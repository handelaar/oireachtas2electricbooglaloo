   <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise matters of national importance, namely, the further delay in publishing the Disability Bill, in breach of the programme for Government; the 2,826 people with intellectual disabilities seeking day care, respite and residential places; the blatant breach of the O&rsquo;Donoghue court judgment of 1997 at Enable Ireland where 15 students with multiple disabilities are being refused a service in the July programme; the fact that people are still on trolleys in hospitals, the urgent need for more bed spaces and the urgent need that the Government immediately put in place adequate resources and comprehensive infrastructure in our health service.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the profligate overspending of this Government in numerous spheres, particularly transport, where the Luas light rail system on two lines has been constructed at a cost of &euro;778 million, compared to the original estimate of &euro;318 million for a three-line system. The Dublin Port Tunnel cost has risen to &euro;715 million as against the original estimated cost of &euro;220 million. Nine road schemes around the country are to cost &euro;1.6 billion, compared to the original budget of &euro;538 million, out of a total roads programme over-spend of &euro;9.8 billion. The possible projected cost for the various sitting tribunals is more than &euro;300 million. By contrast, in the areas of health, education and social welfare there have been stealth taxes, service cuts, gross mismanagement and utter incompetence.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This is like a Second Stage speech.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the decline in salmon numbers returning to spawn in Irish rivers over a 20-year period, and in recognition of the unsustainable numbers now returning to spawn, the need for the Government to no longer issue licences for draught net, drift net or snap nets for use in Irish waters, and that the net men be compensated for any loss of income.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We look forward to hearing the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources respond to that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to ask Deputy Ferris about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the closure over the entire summer of the 15-bed care unit of the elderly ward at Mayo General Hospital for a period extending from 2 July to September 2004; the closure of the day service unit at Mayo General Hospital for two weeks, and to debate how day patients and older people are expected to cope without these essential services over the entire summer period.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter of national importance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise the following specific matter of public interest requiring urgent public attention, namely, the serious implication of the further restriction on eligibility for rent supplement allowance by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the urgent need to provide significant additional funds to local authorities to allow them to meet the extra demand for public housing that will arise from this decision. In view of the importance of this issue I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to consider it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the revelation that the lives of women who are not Irish citizens are being put at risk by virtue of being forced to resort to back-street abortions; the need for an urgent and sympathetic study to establish the extent of the problem of immigrant women with crisis pregnancies, and the particular difficulties of women in this position, regarded by the State as being in the country illegally; the need for <Col N="1927"/>urgent measures, including changes to the law if necessary, to ensure that immigrant women with crisis pregnancies can make a free choice to avail of any of the options open to women generally in the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, in the light of reports concerning back-street abortions on immigrant women that the Government state what steps it intends to take to address the climate of fear brought about by the restrictions on rent supplement and the debate on the citizenship referendum.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs come before the House to detail and debate her latest proposal on the payment of rent supplement.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No.14, Revised Estimates for the Public Services 2004 [Votes 28 and 29], back from committee; No. 14<i>a</i>, motion re Freedom of Information Act 1997; No. 15 , motion re Proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Prescribed Research and Development Activities) Regulations 2004, back from committee; No. 16, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the transmission of natural gas by a second pipeline, back from committee; No. 23, the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill 2004 <i>[Seanad]</i> &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; No. 26, Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; No. 24, International Criminal Court Bill 2003 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 14, 14<i>a</i>, 15 and 16 will be decided without debate, and in the case of No. 14, Votes 28 and 29 shall be moved together and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 September 2004.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 14, 14<i>a</i>, 15 and 16 agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree to this proposal. The Government is trying to take four separate items as one without debate. The first of these is the overseas development aid budget. We have set ourselves a target of &euro;1 billion in this regard <Col N="1928"/>for the year 2007. However, the figure for 2004 is only &euro;400 million. We have not yet reached 40% of the target level for 2007 and the Government is proposing to pass the Revised Estimate without debate.</P>
    <P>The second item is a motion in respect of the Freedom of Information Act. A report has just been issued by the Information Commissioner which criticises the way in which policy is being implemented and which seeks specific changes in the Freedom of Information Act. It is proposed that there will be no debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>The third item involves taxes on research and development. Newspaper reports this morning indicate that the Government has failed to secure approval from the European Commission for proposals it made in respect of the business expansion and the seed capital schemes. We will again pass a motion on tax incentives for business without debate and with no opportunity for Members to discuss the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Each of these items involves significant issues of public concern and they should not be pushed through without debate. To do so is to make a mockery of the importance of the Parliament and of these issues. There are many hundreds of millions of people living on less than $1 per day and we are unwilling to debate the inadequacy of ODA budgets in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice of taking a multiple of items together betrays the Government&rsquo;s real lack of regard in the House. The Green Party may have a difficulty with one of the items and has no problem with the other three but it will be obliged to vote against all of them to make our point. If we are to take each of these items seriously &mdash; I am sure the Government will indicate that it intends to do so &mdash; they should be taken separately. We are opposing the taking of the four items in one grouping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight the grouping of items in this instance. We have no objection to the Revised Estimates for the public service but this item will be grouped with the motions relating to the Freedom of Information Act and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Prescribed Research and Development Activities) Regulations 2004.</P>
    <P>The discussions we held recently on overseas development aid indicated that we will not reach, on current levels of commitment by the Government, the target of 0.7% of gross national product by 2007. However, we would not object to the passage of the Revised Estimate. What is needed is a debate on ODA and we are opposed to taking this matter without debate. How we are going to make up the shortfall in the budget between now and 2007 is beyond me. I do not believe that the Government will make up the difference in the coming three years.</P>
    <P>As regards the Freedom of Information Act, in a submission to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service the Information Com<Col N="1929"/>missioner made it clear that there is not only a charge in respect of accessing freedom of information but that there is also a fee of &euro;150 for those seeking redress through the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s office. That is prohibitive. If people are to go through the full course to secure a final and favourable judgment, they will be obliged to spend in excess of &euro;400. That is absurd and there is no comparable situation in any other democracy as regards freedom of information legislation. We have a strong objection to this item being taken without debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will agree an arrangement relating to significant tax reliefs for research and development with no certainty that there are certification schemes in place which will ensure that widespread tax avoidance does not result from this necessary proposal. In the debates on the budget and the Finance Act, the Minister for Finance promised that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment would put in place a certification scheme to ensure that the scheme relating to research and development would not be the subject of widespread tax avoidance. The D&aacute;il will rise today for the summer recess and no assurance has been provided about this matter by either the T&aacute;naiste or the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner said yesterday that there are 400 freedom of information officers employed by public bodies throughout the country and that she is not sure that they have much work to do because the Freedom of Information Act has been emasculated and usage of it has been decimated.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing, in respect of the Revised Estimate on overseas development aid and in the context of the trumpeting of the success of the Irish Presidency, that the D&aacute;il will rise as Africa, particularly the area of western Sudan, is on the brink of yet another catastrophe which will cost millions of lives. No specific additional provision is made in the Revised Estimate to supply the money Ireland and other European countries need to allocate to address the situation that is unfolding in Darfur in western Sudan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before calling the Minister to reply, I wish to inform the House that the grouping of one or more items of business in one proposal is in order as the proposed arrangements to be followed are the same for all items, namely, that they be taken without debate. The items themselves are voted on separately when put to the House after the Order of Business. It should be borne in mind that a proposal on the Order of Business is a narrow procedural motion, making arrangements for the taking of the business and nothing else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Nos. 14 and 15 are back from committee. Deputies, therefore, had the opportunity to discuss these matters in committee. The House needs to reflect on whether it will have <Col N="1930"/>respect for the work done by committees or whether, as Members seem to be suggesting, everything should be dealt with in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>As regards No. 14<i>a</i>, the relevant committee is being given the opportunity to discuss this matter. There is no prohibition on that happening.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in Third World aid in recent years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is well below its target.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>That increase is phenomenal when compared to anything that happened in the past. We are proud of the work going on across the world on foot of what&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should consider the events that are unfolding in Sudan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the people voted against the Government in the recent elections.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government has provided. Deputies should not make light of that.</P>
    </Speaker><P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposals for dealing with Nos. 14, 14<i>a</i>, 15 and 16 be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
   
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with the Adjournment of the D&aacute;il agreed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be appropriate to reflect on how much has been achieved in the context of the legislative programme. It is revealing to discover that of the 19 Bills that were promised by the Government, only nine have been published and ten remain to be published. Of the nine published, one was published only this morning. If one was interested in monitoring the performance of Ministers, particularly in the context of the fact that the Taoiseach is supposed to be considering a reshuffle, one would find that of the three Bills promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, none has been presented to the D&aacute;il, although one was published this morning. The Bill promised by the Minister for Health and Children was not produced. Of the two Bills promised by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, neither was published.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>People are leaving the land.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Social and Family Affairs failed to produce any of the Bills they promised. I accept that some Ministers are fortunate in that they did not promise to produce any Bills and cannot be accused of failing to deliver. These individuals buried their talents well. The Minister for Defence is one of those who finds himself in this happy situation.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1931"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has not kept himself up to date.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a bad summer report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Joking aside, we must consider the Bills that have not been published. The Disability Bill 2001 was withdrawn in 2002. In May 2003 it was stated that the Bill would be published before the summer recess. In October, the Government was working urgently to prepare the Bill. In December, it was to be published before the end of January. In April, it was the top priority on the Government programme yet it is already July and we have not seen it.</P>
    <P>What is happening in Government? Why are Ministers not able to deliver the promises they make to the House? Why is legislation not being produced, debated and acted upon? Is there a paralysis in Government whereby Ministers just cannot make up their minds on important issues? It is just not good enough that the House should adjourn leaving so much work undone. The tragedy is that many of these Ministers do not need more time. They need a remedial programme to help them deliver some results, make some decisions and present some business to the D&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long six months.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Most people in the House will welcome the fact that the end of term beckons, given the work of the Presidency, the local and European elections and various other matters this year. It beggars belief as far as the public is concerned that the House should not reconvene until 29 September. I think the Government is of the opinion that it is disadvantaging the Opposition and that its manner of treatment of this House is disadvantaging the Opposition. All it is doing is diminishing the stature of the House and diminishing respect for politics. No Government has the track record of this one, not even the same combination of parties in the previous Government, in terms of its disrespect for this House, the number of guillotines and the manner in which long-promised legislation has not emerged.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislation that was never promised emerged and was railroaded through the House in the minimum time possible and frequently on foot of a guillotine. There have been several examples. Yesterday we had some explanation of a Bill being prosecuted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which he was making up on the hoof, withdrawing his own amendments and submitting what he called draft amendments on the floor of the House. That is not unusual.</P>
    <P>Despite the number of matters to be dealt with, it is now proposed that we go into recess until 29 September. I instanced yesterday the statement by the Chief Whip on behalf of the Government on 25 January which said the disability Bill was a <Col N="1932"/>priority for the Government and that it would be published shortly. I read it into the record yesterday. Despite the collapse of that Bill and the dismissal of the Minister that was piloting it through prior to the previous general election, it still has not re-emerged. Out of 19 Bills promised, ten remain unpublished. It is a lamentable performance by the Government. It had first-hand experience not of any opinion poll but of the attitude of the people in real live elections and, despite that, its response is to show disrespect for the House by staying out of it for as long as possible and making announcements outside of the House. The last place one will find an announcement of any significance made by a Minister is in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced outside of the House yesterday that she will terminate the rent supplement for tenants after 18 months. I can see concern on the face of my constituency colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Connor, and I can understand why. He will know all about it in the weeks ahead. No commensurate provision has been made to allow local authorities to put measures in place to accommodate promptly the implications of such a severe measure. There are many such matters. The report of the enterprise strategy group, which was published yesterday, requires debate in this House, yet we are going into recess unnecessarily until the 29 September, to which I am opposed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no denying that many people will appreciate a break but the length of it is the issue. The Cabinet is due to come back in September which means the D&aacute;il should as well. I propose an amendment to the Order Paper that Wednesday, 1 September 2004 should be the date we reconvene. If the Cabinet is to meet from September onwards, not having the D&aacute;il will allow it to duck and weave. It will lack accountability or any full debate in which the House is obliged to engage to reflect the views and interests of the people. In the absence of the D&aacute;il meeting, it is remiss of us to allow the Cabinet to meet. We should take this into account in addition to the urgent needs we have in regard to issues like Sudan and many other world issues.</P>
    <P>The report of the enterprise strategy group requires urgent debate in the House. Many of its terms are similar to the Culliton report, the Telesis report and many other proposals made throughout the years by the Green Party. It is clear the Government has been falling down on its responsibilities. We need to have that debate in the House.</P>
    <P>The prospect of an ESB strike also looms. In that event I would like an assurance from the Government that the D&aacute;il would resume early. We do not want to see an escalation of industrial problems. We do not want to see blackouts in this country. We want to see the Government held to account. An amendment is needed for the D&aacute;il to reconvene on 1 September. On that basis we should also get an assurance from the Govern<Col N="1933"/>ment that it is prepared to come back before that, if necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the proposition to adjourn until 29 September, one should put on record that we will be meeting in committee during the rest of this month and in September. One can pre-empt the Minister&rsquo;s reply. It is important that we do not feed the general notion that we will be doing nothing over the summer. That does not serve any of our interests nor the interests of representative democracy. However, it is the case that the D&aacute;il Chamber will not be in session and the Government will not be held to account over the period, which is a deficiency. There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>The Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, issued a statement on the first day of the current D&aacute;il session on 26 April. She stated in the third paragraph: &ldquo;The pace of legislative reform being maintained by this Government has been remarkable.&rdquo; It certainly has. There is no doubt in the world about that. It has been absolutely remarkable and that has not been lost on anybody.</P>
    <P>The disability Bill is not just a stick with which to beat the Government. We must recognise the reality of those who are at the coalface of the delivery of services, particularly to those in society with disabilities. Deirdre Carroll of the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped in Ireland stated the failure of the Government in bringing forward the disability Bill is unacceptable. She said more than that but I am just paraphrasing it. This is far from a joke; it is serious. Proposed legislation such as the disability Bill and other Bills needs to be expedited and brought forward. No Deputy would refuse the opportunity to come back early to ensure such substantive legislation is properly addressed. We must bring forward legislation that will make a key and critical difference in people&rsquo;s lives. Rights-based legislation is necessary to address the needs of the disability sector.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While the Government may take up the arguments of the Opposition, will the Minister in his reply at least indicate to us whether the Cabinet committee on health will sit in emergency session during the rest of this month for whatever time is necessary to come up with the key and necessary proposals to address the current crisis in the health services? That is one area that needs urgent attention. Perhaps the Minister would indicate in his response to us that the Cabinet committee on health would act responsibly in the coming days.</P>

	<P>Since the Government parties were returned to Office, 90 Bills have been enacted. Members should look at the records over the years and see if that was ever beaten. The Opposition wants to make little of that as well, even though much of its own work went into it as well as ours. We accept that and appreciate it. Ten Bills on the A list have been published and the remainder on the A list will be published this summer. Fourteen Bills have been published altogether even though some Deputies have mentioned only nine or ten. Again they want to make little of the work done for whatever reason and that is their business.</P>

    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the D&aacute;il shall adjourn today until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 September 2004 be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government introduce a Supplementary Estimate arising from the new proposal for housing persons who have been in receipt of rent supplement for more than 18 months? There will be public concern as there are 50,000 families on the housing waiting list and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should confine himself to a question and not what he might like to say if such an Estimate were to come before the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but I think we need to set the context for the urgency with which this ought to be brought forward. If there are no resources, the Government will not be in a position to meet the commitment it is making to this group.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will there be a Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    <P>It seems the enforcement of the no smoking provision has been somewhat wanting in the past number of days. Is the Minister satisfied that the existing legislation is robust in terms of enforcement? Is he of the view the D&aacute;il must reconsider it to ensure the legislation can be enforced speedily and effectively?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>: The Government is satisfied that the legislation is sufficiently robust to ensure <Col N="1938"/>that everything that is necessary for compliance can be enforced. It does appear that there has been some delay in that enforcement procedure in a particular case. However, I understand that time has been given, which if not complied with, will lead to a further injunction being sought.</P>
    <P>As regards the first question, no Supplementary Estimates are envisaged in that context. Over &euro;300 million is now being expended on rent supplements. It is wise to look at that in terms of more permanent housing arrangements and the numbers of people who qualify on the housing lists. Many people will be anxious to see these moneys diverted, where possible, into permanent housing for people who are in need.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>How it will happen is crucial.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There cannot be a debate on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The D&aacute;il needs to have an opportunity to scrutinise how this is going to happen otherwise more people will be piled onto a system that is unable to cope as it is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. I would ask the Minister to refrain from going beyond the Order of Business. Otherwise this will lead to a long debate in the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister for Defence well and hope he will be back in that seat taking the Order of Business in the autumn. I hope he will be untroubled by any telephone calls during the summer. Having wished him well, will he explain how, if there is to be no Supplementary Estimate, it is proposed to deal with this issue, given that there are almost 60,000 on the public <Col N="1939"/>housing queue, many in private rented accommodation?</P>
    <P>I am touched by, appreciate and share Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s concern for the money we are giving private landlords. How is it proposed to terminate the rent allowance after 18 months if there is not a Supplementary Estimate? What is the point in the &euro;300 million being put into public housing? That would build less than 3,000 houses. If the entire sum is spent it would mean a good deal less than 3,000. One could not build a local authority house for &euro;100,000.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How is it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should raise the matter in the House in some other way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>When can he do that? Tomorrow?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>When can he raise it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to the Order of Business. There are ample opportunities, for example, on this evening&rsquo;s Adjournment debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an excellent suggestion. If I can comply with the time I will table it for the Adjournment because many Deputies on both sides of this House will be meeting distressed people over the summer months who will want to know what will happen when their rent supplements are terminated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that Members of the House will join me in expressing sympathy to the people of Austria on the recent death of their Head of State, President Thomas Klestil, at Vienna general hospital. It is important that a Head of State in the European Union who has been a voice for peace and reconciliation in his own country and beyond should be remembered. The Austrians, who showed this country an example in trying to end the EURATOM Treaty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question must be appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;should be borne in mind, as well. It is important that I should express sympathy, on that basis, from the Green Party to the Austrian Green Party and the Austrian people.</P>
    <P>It is important to keep in mind the enterprise strategy group report and the legislation that might arise from it. We will not have a chance for a debate unless the Government does a <?oasys _jy?><Col N="1940"/>turnaround. I would like to know whether there are to be written parliamentary questions at any point during the summer break so that Members can at least ensure some level of accountability and questioning. Just like the matter I raised earlier, as to whether the D&aacute;il will reassemble if there is an ESB strike, this too is important.</P>
    <P>One of the strategy group&rsquo;s recommendations concerned the education of the workforce.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question on legislation?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Grangegorman Development Agency Bill has been raised again and again in the House. Will this Bill be given priority in light of that report and the need for further attention to be given to training?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, that Bill has been published and is being given priority for the autumn session.</P>

	<P>When the Aer Lingus Act was taken in this House, a commitment was given by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to bring forward secondary legislation which would require the approval of the D&aacute;il to allow for any partial or full sale of the national airline. In light of the proposal now on the Minister&rsquo;s desk, when will we see a White Paper on the sale of Aer Lingus and when will the secondary legislation be published?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Aer Lingus Bill has now been enacted. Any change in the status of Aer Lingus will obviously require legislation that will come before this House.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the Bill have been approved by the Government. It is just not possible to say, at this stage, when they will be introduced.</P>

	<P>The nation is shocked that the spectre of back-street abortions has reappeared, inevitably, with women in the twilight zone of the Government&rsquo;s immigration laws. Will the Minister say if the Government will look urgently at this terrible human tragedy and need that has emerged, and legislate or resolve it in the interests of those in our society who are extremely vulnerable?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has indicated in the House on a number of occasions that no legislation is planned in this area. That remains the position.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the publication of the enterprise strategy report by the Government yesterday, which says nothing more than we already knew, will the Minister say if one of the recommendations will require amending legislation to change the status of the development agencies and to amalgamate the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and a number of other agencies? Will the Government be introducing a Bill to put that into effect?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>On a related matter, I asked two brief questions yesterday on the Order of Business as regards the briefing required on the publication of this important strategy. I  heard nothing further since I raised it yesterday, although I was promised that such a briefing would be provided. I got the normal documentation every other Member of the House received.</P>
    <P>As regards the document itself, one of its implications is the analysis that we require a significant input of foreign skilled labour to maintain our economy. Where exactly is the work permits Bill that has been promised for over a year and a half and why has it not yet been published, debated and enacted in this House?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am told it will be published next September. As regards the report, obviously it is significant and one which will be duly considered by the Government. Whatever legislative action is required will be taken in that context.</P>

	<P>We would not want to create a dangerous precedent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the amendment is to limit the funds we are lending to the ESB to &euro;4 billion, rather than &euro;6 billion. There are a number of arguments in favour of such a change. During our consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage and the joint committee&rsquo;s examination of the electricity and energy sectors, it became clear that &euro;4 billion will give the company a sufficient capital base to allow it to engage in all the activities it might want to engage in up to 2008. The acceptance of the amendment will not restrict the company in any way in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to my main point. The allocation to the ESB of a larger capital lending facility is not a good corporate strategy at a time when the Government does not have a clear idea of how it sees the company developing. It is not a purely academic exercise. The managing director of ESB National Grid, Mr. Kieran O&rsquo;Brien, made a presentation at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. He argued that we are facing a difficult and unwelcome situation in the electricity generation market. He used the term &ldquo;inefficient oligopoly&rdquo; to describe the dominant position in the market of the ESB, which sets the price 99.9% of the time. If we achieve a reduction to 60% of the company&rsquo;s share of the electricity generation market, which will be difficult, the ESB will still be in a dominant position. Mr. O&rsquo;Brien argued that the ESB&rsquo;s position is characterised by a series of inefficiencies and that the Irish consumer loses out as a consequence of high prices.</P>
    <P>It will not be acceptable if the strategy for the development of the ESB helps to maintain the <Col N="1946"/><i>status quo</i>. It would be inappropriate for us to give the ESB a larger lending facility that goes beyond its obvious investment needs in terms of the maintenance of the grid. Nobody would object to providing for such investment. If our provision is too great, however, we may allow for the strategic development of the company in a direction that the Minister might not require. When Mr. Padraig McManus of the ESB recently addressed a meeting of the joint committee, he set out a strategy for the company under which it maintains a dominant position in the Irish market. We know from Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s evidence that such continued dominance would have serious consequences for the market.</P>
    <P>Mr. McManus told the joint committee that the ESB hopes to invest approximately &euro;150 billion overseas each year. Perhaps the Minister agrees with the strategy and the Government is satisfied with it. The joint committee was recently told that there is a risk that we will not have sufficient power in the winter of 2006. It may be that the Minister is willing to accept that higher prices may result from such a strategy. I do not believe that the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> is appropriate. It is not right that the House should offer the proposed lending facilities in the absence of a clear Government strategy for the ESB. I do not believe any board of directors in the private sector would operate on such a basis. Similarly, as shareholders in this important company, we should not do so.</P>
    <P>We have various choices. The ideal solution may be to return to the centralised arrangements which worked well for so many years, which may be appropriate given the small size of our market. That seems to be out of the question because of European legislation, unfortunately. Like Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, the Commissioner for Energy Regulation, Mr. Tom Reeves, seemed to indicate when he made a presentation to the joint committee that a possible way forward would be to put in place some sort of process whereby the ESB generating stations would act as independent operations.</P>
    <P>I offer that as a possibility to the Minister. Has he given any thought to the way such a development might work? Perhaps he is considering other alternatives and, if so, I would be interested to hear those.</P>
    <P>It is inappropriate for this House to allocate a &euro;6 billion lending facility &mdash; not a small amount of money &mdash; when we do not have a clear strategy from the Minister on how he sees the company developing. In Mr. McManus&rsquo;s presentation to the committee he made the point that both the ESB and the Department were currently in talks on an evaluation of the strategy set out by the company. Given that, a &euro;4 billion lending facility is far preferable to the &euro;6 billion and it would make the point to the company and to the public that we are in an interim phase and not just staying with the current <i>status quo</i>, which Mr. O&rsquo;Brien described as an inefficient oligopoly.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1947"/>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is fundamental to the whole Bill. The Bill proposes to increase the borrowing from &euro;1.6 billion to &euro;6 billion. It is 22 years since the last change took place. The question in regard to this amendment is whether what Deputy Ryan says is true, that the &euro;4 billion he proposes is sufficient to meet the needs of the ESB for the foreseeable future, and whether there is a particular reason for the &euro;6 billion figure.</P>
    <P>The points raised on Second Stage should also be borne in mind because we do not know the Government&rsquo;s future intentions regarding the ESB other than it would appear that through the actions of the regulator, ESB costs and prices are being slowly engineered upwards to make it more attractive to other investors to become involved in the area of energy generation and supply. As a result, it would appear to many consumers that far from making matters better for the consumer, be they domestic or industrial, they will face a worse situation than they did heretofore.</P>
    <P>We also have to consider this in the context of the future power requirements of the ESB and the extent to which it will be possible to avoid blackouts. Incidentally, on a number of occasions I tabled parliamentary questions on that subject only to find they were refused. Nobody wants to answer them any more. If there is one permanent change I would like to see implemented relative to the business of this House it is the reluctance on the part of all Ministers, whichever party is in government, to accept responsibility for areas over which they directly or indirectly have control. We should be able to get those answers on a more regular basis than is currently the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell the House why the &euro;6 billion lend facility is necessary as opposed to the &euro;4 billion proposed in the amendment and the net benefits to the consumer, be they industrial or domestic, between one and the other. Is there much of a difference between the two? Would it have been sufficient, for instance, to have an increased borrowing limit of &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion? On what basis was the &euro;6 billion figure arrived at? If we knew that we might have some indication as to what the Government proposes to do regarding the ESB and the generation of energy over the long term.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we talked about alternative sources of energy, the fact that such sources were expensive and that to produce energy in this way and tap into those alternative sources was to perhaps create a situation whereby electricity prices were slowly increased to make it more attractive. Will the Minister clarify those points in his reply with a view to identifying the reason we should proceed with the Government&rsquo;s proposals?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the amendment or the arguments made in favour of it, nor do I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s basic proposal. The ESB does not determine the price of electricity, nor does the Minister; that is determined by the regulator, Mr. Tom Reeves. I know the regulator very <Col N="1948"/>well because I worked directly with him when he was in the Department. He is a man who is passionately in favour of competition and in the interest of competition he has made some extraordinary decisions without achieving a result. One of his extraordinary decisions was to increase the price of the product to make it attractive to others to enter into the market. The consumer is now paying more for electricity than is required by economic forces and in spite of that, we did not get the competition because it was not sufficiently attractive. We attracted minor competition. That is not the issue and the argument that the ESB, because it is a monopoly, can determine the price of electricity is no longer true.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the possibility of competition, the ESB shed over 2,000 jobs and in spite of the loss of those jobs and an increase in the price of electricity, there is no gain for the consumer in this situation. The argument about what would happen to the ESB if it had a higher borrowing possibility simply does not stand up. We have other examples of alleged competition in the telecommunications area and in the housing market, and it is not producing a very good result for the consumer. I do not want to stray from the Bill, which is a straightforward measure, other than to say that I do not agree with the amendment.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is obvious they could not agree on a fundamental issue, namely, the future of the ESB, in that we have heard divergent views from Deputies Eamon Ryan and Stagg.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should welcome a bit of support.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have considered the content and the portent of Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s amendment but I cannot accept it and I will outline my reasons in that respect.</P>
    <P>The borrowing limit, as previous speakers have said, was set 22 years ago at an equivalent figure of &euro;2 billion. We propose to increase it to &euro;6 billion to take into account the dramatic ESB current and forecast financial position.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s point that there has been no gain for the Irish consumer. For <Col N="1949"/>years, Governments of every hue and cry prevented, for political reasons, increases in electricity prices. That was very popular but the reality is that over those decades there was no investment in the infrastructure and, ultimately, the people would be at a significant loss if that was the case. To be fair to Deputy Stagg, he acknowledges that neither the Minister nor the ESB has power in regard to pricing. We passed legislation which gave that power to an independent regulator who is obliged, under law, to give a rate of return to companies investing in this infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about Government stealth taxes but the reality is that this was established by the Oireachtas to allow a fair return for investment in telecommunications or in the energy area. By 2007, the ESB expects that its peak net debt levels will be approximately &euro;4 billion. This is a one-section Bill, taken from the more substantial Electricity Bill to be introduced later in the year. The reason for it is that this is a period in the Oireachtas in which parliamentary time for legislation is much sought after and time is of the essence regarding the ESB&rsquo;s current financial position.</P>
    <P>Consumers will be the main beneficiaries of investment in the supply infrastructure. Ireland will not have the same problems of significant black-outs as experienced recently in Italy, the US and the UK. The ESB is investing &euro;5 billion in the supply grid over five years, from 2002 to 2007. Ultimately, the consumer will pay for such investment but will gain the benefit of an electricity infrastructure which will ensure no black-outs and sustain current economic growth. Even though it is accepted that the ESB will be at its peak of net debt levels of &euro;4 billion by 2007, the Government believes it is prudent that extra facilities be given to it. The additional &euro;2 billion will be divided into &euro;1 billion to ensure liquidity and &euro;1 billion for headroom factors. The proposed limit of &euro;6 billion is considered sufficient to cover the ESB for at least ten years, which is the financial forecasting horizon period for the company. Inclusion of the &euro;2 billion on top of the anticipated borrowing level of &euro;4 billion is considered reasonable and prudent. Though the ESB&rsquo;s net debt stands at &euro;1.9 billion, it is rising rapidly and will soon probably go over the existing limit of &euro;2 billion if this legislation is not passed. While the company employs tight management of its cash outflows, the remaining cash balance is nearing exhaustion.</P>
    <P>The fundamentals of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy are set out in my Department&rsquo;s strategy statement. This is further informed by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, other related Government policy papers and relevant EU developments. It is important to understand the dynamic nature of the energy sector. My Department is involved in ongoing work in developing, updating and refining the detailed elements of its policy regarding the wide-ranging issues that impact on the energy sector.</P><Col N="1950"/>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, explained that the ESB strategic plan takes full account of Government energy policy. The company is revising its five-year corporate plan with my Department to ensure it is in line with Government policy. There is a consultation process in the renewable energy area which will inform the Government when introducing a new policy for that sector. It will be submitted to the Government for approval later this year. I am working alongside my Northern Ireland counterpart, Mr. Barry Gardiner, MP, on the development framework for an all-Ireland energy market. The future of Moneypoint generating station also needs to be speedily resolved.</P>
    <P>The ESB has a five-year corporate plan covering 2003 to 2007. The ESB has stated that it is committed to reducing its generation market share to 60% by 2005 to resolve the issue of its market dominance. The privatisation of the ESB is not on the Government agenda. I am opposed to the privatisation of the networks. I have already said that in the event of any future change in the structure of the ESB, selling of the wire would not be on the agenda. The Government believes the ESB is a critical national asset and must remain in State ownership. One thing worse than a public monopoly is a private one. The Government&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the ESB&rsquo;s company structure remains as it is.</P>
    <P>While the finances of the company are its own matter, it is required to get annual approval from me as the Minister responsible for its annual capital expenditure budget. Any of the capital expenditure associated with projects abroad, such as in Bilbao in northern Spain and Coolkeeragh in Northern Ireland, require my prior consent and that of the Minister for Finance. The introduction of a borrowing limit of &euro;6 billion for the ESB is prudent and reasonable, particularly when the last time it was amended by the Oireachtas was 22 years ago. Introducing a borrowing limit sufficient for an anticipated ten years is the correct course of action. I cannot accept Deputy Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was informed that borrowing would rise to &euro;4 billion by 2008 and not 2007 by the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, on Committee Stage. This figure was also given to me by Mr. McManus of the ESB, who also stated that there was plenty of fat in that figure. The &euro;4 billion proposed in my amendment allows the company plenty of room.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that electricity prices have not risen in a long time. He implied that the recent 23% increase was a catch-up exercise. To a certain extent that is correct, but now prices for industrial and domestic consumers are significantly above the European average. Deputy Stagg is correct in stating that the regulator gives sanctions to price increases. However, according <Col N="1951"/>to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien of EirGrid, the ESB sets the market price by continuing to control the mid-merit stations. These are stations that cannot easily be turned on and off. The company that controls those stations sets the market price.</P>
    <P>Another reason behind the price increases is that Ireland has been unsuccessful in attracting new entrants to the market. To overcome this, electricity prices have been significantly increased, yet the price is set by the ESB, according to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien of EirGrid.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Minister said that the investment in the grid is necessary to ensure we will not have blackouts such as occurred in America and Italy. I agree. We need to invest that money in the grid, but I criticise the manner in which it is being invested. The Minister needs to provide a policy direction that we should invest in that grid network on a future production basis, looking towards the new renewable energies which will come on stream in the next ten to 15 years, rather than on a demand-led basis, which is how the substantial sum of money of &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million is being spent annually. We are not spending it cleverly. If we are to have the interconnector, we need to start giving directions that the grid must be built up on land to join with the connector. We need to start ensuring the investment is not made solely on a demand-led basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly said that the investment in the grid will ensure we do not suffer blackouts. However, according to the ESB network company, the likelihood of blackouts in the winter of 2006 is now becoming significant partly because of our inability to attract new entrants to the market.</P>

The regulator said that the new power plant in Tynagh Mines may not be on stream as expected in 2005 and the Kish Bank offshore wind farm in which the ESB is a partner is unlikely to be brought on line within the timescale planned. Since we are failing to deliver new capacity, how can the Mini<Col N="1952"/>ster assure us we will not have blackouts next winter or the following winter?</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has pointed to the wisdom of the Department&rsquo;s proposal and I note that. However, given the changes that are taking place and the increased requirements in terms of investment and energy over the next ten years, the period for which the Minister said the &euro;6 billion would suffice, we should perhaps consider the reverse of the amendment, so to speak. The investment of &euro;6 billion is possibly not enough and if so, this is the time to act.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that there will be a significant increase in investment and restructuring within the ESB to avert possible power shortages. The more industrial development that takes place, the greater the electricity requirement and, as a result, the greater the investment requirement for the electricity or energy supplier. The Minister might elucidate matters. We are aware of the alternative sources of energy and when they might kick in but, as other speakers have noted, they will kick in only at a level that makes it economically viable for them. That may well have the knock-on impact of making life more difficult for industry in general and for the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>It would be wise at this stage for the Minister to summarise for us the implications as he sees them and as the ESB sees them. We must examine the situation not as it has developed up to now but as it is likely to be from here on in, with hugely increased energy demands. It may not be possible in the short term to provide that extra energy by way of alternative energy sources.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Durkan suggested that we should perhaps increase the investment. I repeat that I am quite sure that the &euro;6 billion will be sufficient for the ESB grid investment requirements over the next ten years. The current dispatchable capacity is 5,549 MW. The peak expected demand last winter was 4,480 MW. Due to higher than expected temperatures during the winter period, the peak was lower than expected, at 4,320 MW. From that point of view we had reasonable headroom.  With the implementation by the ESB national grid of what it calls the demand side management programme, and it was able to secure a reduction of approximately 120 MW, increased imports of 167 MW of electricity from Northern Ireland, which is contracted until June 2005 with a possible extension to autumn 2006. The ESB purchased an additional peaking plant which may not have been necessary. Measures have been taken and will be taken. There are two new additional generation stations at Tynagh and Aughinish bringing in an extra 550 MW which we expect to come on stream in 2007. It is also possible that there will be additional generating capacity coming on stream.</P>
    <P>In an island nation on the edge of Europe it is difficult to get competition into an energy market where huge investment is required in generation <Col N="1953"/>plant and infrastructure and there is a relatively small population. That is one of the reasons the Government took a strategic decision to proceed as quickly as possible, as a priority, with a double interconnector of 500 MW each, which we expect will be in operation in the not too distant future. That will ensure not only security of supply but more competition, which will ultimately reduce prices.</P>
    <P>The figures given by Deputy Eamon Ryan regarding the cost of electricity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the rest of Europe with regard to residential users are at the EU average, or close to it. The costs for large industrial operators are higher than the EU average, but that is the only significant area of demand where there is a completely open market. Such operators are not obliged to deal with the ESB and may deal with competitors.</P>
    <P>Regarding the amendment, it is prudent and reasonable to put in a facility of &euro;6 billion to cover the next ten years, particularly given the difficulty of returning to the Oireachtas to seek additional time in which to get legislation passed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that while it is an open market, the electricity price is set at a certain level by those mid-merit stations, so that no matter how open the market is, the price will be set by the ESB in terms of what it cost it to turn on its most inefficient plant? While the Minister&rsquo;s figures are no doubt correct, is he concerned that the grid operator, who would have as close an eye on this matter as anyone, is raising serious concerns? While the figures may look good on paper, when one has 75% or 76% availability coming from that generation capacity, the figures look rather different in reality.</P>
    <P>How does this address the concerns of the grid operator that we will not have enough power?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline why he thinks it is difficult to introduce competition? Is this because outside investors look at a market where there is a dominant player which effectively sets the price and decide that it is not a business environment they want to enter? Does the Minister accept the point made by Mr. McManus, the head of the ESB generation company, that even if it is down to 60% power generation capacity, it would still have a dominant position?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister should be brief. He is not entitled to further contributions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider closely the promises that this alternative arrangement is postulating in the energy area. I suspect this will be one of the key fault lines between the Green Party view which is, in effect, to break up ESB, and the Labour Party view which is to retain it as it is. <Col N="1954"/>This will be an interesting debate in the years leading up to the next general election.</P>
    <P>As far as Deputy Ryan is concerned, the Green Party position is that the <i>status quo</i> cannot remain. I am not sure what the Fine Gael view is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not too sure of the Minister&rsquo;s views either. He told the public many things before the last general election but unfortunately was silent afterwards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an interesting debate. The Opposition is telling the public it will run as an alternative. However, here is a major issue on which the Opposition cannot agree before the alternative even gets off the ground.</P>
    <P>The operators of the grid have rightly expressed concerns in this regard and we must take those into account. The biggest concern is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister to be brief. This is not Committee Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy on the other side got plenty of time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>He moved the amendment and is entitled to reply. He replied and we should now put the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief. The Deputy instanced the concern of the operator of the national grid. The biggest concern of the operator is in regard to a significant amount of wind energy coming onto the grid and the technical instability associated with this. This is one of the reasons we had to hasten slowly in regard to new contracts, on the advice of the same person.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They have 20 years of that technology behind them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I raise a point of order?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may, because we are in total disorder at present.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy always wants to come back in.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, the Minister was not available on Second or Committee Stages to discuss these points. This is a single amendment to a very important Bill and I would like to make a concluding remark, if I may.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It was open to the Deputy before commencement to move a recommittal. That would have solved the problem but it was not done. The Deputy should be brief.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is correct that there may be differences on this side of the House. It will take an amount of political courage because it is a very sensitive and important issue <Col N="1955"/>for four parties to come out and state that the <i>status quo</i> is not working and needs to be changed, which I am happy to do. The point of the amendment is to discover what the Minister thinks. My criticism has always been that the Minister has not clearly stated his position. I regret that at this stage of the debate we have heard the same arguments presented on Committee Stage by the Minister of State with some political mud slinging tacked on.</P>
    <P>There is a serious issue which we cannot ignore and must address. If we wait until my party is in Government in three years&rsquo; time, the damage will be done. The decision cannot be put off until that time. If we are not able to debate the matter in the House, given that the Minister will be attending the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for a final summing up on our energy module, we will have to debate it there. However, we will have to debate it somewhere because politicians have an obligation not just to score cheap political points and trade in soundbites but to seriously address this important issue for the development of our country and to take tough decisions. I do not get any sense from the debate that the Minister is willing or able to engage in that debate or, it would seem, make decisions on the matter, which I regret.</P>
    <P>I will press the amendment. In a situation where the future development of the market is so uncertain and the progress of the company may change radically, it is not appropriate to send a signal that the <i>status quo</i> is working or to allow the company this top-up of &euro;2 billion above what the company states it needs. This is bad planning and bad direction. While the debate on policy will have to happen somewhere else, I propose the amendment to restrict the lending facility to &euro;4 billion. This is prudent and correct and I hope the Minister, at this late stage, could accept it as a signal that he will have to do something on this issue. We cannot just paddle on as if everything is going swimmingly, because it is not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate has been very illustrative of the serious fault line now evident between the Green Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is significant that the public should know the Opposition parties&rsquo; attitudes in this respect.</P>

	<P>Deputy Eamon Ryan states that I have not articulated the view of Government. I have said clearly in regard to the network&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1956"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair wants to intervene at this stage because the procedure is totally out of order. I suggest that the Bill be recommitted in respect of amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker><P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 1.</P>
   
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it clear that the networks are a national asset and must remain. The issue of ESB dominance is being tackled by the Commission for Energy Regulation under the legislation passed by the House. However, I accept that there is a need to rigorously assess this issue in the near future. The figure of &euro;6 billion is more than adequate. While Deputy Durkan suggests we should go even further, we should stick with that figure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I did not realise a recommittal allowed for continued debate or I would have facilitated you earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in that the energy regulator sought the introduction of some sort of competition in the market by asking ESB generating stations to act independently. It would seem that the potential for this option is being rapidly diminished by the recent abandonment of the local nodal pricing mechanism that the CER had proposed. Such circumstances lend further urgency to the matter.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the options I would consider. One that would not be allowed due to European regulations would be to re-centralise everything, buy back outside independent capacity and put it into one central company, which was the position for many years. This might be the best policy but now seems impossible and must be ruled out. A further option for consideration would be to split the generating companies into three or four groups, and possibly sell them and allow them to compete against each other on the open market.</P>
    <P>The other option which deserves consideration, and I will probably make further proposals on this, is some type of flexible mechanism to make the management and operation of the stations genuinely independent. It could be through awarding a contract to individual workers and management in those stations to operate independently, sell their output independently and make a profit from it. That might have a role in solving some of the industrial relations difficulties we are facing at present, where the unions are demanding a 20% share of the overall company.</P>
    <P>It is a method whereby the stations could operate independently while the asset could be maintained in State ownership. Some of the generating stations are actually an extension of the network. In Moneypoint, for example, we have built two massive 400 kV lines connecting it and the location of the station means it is, in essence, almost a State asset. It could be kept in State ownership but the operation could be private. It <Col N="1957"/>is similar, in a way, to what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is suggesting in the bus market. I am not sure if it would work there but it might work in the electricity market. It is clever, flexible solutions such as this which the Minister should discuss. It might not be the right option and the analysis might show it would not work but it is preferable to the <i>status quo</i>. Perhaps the Minister is considering such options.</P>
    <P>The Minister might not be aware that there has been a sea change in recent months with regard to the technical difficulties for wind power on the grid network. The technical changes the grid operator is now seeing in turbines and their ability to ride through any fault in the grid and to assist the grid operator in frequency and voltage stability are such that the arguments about wind power being a problem in the grid are yesterday&rsquo;s arguments. I believe there will be a massive development of wind energy, which will be one of the possible solutions for the future.</P>
    <P>However, the market support mechanisms in place, the AER VI system, will be seen to fail because people will have bid too low to win the contract. The lack of proper support mechanisms from the Minister is what will delay the arrival of wind power to save the day. The AER structure will not be enough to get us through the crisis we will face in 2006. The Minister might see this as division on this side of the House but what we should be about is proper political discourse and putting forward suggestions. They need not be on an ideological or rigid basis but we should certainly ask the relevant questions. It is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to make certain decisions in this area. If he is happy with the way things are, he can decide to do nothing. However, what we are hearing from the industry, the grid operator and from the regulator is that this half way house, where we have half liberated the market but left it dominated by one player, will not benefit the public or the operators in the market in the long run.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to renewable energy, I agree that there has been a sea change. That is the result of proper contact and discourse between all the interested parties, including the grid operators, so that everybody understands where we are going in this respect. I agree that as a result of technical and technological changes in the delivery of wind power, there are greater possibilities. That is one of the reasons I knocked heads together in the case of all the operators and it is the reason we have a renewable energy group that is currently looking at the way forward in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Deputy about AER VI. It has been very successful. To a certain extent we have been the victim of our own success in that respect. The Deputy says there are no proper supports. That is saying, in effect, the Government should allow higher prices for renewable energy. I accept the Deputy has an argument about what is included in the cost per unit of <Col N="1958"/>renewable energy but everybody accepts, even in Denmark where there is a plethora of wind energy, that electricity from renewable sources is more expensive than from fossil fuels. It is important to tell people this because they tend to have an old-fashioned or aspirational view that everything should be renewable. Everybody would like to use renewable sources as much as possible but we also must be aware of the consequences not only from a price point of view but from the point of view of stability on the grid. That is what the group is working on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s musings on the future structure of the ESB and his comment that we should not get hooked on ideology, he need not direct his comment to this side of the House but to his Labour Party colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party&rsquo;s future bride.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should say it to some of his backbenchers as well.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The pertinent question is how the Green Party and the Labour Party will be able to commit themselves to any future in this area if they are postulating themselves to the public as an alternative to this Government.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear, and perhaps no other Minister has been as clear in this regard in recent years, that as far as this Government is concerned privatisation is not on the agenda. We regard the ESB as a national asset. In the event of any change in the structure of the ESB, we will not countenance selling the network of the wires and the pipes. They should stay in State ownership so they will be available for all operators. That will allow proper competition to continue.</P>
    <P>All parties, including the ESB, would accept that the dominance of the ESB in this market has to be examined. It is currently being tackled by the CER under the current legislation. One of the reasons I am changing the legislation is to give the Minister the ability to give policy directions with regard to this and other issues so there will be a political tie between the independent regulator and the representatives of the people in the Oireachtas. That exists in the telecommunications area and it has worked successfully. From that point of view, there is work to be done. There must be a rigorous assessment of the options for the future in this respect and these issues will be examined in the not too distant future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply moved and touched by the Minister&rsquo;s concern about the ideological musings on this side of the House. However, he does not express any concern about the ideological musings on his side of the House, some of which are fundamental and could have a huge bearing on the future of not only the ESB but other State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>There is a general concern among the public as to what might happen to the ESB and a number of other agencies, having regard to what hap<Col N="1959"/>pened to Eircom or Telecom &Eacute;ireann, as it was known at the time. A national asset was sold to the people for a huge amount of money and then was subject to another flotation at a later stage. That experience will not have gone amiss so people are ready to expect anything on this occasion. It is important that the Minister repeatedly reassure the House about the likely future of the ESB, notwithstanding the need to comply with EU regulations on competition.</P>
    <P>One issue that can always be mentioned is the unfortunate experience I have just referred to whereby, in an effort to achieve the type of competition that was desirable under EU law, a massive overkill was achieved. Everybody was accommodated except the unfortunate consumers who bought a national asset that they already owned. They paid a huge price for it but a short time later they received not a cheque in the post but a note pointing out that they could only get 60% or 45% or whatever percentage applied of the sum they paid for that asset. The people have a long memory. It might be longer than the Minister would like, as he will find out in due course and as he discovered in the most recent election. The Minister may cease his musings on the ideological differences on this side and concentrate on the difficulties that exist on that side of the House. Perhaps the Minister has heard that from his backbenchers in the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about wind energy. I am in favour of alternative sources of energy. The sight of wind farms is appalling, but we cannot put propellers underground. They must be placed over ground and they are not the most edifying sight on the horizon. The issue of tidal wave power arose during the debate on Second Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should concentrate on the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concentrating on the amendment, which applies to the entire Bill. Will the Minister reconsider the notion that wave technology is not sufficiently advanced? I cannot believe that. Hydrology is as old as the hills &mdash; it existed at the time of the Romans. If we had the Shannon scheme many years ago, I cannot understand why we cannot develop wave energy to any extent now. For as long as I have been a Member of this House we have been told again and again that the technology is not yet far enough advanced. It is similar to the answer we received in this House many years ago on the question of air conditioning. I will not revisit that issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is in favour of retaining the ESB as a State entity while at the same time enforcing the changes recommended by the regulator. Although the Minister might not like to admit it, he has influence over the regulator, the appointment of the regulator, the terms of appointment of the regulator and so on. If the regulator impacts sufficiently on the ESB to the extent that costs to consumers are increased <Col N="1960"/>across the board to attract further investors into the marketplace to break the monopoly, that could have a negative impact on Irish industry right across the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s dismissal of the &euro;4 billion or &euro;6 billion proposed by my colleague as not being enough creates the basis for a very wide-ranging debate. The Minister will have to examine the whole structure of the provision of electricity within the country, the number of companies and alternative companies that will have the option of providing for the industrial sector as well as for the domestic sector. There is ample evidence in the United States, the UK and Canada that one trigger in the context of overload can have major and far-reaching effects. Such an event would involve colossal expense for industries here that are greatly dependent on electricity.</P>
    <P>I reject the Minister&rsquo;s political gymnastics. I congratulate him on the colourful nature of it and the fact that he seized every opportunity to deflect attention from what should be the focus of our attention and energy. I reassure him that when the time comes for the people to make that grand decision, they will have ample opportunity to balance the rights and wrongs of what they are about to do. I have no doubt what their decision will be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither have I.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s points. It is interesting to hear his political slagging. I thought the Minister and certain Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers were urgently attempting at present to go to the left of the various other parties on the left. It is interesting that he is flicking back to the right again for a brief period to have a go at the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the main point of this amendment. The ESB recently made a presentation to a committee of this House. It effectively set out its strategy as being to maintain a dominant position in the Irish market and to enter into the European market. That seems correct as the current structures in Europe are leading to a larger, wider market. It will continue to invest approximately &euro;150 million a year in projects such as the 750 mw plant it built in Bilbao. If we had another 750 mw plant here our problems would be over and I would not be moving this amendment.</P>
    <P>That strategy is akin to the strategy Cement Roadstone Holdings or AIB have very successfully followed in the past 20 years. It enabled these companies to make very significant profits as a result of maintaining a dominant position in the domestic market, reinvest those profits overseas in acquisitions and build themselves up as global players. It could be argued that that strategy is the correct one. The difficulty of such a strategy, as we have seen in the area of bank charges and in the price of cement, is that domestic consumers would pay a very high price for electricity.</P><Col N="1961"/>
    <P>Is the Minister pleased with that strategy? Does he believe it is an appropriate strategy to maintain a dominant position here and expand overseas? If he does, my amendment is incorrect because that strategy would be appropriate. Investing a significant amount of money &mdash; the additional &euro;2 billion provided for in this Bill &mdash; would allow it to be a player in the European market. The Government&rsquo;s decision regarding the proposed investment in Poland indicates either that the Government does not believe that is the correct strategy or that the Polish bid was too large for the company to take on. If that is the Government&rsquo;s position, the &euro;4 billion spending limit I suggest would more accurately reflect what it is trying to do. I need an answer to that question before I as a Deputy on this side of the House allow a company, of which we as representatives of the people are shareholders, to have significant borrowing above its immediate requirements on the basis of that policy. That is the real question to which I have not yet received an answer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps today is not the time to answer it. We need to carry out a rigorous assessment of the dominant position of the ESB. I have not met anyone in this country who suggests that we should sell a single ESB line. To keep parroting that line is a distraction because no one is talking about privatising the ESB. It would make no sense whatsoever. It would be repeating the mistake we made with Eircom. That is out of the question. Let us not spend our time discussing it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should say that three or four times. The Minister might not hear it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully accept the Minister&rsquo;s credentials and conviction in that regard. I do not believe anyone is advocating such a position. Not even the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues in the Progressive Democrats would argue for such a position. Let us not, therefore, talk about that, but I would like to hear from the Minister whether the strategy set out recently to the committee and, I am sure, the Department, is the appropriate one. Perhaps it is. However, it would be at a price to the Irish customer. Does the Minister believe Irish customers are willing to accept that? Perhaps an alternative is possible where we would handle the dominant position here and still allow ESB International to act as a player on the international market. Given that it is a publicly owned company, I would like to see our best engineers playing on that market, winning contracts and bringing profits back to the State. I would be happy enough with that, but not if it is done on the back of Irish customers. The fundamental intent of my amendment is to thrash out what we are talking about here and what we want to do, and I still have not got an answer to that question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent CER decision on marketing arrangements was made in the context of further investigating what are the most appro<Col N="1962"/>priate arrangements for the Irish market. He did that as a result of significant contact between regulators and industry interests, North and South, as well as between Mr. Gardiner and myself, and because significant issues were raised not only by the ESB but more particularly by other operators in the Irish market who felt it should be given more consideration. I welcomed his decision to take into account the significant issues coming to the fore in that respect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>So did I.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the key issues the regulator must bear in mind is the cost to consumers of any decision that he makes regarding pricing. We could hammer this issue out all day regarding the limit on the ESB and what it requires, as well as the question of investing abroad. I very much welcome investment abroad, provided it does not affect the ESB&rsquo;s core business and the company does not take its eye off the ball regarding investment in infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is an indisputable fact that it is currently carrying out very significant investment, spending &euro;2.25 billion on the network, the partial construction of two new peat stations in the midlands at a cost of &euro;300 million, and a 400 mw combined cycle gas turbine at Ringsend. It is also going ahead with a &euro;3.6 billion investment in upgrading the transmission and distribution networks, completion of a 400 mw gas turbine generation plant at Coolkeeragh in Northern Ireland in 2005, a 250 mw peat plant at Loughrea in 2004, a west Offaly plant in 2005, a 380 mw repowering project for an existing ESB site, a 755 mw combined cycle gas turbine in Spain and additional IT developments in that respect.</P>
    <P>As Members can see, the ESB is not taking its eye off the ball regarding any of the investments. I understand that the ESB systematically invites Oireachtas Members and indicates to them the types of investments taking place in the various areas. We believe that the &euro;4 billion figure is reasonable and prudent, and I strongly recommend it to the House.</P>

    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">The need for recommittal arises because of the recent enactment of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. This Act was published and initiated after publication of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 and was still within the legislative procedures of the Oireachtas when the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 was considered on Committee Stage. Accordingly the enactment of the new superannuation legislation could not be presumed at that time. The subject of both amendments is the retirement age for the Defence Forces Ombudsman. Two linked amendments are now required to sections 2(4)(<i>c</i>) and 2(8) to reflect the provisions of the relevant aspects of the new public service superannuation legislation.</P>

Does this mean that with the consent of the Minister for Finance the time for which a person may <Col N="1964"/>hold office can be extended or reduced, or that it will be possible for the Government to approve an extension of time for the incumbent, when he or she has attained a certain age, subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance? Is there a third possibility because amendment No. 1 seeks to delete &ldquo;in any case,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where <i>subsection (8) </i>applies,&rdquo;?

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost all aspects of this Bill exclusively have been agreed with the Defence Forces association and PDFORRA. This amendment, however, is a technical one arising from the passage of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. It is not a question of having agreement with the associations or the Department of Finance, it is simply an essential technical change.</P>
   
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill reported with amendment.</P>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 5, to delete lines 9 to 13 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(5) subject to this section, a person appointed to be the Ombudsman shall hold office for a term of 7 years and may be re-appointed once only to that office for a second term.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Bill as drafted gives the Government quite a degree of control over the Defence Forces Ombudsman, including the setting of the length of his or her term of office. It might be deemed prudent to grant the ombudsman more independence from Government. The amendment does not in any way suggest that the Government is attempting to overly influence the ombudsman. It is an attempt to separate Government from control over the ombudsman in respect of a number of areas, such as, for example, the length of his or her term of office. The amendment is consistent with existing legislation and is modelled on the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 which contains a similar provision.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the term of office be specified in legislation and not prescribed. As the Minister is aware, the length of the term of office could have an effect on the policy pursued by an <Col N="1965"/>ombudsman. That is not a reflection on the likely incumbent or the Minister, it is simply a reference to the fact that if, for example, the term of office was set at 20 years, the policy pursued by an ombudsman might well be different to that which might obtain if the term of office was reviewable on a more regular basis. The amendment seeks to address that issue. Why is the Minister seeking to depart from prescribing the term of office?</P>
    <P>For an appointee to be entitled to hold office beyond a second term could be detrimental because the degree of independence and impartiality that is required could diminish during a longer term of office. This could happen for a number of reasons and could be to the advantage or disadvantage of either the Government or the Defence Forces. To reassure ourselves in respect of the independence and impartiality of the ombudsman, we believe it would be better to follow the route set out in the amendment, namely, that a person &ldquo;shall hold office for a term of 7 years and may be re-appointed once only&rdquo;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation provides for a period not exceeding seven years, with provision for a possible second and subsequent term of appointment. On Committee Stage, Deputy McGinley held that the legislation should provide for a fixed-term appointment of seven years, with the possibility of one second period of appointment only, presumably also a second fixed term of seven years. His proposed amendment would potentially allow an individual to serve for 14 consecutive years in total. I undertook to reconsider this matter without making any commitment. Having done so, I must honestly state that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill for the term of appointment were drafted to provide flexibility in making an appointment, not least from the viewpoint of potential appointees. A suitable potential appointee might be interested in filling the position for a period of three years or five years, for example, but might not wish to undertake the task for a period of seven years. We need to retain some degree of flexibility as regards the term of appointment. As a consequence, we also require flexibility as regards the possibility of any second and subsequent terms. In the context of the new Defence Forces Ombudsman, it is important that artificial restrictions which could, in practice, serve to frustrate the filling of the post by a suitable candidate for a term of less than seven years are not introduced into this primary legislation. The Bill provides that the question of the fixing of the duration of term of appointment should be left to the actual instrument of appointment, subject to the term not exceeding seven years. I remain convinced that this is the best practical operational model for the new position.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Durkan, Deputy McGinley made a strong case in favour of this amendment. I undertook to give serious consideration to see if I could agree to what was being suggested. We repeatedly tie our hands to an extraordinary <Col N="1966"/>degree and people sometimes say that we introduce too many regulations. I am seeking flexibility in respect of the new position of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. There might be someone suitable for the position who may wish to serve for three, four or five years or perhaps longer. All we are seeking is flexibility in terms of deciding on the exact length of the term of office.</P>
    <P>This is not a major issue and I do not believe Deputy McGinley would have pushed the matter to a vote. However, like Deputy Durkan, he believed that his view was right. I feel the same way and, therefore, am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(8) In respect of any person who is not a new entrant (within the meaning of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004) the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe the age at which such a person shall vacate office pursuant to <i>subsection (4)(c)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Ombudsman may of his or her own motion formally investigate in accordance with <i>section 9</i> any action which it appears to the Ombudsman that it is desirable in the public interest to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Deputy McGinley tabled this amendment to allow the ombudsman to decide to investigate a matter which he or she perceives as being in need of investigation without having to wait to respond to a complaint made to him or her. This power has been found to be useful elsewhere. We recognise that the role of the ombudsman may well evolve but all we can do at present in the legislation is to establish the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and set down the guidelines within which it will operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the amendment because it will be beneficial in terms of adding strength to the role and power of the ombudsman. It would be a good development if the ombudsman were granted power to examine matters he or she may consider worthy of investigation, without having to await the making of a complaint. This would also have an impact in terms of the independence and effectiveness of <Col N="1967"/>the office. I do not propose that the ombudsman should replace the Minister, the Department or the various representatives. However, it might be wise to encourage the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces to develop to a point where if he or she thought a matter was worthy of or suitable for investigation, he or she could proceed to do so without awaiting a complaint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment for the reasons outlined by Deputy Durkan. In general, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes and supports the Bill. However, we strongly object to the way the Government ordered Report Stage. We were only made aware of the fact that Report Stage would be taken at 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday and we were obliged to table amendments by 11 a.m. on Wednesday. The time provided was inadequate. We were informed that we could have tabled amendments on Committee Stage but our party is not represented on the relevant committee. It is unjust and unfair that matters have proceeded in this way. We have been denied the opportunity to table amendments. Having said that, we welcome and support the Bill. I fully support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has been on the Order Paper for a very long time. We have been pressing for it to be taken in the D&aacute;il for months and we eventually succeeded. There is considerable interest among members of the Defence Forces in having the legislation passed. It has received a broad welcome and there has been widespread support in the House for the principles enshrined in the Bill. There did not appear to be a significant number of amendments emerging from any source that would change the principles contained in it. No party has been placed at a disadvantage. The Bill has not been rushed. It has been hanging around for a long time.</P>
    <P>Amendments are generally not tabled until a Bill is due to come before the House. However, if one is very keen, one could table amendments well in advance in the knowledge that the Bill would come up at some stage rather than waiting until the last minute. I know this from my time in Opposition. We have all done some whitewashing when visitors were coming.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but the Bill has been there for a long time.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Durkan, it is an essential principle of the legislation that, subject to the provisions of the Bill, the Defence Forces Ombudsman may investigate any action that is the subject of a complaint made to him or her by a person affected by the action. That is a very significant principle in terms of ombudsman legislation, not just here but in many other jurisdictions. It is an essential condition, therefore, that there must be an identifiable individual com<Col N="1968"/>plainant in place. The proposed amendment would depart from that basic concept. I cannot envisage how in practice the Defence Forces Ombudsman could autonomously commence an investigation into an action in the absence of either a complainant or a complaint. I must, therefore, reject the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s response and I do not intend to press the amendment. However, it is felt that it might be an added strength to the ombudsman&rsquo;s office if it were possible, as may well become the case, that in the course of the investigation of a complaint from a third party, he or she may see an additional complaint arising from the original one. It may well be of benefit to him or her to investigate other elements other than those outlined in the complaint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>To take an example that is very current, in terms of modules being investigated by a very famous tribunal, we know the kind of culs-de-sac people can travel. This would make the ombudsman&rsquo;s task well nigh impossible.</P>
   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 not moved.</P>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) In this section &lsquo;serving member&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a person in the service of the Defence Forces, including a recruit,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) a former active member, including a former recruit,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) a retired member,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) applicants to the Defence Forces, and</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) a civil servant in the service of the Defence Forces.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The intent of this amendment is to broaden the categories of people who may be able to file a complaint. Apparently, in the Canadian model, those eligible to file complaints include current and former cadets, members of the Canadian forces, employees, applicants to the Canadian forces and family members of any of the preceding. I understand why this might be considered useful as very often those who apply for a particular position may well have reason to disagree with a decision because it was not in their favour. It is felt that if the ombudsman is to have real impact, the category of complainants must be sufficiently broad as to encompass those persons as set out in the amendment. That would substantially increase the number of people who would be eligible to file complaints. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1969"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment concerns the prescribed categories of persons who may make a complaint to the Defence Forces Ombudsman. Having considered the matter, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The published legislation provides that complaints may be made to the Defence Forces Ombudsman both by serving and former members of the Defence Forces, subject to the other governing terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>A complaint may be made in respect of a matter internal to the Defence Forces where the complainant feels adversely affected. The general body of serving members and former members of the Defence Forces, including recruits and cadets, will be able to utilise this legislation to access the Defence Forces Ombudsman, as provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no reason civilians who have never served in the Defence Forces would need to make an application to the Defence Forces Ombudsman regarding internal Defence Forces matters. Such civilians have recourse to the existing Ombudsman as regards matters relating to the Department of Defence, Civil Service secretariat and to the Minister. Typical examples would relate to civilian employee pensions, matters relating to property owned by the Department of Defence and civilian applications to join the Defence Forces. None of these matters is proper to the specific role of the new Defence Forces Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Defence Forces Ombudsman legislation is not relevant to civilian employees of the Department. As I explained on Committee Stage, these individuals are non-established civilian employees of the Department of Defence. Many are craftsmen while others perform various clerical functions in stores and so on. While they work with the Defence Forces, their employment is subject to the normal body of civil employment legislation. They enjoy exactly the same employment rights as all other non-established State employees who are employed by the Office of Public Works and by certain other Departments. Their interests are represented by recognised trade unions at the joint industrial council for non-established State industrial employees of Government Departments. They are not subject to military law or military discipline. In light of the entirely comprehensive nature of the provisions of the published legislation, I must, therefore, reject the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some degree of experience in this matter, which I am sure the Minister will recall. I accept the point made by him in regard to the fact that such civilians are not subject to military law or rules and regulations. However, they do work with and in the Defence Forces. If they were not in those positions their places would have to be filled by members of the Defence Forces who, in turn, would have the right to make a complaint in the normal way. I accept that many of the people concerned are <Col N="1970"/>former members of the Defence Forces which allows them to make complaints.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>A large percentage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct. It is understandable and is probably a good thing for security reasons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>They are covered.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>As former members they are covered. I know that security sensitivities surround this area and that a spurious complaint could be made. However, in those circumstances, it would be the ombudsman&rsquo;s prerogative to make a judgment call.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should make provision for persons who do not have an entitlement to make a complaint by virtue of not being former members of the Defence Forces, but who may be working alongside former members of the Defence Forces who are entitled to make a complaint. Notwithstanding the trade union route which such employees can take, if they work alongside former members of the Defence Forces, in many cases doing the same job, it would be beneficial to include them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We have considered this very carefully. The proposal for an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been on the political agenda for some time. I made my first announcement in this regard prior to the 1997 general election. During that time no representations have been made by any of the associations or the unions representing those about whom Deputy Durkan has expressed concern. I do not accept the principle that because an employee works alongside somebody who is subject to military law and discipline everything that applies to him or her in the Defence Forces should apply to the civilian employee. When we consider the range of services being carried out, this might arise in many circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the Ombudsman can accept complaints from such people and at the same time we are enshrining a provision in this legislation, which also complicates the matter by enabling them to also take this avenue, what the Deputy is proposing would afford them two options. At present they can go to the Ombudsman and this amendment would allow them to go to the ombudsman for the Defence Forces also. On reflection Deputy Durkan might not want to press the amendment. I can understand the reason behind it. The Deputy&rsquo;s constituency contains many people who work alongside members of the Defence Forces. While this is a legitimate proposal, we cannot accept<?oasys _jy?>it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to delay the proceedings of the House other than to ventilate the issue, as a former Ceann Comhairle used to say. I could foresee the possibility of a civilian <Col N="1971"/>employee working alongside a former member of the Defence Forces who would have an entitlement to lodge a complaint in the normal way. The Minister has correctly said that such a civilian employee would have the right to go to the national Ombudsman with his or her complaint. The other person with whom he or she works would have the entitlement to go to the ombudsman for the Defence Forces. I could foresee a slight problem arising there. Since this relates to activity and practice within the Defence Forces, I would prefer the ombudsman for the Defence Forces to make the decision on the complaint. This might require further amendments in other legislation to ensure only one ombudsman is referred to. We could not allow each individual to go to various and different ombudsmen to resolve a particular problem.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied, that is fair enough. However, from my experience there will always be a certain amount of healthy competition, for want of a better description, in such circumstances, even in cases where the former members of the Defence Forces are involved. I do not want to be disruptive or to create dissension given the security point of view, but I am not certain that the two-avenue approach to resolve complaints, one to the military ombudsman and the other to another ombudsman, is necessarily the right way to go about this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>We never want to be too certain in this business. As the Deputy knows, a civilian employee has access to other forums, including the Labour Relations Commission, which are closed to members of the Defence Forces. Many compounding reasons prevent us going down that road. I have no more to say. My persuasive ability is obviously wanting in getting the honourable Deputy from Kildare to come along with me. That is our position.</P>

    <P>We are concerned over the elaborate phraseology. I wonder why it might have been put this way. It obviously does not mean the &ldquo;in the Civil Service&rdquo;. I presume it means &ldquo;in the civilian service&rdquo; of the State, or does it? It would appear to <Col N="1972"/>be an extensive description of what it is meant to convey.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>There is some confusion concerning the definition of the term &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo;. The Bill provides generally in the definitions that the term &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; has the meaning assigned by the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956. This is the same definition as is provided in both the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 and the Ombudsman Act 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 14 relating to staff deals specifically with the civil servants who will be employed within the new office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The provisions here reflect the corresponding provisions of section 10 of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and section 21 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 in providing that a member of staff of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State, as opposed to a civil servant of the Government, the latter being typically a civil servant working within a line Department under a Minister.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s amendment would establish a different situation for those working in the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces as compared to the officers of the other two existing statutory ombudsman&rsquo;s offices.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 17, line 43, to delete &ldquo;shall come&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This is a minor technical amendment which proposes to delete &ldquo;shall come&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comes&rdquo;. The wording proposed in the amendment is now quite common. The use of the active voice has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission and my esteemed colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, will be familiar with it. Some suggest that the Bill is drafted in the old style and the Minister admitted that when he stated a few minutes ago that it has been in the stocks for a long time. That was a rather unfortunate expression for something associated with the military. The word &ldquo;stocks&rdquo; was not intended to be derogatory. The Bill has been in existence for a while. Perhaps the Minister may comment on this amendment.</P>

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank most sincerely all the Deputies from various sides of the House who contributed so thoughtfully and constructively to the debate on the Bill. All the contributions made were welcome and indicated Deputies had formulated their contributions to the debate with considerable thought and reflection.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Second Stage and in addressing individual amendments on Committee Stage, I was pleased to have the opportunity to bring forward two important and fundamental ministerial amendments to the published legislation to accommodate specific concerns raised by PDFORRA. Both amendments secured the support of the House. The first widens the potential remit of the new Defence Forces Ombudsman. This amendment carefully redefines the term &ldquo;military operations&rdquo; to greatly limit the definition of the term in the Bill. The amended definition greatly restricts the application of the term &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; as a basis for the possible exclusion of the ombudsman from investigating a complaint.</P>
    <P>The second significant amendment deals with those unusual circumstances where the ombudsman cannot become involved in the investigation of certain types of complaint, a limited number of which specific statutory exclusions are provided for in the legislation. The second amendment ensures that, in such circumstances, the complainant will retain the present right to refer the complaint to the Minister when internal military channels of appeal have been fully utilised up to and including the Chief of Staff. It has always been the intention to maximise the operational remit of the new Defence Forces Ombudsman to the greatest degree possible. It has always been my view that any limitations which will impose upon the new ombudsman must be materially justifiable in terms of essential criteria for military command and control, operating military effectiveness in the field and security.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley and Deputy Sherlock, who was represented by Deputy Wall, also submitted a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I thank these Deputies for their attention to and interest in the legislation. However, in the event, I was unable to accommodate any of the amendments bar one.</P>
    <P>The objective observer would agree that the Bill, as amended, has secured the proper balance and I am gratified that all the various amendments which I brought forward were so readily accepted by the House. I believe that the Bill, as amended, will provide an excellent statutory foundation for the operation of the new Defence Forces Ombudsman in future. I have every confidence that the establishment of the new office of the Defence Forces Ombudsman will prove to be an important milestone in the history of the Defence Forces. This significant new statutory <Col N="1975"/>office will be one major factor among others in ensuring a further development and maintenance of a modern contemporary working environment in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In bringing this legislation forward, I have been impressed to note that all the interested parties have acknowledged and agreed the need to preserve and maintain the unique disciplined environment of military life. This aspect of discipline has always been an essential requirement for meeting the challenges and responsibilities of military life. Moreover, these challenges and responsibilities must sometimes be faced under extremely dangerous circumstances.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies, in particular Deputy Durkan and his colleagues, for constructive and supportive engagement with the Bill in the course of its passage through the House. I thank my colleagues in the Department of Defence who have worked tirelessly to ensure that the legislation would be well developed and stand the test of time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for accepting one amendment. I do not suppose it will have a ground-shattering effect on anyone involved, but it might be seen as an indication of the modernisation of the phraseology used in this context. Having lived all my life in a constituency that has an ongoing relationship with the Defence Forces, it is timely to reflect on the role they have played heretofore. I do not want to go into that detail today, except to reiterate that they have played a significant role and we pledge our continued support for them. The whole procedure of dealing with complaints in the Defence Forces is something that was unknown 25 years ago, but is apparently working well. That is the way it should be. In the absence of a complaints procedure dissension occurs. Now that the procedure is in place, it is working well. I hope and trust that this element of the procedure, the appointment of an ombudsman and the definition of that office&rsquo;s powers, will be of benefit to the Defence Forces of the future.</P>
    <P>I apologise for the absence of Deputy McGinley, who unfortunately is otherwise engaged and cannot be here today. He specifically asked me to stand in for him in discussions with the Minister on the Bill. I thank the Minister, Deputy McGinley and all those involved, including PDFORRA, in the Defence Forces, which made a very useful contribution in preparing this legislation. We hope it all works well.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="1976"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has been an enthusiastic supporter of the establishment of the International Criminal Court since the issue was agreed in Rome six years ago. The establishment of the International Criminal Court is the most important development in international law since the foundation of the United Nations. For that reason we fully support the Bill before the House. It is a Bill that, after ratification, ensures that our domestic law is in compliance with the obligations we undertook when we signed the Rome statute six years ago and ratified it in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court is a tribunal that will try individuals responsible for the most serious international crimes &mdash; war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture, enforced disappearances and genocide. There is no doubt that such a forum is needed after a century of strife and trouble and crimes against humanity, not just in Europe but across the globe. The court has been in gestation for upwards of a century. The Treaty of Versailles, after the First World War, provided for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the German emperor. As it happens Kaiser Wilhelm ll never stood trial, but efforts after the Second World War were more successful in that temporary tribunals were set up in Nuremberg and Tokyo to try the major war criminals. In addition the Nuremberg charter specified areas that are still considered to be key crimes under international law &mdash; crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In many ways these initiatives were the forerunners of the International Criminal Court. In particular they shattered the notion forever that state sovereignty could be used as a defence for acts that were considered outrages on the consciences of mankind.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, there were the genocide and Geneva conventions. The General Assembly of the United Nations then asked the International Law Commission to examine the possibility of an international criminal court. To show how slowly such matters move, that is over 50 years ago. Then we had the Cold War and no possibility of getting agreement among nations. Nothing much happened after that until the 1980s.</P>
    <P>It was a small country which proposed that efforts to establish an international criminal court should be resumed. When people argue that a small country such as Ireland has no role on the international stage, I point to the example set by Trinidad and Tobago in the 1980s, a little country that most people here have probably never heard of. It got discussions going again. In the meantime there have been temporary tribunals dealing with the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The establishment of those temporary tribunals gave a further impetus to the need for an international criminal court. Given revelations in recent times around the world, one sees the justification even more for such a court. In Iraq a good deal of attention is currently focusing on the recent incidences in Abu Ghraib, but let us not forget that over the previous 20 years a dreadful regime of <Col N="1977"/>torture was in place there under Saddam Hussein and his lackeys. This was not just in Abu Ghraib, but throughout the whole of Iraq.</P>
    <P>In recent times also we had the killing fields in Cambodia, Rwanda and even now the way in which the Palestinians are being treated in the Middle East is contrary to international law. That brings me on to the question of how effective this court will be. Ireland is, and should be, an enthusiastic supporter of the International Criminal Court. To some degree it is relevant that the entire global village accepts its jurisdiction. It is probably significant that at this stage well over 100 countries have ratified the treaty. It is timely to recall those countries which voted against the Rome statute six years ago and investigate their reasons for doing so. Seven countries voted against the statute in July 1988, one of which was the United States, which we will come back to. China was another, not exactly a bastion of freedom and human rights. Iraq, which is still not off the wrack, voted against it.</P>
    <P>Israel voted against it for its own reasons, which one can see when one examines the state terrorism in which it is indulging at the expense of the Palestinian people. Libya, under the leadership of Mr. Gadaffi, is not a prime example of democracy and human rights, although it is fair to say that Mr. Gadaffi seems to have had some change of heart in recent times, which is to be encouraged. The other two countries which voted against it at the time were Qatar and Yemen.</P>
    <P>The countries that do not want international inspection of their actions do not support the proceedings of the International Criminal Court. The United States, which is prime among such countries, signed the Rome statute in the final days of President Clinton&rsquo;s time in office, but it has not yet ratified it. The authorities in that country feel that the American Senate would not ratify it. I have never been considered anti-American, but I question the approach of the American authorities in this regard. Every possible pressure should be brought to bear on the US, as the only global superpower, to encourage it to support the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the official US position with the US authorities. They said they are not against the idea of international accountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, but they do not agree with the form the International Criminal Court takes. That is probably an easy way out for them. The US is happy for other people to be bound by the court but it does not want to be bound by the court itself, which is an indefensible position. As a friend of the US, Ireland should continue to impose on it in a constructive fashion any pressure it can, bilaterally and through international institutions, to encourage the US to support the court. The support of the US is vital if we want the court to be widely accepted in the short term. I do not doubt that it will be successful in the long term and that in years to come it will suit the US to support the <Col N="1978"/>efforts of the court. We have a duty to continue to press the issue with the US authorities.</P>
    <P>One should not forget that the court&rsquo;s operations are under way. It is investigating a case in northern Uganda and it has received a second referral from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is important not only that the court should be fully established, but that it should be fully accepted and recognised as a body that can bring good to the world. The tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo were established by the victors at the time. They were established <i>post facto</i>, after nazism and fascism had been defeated. The advantage of the International Criminal Court is that it is in place now. Those who are tempted to indulge in horrific practices are aware of its existence. They know they may be answerable to the body. It is not a question of getting the international will to support the establishment of such a body subsequently.</P>
    <P>The other country that should be encouraged to take cognisance of the International Criminal Court is Israel, which seems to be prepared to plumb the depths of inhumanity at a state level. Anybody who raises such issues with Israel is deemed, as a standard defence, to be anti-Semitic. Such an argument is rubbish and baloney, to use a phrase used by the Taoiseach yesterday. Jews suffered dreadfully as a consequence of the inhumanity of man when the state of Israel was established and immediately thereafter. We should recall that 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, but that does not give those who are running the state of Israel a licence to subject others to the same treatment. While there is no direct parallel, some of the inhumanity in which Israel is involved against the Palestinians has certain resonances. It is from the same stable, in many ways. I hope those who are friends of Israel and want Israel to live in peace and harmony with its neighbours on a fair and just basis will bring that message home to Israel. More importantly, I hope the message will be heard.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court, which we have supported from the beginning, has started its work. I have a mild criticism in that it is a little late in the day to put in place measures that should have been put in place some years ago. I accept that there was a need for a referendum, which took place about three years ago, to the best of my recollection. I accept too that the Bill, which is quite complex, contains a series of sections aimed at ensuring that our domestic law complies fully with our international obligations. I wish the Bill had been in place when we were ratifying the relevant treaty, which would have been the correct procedure. It is good that the Bill is now before the House, however, and that we are in a position to support it, thereby ensuring that we will comply fully with the court in every respect, including in our domestic law.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider certain aspects of the Bill. Amnesty International produced a comprehensive document on the Bill, including many comments and recommendations. I hope the <Col N="1979"/>Minister will assure me in his closing speech that the issues raised by Amnesty International have been taken fully into account. I do not intend to discuss the document in detail because the Minister will have read it just as I have. Amnesty International has raised issues such as increasing to 18 the age at which children may be conscripted or enlisted in armed forces. The existing articles provide that it is a war crime to conscript or enlist children under the age of 15 into armed forces or groups, or to use children under that age to participate actively in hostilities. It is not a theoretical problem because young children are being drawn into conflicts in many parts of the world, unfortunately. They are generally not involved in the regular armed forces of a country, but many children are actively participating in hostilities with irregular groups, militias and terrorist groups. There is a strong case for raising the age of prohibition from 15, which was set to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I would support an approach which would seek a higher standard of protection for children. Since 18 years is the age of majority, there is no case for conscription under that age, nor is there a case for drafting children under the age of 18 into militias and groups.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>An issue which one might not speak about with complete certainty concerns voluntary enlistment of children under that age in the regular forces of a country. That might not be as clear-cut if we are talking about apprentices into a regular army or something of that nature. The case made by Amnesty International on that issue is a good one.</P>
    <P>It also deals with the issue of other crimes under international law that are not contained in its own statute. I would be in agreement with the thinking on that. The establishment of the International Criminal Court is the most important progress in international law in years but I would hope that once it is fully supported by the entire international community, the ambit of the court will be extended. I could see the International Criminal Court having jurisdiction at some stage in regard to drug trafficking and issues of that kind. I realise that may be well into the future but it is possibly a development that will take place once the court is operational and fully supported by all members of the international community.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is fully supportive of the International Criminal Court. We want Ireland to comply not just with its obligations but take the lead and give an example in ensuring the International Criminal Court becomes a permanent successful part of the international architecture. We do not want it to be just a symbol but a working body that will help to bring to justice those who are guilty of these outrageous crimes. If the court succeeds in the short term, we will all be pleased and we can then hope to extend its ambit and jurisdiction to ensure it will have an even <Col N="1980"/>greater role in international affairs in future years.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on the International Criminal Court. It is very relevant, particularly having regard to the current international situation. There is a need for a debate, detailed analysis and discussion among all parties on this important legislation dealing with the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>In examining the question of war crimes and genocide, we must all pull back a little and make a clinical decision that will have legal effect when supporting legislation on international courts. That is the reason I am particularly critical of international Governments that do not have a clear record in terms of justice and fair play internationally. I am talking in particular about the Bush, Blair and Sharon Administrations which have not made any contribution to the International Criminal Court and in the area of justice. When international leaders walk away from bodies like the International Criminal Court they cannot lecture others about their commitments to non-violence and world peace. We should put that down as a marker before we get into the core of the debate.</P>
    <P>In the past Ireland had a strong track record as an international broker and a country with an independent foreign policy. We are respected in Third World countries, the Middle East and South America but we are beginning to lose that respect because of the policies of successive Governments over the past nine or ten years. If we do not examine Ireland&rsquo;s role in this area, there is little point coming into this House to support the International Criminal Court when we appear to be siding with one side in international conflicts.</P>
    <P>The events at Shannon Airport are a classic example of that. When we consider the question of guns, war crimes and other issues, and what has been happening in Iraq over the past year, particularly with more than 20,000 civilians dead, we must ask what exactly is going on at Shannon Airport. Last year, 3,691 foreign military aircraft carrying 120,855 armed troops passed through Shannon. A total of 612 civilian planes carrying undisclosed munitions of war landed at the airport and 270 other civilian planes landed carrying unspecified weapons. There are also question marks over the ownership of a small aircraft which regularly visits Shannon Airport and is based in Virginia, in the United States. Many people are concerned about what this so-called civilian aircraft is doing at Shannon. Who owns it? Who are the passengers being brought through Shannon and from where are they coming? Are there connections between the CIA and this aircraft which regularly uses Shannon? I raise <Col N="1981"/>these important questions because we are discussing the International Criminal Court which will try to deal with people who have a record of genocide, violence and war crimes. We have to face up to those realities.</P>
    <P>On the Bill, the statute provides for the establishment of an international criminal court with jurisdiction to investigate, prosecute and punish persons who commit the most serious offences of concern to the international community &mdash; genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over individuals rather than states who commit these crimes on the territory of the state party or where a non-state party has given its consent. The court will also have jurisdiction over crimes committed in situations anywhere in the world which are referred to it by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes, the court may also prosecute those in authority who ordered crimes to be committed, including Heads of State and government officials. I welcome that positive aspect of the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court operates on the principle of complementarity rather than a substitute for a national criminal justice system in that it will only take on an investigation where a state is unwilling or genuinely unable to carry out the investigation or prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates new offences of war crimes and crimes against humanity and consolidates the existing offence of genocide under the Genocide Act 1973.</P>
    <P>There are 18 judges of the court who were inaugurated on 11 March 2003, at which time 89 state parties had ratified the statute. I pay tribute to the Irish judge at the International War Crimes Tribunal for Yugoslavia, Ms Maureen Harding Clark, who has been elected as one of the 18 judges of the court.</P>
    <P>States have a responsibility in this area but some states, particularly powerful ones like the United States, have not agreed to sign up to the International Criminal Court. That is not acceptable. I urge the Government, if it has any influence with the US authorities, to encourage them to sign up to this court.</P>
    <P>When referring to violence, terrorism and war crimes, it should be noted that the British state did not accept its responsibility in dealing with the families of the victims of the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings. As a member of the Oireachtas sub-committee on the Barron report, I was appalled that its Government did not facilitate the sub-committee&rsquo;s hearings on the report.</P>
    <P>There are serious questions about the UK security forces&rsquo; involvement in acts of violence in this State. In trying to develop the peace process and restore public confidence in all security forces, the public must be satisfied that the victims are looked after and protected. Many people have concerns about collusion. The events of the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings can be con<Col N="1982"/>strued as an act of war. However, we seem to be burying our heads in the sand in the hope it will go away. If there is a genuine interest in developing justice and truth and moving the peace process forward, we must face up to these issues and take responsibility for them. I call on the Government to do this. I challenge the British Government, in particular, in its role in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.</P>
    <P>Defining where violence comes from must also be addressed. States cannot be involved in terrorism while at the same time condemning it. I wish to raise the case of the Miami Five. Gerardo Hern&aacute;ndez, Antonio Guerrero, Ram&oacute;n Labañino, Fernando Gonz&aacute;lez and Ren&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez were five Cubans trying to stop Miami-based terrorist groups carrying out violent actions against the Cuban people. They were found guilty by a Miami court from evidence of convicted terrorists of charges ranging from murder to espionage. Extensive intimidation of jurors by these US-based terrorists was also a feature of the trial. The Miami Five are innocent of the charges brought against them. They are currently appealing their convictions in this obvious miscarriage of justice. The campaign for their release and exoneration is dedicated to the memory of those 3,478 killed and 2,099 maimed Cubans by US-based terrorist groups since 1959. This reality is not faced up to often.</P>
    <P>The major powers must be forced to be responsible to the principles of the International Criminal Court. I am concerned about the US lack of support for the court and I urge the Government to put pressure on the US through EU and UN channels that this is not an option. There is a need for a credible international independent court. Its integrity and independence needs to be emphasised and I am glad that an Irish judge is involved in the court. We must ensure that the International Criminal Court has the respect and support of all countries, not just the western and EU states &mdash; I am glad 89 states signed up to this. There must be a strong emphasis on civil liberties and human rights issues. Mistreating prisoners is not acceptable. I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the International Criminal Court Bill and I urge the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to use all its power to support the court in its work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, a Progressive Democrats Member, opened Second Stage of the Bill this afternoon. I note that his party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is overseeing the debate. Yet we have not seen their Progressive Democrats colleague, Deputy McDowell, the Minister responsible for seeing this legislation through the Oireachtas, in the Chamber. Is this an indication of his reticence about national jurisprudence being transferred to other international courts of justice? If it is, he <Col N="1983"/>should state for the record whether he is in favour of the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been a long time in gestation. Most Members only heard of the International Criminal Court when the Government decided it was necessary to have a referendum on it. This was held with the referenda on the removal of the death penalty from the Constitution and the Nice treaty. As has transpired, the delay in putting this Bill together shows how unnecessary that referendum was. It was not a sincere attempt to engage the electorate about the principles of the International Criminal Court. It was more a cynical exercise to have people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the three referenda. However, the Government&rsquo;s plan came undone when people readily agreed to the International Criminal Court and the abolition of the death penalty but chose to reject the Nice treaty. I hope the Government has subsequently learned a lesson.</P>
    <P>The principle of the International Criminal Court is largely supported by the Irish citizens which Members will endorse. There are crimes perpetrated of such devastation and evil that cannot be dealt with in a national jurisdiction. Instead, they require the international community to act in concert in tracking down the perpetrators to achieve justice for the many thousands of victims. However, this idea is compromised by the attitude of the US towards the International Criminal Court. Without the participation of the US, with its armed forces not being subject to the court&rsquo;s rulings, the court&rsquo;s aspirations are a nonsense. The US has defined for itself a role as the world&rsquo;s policeman which has resulted in thousands of its troops being deployed in places such as Iraq. In Iraq, a few bad apples caused certain crimes, which should be looked at individually and put through a judicial system. However, given the rabid nature of the US Administration, there is evidence that instructions on how the armed forces were to behave and how prisoners are treated came from the top.</P>
    <P>Remaining outside the International Criminal Court, the US has decided what constitutes a prisoner of war and how he or she can be detained and treated. Events at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib in Baghdad show that the goodwill of the US is compromised on every level. Instead of encouraging the US to participate in the court, it should be shamed and embarrassed into doing so. The US should espouse those principles that have made it the world&rsquo;s greatest democracy. Ireland is compromised by these activities.</P>
    <P>Despite events in Iraq being governed by a UN Security Council resolution, Government answers have been evasive on the suggestion that transit to Shannon Airport may be bringing people from Afghanistan and Iraq, particularly Afghanistan, to Guantanamo Bay. It has certainly done so in the past. The irony of this country presenting itself as a signatory and a participant, and having an Irish judge as an integral part of this process, <Col N="1984"/>somehow standing idly by while the principles of international justice have been compromised to such an extent, deserves a response from the Government. Unfortunately its silence speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>The fact that an international criminal court was first suggested in 1948 with the foundation of the United Nations shows the difficulties and barriers put up by the larger countries which had a vested interest in ensuring that such a criminal court never saw the light of day and could never have an effect. The further irony is that the United Nations was largely founded through the efforts of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of the wartime American President and that it is subsequent American Administrations which have poured cold water on the idea of a true international system of justice and have put most of the obstacles in its way. This should be a source of shame for the United States.</P>
    <P>Even coming into being now, in the changed circumstances of the world we live in, an international criminal court must have its effectiveness questioned &mdash; even if the Americans were to take a full part in it tomorrow. The nature of war, if it was ever civilised, has gone beyond the civilities of formal declarations of war and the presence of known combatants. We now have systems of war that are globalised, akin to the economies we live in. The combatants do not come from a particular country. They are mobile, and they have rules of engagement which do not exist in the textbooks of military theory. The situation becomes even murkier when we look at people in those situations who commit acts of genocide. Is it the role of the court to decide if the person who pulls the trigger or wields the knife is ultimately responsible? What about the people in the background, the very respectable nations and corporations which are responsible for arming people in these situations? Surely they are as culpable in crimes of genocide? The criminal court does not seem to address that. The idea of corporate responsibility and of national responsibility for foreign policy that results in the deaths of thousands of people in other countries should be a responsibility of an international criminal court.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to take responsibility for Ireland participating in this court while trying to coerce those with whom we have an international involvement. By failing to make firm statements of intent as to where we stand on the principles of international justice we are losing most of the goodwill we have earned as an independent country through our work over the past 50 years in the United Nations. Unless we become less circumspect, less evasive in terms of condemning certain crimes and those who are ultimately responsible or have a shared responsibility for these crimes, the type of role we have played genuinely and successfully in UN peacekeeping missions will be compromised, and invitations for us to participate and people&rsquo;s willingness to trust our troops in situations where we might have to be part of an international force <Col N="1985"/>that tries to rebuild countries after genocide will be affected. I hope in the ongoing debate on this Bill the Government is prepared to respond to those criticisms.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in unreservedly welcomes the creation of an international criminal court to prosecute those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity including in particular the crime of genocide, which has been repeated down the centuries in all parts of the globe by those who will stop at nothing to build empires, and a crime which, until the present, has been carried out with virtual impunity.</P>
    <P>After more than 50 years in gestation, the establishment of this permanent Court of International Justice in the Hague and the inauguration of its judges in March 2003 is a small source of hope for a more just future for everyone. I congratulate Judge Maureen Harding Clarke on her election to the court, and wish her every success. I also commend her recent appointment to our own Human Rights Commission. Now if only we could get our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take this body seriously and treat its opinions with the respect they deserve, we could make some real progress in the area of human rights in this state.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are also to be commended for their 2001 referendum vote endorsing the establishment of the International Criminal Court, but why did the Government wait for nearly a year after that to ratify its statute? Given the popular mandate received for this legislation which gives domestic effect to its provisions, what possible reason could there be for the delay of two years to publish the Bill, and why the delay of another year to bring it to Second Stage? By the time this Bill reaches Final Stage, almost six years will have elapsed between the time Ireland first signed the Rome Statute in 1998 and the signing of this Bill into law. Given the subject matter, this negligence is totally inappropriate and must be a source of embarrassment. It reads to others as though the Irish people do not consider this to be a priority, while nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The grotesque acts of torture committed on Iraqi prisoners of war by American and British occupation forces have brought the issue of impunity for war crimes into sharp relief. While it is reluctantly accepted that according to the provisions finally agreed at Rome, all those who committed war crimes and crimes of genocide prior to the entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court on 1 July 2002 may not be prosecuted, any such criminals committing crimes after that date must not escape international justice.</P>
    <P>The will of the international community is clear on this point. All such perpetrators must be held accountable for their crimes without exception, regardless of official position, military rank or nationality. They must be tried either by national courts, or failing that, by the International Criminal Court. It is crucial to both the legitimacy and <Col N="1986"/>effectiveness of this new instrument that no person from any state be deemed immune. I express on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in our deep concern over the continuing refusal of two states, the United States and Israel, to ratify the Rome Statute. The hypocrisy of wanting this statute to apply to others but not to themselves speaks volumes. I also criticise the lobbying effort by the United States to pressure other countries into signing bilateral Article 98 non-surrender agreements to effectively grant its nationals immunity from the International Criminal Court. Such agreements are illegal under international law as they violate the obligations of all states to ensure that people accused of such crimes, the most serious crimes under international law, are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>For what crimes is this international immunity being sought? Article 6 crimes are genocidal crimes including acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Article 7 crimes are crimes against humanity committed as part of a widespread or systemic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.</P>
    <P>These include acts of murder, extermination, enslavement, forcible deportation or population transfer, imprisonment in violation of the fundamental rules of international law, torture, rape, sexual slavery or enforced prostitution, persecution against any identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious or gender grounds, the crime of apartheid, and other inhumane acts intended to cause great suffering. Article 8 crimes are a series of 51 separate and distinct war crimes. According to Article 5.1(d), once definitions can be agreed by the parties, the crime of international aggression will also be included in the statute. Despite this, the United States is demanding that any US national accused of such crimes should be returned to the US, without any commitment that they will be prosecuted by US courts. In fact, in many cases the US will not even be able to do so, as many of these international crimes are not against US law.</P>
    <P>The pressure to sign these agreements has been intense. According to the US state department, as of 15 June more than 80 countries have entered into such immunity agreements. However, 58 of the 94 state parties which have not signed, 45 countries have publicly refused to sign and 23 of these state parties have made the courageous and principled decision not to sign despite the consequent loss of US aid. The Irish people deserve to know in what category this State stands. Moreover, I want the Minister to give an unequivocal commitment in clear language that the Government will not sign any such bilateral agreement with any state at any time now or in future.</P>
    <P>The ongoing campaign the US has mounted to undermine the ICC and to secure permanent immunity for itself is a disgrace, and Ireland must not stand idly by. It was with dismay and shame that I watched the UN Security Council pass Res<Col N="1987"/>olution 1422 in 2002 and Resolution 1487 in 2003 allowing US peacekeepers on UN authorised missions immunity from the International Criminal Court. Therefore, it was with relief that I learned a similar resolution tabled to the UN Security Council this year was withdrawn by the US on June 23 of this year, because it could not secure adequate support from the other members of the council. I understand the passage of these annually renewable resolutions &mdash; unanimously in 2002, when Ireland was a member, and with only three abstentions in 2003 &mdash; was in response to a US threat to hold future UN peacekeeping hostage to its demand. However, Ireland&rsquo;s acquiescence in 2002, and particularly the fact that we did not join the campaign of opposition led by South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Brazil and Mexico, is a stain that will not easily wash away.</P>
    <P>In his reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the Minister stated that during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, the Government would lead European efforts to ensure the widest possible ratification and implementation of the ICC statute, and to develop a broader dialogue between the EU and the US on all matters relating to the International Criminal Court. Was this done and, if so, how? Was the issue of ratification of the ICC statute raised with the US President during the June summit by the Taoiseach acting either on behalf of the State or on behalf of the European Union? Will the Minister include a statement on these matters in his closing remarks?</P>
    <P>The Bill and the related statute are complex. The ICC statute itself at Schedule 1 has 128 articles. Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see the Bill passed quickly but not so quickly that we miss the opportunity to make this legislation the best it can be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in tried to muddy the waters by raising the issue of the delay of the Bill as if to suggest that prejudice had somehow arisen in the period before the Bill came before the House, that somebody has been short-changed, that an injustice had been done or even that it is the deliberate intention of Government to side-step its responsibilities, which is not the case. The Deputy pointed out that the Government made commitments in regard to the International Criminal Court that other governments have not made. It would be wrong not to challenge the Deputy&rsquo;s comments. If there was delay, it was not due to prejudice by any party and no injustice was suffered by any party as a result of delay. It was not the intention of Government to delay the Bill for any nefarious purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill is needed. I learned about the Nuremberg war crimes trials as a history teacher. The defence laid before the court by the Nazis tried at Nuremberg was that the laws they were charged with having broken were created after the offences, and that it was wrong to retrospectively convict them of crimes that did not exist <Col N="1988"/>before 1945. These were strong and legitimate defences and, in another tribunal, might have succeeded. However, there was no moral strength to their defence. Nonetheless, the situation showed a clear need to bring together legislation such as that before us.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the delay of six years, it is amazing we have waited this long to have a permanent court that can try individuals for the kind of crimes described in the statute. We have waited almost 60 years to have this kind of legislation in force in this country. While there is no question that the Bill has taken a long time to reach this stage, I would not put the responsibility for this on the Government. The issue required much negotiation between countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to UN Resolution 1487, a matter missed by media coverage. It is interesting to note that the UN is standing up to the Americans on this issue. The US has consistently tried to drag its heels on the application of the court to UN-type peacekeeping missions. While this is no longer the case, I want to examine the American argument.</P>
    <P>People in Ireland give Americans a hard time and this is not always fair. The Americans argue that it is not in their interest to sign up to the court because of the danger of politically motivated prosecutions. Any country&rsquo;s foreign policy is determined by their base national interest. So long as that is the case, America is probably right in what it is doing as there is no doubt somebody will try to use the court in this manner at some stage. While I do not think there is any way that the International Criminal Court could host a politically motivated and frivolous prosecution, the Americans argue this is the case. it is against the constitutional principles of the separation of powers, checks and balances, and the fundamental nature of the judicial system. Again, this argument does not stand up because if that was the case, they could test its constitutionality in the US Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>One argument which does stand up is that their own courts are adequate to deal with the problems addressed by this Bill. That is true. A couple of weeks ago the US Supreme Court gave its decision on issues arising from the detention of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. It found that the detainees were entitled to the protections of US law. That demonstrates the independence of the US Supreme Court. Anybody who is charged with any of the crimes outlined in the Rome Statute would be tried in an American court.</P>
    <P>The Americans are saying, in effect, that this statute is for countries without a properly functioning judicial system. In view of the cases that have come before the court so far, that is the case. They involve places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, not European or developed countries. That argument is valid. I do not envisage Americans being prosecuted under this statute because their own system is perfectly adequate.</P><Col N="1989"/>
    <P>However, America should return from its position of isolation in world affairs. Its isolation is seen in matters such as the landmines treaty and the nuclear test ban treaty, neither of which it has signed, and with regard to the Kyoto Protocol. It is not all George Bush&rsquo;s fault. These were not signed by former President Clinton either so let us not make a demon of George Bush unnecessarily. However, for so long as America remains outside these multilateral treaties, its isolation will continue. America should sign the International Criminal Court statute because it symbolises multilateralism and it would symbolise America coming back into the world from which it has isolated itself through its foreign policy. I am not an attacker of the United States but there are so many of these examples that it is becoming dangerous for them.</P>
    <P>What is also dangerous is the bilateral approach the US has adopted. The EU is equally responsible for this. The European Union encouraged America to sign bilateral agreements. The Americans went mad with it and signed many more than anybody expected. Article 98 of the Rome Statue gives them that right. It states: &ldquo;The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the co-operation of that third State for the waiver of the immunity.&rdquo; The Americans have a technical legal argument that this entitles them to absolve themselves from the application of the court. What they have done is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Americans have anything to fear from the International Criminal Court and it would be enormously symbolic if America signed the statute. It would be beneficial for better relations between the European Union and the US. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>

	<P>When is the reshuffle?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>He must know more about it than we do. We will see who else turns up in the Chamber on the last sitting day.</P>
    <P>We have been a long time reaching this point with the International Criminal Court. Deputy <Col N="1990"/>Andrews is correct that it is not this Government&rsquo;s fault. The resolution was passed in 1948 when the UN General Assembly recognised that genocide inflicted great losses on humanity and stated that to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation would be required. In the same resolution, the General Assembly invited the International Law Commission to study the desirability and possibility of establishing an international judicial organ for the trial of persons charged with genocide. This was the early stage of the idea of establishing an international criminal court. It was later established under the Rome Statute on 17 July 1998 and ratified by Ireland in April 2002 and through a referendum in June.</P>
    <P>What took so long? I am not blaming the Irish Government, but it demonstrates how slowly business is conducted internationally. Another example is the new EU constitution. It was meant to be an informative handbook guide on how the EU works and to make it simple and accountable. What was the result? Three hundred and fifty pages of jargon which only a solicitor could read. The International Criminal Court took more than 50 years to be established while the new constitution for Europe is a massive, long document. We need to look at other ways of getting things done more quickly and clearly so people who are not politicians, solicitors or barristers can follow what is happening and take part in it. That is what will generate accountability and encourage people to become more involved.</P>
    <P>The referendum on the International Criminal Court was passed in 2001. I know more about the court now, after researching it for the past couple of days, than I did when I voted in the referendum. A high percentage of voters were in the same position. We are holding referenda without fully informing people or bringing them with us. That is how countries are doing their business. Something is wrong if it takes so long to establish something as important as the International Criminal Court. It is amazing.</P>
    <P>Fifty four years is a long time to wait but nobody thought that the horrors of the Second World War, the concentration camps, the exterminations and the Holocaust, could ever happen again. However, history has shown how such atrocities can continue to happen. One need only look to the horrors of Rwanda, Bosnia and Cambodia for recent occurrences of genocide and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately, such shocking actions on the part of individuals will probably never stop but we must do all in our power to help prevent them and, if they take place, to ensure justice is done. We cannot sit idly by and not take part.</P>
    <P>The message that needs to be sent to the perpetrators of these crimes is that Ireland, as part of a united world front, will no longer tolerate their actions. We will play our part in the administration of justice. They must know that they will be held to account for their actions and that no individual or group of people can carry out acts <Col N="1991"/>of violence and genocide against others. That is the reason I welcome this Bill and the establishment of the court. It is already up and running and I look forward to receiving the reports on its first cases.</P>
    <P>I recall standing in one of the concentration camps in east Berlin a number of years ago. It was only then I realised how serious it was. One can discuss this and read books, but standing in the concentration camp on a frosty, cold morning with my colleagues from the House was when the events that happened there hit home. The suffering and unnecessary pain should never have happened. We cannot prevent these things. No matter how good the Government is, it cannot prevent these things occurring. We must hope and pray they will not happen in massive numbers and that we can attempt to control and deal with them when they do occur.</P>
    <P>Ireland is seen internationally as a peacekeeping country which, through its role in the UN, assists countries in times of crisis. By introducing this law, we will accept a new role as a partner in investigating and prosecuting those who commit crimes against humanity. This role cannot be taken lightly. An important point in this Bill is that we will also accept that all state parties are potential defendants before the court. It is not just a case of the victors bringing the defeated parties in conflicts to justice, as happened in the past. In the past, when atrocities occurred, the winning party took control and administered justice by holding trials and so forth. It might also be those who came along and saved the day, generally those who were involved in sorting out the mess or ending the atrocities. It is only proper that we will now have a structure which is outside and above that process, which is fair and which no one can directly influence. Everyone knows how it will work and most countries have signed up to it. It will guarantee fairness and justice. There will be no doubt about the results coming forward because it will clearly be an independent court.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is necessary, it has some minor flaws which we should consider before it is passed. The first is the exclusion from the Bill of jurisdiction over crimes that occurred in the past. Genocide and crimes against humanity are already contrary to existing law. They should, therefore, be included as crimes under this Bill. It is my understanding of the Bill that it cannot deal retrospectively with crimes. If that is correct, what prevents it from doing so? This is a proactive attempt to administer justice. I do not, therefore, see why it could not apply to previous crimes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, moved Second Stage of this Bill in the House in May 2004. He stated that the Bill would enable assistance to be given to the International Criminal Court by permitting the arrest and surrender of persons requested by the court. Will that affect <Col N="1992"/>any of our current extradition agreements with other countries? Will these arrangements be compromised or replaced?</P>
    <P>I am dismayed that the United States of America has not signed up to the International Criminal Court. The United States is a supposed superpower in the global economy that often acts as a superbully in pursuit of its international policies. Why is it afraid to join with the rest of the law-abiding countries of the world in backing the International Criminal Court? Deputy Andrews suggested some reasons and said the US might be putting its case forward. Others will ask whether the Bush Administration is afraid of the court, given what is coming out of Iraq at the moment, and whether the United States is afraid it might have to appear before the court. Did the Taoiseach use his famous diplomatic skills of persuasion during the Irish Presidency of the European Union to try to persuade the United States to sign up to the court? Was it on the agenda? Was it discussed? I hope it was, but I would bet it was not. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs to be enacted and a message sent out that Ireland is not afraid to stand up and be counted when it comes to bringing those who commit crimes against humanity to justice. The case for the International Criminal Court is a simple one. It will be the first court to be established on a permanent international basis. It will be the first to be in existence prior to any conflict or war. That is extremely important and very proactive. The practice of setting up <i>ad hoc</i> committees or tribunals after a conflict arises or after an atrocity takes place is a bad one. It is not good enough in a modern age and often gives poor results and convictions that are questionable. The practice is reactive and cannot guarantee justice. There can be no doubts regarding the recommendations or convictions of a court of this magnitude. Everyone should know the rules of operation of the court which exists to protect and administer justice. It is only right to have a permanent structure. It is a pity some countries have chosen not to support it. I hope this will not affect its powers in the long term or the results, recommendations and feedback from the court when it investigates crimes.</P>
    <P>A ready-made existing structure should prevent unnecessary delays. Delays in the administration of justice are not acceptable because they can lead to mishaps. Documents can go missing. Even the people on trial can go missing or pass on. It is, therefore, important to be seen to move quickly when people are to be tried for crimes against humanity so that justice will be seen to be done. It can take months or even years to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee. I am not yet convinced as to how fast the International Criminal Court will work. It has been set up and is ready to go, but how quickly must it report?</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court will act only when countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute. What timescale will be involved in that <Col N="1993"/>context? If a country states that it intends to prosecute or investigate and sits back on its laurels, how long will it be before the International Criminal Court steps in to investigate? What will happen if it is believed a country carrying out an investigation has not done or is not trying to do a good job and is leaving stones unturned? Can the International Criminal Court take over in the absence of a fair result?</P>
    <P>What punishment can the court impose? If it intervenes in a country that has not asked for it to become involved and which was hoping to carry out its own investigation, who is responsible for imposing the punishments?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and urge everybody to support it. I will watch closely when the court reports on its first case. I wish all who are involved in its operation well. It was not easy to set it up. It took 55 years. I am sure it was not easy to get total agreement on it because many countries, including Ireland, had to make changes to their constitutions and give up certain areas of responsibility. It may also be difficult to run it and prove it successful. I hope justice will win. I understand that one of the 18 judges sitting on the court is an Irish judge and I wish her the best of luck. It is good that Ireland is so involved.</P>
    <P>Since we are debating crime, it would be remiss of me not to mention crime at home, although it has nothing to do with this Bill. Ireland has a problem with crime and we continually bury our heads in the sand and do nothing. People are afraid. It is not just elderly people but young people who are afraid to go out on their own, always travelling in twos or threes.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be moving quickly to solve the problem here. There is plenty of talk. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is well able to talk. He has all the answers and he sounds good. However, very little seems to be happening on the ground where it matters. I do not recall any Bills being passed here in the past 12 months that would make any difference to crime on the ground. That is a shame. We are here to react and solve problems that arise. We hardly ever fully debate crime or seek answers or results. We spent last year discussing alcohol and brought in one or two Mickey Mouse Bills which will not change anything. We have not got down to the nitty-gritty which involves not merely introducing new Bills but implementing new ideas and initiatives. The Budget Statement was devoted to the issue of decentralisation. A certain Minister did well out of that. I hope the next budget will home in on crime and health because crime can leave people in need of treatment.</P>
    <P>We have a problem which we cannot leave to one side. We must try new initiatives and put money into them. The drive to recruit 2,000 garda&iacute; will help. We will probably need 3,000 by the time they are recruited. We need movement, more garda&iacute; and other ways of solving crime. People of all ages are involved in crime. Some of these crimes are minor, but there are more serious crimes which involve beatings on the <Col N="1994"/>street after a night out. A greater fear of the law, of what will happen if one is caught, and an increase in the chance of being caught will help to prevent crime. Most people assume they can get away with crime because there is no one to catch them. They also feel that if they are caught they will get away with a slap on the wrist. Those are two perceptions that we need to change. What is required is action, not fancy words and jargon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2001 the people voted in a referendum to amend the Constitution to accept the provisions of the statute of the International Criminal Court. Its effect was also to reconcile our constitutional obligations with our obligations under the International Criminal Court and, consequently, the ceding of a degree of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice administration.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be welcomed. It is a landmark development, something that the world has needed for a very long time. I note that it has been ratified by the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s nations. This legislation is not before its time. It will enable us to co-operate with most countries in critical areas of investigating, arresting and extraditing alleged war criminals.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>As regards offences such as involvement in the arms trade and participation in war crimes and crimes against humanity, it is not inconceivable that large corporations could be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. Many large companies escaped prosecution in the aftermath of the Second World War. Instead, the emphasis was mainly on putting the leading individuals on trial at Nuremberg and Tokyo. International law in this area must be further developed so that criminal liability for collusion in war crimes, genocide or crimes against humanity can attach to corporations as well as mere individuals.</P>
    <P>The past century was one of the bloodiest in human history and at the end of it, on 17 July 1998, the world&rsquo;s first independent and permanent criminal court was created. Its primary aim was to investigate and prosecute those individuals accused of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. The International Criminal Court complements existing judicial systems and steps in only if national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes. The International Criminal Court will also help uphold the rights of those, such as women and children, who have often had little recourse to justice. In July 1998, 120 countries voted to adopt their own statutes, with only six countries voting against. Significantly, those voting against the establishment of the International Criminal Court included Israel, Iraq, the US and China. Nevertheless, the International Criminal Court is now a reality. It represents a turning point for justice and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>Ruthless leaders who committed far too many atrocities have calculated that they could get <Col N="1995"/>away with mass murder. Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are the two individuals who most readily come to mind. They still roam free with apparent impunity in the Republika Srpska, the Serbian state within a state that is part of Bosnia Herzegovina. The wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia introduced the phrase &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo; into our vocabulary in the final decade of the 20th century. Nine years have passed since the slaughter at Srebrenica, the scene of the worst massacre of the Bosnian war, and in Europe, since the Second World War. Srebrenica was a so-called UN safe area where tens of thousands of civilians had taken refuge from Serb offensives in north-east Bosnia. Yet it was overrun in July 1995 by Serb forces. That in excess of 8,000 men and boys could be slaughtered wholesale was virtually unthinkable more than 50 years after the Holocaust.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, after six years of painstaking research, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia determined that genocide had occurred and sentenced Bosnian Serb general Radoslav Krstic to 46 years on eight counts of genocide and crimes against humanity. However, the sad and shocking truth remains that most of the perpetrators of human rights violations at Srebrenica remain unpunished. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the Rwanda tribunal have given momentum to and paved the way for the drive to establish a permanent, independent international criminal court empowered to act when national courts fail. Whatever a ruthless leader may do to undermine his own national justice system, the International Criminal Court will stand ready to prosecute his acts of violence or interrupt his plans for immunity.</P>
    <P>The Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court is a tremendous advance for the cause of human rights, and it comes not a moment too soon. After the hopes of &ldquo;Never again war&rdquo; were shattered in Croatia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia, East Timor and, latterly, Iraq, after slaughter and atrocities in many countries around the world, a court has finally been established that stands ready to prosecute and sentence the authors of those crimes anywhere in the world. The International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Irish citizens in the territories of Governments that ratify the Rome treaty. It can also try any individual responsible for such crimes, regardless of his or her civilian or military status or official position, right up to a country&rsquo;s leaders. In addition to prisoners and combatants captured in conflict, generals and heads of state can also be brought to book for the types of crimes that fall within the International Criminal Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The statute contains a detailed list of the rights that any accused person shall enjoy, including the presumption of innocence, the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, the right to remain <Col N="1996"/>silent, and the right to have charges proven beyond reasonable doubt. The complementarity principle would apply, giving the state the primary responsibility and duty to prosecute the most serious international crimes. If a national court were not willing or able to bring a case against someone accused of those crimes, it would be necessary to have an international forum to do so. It would allow the International Criminal Court to step in only as a last resort if the state failed to implement its duty, that is, only if appropriate investigations or prosecutions had not been carried out in good faith. Bona fide efforts to discover the truth and hold accountable those responsible for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes would bar the International Criminal Court from proceeding.</P>
    <P>There is an overriding need to ensure that the International Criminal Court upholds the highest standards of fairness and justice. There is also an urgent need to redress today&rsquo;s atrocities and deter tomorrow&rsquo;s would-be killers. The 18 judges elected include people of unimpeachable integrity, including Ms Maureen Harding Clark, formerly of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and an Irish judge of very high repute.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court is under very considerable challenge, particularly from the US, which refused to ratify the Rome Statute setting up the international court. The US regards its justice system as infallible, refusing to subject its citizens to enforceable international standards. That opposition to the International Criminal Court seems strange since the US firmly pressed for the setting up of tribunals in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. It also held war criminals individually responsible for their actions through the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals after the Second World War, which were dominated by the Americans. That could be regarded as the victor&rsquo;s justice, doing nothing to alter the cycle of killing and revenge.</P>
    <P>The US has labelled the International Criminal Court as an institution of unchecked power, a charge that is patently untrue. The US frequently blasts other countries for human rights violations and often supports war crimes prosecutions against other countries&rsquo; leaders. In the case of Iraq, it initiated such prosecutions against Saddam Hussein and other members of his ruling council. However, at the same time, it failed to acknowledge that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. It seeks to immunise US leaders from war crimes prosecutions entirely, irrespective of what they may do.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court is accountable to an assembly of member states but chooses its prosecutors and judges and can vote to have them removed. Unsurprisingly, the court consists predominantly of democratic states deeply committed to the values on which it was founded. Equally unsurprisingly, the world&rsquo;s worst violators of human rights have declined to join the court. The Bush Administration also announced <Col N="1997"/>that it would withhold military aid from most ICT member states unless they first signed formal agreements never to extradite US citizens to the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. That is a punitive policy against countries that have pledged to prevent human rights abuses and atrocities and that endeavour to protect their inhabitants from those crimes. It is also threatening that, unless its armed forces receive guarantees of immunity, it will veto extending the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and perhaps in other places too. For the International Criminal Court to hold perpetrators of human rights accountable is not merely about securing justice and truth for victims but about preventing future crimes from occurring.</P>
    <P>Repressive regimes are rewarded by becoming beneficiaries of the largesse of US military assistance. This amounts to a cynical undermining by the United States of an international effort to protect basic human rights. It also sends the unfortunate message around the world that there is one standard of justice for Americans and another for everyone else. Such haughty foolishness makes the world a less safe place, even for Americans.</P>
    <P>The ideological antipathy of the United States to the International Criminal Court which it fears might focus on an American has inspired its dislike of any international tribunal. The manner in which the United States Government has treated Afghan and Iraqi prisoners in Guantanamo Bay puts it outside the pale of civilised treatment of prisoners, and displays an utter disregard for the norms of international law.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court needs careful stewardship, attention, resources and support during its critical formative period. The establishment in this new century of a new international institution dedicated to protecting people against violation of their human rights is a remarkable achievement in the progress of humankind. Our Government&rsquo;s ratification of the Rome Statute and the passing of the referendum approving this is typical of our respect for human rights. I am happy to welcome this Bill without reservation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. The various comments on it have been interesting. As democrats we must support its contents but the success or failure of the concept remains to be seen. Unfortunately, despots do not take account of what might become of them. They judge a situation as they see it. Recent crises, such as those in Rwanda and Sudan, which remain fresh in our memory are sufficient to remind us of how despots feel about international courts. The success of this internationally desirable and acceptable legislation will be determined by the extent to which it becomes a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The Nuremberg war crimes trials were no consolation to the 60 million who died in the concentration camps and elsewhere in the Second World War. While it would be good to know that an international criminal court could interrogate and <Col N="1998"/>try the perpetrators of the attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001 that might not be a sufficient deterrent to those people. I and others have spoken often in this House about people who have chosen, in pursuit of their own goal, to eliminate, literally and figuratively, innocent people with no direct involvement in their cause. I remain to be convinced of the effectiveness of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>It appears that the trial of Slobodan Milosevic and his colleagues is proceeding well but I am concerned about his attitude to the court which he treats as the Colosseum where he takes on the assembled forces of all those whom he regards as evil. He is setting about to prove his case and, worse, to validate the events in Serbia, including the execution of 8,000 people in Srebrenica. Although it is not often remembered, the United Nations was there at the time and was unable to do anything about that. The comment was made here that the Dutch Government had to resign afterwards. I doubt that was a consolation to the 8,000 people who died, coming after the event, as so often happens. The success or failure of international criminal trials as envisaged in this legislation will depend on the extent to which it becomes a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I have tabled countless parliamentary questions about the developing world and the destination of overseas aid. I read recently of one leader who, shortly after receiving a considerable international donation of development aid, turned up in a brand new plane worth &euro;35 million. Meanwhile, there was no sign of that aid entering the economy of his country. We must find a way to deal starkly with people who disregard human life and rights, and care only for the pursuit of their own selfish ends. This might be used to teach them beforehand that if they pursue that route, there will be swift retribution.</P>
    <P>The question arises of how to deal with that. Deputies have argued that there are two sides to the war in Iraq, and US involvement in it. There was no great outcry following the attack on the World Trade Centre, which was not condemned as an atrocity. We all, as politicians and members of the public, tend to accept some atrocities on the basis that there was a reason for them or that they were perpetrated in retaliation for something. If we continue in that fashion we will reach the point where there is no purpose in having international criminal law or courts because they will mean nothing. The result is the criminal or despot will believe himself or herself to be no worse than anyone else in pursuing what appears to be his or her natural way of life. Saddam Hussein was one of those who thought nothing of executing 500,000 people for his convenience, by chemical methods or whatever. We tend to forget about these events afterwards.</P>
    <P>How would the International Criminal Court have dealt with Adolf Hitler had it sat in Nuremberg when his cohorts were tried? It probably would have ordered his execution. That would have been of no consolation to those against <Col N="1999"/>whom the atrocities were perpetrated, including those in the concentration camps, and who were mercilessly slaughtered in the course of Hitler&rsquo;s push for power and in his retreat.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has come before the House and I would like to hear his comments on this issue in the not too distant future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy gives way I will comment on it now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt it. However, I would not want to overload the schedule of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights which will be obliged to deal with 14 or 15 Bills during the recess. It will, therefore, be well occupied.</P>
    <P>The concept of the International Criminal Court is fine but we must accept that it can only act after the event. It is like the old story about crime, namely, that we have means of punishing people if we catch them. It is in that context that international despots seem to get away with what they have done.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what happened in Rwanda or current events in Sudan. The most awful atrocities are occurring in the latter country and the unfortunate people there are starving. These atrocities and the starvation being suffered have been largely brought about by a war over which these people have no control and in which they have no wish to be involved. These events are happening when our so-called sophisticated and alert society is supposed to be in a position to take action. We are able to do very little, even at this stage.</P>
    <P>I will not have adequate time in which to comment on the various matters I wish to raise. However, I would like the Minister to indicate, in anticipation of the successful application of the International Criminal Court, the steps the international community will be able to take to put in place measures that will intimidate the perpetrators of evil before they act. There may be some possibility of intimidating these individuals on a national level but I have serious doubts about whether it will be possible at international level. The concept behind the Bill is good. I attended the hearings in the Hague and I was quite impressed. However, as I stated before the Minister entered the House, a certain Mr. Milosevic is not as impressed or intimidated by the courts as were some of those people who appeared before them previously.</P>
    <P>In order for a court of this nature to be successful, it must observe the rights of individuals under the law. People who are accused will not need any encouragement in this regard and they will ensure their rights are observed. They will go through the legislation with a fine tooth comb in order to ensure that not one of their rights will be trampled upon in any way. This will be despite the fact that they will have probably spent the <Col N="2000"/>earlier part of their lives trampling on the rights of others. I am sure they will resume that behaviour if they manage to get away with what they did previously. I hope the Minister will refer to this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>This is a substantial item of legislation which will allow the court to operate across countless boundaries. It will bring the entire concept of breaches of human rights into an arena in which, I hope, some form of retribution can be delivered. However, it will do little in terms of acting as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to continue my contribution because I had a number of further anecdotes I wanted to recount. However, time is against me and I know the Minister is anxious to refer the Bill to the select committee which I presume is anxious to deal with it, even though it has approximately ten other Bills with which it must deal. It would not be fair to ask the House to sit for a further week to go through the legislation in finer detail.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies on all sides for their contributions. The breadth of the exchanges that this wide-ranging measure has provoked is an indication of the potential contribution of the International Criminal Court in protecting those who often have no voice from the most heinous crimes.</P>
    <P>The opening contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, recalled the difficult birth of the Rome Statute and the many atrocities which occurred from 1948, when the idea of an international court was first raised, to 2002, when the statute came into effect. Enactment of this legislation will ensure that Ireland can comply with its obligations under the Rome Statute and co-operate with the International Criminal Court in ensuring that those responsible for such atrocities can no longer escape punishment for their offences.</P>
    <P>Unlike previous tribunals, the Rome Statue could potentially apply to any state party. While we may consider that the statute would never be applied to Ireland, its very existence and our obligations to the International Criminal Court will ensure that we will not become complacent in our dealings with these offences. The Bill provides for the new offences of war crimes and crimes against humanity and consolidates the offence of geno<Col N="2001"/>cide under the Genocide Act 1972, while, at the same time, establishing the practical framework for providing assistance to the International Criminal Court and for the prosecution of offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the protection of human rights. I have no doubt that the jurisprudence of this court, as it develops, will fully respect human rights and that the court will, in its procedures, vindicate the rights of those who are tried before it as well as the rights of victims in respect of whom prosecutions are brought.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello queried the number of signatories to the convention. It was stated during the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening contribution that 94 states had signed the statute. That is now understood to be 139, with 94 of these having ratified the statute.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made a number of suggestions regarding possible amendments to the Bill. Some of these, while worthy of consideration in their own right, go beyond the objective of the Bill, namely, the implementation of the Rome Statute. I do not doubt that the select committee in its wisdom will consider the text of the Bill carefully in order to discover if it requires amendment. I will be open to accepting any appropriate amendments.</P>
    <P>I again thank Deputies for their contributions and for the research they undertook in respect of those contributions. I look forward to the Bill being brought before the select committee in due course. As far as I am concerned, Deputy Durkan is correct to state that the committee is facing a very heavy workload. On the other hand, however, members of the public are looking to us not merely to become signatories to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court but also to bring it into effect. I know I will have all-party support in bringing the deliberations on the legislation to an early conclusion.</P>

     <Quest>the details of all aspects of the regime and practice, including any special privileges or treatment, applicable to the day to day life of the persons imprisoned in respect of the killing of a person (details supplied) in Castlerea; the way in which that regime and practice, privileges and treatment differs from that applicable to other persons detained in Castlerea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20857/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The prisoners referred to by the Deputy are detained in the area of Castlerea prison known as the Grove. The regime applicable to these prisoners is the same as that applied to the other 36 prisoners detained in the Grove area of Castlerea Prison.</P>
    <P>The prisoners detained in the Grove must remain inside their accommodation between the hours of 10.30 p.m. and 8 a.m. They are generally free to move around this enclosed area during the other hours of the day and can avail of facilities, including visiting units, a communal kitchen and dining hall, a recreation hall and gym, an education unit and workshops and an outdoor recreation area. Education classes are generally available from 10 a.m. to 12 noon and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Workshops in this area are generally open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>A high level of trust is placed in each prisoner to conform to the rules of the unit without close supervision. While the regime is not strict in the conventional meaning, the prisoners are held in secure custody. The area is surrounded by perimeter walls, is covered by CCTV and is supervised by prison staff at all times. In addition, there are rules and regulations which have to be adhered to, for example, each house is subject to random searches by prison staff.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister set out the regime applicable to those who are in Castlerea Prison, including the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe. That is the most heinous crime for which anybody could be incarcerated. It has been suggested that they are in receipt of preferential treatment above and beyond the fact that they are in the Grove part of the prison. They are lording it over other prisoners and set down their own rules and regulations as to who may be in their company. They insist that any food cooked for them is not cooked by certain categories of prisoner, for example, those convicted of drugs charges. They do not allow anybody convicted of such charges to work in their immediate vicinity. In addition, on a daily basis they fax down their <Col N="2003"/>requirements to the local shop and these are delivered to them. Is that correct and, if so, is it applicable to other prisoners in our prisons? Does the Minister not accept that this is preferential treatment? Why should people who are in prison for such a heinous crime receive this preferential treatment? I cannot think of anything worse than the killing in cold blood of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe these people are held on substantially the same terms as other prisoners. Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe said they tend to be clannish and exclusionary in their dealings with other prisoners. In an area of free association and dissociation, it is not possible to force prisoners to interact with each other. The regime, effectively, allows groups or sub-groups within the Grove to stick to themselves if that is their desire.</P>
    <P>The Grove consists of seven separate houses where inmates live in a domestic type environment. In total, there are 40 prisoners, including 11 provisional IRA prisoners, two INLA prisoners and 27 non-aligned prisoners. Some of the descriptions of the basic accommodation in this area give a misleading impression of luxury and tend to ignore the reality that the inmates there, as elsewhere in the prison system, are behind prison walls and in secure custody.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about purchasing goods. I am told it is not true that prisoners are entitled to order takeaway food. I understand that from 1973 a regime existed in Portlaoise Prison which enabled prisoners belonging to the provisional movement to avail of the finances of a group called Cumann Cabhrach to purchase what is, effectively, tuck. Items are submitted for purchase on the basis that an officer would make purchases from local shops from time to time where that does not involve inordinate time or inconvenience. Any material or goods ordered into the prison are subject to the normal rules and regulations in place for good order and security.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My main concern is the impact of preferential treatment for these killers on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and prison staff. It was a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who was mercilessly gunned down by these people. The prison staff are witnessing a situation where, in many ways, these prisoners are lording it over other prisoners. Surely the impact of that is obvious.</P>
    <P>I am assured that up to relatively recently a prison officer was sent down to the local shop every day with the prisoners&rsquo; orders but that has now been changed to a situation where they fax their order to the local shop which then delivers to them. I am also assured that it is not a question of them sticking to themselves, they actually lay down restrictions to the effect that other prisoners who are there for far less serious offences, especially those convicted of drugs or sex offences, are not permitted to have any hand, act or part in the cooking of their food or allowed to <Col N="2004"/>work in the same vicinity. Does the Minister accept that this is not a good state of affairs, that it is generally bad for morale and, in particular, that it is bad for the morale of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for the reasons I described, and for the prison staff in Castlerea Prison.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that the situation which obtains in the Grove is one which I inherited. I have not improved or disimproved it in any way. The morale of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is high. I deplore the incident in which a number of Members of this House and members of another Parliament posed for a photograph with the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe. The photograph subsequently appeared in a newspaper. That was a deeply insulting occasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. Why did the Minister allow it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not permitted. The particular event has not recurred and will not recur. It amounted to an abuse by those Members of this House of the rules of the prison and I condemn their behaviour roundly.</P>
    <P>There is rank hypocrisy in people prating on in this House about human rights and posing with people who took the life of an innocent member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na going about his duty and leaving his wife a widow. It is not simply a matter of Garda morale, it is a matter of national morale. The conduct of Members of this House has an effect on national morale and this incident betokens a complete and total hypocrisy in standards on the part of those Members.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed at the impact of the prohibition on persons under 18 being in pubs after 9 p.m.; if he has received representations to have this matter reviewed; if he intends to undertake such a review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20861/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which substitutes a new section for section 34 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, generally prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from being in the bar of licensed premises, but not from being in any other part of a licensed premises. A licensee may, however, permit a child, that is a person under the age of 15 years, to be in the bar if the child is accompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m. A licensee may also permit a person aged between 15 and 17 to be in the bar unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m. Naturally, they cannot be served alcohol.</P><Col N="2005"/>
    <P>Section 14 also provides that a licensee may allow a child accompanied by a parent or guardian, or a person aged between 15 and 17, to be in the bar after 9 p.m. on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the restrictions set out in section 14 of the 2003 Act apply to the bar and not to other parts of licensed premises. People who are now talking about setting up separate rooms for smokers in their premises might reflect on the fact that they appear to have been incapable of setting up a separate partitioned area in their premises for parents and children to enjoy meals after 9 p.m. I wonder whether we are listening to a lot of guff on this subject that is purely driven by profit and not by any common sense distinction. This means persons under the age of 18 years may be in parts of licensed premises other than the bar after 9 p.m. In the case of hotels, they can be in every part of the hotel and in the company of their parents even though their parents are consuming alcohol in any part of those premises other than the bar of the hotel after 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 14 are fully in line with recommendations both of the commission on liquor licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol. They take account of the need to facilitate families while at the same time promoting compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws. The restrictions are not solely motivated by enforcement concerns. The strategic task force on alcohol recommended restrictions because it felt the presence of children in bars exposed them at an early age to a form of alcohol promotion, which was unnecessary and potentially damaging to them and which undermined the aim of better health for children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Minister that this is not guff; it is real. The Minister is correct and was supported by my party in targeting the abuse of alcohol by those who are under age. However, a real issue will affect families on their summer holidays. I go to Dingle for the month of August and will do so this year. The area where I go has no hotel. As the Minister knows, throughout the Ring of Kerry, in west Cork and Galway where people rent houses to take their children for three weeks or a month, the only place such families can have a meal is on licensed premises. Many such places have a window of opportunity of perhaps three or four months in the year and are not in a position to provide a separate room.</P>
    <P>While it is too late for this season, during the school holidays the family should be permitted to have their meals in such places. I am not talking about big towns but small areas many of which could not be called villages, mainly by the sea. The only place people can get some food is on licensed premises. Many families are on a budget and while we know Ireland is not a cheap destination, we are trying to encourage people. Many <Col N="2006"/>families go to pubs because they are perceived to be cheaper than hotels. While I agree with the Minister that we must be very concerned about under age drinking, what I am discussing will not lead to that. When we were younger and our parents took us away in a caravan or whatever, we went to a place where music was played and 99.9% of us did not end up as alcoholics or with a drink problem because our parents were with us.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I raised my concerns and the Minister advised that the vintners were not lobbying for this, probably because they were caught up in the haze of the smoking ban at that stage. I know the hoteliers lobbied the Minister and I asked him whether he had received representations to have the matter reviewed. Bearing in mind the picture I have outlined, the Minister should review the matter and make a change just for June, July and August.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the near future I hope to introduce a major consolidating Bill to consolidate all the law relating to licensing for the sale of alcohol. In that context I will consider positively any measure that makes common sense. However, common sense must be built into any proposal that might be introduced. While addressing a hotel in Dingle we must also address a hotel in Temple Bar. While addressing a small hotel we must also address a large hotel. While addressing a one-room pub we must also address a super pub.</P>
    <P>If we can have a law to allow children to remain on licensed premises in the company of their parents without creating the equally unacceptable situation where garda&iacute; would enter a hotel in Dublin find 17 year olds propped up against the bar and be given the excuse that their parents are elsewhere in the hotel, I would like to see it. However, when this issue arose in the 2003 legislation and since, no one has proposed a workable way to distinguish between the small bar or hotel in Dingle and the big bar or hotel in Dublin, which would allow a garda go to the owner of licensed premises with a 17 year old at 10 p.m. and find out whether the owner asked for identification and why the 17 year old is on the premises.</P>
    <P>If somebody can propose a common sense solution, I would be the first to grab it. However, I have not heard it proposed yet. For all of the resources available to hoteliers and vintners, they have not been able to make a proposal as to how the seasonal issue which the Deputy mentions can be married with the need to stop under age drinking.</P>
    <P>Before the introduction of the 2003 Act, I was visited by a woman from the west whose under age daughter was found unfortunately dead in a ditch beside the road, having been served in a pub while her parents were away on holidays. She pleaded with me to do something to prevent that happening again. The only practical way of enforcing the evidence of age cards is to ban under age persons during some hours from the <Col N="2007"/>bars of licensed premises. If someone can make a common sense proposal that marries what the Deputy wishes to see and the requirements of a generally operable law, I would be the first to grab that opportunity if it were placed before me. I have not seen it yet and it is not for want of effort on my part to think out solutions that would be workable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to hear that the Minister is willing to listen. Last August in the good weather some people did not leave the beach until 7 o&rsquo;clock or 8 o&rsquo;clock, which gives very little time to get something to eat. I suggest the Minister should extend the time limit to 10 p.m. in June, July in August to give people time to eat their meals. I abhor celebrations like holy communions and christenings being pub orientated. I am talking about food and providing a service for families. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s difficulty. If the time limit was changed for the summer we could revert to 9 p.m. for the rest of the year. The same problem does not arise during Christmas holidays, only in summer.</P>

	<P>I will consider this in the context of the forthcoming legislation if we get around to considering it. By the way, when I said &ldquo;guff&rdquo;, the guff to which I objected referred to owners claiming they could not adapt their pubs to install a glazed partition for a special room adjacent to the bar in which children and their parents could eat. However, when smokers came lurking on the horizon, they claimed it would be very easy to subdivide premises to allow a smoking area. What was so difficult in the context of food became so easy in the context of smoke and I regard that as guff.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>the details of the criteria used in the nomination and appointment of members of the Judiciary; and if he has plans to review the present system.</Quest>
     <QRef>[21215/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established pursuant to the Court and Courts Officers Act 1995. The purpose of the board, simply put, is to identify persons and inform the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment to judicial office. By definition, the board&rsquo;s remit is advisory and the ultimate decision as regards appointments of persons to the Judiciary rests with the Government.</P>
    <P>The board consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, nominated representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society and three lay persons nominated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Section 14 of the Act enables the board to adopt such procedures as it thinks fit to carry out its <Col N="2008"/>functions. In practice, the board places advertisements for applications for judicial appointments in the national press and requires applicants to complete a detailed application form which includes questions on their practice, their professional qualifications, education, character etc.</P>
    <P>Under section 16 of the Act, where a judicial office stands vacant or before a vacancy in a judicial office arises, the board, at the request of the Minister, submits to the Minister the names of all persons who have informed the board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment to that judicial office and the names of at least seven persons whom it recommends for appointment. With one exception, since the Act came into operation, persons have been appointed on foot of the recommendation from the board. In the sole exception where it did not happen, the person had been previously recommended and it was not possible in the unique circumstances of the case to go through the advertising process on a second occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government, when advising the President on the appointment of a person to a judicial office, must first consider persons who have been recommended by the board. It is important to note that the board cannot submit nor recommend the name of a person unless that person meets the eligibility criteria set out by law for the post in question.</P>
    <P>The board cannot recommend the name of any person unless, in the opinion of the board, the person concerned has displayed in his or her practice as a solicitor or barrister a degree of competence and probity appropriate to and consistent with the appointment concerned, is suitable on grounds of character and temperament, is otherwise suitable for appointment, complies with the provisions on taxation and undertakes to undergo training. Those are the criteria by which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Boards operates. It gives a shortlist to the Government, from which the Government selects.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister consider bringing forward proposals to depoliticise the appointment procedure for judges? This would certainly remove the perception of political bias in their selection. I accept that in most cases the Government has taken the recommendations of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and given them to the President. If that is the case, why not remove the politicisation of the office of judge? In many countries the judicial appointments body is independent of Government. I think that would increase the stature of the judges we appoint.</P>
    <P>Why not look at countries such as the Netherlands where half of the judges are appointed straight from college? Young graduates would be appointed and I believe they would be a fantastic addition to the way in which the Judiciary operates. We would benefit from an examination of what goes on abroad. The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board puts forward names to Government, which does not necessarily take <Col N="2009"/>those recommendations on board. I suggest the stature of the Judiciary would increase if the perception of the taint of political bias were removed. There are good examples as to how that can be done if we were to look abroad.</P>
    <P>It makes sense to have the Presidency the Judiciary and the Legislature separate in so far as we can. I am at a loss to understand the reason we demean the Judiciary by putting them through this process of political vetting. I hope the Minister will consider other means of appointment. I accept that judges must be competent, have a degree of probity appropriate to the office, be of good character and temperament, but I suspect we might recruit better judges if the selection body was removed from political influence.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The common law system throughout the world has a different concept of the Judiciary from the civil law system referred to by the Deputy. In the common law system, the Judiciary has much more power than the Judiciary in civil law systems, their function is different, they are neither investigative nor prosecutorial in any shape or form and they are not career public servants. They are people chosen, usually in their mature years, on the basis of carrying out an arbitral role, which is quite different from the civil law system of investigative magistracy.</P>
    <P>One of the strengths of the common law system worldwide is jury trial, which is another form of independent arbitral justice. No country with jury trial has ever succumbed to internal tyranny, whereas all the great tyrannies of the world have emerged in countries which have had the civil law system, which is an interesting historical fact. One of the great strengths of our Constitution is the significantly important role that we accord to the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Constitution also provides that it is the Executive which nominates the Judiciary and that is common to common law systems. Under the Constitution, the Government of the day advises the President to appoint people to be judges. Without a constitutional amendment, that right must remain vested in the Executive. The days of party political appointments are over and if one looks at the pattern of appointment in recent years, one will see the previous pattern, which existed a long time ago, of party political appointments has, largely speaking, come to the end. That is a good move. It is good that Government chooses people who are known to it to be supporters of Opposition parties for appointment to the Bench. I am happy with that pattern. If one checks the recent record, one will find that has happened more frequently now than ever before.</P>
    <P>I am not attracted to a clone of the civil law system. We could have much more politicised appointments of judges, such as happens in the USA where every judge is the subject of an intensive mangling process in which the Houses of Congress sometimes examine in great detail everything to do with the judge, and quite politi<Col N="2010"/>cal considerations come into play as to the outlook of the judge and so on. I do not think that is a desirable model to follow.</P>

     <Quest>his views on and if he proposes to implement the proposals contained in the final report of the Garda SMI implementation steering group to downgrade five divisional Garda headquarters and up to 30 district Garda headquarters; the way in which and when he intends to proceed with this; if he has identified possible locations for downgrading; the details of the factors that will be taken into account in making such decisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20858/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategic management initiative in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been under way since 1997 and a great deal of work has been done. Far-reaching recommendations in a previous Garda SMI report on performance and accountability have been included in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill which is before the Seanad. The current report is the final one of the Garda SMI implementation steering group. It deals with important aspects of the organisation and structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I believe it will inform the Garda Commissioner in the kind of strategic planning envisaged for the Garda organisation when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>In compiling this report, a lengthy process of consultation was undertaken by the Garda SMI implementation steering group and a related review group. This was an inclusive, consultative process, involving Garda management, the Garda representative associations, officials of interested Departments and outside consultants. Their task was to give advice and make recommendations as to how the challenging and wide-ranging proposals for change and enhanced efficiency in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which were made in an earlier report of the 1997 steering group, could be translated into reality.</P>
    <P>The Garda SMI report makes recommendations on the reorganisation of Garda regions, divisions and districts throughout the country, including the reduction of the number of regions by one, the number of divisions by five and the number of districts by between 20 and 32. The Government and I have made no decision on this or any other proposal in the report. In this and many other aspects of the report, the Garda Commissioner, under the terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform, and I believe that this report will be of considerable assistance to the Garda Commissioner in that task.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minster accept that these proposals, if implemented, will involve substantial downgrading of Garda headquarters throughout the country? The number of div<Col N="2011"/>isional headquarters, where a chief superintendent is stationed, will be reduced from 22 to 17 and the district headquarters, which I understand number approximately 130, could be reduced to fewer than 100.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Does the Minister recognise the bond that exists in cities, towns and villages throughout the country between the people and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na? Does he not see that, if this proposal is implemented, contact between the Garda and communities will be diminished? Will he agree that the theory behind this proposal is to centralise the Garda in Dublin and throughout rural areas? We could end up in the position where people&rsquo;s only contact with the Garda would be in situations of conflict and this is the wrong approach. The Minister appears to be adopting a Pontius Pilate reaction to the report in that he implies it will be for the Garda Commissioner to implement. Has he any stance on the issues I have raised?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do have a stance that reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is definitely needed. I do not accept the proposition that the distribution of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has much to do with the 19th century distribution of the RIC in Ireland, rather than 21st century conditions and circumstances, needs to be reformed. I have no problem in saying that. Likewise, our changing demographics will clearly have implications for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The fact that our population is becoming increasingly urbanised and that the numbers are rising, are issues which require a response in terms of the organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, lest it be forgotten, its size. That is why it is necessary to increase the size of the force.</P>
    <P>It is not a Pontius Pilate act on my behalf. I am bringing forward legislation in the Oireachtas which has been broadly welcomed in which day-to-day management and control will be vested in a tangible way in the Commissioner, on the basis of statute. At present, under the 1924 legislation the distribution of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, theoretically, still a matter for my decision. I do not believe that giving the Minister of the day the right to move Garda resources from this town to that town, as envisaged in the 1920s, is the proper way to run a police force. It is important to keep the Garda away from political interference. This House would be the first to raise its collective eyebrows, if I were suddenly to announce that garda&iacute; should be transferred from, say, Cork to Limerick or from Limerick to Dublin or <i>vice versa</i> on the basis of my judgment of the situation instead of on the good, reflective policy making of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The slimming down of some Garda branches does not have implications for the large numbers of garda&iacute; across the country. I believe the coming weeks will show it is vitally necessary to have a proper chain of command and accountability within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="2012"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not talking about day-to-day matters when discussing the downgrading of Garda stations. As regards the size of the force, I am surprised the Minister even mentions it since that was the greatest con job of the last election. We are still missing the 2,000 garda&iacute;. If these proposals are implemented, will that not have an enormous impact on the opening hours of stations? The only stations with assured 24-hour opening will be the 17 divisional headquarters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not deal with the first two points because the Deputy will have his reply soon enough. On his point about Garda stations, I would like to inform the Deputy that in the Dublin metropolitan region, at any given time there are 34 sergeants and 60 garda&iacute; engaged in station office duties. When rostering is taken into account, that means 177 sergeants and 312 garda&iacute; are permanently allotted to station duties in the Dublin area. In some cases many of them might be better deployed on the streets or doing core Garda policing functions outside the station.</P>

	<P>He could hit four Garda stations with a good drive from that area. All of those stations have to be manned at night. They must all have the complement of garda&iacute; I have just mentioned attached to them. We must change a little. There is no point in pretending that everything must remain the same. However, I agree with the Deputy that we have to maintain the strong links between the ordinary people and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We cannot have a Garda service which is provided by commuting garda&iacute; at a great distance from the community they serve. We must strive to maintain the links between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the community in which it is based and within which it is working.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not yet possible to provide accurate estimated costs of the security arrangements for the recent visit of the US President. I do not want to give inaccurate information. It is worth pointing out, however, that the visit by President Bush was important, both nationally and in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s successful Presidency of the European Union. Accordingly, any costs involved should be considered to be part of the normal expenditure required for Ireland to maintain its national and international obligations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the United States and the European Union.</P>
    <P>The extent of the operation which was put in place for the presidential visit to Ireland by the Irish security forces, both Army and Garda, is equivalent to the commitment that would have been made by any other member state of the European Union. It was not excessive in the circumstances and is what would have been expected by the people.</P>
    <P>In case the Deputy might think I am evading the question of the magnitude of the expenditure, it will run to several million euro. I imagine it will be between &euro;3 million and &euro;5 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

	<P>It is Deputy Costello&rsquo;s priority question.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a ridiculous answer. I read in a newspaper article the specific amounts given in reply to Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe last week. I already had this question down. The Minister is not even able to give me provisional amounts here. He gave the blandest answer one could possibly imagine. He has given no indication of the costs of this operation and no information regarding the number of garda&iacute; involved.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister read the question? I asked for a number of things. Can he give answers? I asked for the estimated cost as regards security arrangements and the number of Garda personnel involved. That would surely not be a matter that would have taken long to put together. This would have been known before the President&rsquo;s visit. I believe there was an answer on that.</P>
    <P>I asked about Garda hours involved in the operation, the level of disruption and the number of arrests made. It is not good enough that nearly a month later the Minister is not able to tell the House the number of arrests made. He simply has not answered the question. I am totally dissatisfied with that answer. It has avoided the question, <Col N="2014"/>no effort was made and there is nothing specific in the Minister&rsquo;s answer.</P>
    <P>These are priority questions, after all, but the Minister has not given us a priority answer. Was the visit not something of a photo opportunity? When one considers that President Bush went to bed almost as soon as he arrived in Shannon, were the arrangements not somewhat farcical? It was really a sleep-over for the President on his way to the NATO summit. The main photograph that emerged from the event was of the President in his underwear. The Minister is unable to give me details of the security arrangements, such as how much they cost, what the numbers were, how many people were arrested and the amount of disruption that was caused. I am seeking such answers. Was the entire visit not manipulated by the President to get a nice cosy photo opportunity for his presidential re-election campaign?</P>

	<P>The Deputy read the answer I gave Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe. Does he want me to repeat myself constantly in the House? Approximately 3,800 garda&iacute; were involved in the security arrangements. I have not received a more accurate estimate of the Garda man-hours involved than that on which the provisional figures I gave Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe last week was based. I inform Deputy Costello that seven arrests were made during the Garda operation, which was much less than had been provided for in the contingency arrangements. The Deputy knows that a warehouse facility adjacent to the airport was designated as a temporary Garda station in case more arrests were made. A small number of arrests was made, happily. The proceedings at Shannon were peaceful and amicable, generally speaking.</P>

   <?oasys _cp10,10.7-?><Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister could have provided that minimum level of information when he gave his initial reply. He has informed the House that 3,800 garda&iacute; made seven arrests. He referred to the provisional figures. Why did he not give such details at the outset, instead of saying that he did not have figures? Does the Minister think that a fair balance was struck between the rights of local citizens in the Shannon area, who suffered a certain amount of disruption, and the security requirements? A warehouse was opened up and many garda&iacute; were employed but there was no trouble, as far as I can gather. Given the level of disruption and inconvenience that was caused, does the Minister think that the attitude of the State was excessive or heavy-handed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe the State&rsquo;s response was disproportionate. If I had ignored the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s advice about the appropriate level of security, or said on financial grounds that I would not grant him the resources he sought as necessary for the proper policing of the occasion, and there had then been different scenes and a different outcome at Shannon &mdash; if there had been a major collapse in public order, for example &mdash; I would be accused of personal culpability. I do not agree that most people in the Shannon region have a negative view of the summit that was held there recently. It was successful in that the names of Shannon and Dromoland Castle were broadcast internationally. The general ambience came across positively in the media. The local economy will benefit as a result in the fullness of time. International name recognition is very important.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if he has received the report of the senior Garda officer who has been requested by the Garda Commissioner to examine all matters featured in a television programme (details supplied) of 8 January 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20720/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously informed the House that a senior Garda officer had been appointed to examine all matters featured in a television programme of 8 January last. In this regard, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner recently received the report of the senior Garda officer about the issues raised in the programme. He is considering the report and I expect to hear from him shortly.</P>
    <P>Allegations of serious wrongdoing by members of the Garda, such as those broadcast on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, are of serious concern to me. Some of the cases featured in the programme were previously reported and in the <?oasys _dc24-?>public domain. They have been, or may be, dealt with in <Col N="2016"/>the courts or through existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms. In the circumstances, the House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific details of the cases. I expect that the Garda response will address the issues raised and examine the individual cases featured in the television programme. Where relevant, the systems, practices and procedures which operate in the Garda will be assessed with a view to seeing whether additional safeguards or other changes are necessary.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <P>I do not doubt that the existing laws and procedures for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda are not adequate. It is essential that such cases should be dealt with by means of a proper mechanism, which commands the full confidence of the public and the force alike. For that reason, the establishment of a fully independent ombudsman commission is a key objective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which is before the Seanad at present. The commission will have wide powers to investigate complaints made against members of the Garda and will be able to investigate policies and practices of the Garda, where such policies and practices may be the cause of complaint.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply, which contained specific details, unlike his previous reply. I am glad the Garda Commissioner has recently received the report. Does the Minister agree that the allegations made on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; in January were of systematic abuse by the Garda? Does he recall that a retired Circuit Court judge spoke about regular perjury in his court? It is imperative that action be taken on foot of the report. Does the Minister agree that the Government has been slow to provide a proper system to deal with complaints? His predecessor spoke in 2002 about the need to hold the Garda accountable. However, the 2004 Estimates make provision of &euro;1,000 for a Garda ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There is no sign that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 will be effectively implemented this side of Christmas. Will the Minister give us some indication of his serious intention of ensuring that the alleged abuses will be properly investigated at an early stage so that they do not lead to a tribunal or cause scandal in the public arena? I refer not only to the matters highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, but also to other matters in the public domain such as Abbeylara and, to a much greater extent, the Morris tribunal in Donegal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the suggestion that the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report reflected on the great majority of members of the Garda, who do their job extremely well and professionally. They strive to attain the highest possible standards in the way they conduct their work and cannot be said to have let down the country in any way. Although it appeared from the manner in which the programme was broadcast, which was deeply regrettable, that the remarks of the retired Circuit Court judge were applicable to the great majority <Col N="2017"/>of garda&iacute; with whom he had dealt, that was not the case. It is important to remember that the judge disowned the implication after he had seen the programme.</P>
    <P>I accept that there has been a disturbing departure from proper standards on the part of a small number of garda&iacute; in a number of cases. The consequences of such behaviour have been damaging to the force. I wish to make clear that as long as I am Minister, I will take these matters very seriously. That is why I am waiting for the report to the Garda Commissioner to be handed to me. I regard the issues raised as very important and grave.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the problems with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complaints procedure have been known for years? The system must be changed because it is the root of the problem. When is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill likely to be brought before the Houses to enable us complete the process? Even the Garda representative bodies accept that garda&iacute; investigating garda&iacute; is not the proper process and they are anxious for change.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that I accept the general consensus that the current system is inadequate. That consensus includes the practitioners of the current system because Gordon Holmes, who is the chairman of the body, has been one of the leading advocates of change and reform in this area. Unlike others, however, I have acted on this matter and brought the legislation before these Houses. The legislation is being considered by the Seanad. Deputy Durkan, in a generous reference to me just before this Question Time began, pointed out the considerable amount of legislation I have before the D&aacute;il committees. Fourteen legislative measures are pending. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is before the Seanad and I hope to introduce it in this House and get it passed as quickly as I can. Nothing is holding me back except the volume of legislative duties of this House. I am enthusiastic that this law should come about.</P>
    <P>The &euro;1,000 provided for in this year&rsquo;s Estimates was to make it possible for me to apply extra funding. It was a nominal sum to open a new head of expenditure so that if the legislation is in effect this year, I would have a statutory basis to apply money to fund that body. It is not indicative of the size of funding I believe should be applied if the legislation is passed by the end of this year.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if Garda resources were used to deliver a personal invitation to a person to a dinner hosted by a Minister (details supplied); his views on whether this is an appropriate use of Garda resources; if regulations exist to cover such requests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20688/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have no personal knowledge of the matter raised by the Deputy, I <Col N="2018"/>am aware of a newspaper report on it which dates back some weeks. My understanding from that newspaper report is that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as a courtesy, facilitated the delivery of an invitation to a person to an official EU function.</P>
    <P>The background, as I understand it, is that the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was sending out invitations to a State function in connection with the EU Presidency. There was to be security on the occasion and persons without a written invitation were not to be granted entry to the occasion. One late invitee, as I understand it &mdash; there may have been more &mdash; required an invitation and a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agreed, as a courtesy to one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials, to effect delivery of that invitation which was necessary for the person to get past Garda security at the State function.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner and I am quite satisfied it has no element of abuse of power or authority or was in any sense a dishonest appropriation of Garda time. It was members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting the way they often do &mdash; beyond the call of duty &mdash; as a courtesy to the other arms of the State. Just as a garda who is called to a house and asked to get a cat out of a tree could say it is none of his or her business and that he or she does not want to help, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na frequently go the extra mile and try to be of assistance on occasions like this. I do not believe it should be the subject of negative publicity when they do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, two garda&iacute; and a Garda car were used to deliver that European Union invitation, which appears a little excessive and more than normal courtesy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A high-risk invitation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not the only instance in which there have been suggestions and allegations of misuse of Garda time, drivers and cars. As the garda&iacute; are the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility, will he not consider introducing a code of conduct for Ministers in the first instance and ministerial drivers to ensure that neither the garda&iacute; nor the Garda cars are used other than for the purpose for which they were intended? We are not talking about courtesy but substantial diversions of Garda time and cars for issues that might not be appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly reject the suggestion that this had anything to do with the use of a ministerial car. As I have explained, this was an occasion when it was necessary for anybody attending the event in question to have an invitation in their possession in order to pass a Garda cordon. One member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agreed, as a courtesy to the Minister&rsquo;s officials, to deliver the invitation. Deputy Costello is right. The member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could have <Col N="2019"/>said it was none of his or her business and told the officials to deliver it themselves, but on this occasion the garda engaged in a small kindness to the people organising this official event and it is churlish and mean-minded to suggest that there was something improper with it or that it was wrong and a waste of time. If there were two people in the Garda car at the time, so what? Would the Deputy have wanted one of them to get out of the Garda car while the other did that small favour? This is mean-minded politics at its worst.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder whether security was required to deliver the invitation. The Minister may not recall but I have asked questions on this subject previously and received replies which were in the negative, that is, that nothing happened. I accept this was probably done for the most innocent of reasons but I have no doubt that if the Minister were on this side of the House asking questions about this matter, it would be a major event. He would ask whether this was the best use of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm for the House that this is an isolated incident which will not be repeated and that it will not become the norm for garda&iacute; or any branch of the Defence Forces to use their time in a way to facilitate social functions organised by Ministers? It is a serious matter.</P>

	<P>It is a serious matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am concerned, this matter is one in which a garda, as a matter of personal courtesy and kindness, facilitated the delivery of an invitation to a person who needed to get past a Garda security cordon around a State event. There is nothing more or less to it than that. I have no doubt that I could be as mean-minded when I was on the Opposition benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as Deputy Burton was in tabling this question, but I hope I would aspire to slightly more decent standards. If this was an egregious abuse of garda&iacute; or if the garda&iacute; involved felt in any way that they had been put upon, that would be a different matter, but that is not the case.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister checked out the matter?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke to the Commissioner today about this matter and told him this question was coming up. As far as he is concerned, and I agree with him, there was nothing untoward about it. It was a personal act of kindness on a particular occasion because of a unique set of circumstances in connection with an official function of the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The next time invitations are being sent out, will the Minister send one to my house?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has spoken to the Commissioner about the matter. He did not indicate that he impressed upon the Commissioner that something like this should never happen again. Why should any Minister or Minister of State expect a garda to deliver an invitation? The garda will do it out of courtesy but he or she should not be asked. Why was an ordinary citizen not asked to do the job instead of two garda&iacute; using a garda car?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a mean-minded question. The incident in question was blown out of all proportion. The press report on this incident which give rise to this question indicated that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon was wholly unaware that a request had been made of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do this and that it was an official who had made it.</P>

     <QRef>[21161/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 294 to 299, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The criminal law in this jurisdiction does not make it easy for criminals to launder money or invest the proceeds of crime in the legitimate property market. On the contrary, a broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enable serious and organised crime to be confronted effectively. The criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the global growth of organised crime and specific measures enacted to meet our domestic situation which is kept under review.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 provides that a person who converts, transfers or handles property or removes it from the State and knows or believes it represents the proceeds of criminal conduct, is guilty of the offence of money laundering. It is also an offence to provide any advice or assistance in converting, transferring, handling or removing property which would amount to money laundering. Under section 57 of the Act suspicions must be reported to the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners. Section 32 of the Act makes provision for the designation of bodies and activities in respect of money laundering offences and sets out the measures to be taken by those bodies regarding identification of customers and recording of transactions. New regulations were drawn up under section <Col N="2022"/>32(10)(<i>a</i>) of the Act to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the second EU money laundering directive in order to update the 1991 money laundering directive. The directive makes provisions for the designation of new categories such as solicitors, accountants, auditors, tax advisers, as well as auctioneers and estate agents. Regulations were signed in order to give effect to the directive.</P>
    <P>Estate agents and auctioneers have been designated bodies since 15 September 2003. Section 32 of the 1994 Act obliges designated bodies to secure and retain the identity of clients for whom they are engaged to provide a service on a continuous basis or where cash in excess of &euro;13,000 in respect of real property transactions, or in excess of &euro;15,000 in respect of high value goods, changes hands.</P>
    <P>Between the Criminal Assets Bureau and the money laundering legislation, there is an array of legislative means available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate, confiscate and trace criminal assets into real estate.</P>
    <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
    <P>If an estate agent or auctioneer suspects that money laundering is taking place, a duty arises to report such suspicions to the relevant authorities. With the introduction of the statutory instruments to which I have referred, representative bodies of auctioneers and estate agents have become members of the money laundering steering committee and, in consultation with the committee, are in the process of developing guidelines on money laundering to ensure compliance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The money laundering steering committee, set up in 1994 under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance, is a representative body of Departments, enforcement agencies, financial institutions and other designated bodies. Its main function is to facilitate consistent application of the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 across the range of bodies and professions affected by the legislation.</P>
    <P>Elements of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which will be published today will further aid the Garda in the investigation of crime. The main purpose of this Bill is to improve the efficiency with which criminal offences, in general, are investigated and prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible for the Garda to say, at any given time, how many properties are in the hands of criminal gangs or are in the course of acquisition by such gangs. However, the Garda continue to take a pro-active and integrated approach to the investigation of all serious crime, including all aspects of organised crime, such as money laundering.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Garda Commissioner has put in place arrangements for criminal investigations which involve members of the national bureau of criminal investigation working together with local district units to combat organised <Col N="2023"/>crime. Garda efforts in this area have met with success. A number of persons are before the courts and a number are serving sentences. Moreover, the Criminal Assets Bureau continues to apply its statutory remit to target assets, including property, derived from organised crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the exact number of organised criminals currently on bail, in prison or early release, data is not maintained by the various relevant elements of the criminal justice system in a way which would readily facilitate the provision of such data broken down by category of criminal. Between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2003, the Garda received in excess of 3,000 suspicious financial transaction reports. It is important to note however, that not all of these transactions would have necessitated criminal investigations and it is not necessarily the case that all suspicious transactions are linked to the activities of organised criminals. The suspicious transactions office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda bureau of fraud investigation meet regularly to review the reports received and to ensure their respective actions are co-ordinated and do not overlap. Money laundering investigations are conducted by the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners deal with cases of suspected tax evasion.</P>
    <P>The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority requires all institutions which it supervises to comply with anti-money laundering legislation and relevant sectoral guidance notes and to have in place the necessary procedures and controls to ensure such compliance. The adequacy of such systems are reviewed by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in the course of its ongoing supervision of institutions and requirements advised to institutions, as necessary. As part of its ongoing supervision the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority ensures that institutions are informed of international developments in the area of prevention of money laundering, in particular in relation to recommendations and reports on money laundering issued by the international financial action task force.</P>
    <P>Ireland&rsquo;s law and procedures on money laundering were the subject of a favourable review in 1998 by the financial action task force under that body&rsquo;s procedure for the mutual evaluation of its members. The next mutual evaluation of Ireland is due in 2005.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and appreciate his good intentions. However, a considerable body of evidence suggests that the measures in place are not working to the extent the Minister would desire. During the registration of a transfer of property, is the person acquiring the property immediately questioned as to where he or she received the resources to acquire it? An ordinary citizen when buying a house receives such an inquiry from the Revenue Commissioners. Evidence is growing that there is large <Col N="2024"/>scale organised criminal activity in acquiring property. It appears that the checks and balances in place are insufficient to deal with it and warrant a further careful examination.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it is a serious matter. One of the important provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 will give the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau the right to open trusts used for buying property and to require the beneficial owners of property bought in trust to be revealed. It is conventional for a solicitor to buy property in trust. However, apart from the solicitor&rsquo;s duty to prevent money laundering and to report suspicious transactions, the Garda will have power to look behind the trust and require solicitors, and others, in those circumstances to reveal the beneficial owners of the property in question.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Durkan has any suggestions as to how the law could be strengthened, I will take them on board when the Criminal Justice Bill is going through the D&aacute;il. If the Deputy knows of any property owned by organised crime beneficially, I invite him to bring it to my attention and I will ensure it is acted upon.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the requirement on businesses to disclose investments of &euro;15,000 or more be included in the Criminal Justice Bill? A new EU directive on money laundering requires the disclosure of sums invested by businesses that could amount to money laundering. If that was included in the Criminal Justice Bill, following the trail of improperly invested money would be easier.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The efforts of the Criminal Assets Bureau in tackling the proceeds of gang crime have been magnificent. I understood the Minister was to tackle the core issue of membership of these criminal gangs, using UN and EU directives as an assistance in the definition of the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures of &euro;13,000 and &euro;15,000 are already incorporated in the 1994 Act by the latest regulations as thresholds for reporting suspicious transactions such as money laundering. The Criminal Justice Bill published today would have contained draft provisions on criminal gangs if I had the report on this of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. I am keenly awaiting the committee&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, I have not seen it. As soon as it is to hand I will table the relevant provisions based on the Canadian, UN and the Council of Europe models to make membership of organised crime an offence. Organised crime <Col N="2025"/>is not gang crime. Three fellows jumping over a counter does not constitute organised crime.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>the membership of the Garda at the latest date for which figures are available; if he has received Cabinet approval for the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute;; the current annual capacity of the Garda Training College at Templemore; if he has plans to extend the college or otherwise increase training capacity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20689/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, all ranks, as of 5 July 2004 was 12,072. In April, 2000, the Government agreed, <i>inter alia</i>, to a system of delegated authority under which recruitment is carried out to maintain the strength of the force at an agreed level. Recruitment was carried out during 2003 with a view to bringing the strength of the force to 12,200 by 31 December 2004.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government states that the Government would complete the previous programme of expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which aimed at a strength of 12,000, which we have now exceeded, and then increase the strength by a further 2,000. This commitment remains. The strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have increased to 12,200 by the end of this year and it will not be possible to increase numbers beyond this level unless we relax the public service embargo agreed by the Government in view of budgetary circumstances in autumn 2002. There is a very strong case for doing that now.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Templemore facility, I am advised that the Garda college has accommodation on a weekly basis of 400 single rooms. These are utilised on a weekly basis to cater for student and course accommodation. The student Garda &ldquo;living out&rdquo; programme that has been developed to cater for increased numbers of Garda trainees enables students to be accommodated off campus but within the environs of Templemore and can accommodate a further 300 students per week. This maximum capacity was utilised to the full in 2003.</P>
    <P>When we decide to bring the Garda strength up from 12,200 to 14,000, a figure to which we are committed, we will make the appropriate adjustments to the facilities in Templemore. Some temporary inservice training off campus may be required and an extension of the dining and catering facilities at the college will certainly be required. I am assured that can be done quickly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that there is no way in which he can reach the modest target of 12,200 Garda members by the end of the year and that there is not a hope in hell of getting the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; within the next 12 or 18 months that this Government has to run?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There seem to be two issues. There is a public service embargo and the issue of the accommodation in Templemore. Would the Minister consider integrating part of the Garda training programme in some other third level institution so as to give Garda recruits exposure to other students of their own age and also to provide some links into other third level institutions, which seems to be the direction in which other police forces are moving? Could we not replicate that in Ireland?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept that the greatest failure of this Government has been its failure to comply with its promise to provide the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; and that it has not a hope in hell, half way through its term of office, of achieving that? Templemore college is bursting at the seams. Would the Minister look beyond Templemore and agree that other facilities must be made available if we are to have any hope of increasing Garda numbers, which all agree must be done?</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue. The market town of Kilrush which has a population of 2,678 is a very important town in west Clare. It is officially dedicated a heritage town with significant tourism potential. It boasts a 12-berth marina, Scattery Island, the Vandeleur walled gardens, golf and woodland trails.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Kilrush has suffered from industrial decline over the years. The recent census figures for west Clare are very worrying, with 20 of the 28 electoral divisions in the Kilrush rural area experiencing no growth or a decline in population. The entire Kilrush area showed a population decline of over 3% in the last census and while welcoming the decentralisation programme bringing 50 Revenue jobs to Kilrush, it is necessary to have an adequate telecommunications structure in place to enable this and future developments to be sustained in west Clare.</P>
    <P>There is a bleak future for the small rural communities, particularly for sons and daughters of small farmers who have decided to leave west Clare to live and work in Ennis, Kilrush, Galway, Limerick and other areas because they do not have local industry to employ them. Farming is now becoming part time and many of these people are leaving west Clare to move to larger towns.</P>
    <P>As the only Clare Deputy residing in west Clare I was very disappointed last week to learn that Kilrush was not included in the first round of the broadband action plan of 2005-2007. This was supposed to be a radical plan to increase competition, raise awareness of ICTs and extend high-speed connectivity to over 350,000 people in 88 towns throughout the country. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, Kilrush should have been included in the first round because this type of technology is critical for Kilrush if it is to attract new industry.</P><Col N="2029"/>
    <P>There is a prime example of how crucial technology is to the area. Nowcasting Limited was based in Kilrush in 1997 and commenced services in 1999. The company had developed a computerised system for sending weather information to ships via satellite and radio. Among the company&rsquo;s customers are the Irish navy, the RNLI and passenger and car ferry companies.</P>
    <P>The company employed nine full-time staff along with contract workers. Soon after its establishment, the company found that telecommunications service in Kilrush were not satisfactory. The issue was not bandwidth but redundancy and reliability. Kilrush was located on a spur on the telecommunications network, which means there was only one way for traffic to travel, with the same way out. When the radio link went down, there was no service. As a result of this poor telecommunications system, the company moved its telecommunications capacity in November 2001 from Kilrush to Citywest, where it has an excellent facility with back-up systems for both telecommunications and electricity.</P>
    <P>That is just one example. I am sure there are many other companies which would have looked at Kilrush but went elsewhere when they saw the poor telecommunications structure. Every job created in west Clare is vital. The 50 jobs announced for Kilrush in the Government decentralisation programme are the equivalent of 4,000 or 5,000 jobs for Dublin. If these jobs are to operate efficiently when they come to Kilrush, the area needs broadband technology. It needs such technology to attract new IT industries.</P>
    <P>The task force set up in Kilrush sent a submission to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and made a good case for Kilrush to be included in the first round, for which I congratulate it. The town has plenty of green field sites for industry but the missing link is broadband. I know that &euro;140 million has been committed to the action plan and the programme announced last week will cost &euro;55 million. However, of the 41 towns included, not one is in County Clare, which is disappointing.</P>
    <P>The people of west Clare are entitled to the service. The programme includes three towns in Kerry, four in Galway, seven in Cork and two in Tipperary and I congratulate the Ministers who have lobbied for their towns. However, I hope the Minister has good news and is in a position to announce broadband for Kilrush in the near future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, under the regulation of ComReg, the Commission for Communications Regulation. In its report on Ireland&rsquo;s broadband future, published in December 2003, the Information Society Commission concluded that the market has failed to <Col N="2030"/>respond to the demand for broadband connectivity, and there is a proven need for Government intervention to accelerate the provision of infrastructure and the driving of demand.</P>
    <P>In December last, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced his Department&rsquo;s broadband action plan, which will see broadband connectivity rolled out to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and over, using community broadband exchanges and strategic fibre. A spend of &euro;35 million each year from now until 2007 has been committed to the broadband action plan.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Kilrush, County Clare has been included in the call for 2005. Broadband services are currently being marketed in the Kilrush area by seven companies using digital subscriber lines, fixed wireless links or satellite links. The Department&rsquo;s dedicated website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, gives full details of these companies&rsquo; offerings, including costs and contact numbers. In addition to this initiative, the group broadband scheme, launched in March last, allows smaller rural communities to pool their requirements and obtain broadband connectivity from a range of service providers, with funding assistance from Government. Some &euro;25 million has been committed for this scheme.</P>
    <P>The broadband for schools programme, which was also announced in March, will bring high-speed connectivity to all 4,100 primary, second level and special needs schools in the country by the start of the 2005 school year. The Department is working closely with the Department of Education and Science and the industry to deliver this &euro;18 million programme, which is being 80% funded by the industry.</P>
    <P>Internet penetration rates in Ireland are now growing faster than in any other European country. In the past 12 months the number of DSL customers has risen from 1,000 to over 45,000, with a further 60,000 customers using flat rate Internet access, and more than 1,000 users of high-speed corporate lines. These figures continue to rise dramatically, with upwards of 1,000 new customers being added each week. The recent free trial introductory offers announced by Eircom and Esat BT, and the entry of NTL into the broadband market, are a welcome indication of the rising level of interest in broadband as a result of lower prices and greater consumer choice.</P>
    <P>The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will continue to push the broadband agenda, with the aim of providing world-class broadband infrastructure in all areas of the country. The continuing aim of the Government is to place Ireland in the top 10% of OECD countries for broadband connectivity within three years. I hope the Deputy is pleased to hear that Kilrush is in line to have the service installed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of Sl&iacute; Eile, the housing <Col N="2031"/>association based in Dromina, County Cork which has lodged an application with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for funding for a social housing project. I commend the organisation for the work they have put into the project and the excellent proposal submitted to the Department. The proposal is a concept developed by Sl&iacute; Eile and consists of a step-down facility from mental hospitals back into the community. It is an innovative idea and the board of Sl&iacute; Eile has worked closely with the health boards and families to develop the project.</P>
    <P>The principle developed after the association considered the statistics regarding re-admission to mental hospitals. Three out of four admissions to mental institutions are re-admissions; over 55% of patients in such institutions are there for over a year and over 33% of those for over five years. This facility aims to provide a communal group setting. The association has a property in mind and has been dealing with Cork County Council and the Department to try to further the project. The application has been with the Department since October 2002 and the association has moved to and fro between the Department and council in regard to the issue. At one stage, the council and the Department had given the green light for the project to go ahead and had instructed solicitors to that effect.</P>
    <P>As the Minster of State with direct responsibility, Deputy Noel Ahern, is in the House to answer on the matter, what difficulty has the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with the project? Is there any way to ensure the project can get off the ground? While I understand that the Department and county council work closely together on such applications, it is time to progress this project as the board of Sl&iacute; Eile and the families supporting it are anxious that it should move ahead.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent project, the brainchild of the Sl&iacute; Eile board which comprises Ms Joan Hamilton and others who have direct family involvement in this area and have been working with family members and others in recent years. They have experienced the ongoing difficulties which must be faced in the context of mental health, including re-admissions. Their fear is that they are in for a lifetime of re-admissions. Will the Minister outline the position regarding Sl&iacute; Eile? I hope he can move the project forward as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the position regarding the application by Cork County Council under my Department&rsquo;s capital assistance scheme for funding for a project proposed by Sl&iacute; Eile at the Old Rectory, Rathcormac, County Cork. I thank Deputy Moynihan for having raised the matter as I know of his special interest in this project. The capital assistance scheme, established in 1984, assists voluntary housing bodies to provide accommodation, generally one or two bedroom units, to <Col N="2032"/>meet special housing needs such as those of elderly persons, persons with disabilities, homeless persons, disadvantaged families and elderly returning emigrants eligible for accommodation under the scheme. The scheme is administered by housing authorities and it is a matter for each authority to examine and assess proposals brought by voluntary organisations and, if deemed eligible, to submit applications for funding to my Department.</P>
    <P>The financial assistance for the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme covers up to 95% of the capital costs of providing the accommodation, subject to an overall unit cost limit of &euro;88,900 for one to two person units of accommodation and &euro;108,000 in the case of family type accommodation. In this case, an application for funding in respect of 31 units of accommodation by Sl&iacute; Eile Housing Association at Rathcormac was received in my Department from Cork County Council in August 2003.</P>
    <P>The local authority was requested to submit costings for the project and when received these were referred to my Department&rsquo;s housing inspectorate on 10 September for observations. The Department&rsquo;s inspectorate reported that the proposal was for a residential therapeutic centre for people who have experienced psychiatric problems. The property in question appears to date from 1782 and is a protected structure.</P>
    <P>In October the Department was provided with a structural and fabric report which was prepared by the housing body&rsquo;s consultant engineer.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>My Department responded to Cork County Council on 7 November setting out the issues of particular concern which have significant cost implications for the project and would need to be addressed. These included the following: the absence of any investigation of the foundations of the existing buildings; a specialist survey of timber conditions was not undertaken; the moisture content of walls, which range from high, medium to low depending on location from ground level; the serious fire safety implications due to change of use to a multi-occupancy dwelling.</P>
    <P>In addition to the issues raised, it was requested to provide information as to how it was proposed to fund the operational side of the project on an ongoing basis and the source of such funding, for example the commitment, if any, the health board had given in this regard and the funding for the provision of accommodation for staff caring for the tenants. Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme funding can only be provided for one unit for a carer or caretaker. Accommodation for any extra carers is a matter for the health board. These are matters which should be addressed and resolved at local level before an application for funding is submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>My Department, therefore, asked Cork County Council some months ago to submit its assessment of the costings and feasibility of the pro<Col N="2033"/>posal and copies of its technical reports. The council was also reminded of the importance of ascertaining a firm level of commitment from the health board towards the project and requested to seek the views of the health board on the proposed provision of only one unit of accommodation for a carer in a project of this scale and nature. A response is awaited from Cork County Council, on receipt of which the application will receive further and prompt consideration.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue before the recess. Haulbowline Island is the centrepiece of Cork Harbour and is known not only as the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service but also as the former location of the State-owned Irish Steel, which was subsequently sold to Ispat International. The plant traded as Irish Ispat. It closed three years ago and has since been in liquidation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, years of industrial activity on that part of the island have left thousands of tonnes of hazardous waste, heavy metals, chemically treated metals and, most worryingly, a considerable quantity of radioactive waste. Since Irish Ispat went into liquidation there has been a legal dispute regarding responsibility for cleaning up the site. Regardless of ultimate responsibility for the cost of the clean up, which the Secretary General of the Department has estimated to be in the region of &euro;13 million, the first responsibility of Government and of State agencies charged with protecting the environment is to remove the environmental risk. The daily leaching of this material into Cork Harbour represents the greatest environmental danger in the area. As the area&rsquo;s public representative, I wish to see the waste removed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>This debate is an opportunity to put on record a call to Government to take action to remove the thousands of tonnes of hazardous material which are not only causing an environmental risk in terms of contamination but also constitute a huge, intrusive eyesore in the middle of a harbour which we take pride in for its scenic and tourism value. I am hoping for a positive response from the Government. I accept there are legal impediments but it is more important to remove the risk and argue about legal responsibility and acceptance of costs later. It is a dangerous precedent to allow this amount of polluting material to remain on site and to allow continuing environmental contamination to occur. I hope the Minister can respond positively.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this issue, thereby giving me an opportunity to outline the progress being made at the former Irish Ispat site on Haulbowline Island. I will first outline the background to the State&rsquo;s current involvement at the site. After the liquidator of Irish Ispat Limited exercised a break clause in the lease, which would have seen him leaving the site on 22 May 2003, the State sought <Col N="2034"/>and obtained an injunction constraining him to remain there pending the removal of radioactive materials. When these materials were confirmed to be removed, the injunction was lifted by consent and the State took over custody of the site on 19 June 2003.</P>
    <P>The Department immediately instigated measures to enhance safety and security at the site, including retaining two senior personnel for maintenance and inspection, retaining the incumbent security firm pending re-tendering of the contract, moving the security hut and installing barriers to ensure that unauthorised persons could not go on to the site, and seeking quantification of the pollutants which could be removed independent of larger-scale site investigation and remediation issues.</P>
    <P>The immediate priority identified from this audit of pollutants was the removal of a large number of deteriorating drums of waste oils and greases which were stored outdoors and might have given rise to serious leakages if not dealt with. All of these were removed at the cost of the State and have been certified as suitably disposed of. Later priorities identified included the removal of PCB containing capacitors and large amounts of dust, mainly contained in bags of about two tonnes capacity. Companies have now been appointed to deal with both of these pollutants. Although these are hazardous materials, they are stored securely on the site in areas to which only authorised personnel have access. These items pose no immediate danger to people in the area or to the environment of Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>While the question of who is ultimately responsible for site remediation is to be resolved by the courts &mdash; through which the State is pursuing vigorous claims for the estimated clean up costs &mdash; the Minister has consistently taken a conservative and preventative attitude in dealing with the site. He has ensured that potentially contaminating material is removed from the site when this can be done outside the broader scope of a full remediation programme, and that cannot be commenced until a proper site investigation has been completed.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council, which has agreed to act as the Minister&rsquo;s agent, is currently in the process of appointing consultants to advise on how to procure a suitable site investigation, to monitor such an investigation on the council&rsquo;s behalf and ultimately to provide appropriate peer review of reports emerging from the site investigation. The site investigation will include a contaminant-pathway-receptor risk analysis and, depending on proposed end uses for the site, will give a range of methodologies for dealing with contaminants so that they will pose no further risk to people and the broader environment.</P>
    <P>My Department is not aware of any specific materials on site which pose an imminent danger to the Cork Harbour environment or of any materials which can readily be moved pending site investigation, which are not already being <Col N="2035"/>dealt with. We are also confident that departmental officials and Cork County Council are taking all reasonable steps to minimise potential hazards from the former Irish Ispat site to people and the environment and we are confident that this aim is being achieved. The Minister is also taking steps to ensure that in the longer term the site can be suitably remediated, so that rather than being an eyesore and a cause of understandable local worry, it will be a positive asset to the Cork Harbour area and the country.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Government of further restrictions in eligibility for rent supplement and the fears and real concerns it has raised among those who are dependent on this form of housing support. A tightening of eligibility for rent supplement was one of the most severe of the savage 16 social welfare cuts announced by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, last November. The restriction imposed at that time made it far more difficult to qualify for rent supplement and created particular problems for single parents. Such was the concern at the impact of the cut that 13 separate organisations from the voluntary and community sector came together to campaign against it.</P>
    <P>Having made access to rent supplement more difficult and restrictive, it appears from the Government announcement yesterday that eligibility for it is to be withdrawn after 18 months and that local authorities will then be required to meet the housing assistance requirements of people assessed as having long-term housing need. According to the statement issued yesterday, &ldquo;The local authority response will be accommodation-based and will not involve payment of rent allowances to tenants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the statement made by Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, yesterday when she said that payment of rent supplements to tenants is an appropriate form of short-term income support, but over-dependence on such subsidies to meet long-term need does not provide the best outcome for tenants or yield good value for money for the State. However, the Minister and other Fianna F&aacute;il spokespersons are attempting to present the &euro;332 million as wasted on private landlords. This money will still go to private landlords, but it will be channelled directly from the local authority to the landlord. How, practically, will local authorities be enabled to make a response that is accommodation based? Will the necessary funding be provided to local authorities? Will they be enabled to build more local authority houses, or are they merely to become a broker between the tenant and the private landlord?</P>
    <P>Everyone is well aware that it has been the view of the Department of Social and Family Affairs for many years that it should be freed of the obligation to pay rent supplement from its <Col N="2036"/>resources and that responsibility for meeting the housing needs of people, either through direct provision or financial support, should be met by the Department with overall responsibility for housing, namely, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In principle I have no problem with that.</P>
    <P>However, I have very great difficulty with the decision effectively to end eligibility for rent supplement after 18 months and to transfer responsibility for meeting the housing needs of these people without providing the finances necessary to allow for a radical expansion of existing housing programmes. I very much doubt whether there has been consultation with the local authorities on this issue and I would certainly be very interested in hearing their views as to their capacity to do what is now asked of them. Deputies may no longer be members of local authorities, but that does not mean that we do not understand the severe difficulties they face in meeting existing housing needs, largely as a result of the failure of the Government to give them the resources to do so.</P>
    <P>House prices have trebled during the term of office of this Government. In 1997 the price of a new house was &euro;97,000. Now it is in excess of &euro;300,000. Nearly half of all new families cannot afford to buy a home. According to the report, Local Authorities Housing Strategies, 33% of new families nationally, 42% in urban areas and 50% in Dublin, cannot afford to buy. Against this background it is no wonder there has been such an increase in the numbers seeking public housing. The numbers on council housing lists have doubled, from 26,000 in 1996 to over 60,000 now, yet fewer than 5,000 local authority houses are being built each year.</P>
    <P>Many of those on the housing lists are in receipt of rent supplement because without it they simply could not afford private rented accommodation and would be homeless. If rent supplement is to be terminated after 18 months, it is hard to see how this will not lead to an increase in homelessness.</P>
    <P>The one major element that was missing from the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday was any commitment that additional money will be provided to allow the local authorities to discharge the new responsibilities they will now carry. The best they could say was, &ldquo;Costs of accommodating rent supplement claimants and administrations will be supported by redirection of funds that would otherwise have been spent in rent allowances for households accommodated through the new arrangements.&rdquo; It should be noted that the term used is that the cost will be supported, not met. Even if the entire spend of &euro;332 million on rent supplement were transferred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it would still not be sufficient to meet the needs of new applicants coming on to the housing lists, never mind clearing those already on it.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, not to proceed with <Col N="2037"/>this plan until there is a guarantee from Government of sufficient financial resources to local authorities to allow them to meet the existing demand for housing. I also ask the Minister to give an undertaking that nobody will have their rent supplement terminated after 18 months unless the local authority is able to provide them with a suitable offer of housing. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, seemed to indicate this morning that the ending of rent supplement will have no implications for persons already in receipt of it, which seems to be at variance with what the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, said. We need to know the answer to this critical question and to other questions that arise from this announcement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The announcement on rent supplement has major implications but the Deputy is entirely wrong to describe the changes as &ldquo;further restrictions&rdquo;. The changes will bring about a significant improvement in the housing position of people who, up to now, have had to rely on rent supplement on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>That is why groups such as CORI and the National Youth Council of Ireland have welcomed this initiative. CORI has stated that the new arrangements provide substantial gain for some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable people. The National Youth Council has stated that young people on rent supplement for some time will now have greater security and better long-term housing options.</P>
    <P>People with a long-term housing need require a long-term housing solution, not a weekly social welfare payment in lieu of housing. The new arrangements announced yesterday will involve local authorities progressively assuming responsibility, over a timeframe of three years, for accommodating rent supplement recipients of 18 months continuous duration.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will meet long-term housing needs of rent supplement recipients through both social housing and private rented accommodation, involving a variety of arrangements. These could include specifically built premises, existing supplementary welfare allowance rented properties, as well as new developments under public private partnerships.</P>
    <P>Funding will be provided to local authorities to support the cost of the new accommodation-based scheme through the redirection of resources from the rent supplement scheme.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister transfer the &euro;332 million?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of it will be transferred as needed. This funding is in addition to funding already being provided under the local authority housing programmes.</P>
    <P>To allay concerns I can confirm that the funding arrangements for the new initiative will in no way reduce the level of funding being provided <Col N="2038"/>to the social housing capital programme or towards the rent supplementation scheme. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the social housing programmes with a combined 2004 Exchequer and non-Exchequer provision of &euro;1.884 billion will be in no way diminished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not coping.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we hope to get better value for the totality of spending as between the local authority provision and the rent supplement scheme. I do not accept that this will lead to extra demand for public housing. Those whose needs will be met under the new arrangements are by definition already in need of housing. The new arrangements will provide additional options for meeting those needs in an appropriate and sustainable manner that will give a better outcome to the tenants concerned.</P>
    <P>The new role for housing authorities in this area reflects views broadly expressed by community welfare staff, staff representatives and the social partners regarding the desirability of local authorities having direct involvement regarding long-term housing needs generally and aligning this element of the rent supplement sector more closely with overall housing policy.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the new arrangements will be rolled-out through groupings of local authorities in three phases. Preparations will begin immediately for roll-out to an initial group of lead authorities in Dublin, Galway and Limerick cities, South Dublin, Donegal and Offaly-Westmeath county councils and Drogheda Town Council. A further group will be included early in 2005 and the balance in September 2005. Overall implementation, in terms of accommodating relevant rent supplement claimants assessed as having long-term need for housing assistance, is to be completed in all areas by September 2008.</P>
    <P>This decision reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective under the national anti-poverty strategy to enable households experiencing poverty and disadvantage to have available to them housing or accommodation which is affordable, accessible, of good quality, suitable to their needs, culturally acceptable, located in a sustainable community and, as far as possible, in a secure tenure of their choice. The new residential tenancies legislation, which passed all stages in the Seanad today, will also help to underpin the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant benefits of the new arrangements is that tenants who have their accommodation needs met by the local authority will be able to retain their accommodation if they progress into employment. I am satisfied that these new arrangements will benefit tenants, taxpayers, accommodation providers and the housing market generally. It is not linked in any way to anything that happened last December. Discussions on this issue have been going on between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of <Col N="2039"/>Social and Family Affairs for some years. The right moment and opportunity to come forward with this is now, when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have asked the Irish Human Rights Commission for its observations on the draft Bill published last April as part of the document, Citizenship Referendum: the Government&rsquo;s proposals, and I await those. I am also at present engaging in consultations with the SDLP as regards aspects of the proposed legislation raised by that Party. I intend to finalise the text of the Bill with parliamentary counsel to the Government, based on the published draft and incorporating whatever modifications are appropriate arising out of these ongoing consultations, with a view to obtaining Government approval to circulate the Bill in time for parliamentary debate on it during the Autumn session.</P>
    <P>The Bill as initiated will also include provision to address the question of putting investment-based naturalisation schemes beyond possibility, in accordance with the commitment in that regard already given by me on behalf of the Government. Should any Deputy or other interested person have any observations to make at this stage, I would be delighted to take them into account in the process of finalising the text.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works was asked earlier this year to assist in the identification of possible sites for a complex to replace the current prison facilities centred around Mountjoy Prison. The Office of Public Works subsequently made inquiries, which included the placing of advertisements in the national press, and arising from this process approximately 30 <Col N="2042"/>potential sites have been submitted for consideration.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of identifying the most appropriate site, and in the light of the large number of potential sites, I have established an expert group, chaired by my Department with input from the Office of Public Works and the Irish Prison Service, to examine the potential sites on the basis of comprehensive and objective criteria and to report back to me. I propose to await the results of the deliberations of this group before proceeding further. I would not expect to receive this group&rsquo;s report before the end of July.</P>

	<P>The position in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy was set out in my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 29 of 5 May 2004 and No. 93 of 1 June 2004. As stated previously the central application facility, CAF, was launched by the Civil Service Commission in May 2004 and civil servants have been invited to indicate their preferred decentralisation locations by 8 July 2004. The staff who apply by this date will have priority over those who apply after that date.</P>
    <P>However, following agreement with the civil service unions, it has been decided to extend the initial period for priority applications until 7 September 2004. When the information is to hand on the initial CAF interest in decentralisation options, it is intended to conduct a survey in which the relevant prison service staff would be asked to indicate definitively whether or not they <Col N="2043"/>wish to remain with the Irish Prison Service and transfer to Longford. The Deputy may be interested to know that, prior to the establishment of the CAF, the Irish Prison Service had received unsolicited applications from 72 persons in other Civil Service bodies who wish to transfer to Longford.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service has, along with all other Departments and agencies due to decentralise, prepared and submitted an implementation plan to the decentralisation implementation committee. Part of this plan outlines the possible risks associated with decentralisation, as well as presenting strategies for mitigating these risks. The Flynn committee will be submitting its second report to Government at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff who do not propose to decentralise to Longford, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has recently indicated in the national press that a central application facility for civil servants who wish to remain in Dublin will be established shortly.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if he will reconsider the policy of placing pregnant asylum seekers together, in view of the outbreak of chickenpox at a centre (details supplied) in Dublin.</Quest>
     <QRef>[20812/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is responsible, among other things, for meeting the accommodation and ancillary needs of asylum seekers. The RIA currently operates 69 accommodation centres in 24 counties throughout the country together with three reception centres in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Having made application for refugee status to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, asylum seekers are accommodated in a reception centre in Dublin, including <Col N="2044"/>Balseskin reception centre which caters, in the main, for families and single females, for approximately ten days where their needs are assessed before transfer to an accommodation centre outside Dublin, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>Health screening is available on site in all three reception centres on a voluntary and strictly confidential basis. In addition, an ante-natal clinic which is staffed by Rotunda Hospital medical, midwifery and administrative personnel, operates two mornings each week at Balseskin. It enables identification of healthy pregnancies where women may be transferred to direct provision centres and receive maternity services outside Dublin. Difficult pregnancy cases are either retained in Dublin or referred to other specialist centres, for example, Cork as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The accommodation of newly arrived pregnant asylum seekers in Balseskin facilitates women in early attendance at a fully co-ordinated health service which includes health screening, an ante-natal clinic, GP, psychological and psychiatric services on site, if required. Cr&egrave;che facilities are also available in the centre for all adults who have children so as to facilitate attendance at medical appointments.</P>
    <P>Following extensive discussions between representatives of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, the Rotunda Hospital and the RIA, agreement was reached on a protocol to be implemented at Balseskin reception centre should an outbreak of chickenpox occur. The protocol was devised to protect the non-immune pregnant women from chickenpox by ensuring their immediate identification and removal from the centre while, at the same time, minimising the impact on day to day operation of the centre.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the protocol, pregnant women who are accommodated in the centre when a chickenpox outbreak occurs are tested for immunity. Those who are non-immune to chickenpox are removed to a dedicated isolated centre where they can be monitored by the medical professionals for a 28 day period &mdash; period of incubation &mdash; and arrangements are put in place to provide a separate ante-natal clinic at Balseskin for the duration of the incubation period. Those who are immune are transferred to suitable accommodation centres outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the comprehensive nature of the services available to pregnant women at the centre and the steps taken in the event of an outbreak of chickenpox, the RIA has advised me that it has no plans, at this stage, to alter its policy on the placement of pregnant women there.</P>

	<P>The 29th report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure entitled, Inquiry to Examine all Aspects of Practice and Procedure relating to Personal Injuries Litigation, was presented to me on 22 June last. In the report, the committee makes a considerable number of recommendations for changes to court practice and procedures and related matters with a view to streamlining and reducing the cost and complexity of litigation.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that those who seek redress before the courts should be facilitated by modern systems, rules and practices which protect them from lengthy delays and excessive costs. It was with this purpose in mind that I introduced the Civil Liability and Courts Bill 2004, which today has passed all stages in both Houses. That Bill has presaged some of the recommendations made in the committee&rsquo;s report. I am, however, having the 29th report examined in my Department to see what further steps should be taken which would further simplify procedures and reduce costs.</P>

     <Quest>the details of the membership of the partnership committee established under Sustaining Progress to examine child care for working parents; and the efforts his Department has made to encourage employers to allow employees extended career breaks to look after their very young children.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the subject of child care for working parents, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of establishing workplace child care arrangements, is presently under consideration by a partnership sub-committee which has been established under Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the sub-committee is to consider how to improve the availability of quality child care for working parents and how the supply of pre-school and after-school child care places can be accelerated. In particular, the sub-committee will examine and make recommendations on the feasibility of establishing workplace child care arrangements such as the following: provision of specific supports to facilitate employers and unions to work together to both design and implement a range of child care supports appropriate at the level of the enterprise; greater targeting of resources towards the active participation of employers in developing and providing child care initiatives, in consultation with the unions.</P>
    <P>My Department has facilitated a number of meetings and provides executive support to this committee. The committee first met on 10 June 2003 and comprises Ms Sylda Langford, chair, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ms Pauline Moreau, Department of <Col N="2046"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Ms Maria Cronin, IBEC; Ms Heidi Lougheed, IBEC; Mr. David Joyce, ICTU; Ms Rosheen Callendar, ICTU; and Ms Denise Fleming, Secretary, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P><?oasys _cl10.5-?>The child care requirements of parents can vary significantly depending on their personal circumstances and work patterns and it is likely that individual organisations would need to tailor their policies according to the needs of their employees. As such, my Department is not directly involved in actively encouraging employers to allow employees extended career breaks to address their child care needs and would consider such matters more appropriate to individual organisations and employers concerned.</P>
    <P>However, my Department does have responsibility for the Parental Leave Act 1998 which provides for unpaid leave for parents to care for their young children. The Act, which transposed the Parental Leave Directive (96/34/EC) into Irish law, came into force on 3 December 1998. The Act provides an individual and non-transferable entitlement to parents to avail of 14 weeks per child unpaid leave from work to take care of young children. This leave must be taken before the child reaches his or her five birthday, except in very limited circumstances in the case of an adopted child. A review of the Parental Leave Act was conducted in 2001 by a working group comprising the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority and the report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published in April 2002.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed, as part of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement, to improving the parental leave provisions and work is currently at an advanced stage in my Department on the heads of Bill to implement the agreed recommendations of the working group. It is hoped that the Bill will be published later this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 59 together.</P><Col N="2047"/>
    <P><?oasys _cl11-?>I wish to advise the Deputies that it is my intention, in accordance with the commitment given in the Agreed Programme for Government, to circulate the Disability Bill at the earliest possible date. The Government is conscious of the complexity and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved and, to support ministerial engagement throughout the process, referred oversight of the Bill to the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion. Work is continuing in relation to the Bill and it will be published when the work is completed. The Disability Bill is a key part of the framework being put in place by the Government to underpin equal participation by people with disabilities in Irish society. The framework includes: the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill, 2003 which is currently on Report stage in the Seanad; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill which is being prepared in the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to the provision of advocacy; six sectoral plans for key public services which will each be published at the same time as the Disability Bill; and equality legislation, amended by the Equality Bill 2004, which has just completed report and final stage in the D&aacute;il report and final stage in Seanad scheduled for 7 July.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government has facilitated extensive consultation nationally in relation to disability legislation, giving disability groups and the disability legislation consultation group, DLCG, in particular an opportunity to present their proposals for a Disability Bill. Many Deputies will know that the DLCG is a group representative of people with disabilities, their families, carers and service providers which was brought together by the National Disability Authority, NDA, to facilitate dialogue at national level, both within the sector and with the expert consultation team appointed by the Government. Broad ranging consultations took place in 2002 and early 2003 following which the DLCG presented the document, Equal Citizens &mdash; Proposals for Core Elements of Disability Legislation, in February 2003.</P>
    <P>Last year, the DLCG had meetings with a number of members of the Government, including the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley. The discussions at these meetings covered such matters as assessment of need; standards; service provision; the need to build capacity in key sectors of the public service so as to allow provision of disability accessible services in a cost effective way; and workable redress mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, meetings took place between officials and the DLCG at which it was given an outline of the proposals for legislation. Its views about these proposals were discussed and noted for consideration by the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion. On 19 May last, the Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, met the group and outlined to them developments in Government <Col N="2048"/>thinking and issues still under discussion arising from meetings with officials in the early part of the year. He reassured them of the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to publish a Bill at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <P>As well as inviting written submissions on the report, I held a major conference on 1 December 2003 to facilitate an exchange of views from a cross-section of interested parties. The conference was well attended and thought provoking. I had made it clear when I brought the report to Government in June 2003 that it was the group&rsquo;s report; it is not a report by me to Government or indeed a report of the Government and the Government has made no decision in respect of the substance of the contents of the report.</P>
    <P>Aside from the recommendations on a press council, there were other important recommendations in the report on defamation which will require consideration. For example, the proposed new defence of reasonable publication; the suggested re-balancing of the role which judge and jury have at present in defamation actions which are commenced in the High Court; the Circuit Court to have jurisdiction in all defamation cases where the amount of the damages claimed does not exceed &euro;50,000; a suggested one-year limitation period for defamation actions and the enshrinement in legislation of a defence to be known as the defence of innocent publication which would be available, among others, to broadcasters, distributors, printers and internet service providers.</P>
    <P>However, it would be fair to say, that a majority of the responses received during the public consultation process, addressed the recommendation put forward by the legal advisory group with regard to the establishment of a statutory press council.</P>
    <P>This recommendation came on foot of one of the more specific of the legal advisory group&rsquo;s terms of reference, which was to consider the nat<Col N="2049"/>ure and extent of any statutory intervention which might attach to the establishment of any entity concerned with the regulation of the press. This is a subject where there is some divergence of views as to the optimum approach to be followed.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, there is a need to achieve a form of regulation which is effective and in which the public can have confidence. On the other hand, care must be had to ensure that any regulatory framework does not trespass needlessly upon the traditional freedoms which the press enjoys in all democratic societies. The group, having carefully weighed up the options, recommended the establishment of a statutory press council with functions which would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints concerning alleged breaches of that code. The report set out, in some detail, the main features of such a council, including matters pertaining to its operation and structure. The draft general scheme for a new defamation Bill, set out in the group&rsquo;s report, contains a template for the legislative intervention which would be required were such an entity to be established.</P>
    <P>At their request, I met representatives of the steering committee of the press industry on 26 April, to receive their draft proposals for a press Ombudsman and a press council. The broad content of these proposals have been subsequently reported in the media. I promised the steering committee that I would give careful consideration to their proposals, which I understand may be further developed. I will also be giving the same consideration to the comments submitted by others on the issue of a press council.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view on a number of occasions, that the particular model examined by the advisory group is by no means the only, or, for that matter, the most obvious model for a press council. There could be a body chaired by, say a judge and composed of nominees of a variety of groups to reflect the different interests involved. Appropriate statutory recognition could be given to such a press council. Other models have been suggested during the consultation process as to how a press council could be composed and these will be given careful consideration by me before bringing a proposal to Government.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the public consultation process that I have engaged in is assisting towards the formation of a reasonable consensus on this issue. I look forward to bringing proposals to Government later this year.</P>

	<P>As I previously outlined to the House on 15 May 2004, there is a high attrition rate in rape cases in Ireland and a large number of cases reported to the garda&iacute; do not reach prosecution stage for a variety of reasons. As the Deputy is only too well aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in his function and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in keeping with the annual policing plan, has commenced a research project on sexual offences. It is envisaged that this research will provide an insight into the attrition rates in sexual offences.</P>
    <P>I have also recently provided funding to the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. Following from this research, it is hoped that we will have a greater understanding as to why some victims chose not to report cases to the garda&iacute;, what we can do with regard to underreporting and why, of the cases reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents, particularly women, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education. The programme provides capital grant assistance to create and enhance new and existing child care facilities and staffing grant assistance to community based-not for profit organisations whose child care services have a strong focus on the support of the child care needs of disadvantaged families, wishing to avail of employment, training or education.</P>
    <P>The total amount of funding available under the programme exceeds &euro;449 million. To date over &euro; 261 million has been committed to child care projects in both the community based sector and to private providers. This funding will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of approximately 29,000 new child care places and will sup<Col N="2051"/>port over 27,142 existing child care places. Of the funding committed to date almost &euro;119 million has been approved towards capital projects, with a further &euro;99 million towards staffing grant assistance. The &euro;99 million staffing grant is targeted solely at disadvantaged areas and families.</P>
    <P>The funding committed to date includes the provision of over &euro;44.3 million to child care services operating in RAPID areas, which are specially designated for urban regeneration. In addition, over &euro;23.2 million has been approved for projects located in CL&Aacute;R areas, which are specially designated for rural regeneration.</P>
    <P>Of the 29,000 new child care places receiving support under the programme it is estimated that over 11,400 are provided on a full-time basis and 17,567 places on a part time basis.

	<P>Since the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s first road safety strategy in 1998, the number of people killed and injured on Irish roads has declined by over 26% from 458 in 1998, to 337 in 2003 despite increases in car ownership over the period. Under the strategy, the garda&iacute; concentrated their enforcement efforts on the offences identified as the main contributors to road fatalities and injuries, that is, speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat-belt offences.</P>
    <P>The new road safety strategy, which is due to be published shortly by my colleague the Minister for Transport, will build further on the good start made and set ambitious targets for road safety. I recognise the importance of enforcement in the area of road safety and the Garda contribution to the success of the new strategy will be enhanced through the provision of modern IT support systems, additional legislative provisions such as the introduction of random breath testing and, where appropriate, the outsourcing of administrative tasks. However, it must also be recognised that drivers have a personal responsibility to themselves and to other road users to obey the law of the land. As the Deputy will be no doubt aware, the main objective of Garda activity in the area of road safety is to change road user behaviour, through enforcement and surveillance, ultimately resulting in a reduction of the number killed and injured on our roads annually. I am satisfied that the innovations I have mentioned will considerably reduce the administrative burden on operational garda&iacute; and facilitate an increased focus on prevention and detection of road traffic offences.</P>

	<P>The majority of prisoners in custody now have 24 hour access to in cell sanitation thanks to substantial investment in the prison estate since 1997. The current prisons capital programme is aimed at the provision of full modern in-cell sanitation in all prison accommodation. I would expect that the remaining cells that do not have this facility at Portlaoise, Limerick, Cork and Mountjoy prisons will be refurbished or replaced within the next four years.</P>
    <P>I am aware of newspaper reports regarding a recent decision of the Scottish courts to award damages to a prisoner who claimed that his rights had been violated due to the existence of the practice known as slopping out. These reports seemed to suggest that the damages related to the <Col N="2054"/>prisoner having to slop out, which is not the case. There were specific conditions of detention in the case in Scotland which would not apply to the Irish situation. It appears to me that the effect of these newspaper reports has been to encourage or prompt prisoners and former prisoners in Ireland to initiate legal action against the State.</P>

This project was initiated in June 2002 with the Department of Health and Children. The standards will apply to disability services for children and adults with autism, intellectual, physical and/or sensory disability, funded by the Department of Health and Children. Over the past two years, these Standards have been developed in consultation with people with disabilities, their families, carers, service providers and other stakeholders. A pilot of these standards was undertaken in the final quarter of 2003. The NDA and the Department of Health and Children are currently finalising amendments to these standards on foot of feedback from this pilot and further consultations and intend to finalise this process later this year.

The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness 2000 contains a commitment from Government in relation to improving the accessibility of public services. Under the commitment, the NDA has been given the task in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to develop guidelines on improving accessibility to public services and to monitor progress in achieving improved access. The NDA has recruited a team of experts In order to carry out this task. This team are currently promoting the NDA&rsquo;s existing guidelines but are also developing a new set of accessibility guidelines specifically related to public services in consultation with Government departments, state agencies, the voluntary sector and the general public. An audit tool and associated assessment tool are in preparation. Lastly, as part of this commitment the NDA are in the process of commissioning an accessibility symbol to award to public services that comply with these accessibility guidelines.

     <Quest>his views on whether moving the prison facility provided at Mountjoy to a location adjacent to the M50 may result in significant hardship to visitors, in view of the fact that such a location will be a considerable distance away from the city, may will not be accessible by public transport, and will lead to further gentrification within Dublin city centre.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works was asked earlier this year to assist in the identification of possible sites for a complex to replace the current prison facilities centred around Mountjoy Prison. The OPW subsequently made inquiries, that included the placing of advertisements in the national press, and arising from this process approximately 30 potential sites have been submitted for consideration.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of identifying the most appropriate site, and in the light of the large number of potential sites, I have established an expert group. It shall be chaired by my Department with input from the OPW and the Irish Prison Service. It shall examine the potential sites on the basis of comprehensive and objective criteria and to report back to me. I propose to await the results of the deliberations of this group before proceeding further.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s assertions that a new location for the Mountjoy complex will result <Col N="2058"/>in significant hardship to visitors. Obviously any change in location may inconvenience visitors who reside in the immediate proximity of the current site but equally a new site may prove more convenient for visitors from other areas. One of the factors that will be taken into consideration in selecting a new site will be its accessibility, including public transport links.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that the relocation of the Mountjoy complex will lead to further gentrification within Dublin city centre. My primary concern is the future health and welfare of those persons held in the Mountjoy complex. The total Mountjoy complex occupies circa 16 acres most of which is covered by buildings. Open space is at a premium and the sanitary arrangements do not meet modern standards. I have been advised that it is only on a new, much larger site that the 1,000 or so prisoners held in the Mountjoy complex can be detained in facilities appropriate to modern day standards.</P>

     <Quest>the steps being taken to address unacceptably long waiting lists for appointments at Legal Aid centres; the average waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor at the centres; the longest waiting time at any particular centre; his views on whether such waiting times are acceptable; and the additional funding which has been provided to reduce waiting times.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Legal Aid Board does not routinely collect information relating to an average waiting time for people seeking its services. It records the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited.</P>
    <P>The board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care and cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately. In 2003 approximately 1,500 of priority appointments were offered by law centres. It is 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year. The board continually monitors the operation of its law centre network. It seeks <Col N="2059"/>to utilise its resources in such a way as to reduce waiting times at centres where they are particularly long.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of additional funding, the grant-in-aid allocation for the board in 2004 is &euro;18.388 million, an increase of almost 5% over the 2003 allocation of &euro;17.539 million. The level of resources provided to the board has increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 1997 the grant-in-aid available to it was &euro;10.656 million. The figure for 2004 represents an increase of almost 73% during the period.</P>
    <P>The following tabular statement includes the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited for legal services as of May by law centre:</P>

     <QRef>[18052/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Child care provision has been at the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s social agenda.</P>
    <P>Recently my colleague, Deputy Harney, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment addressed a seminar entitled Employer Supported Child Care: Exploring the Benefits to Business. It was organised by Mayo County child care committee. Her address outlined the main elements of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to address the need for a work-life balance, especially in relation to child care provision, and I have included the main points of the address for the Deputy&rsquo;s information: in response to the issue of increased demand for quality child care, the Government has provided, with EU assistance, significant funding to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to support child care for parents in employment education or training through the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006; the subject of child care for working parents is being considered by a partnership sub-committee which has been established under Sustaining Progress; and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is actively involved in furthering the work-life balance agenda at the level of the enterprise. The Department chairs the national framework committee for work-life balance policies that comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Departments. The role of the committee is to support and facilitate family friendly-work-life balance policies through the development of a package of practical measures that can be applied at the level of the enterprise. The committee published research on this subject last year.</P>
    <P>The child care requirements of parents can vary significantly depending on their personal circumstances and work patterns. It is unlikely that workplace based child care arrangements alone would meet the needs of parents. In a recent quarterly national household survey parents did not express an overwhelming preference for a particular alternative to their present arrangements although the most popular alternative chosen was a centre based service both for the pre school and the primary school child.</P>
    <P>The child care sector is the focus of significant investment under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006. It is a core element of the Government&rsquo;s child care strategy.</P>
    <P>The programme aims to address the child care needs of parents who are working or who are engaged in training and education activities by increasing the number of quality child care places available throughout Ireland. It provides capital grant assistance to community-not for profit <Col N="2061"/>organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places and staffing grant assistance grants to community based-not for profit organisations which have a focus on meeting the child care needs of disadvantaged families.</P>
    <P>To date &euro;218 million in funding was allocated to child care facilities in the form of capital grants to private providers and capital and staffing support grants for community based-not for profit groups. It is estimated that it will provide for the creation of an estimated 29,000 new child care places and will support over 27,000 existing child care places.</P>
    <P>Further measures on child care are being provided in a number of different ways. I have outlined a few examples for the Deputy&rsquo;s information. In 2001 the Department of Finance allocated &euro;12.7 million capital expenditure for the provision of up to 15 Civil Service cr&egrave;ches for the children of parents who work in Departments. Four cr&egrave;ches are already in operation with a further two due to open in late 2004. Proposals for additional cr&egrave;che are being considered.</P>
    <P>In March 2001 the IDA launched a scheme to provide for the creation of high quality, workplace child care facilities in IDA Ireland business parks around the country. In October 2003 the T&aacute;naiste announced the provision of five new high quality child care facilities in selected IDA business parks. Two of the facilities have opened with the remaining three due to open later this year. It is intended that these facilities will cater for over 450 children.</P>
    <P>Since the start of 2002 the city and county enterprise boards have approved funding of over &euro;1.3 million to 130 child care enterprises across the country. The funding comprises mainly staffing grants with a small number of capital grants available. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Finance has made available a number of tax reliefs for child care facilities. Their purpose is to help increase the supply of affordable child care places. Capital allowances are available for capital expenditure on the construction, extension and refurbishment of a building, or part of a building &mdash; or the conversion of an existing building &mdash; that is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service, day care or other child care facility. The premises must not include any part of a building in use as, or as part of, a dwelling. There is also an exemption to the usual benefit-in-kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. In such circumstances, the employer must be wholly or partly responsible for both financing and managing the child care facility.</P>
    <P>The subject of child care for working parents, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of establishing workplace child care arrangements, is being considered by a partnership sub-committee that was established under Sustaining Pro<Col N="2062"/>gress. The purpose of the sub-committee is to consider how to improve the availability of quality child care for working parents and how the supply of pre-school and after-school child care places can be accelerated. Officials of my Department have already had meetings with IBEC and ICTU to consider these issues.</P>
    <P>With reference to the recent survey of parents conducted by the manufacturers of Calpol, less than 14% of respondents to the survey identified the cost or lack of child care facilities as an important issue.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government and the progress of my Department&rsquo;s equal opportunities child care programme are confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing and reviewing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda. The outcomes of the present programme will be monitored closely to inform the forward planning process in order to support the twin needs of quality child care provision and labour market supports.</P>

    <P>The Deputy shall be aware of the Chen case referred to the European Court of Justice by the UK Immigration Appellate Authority. In the course of its proceedings the UK Government disputed the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction to give a ruling on the matters that had been submitted to it. In that context, it argued that the only element of the case that was not internal to the UK was the child&rsquo;s Irish nationality. Its view was that her nationality was acquired as &ldquo;the result of subterfuge resorted to by Mr. and Mrs. Chen, which should be seen as an abuse of law.&rdquo; The advocate general, in his opinion, stated:</P><P LI="1">The fact is that the problem, if problem there be, lies in the criterion used by the Irish legislation for granting nationality, the <i>jus soli</i>, which lends itself to the emergence of situations like the one at issue in this case. In order to avoid such situations, the criterion could have been moderated by the addition of a condition of settled residence of the parent within the territory of the island of Ireland.</P>

	<P el="0">The optimum use of Garda stations was considered as part of the major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation which looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The Garda SMI implementation steering group&rsquo;s final report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It does not refer to the closure of any specific Garda station. It makes recommendations to assist policy making on the management and use of all available resources, including Garda stations. In this and many other aspects of the report, the Garda Commissioner will, under the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform. The report will be of considerable assistance to him in that task.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a wide range of measures in place designed to divert children away from crime. I understand from the Garda authorities that the Garda primary schools programme was first introduced in 1991. It involves specially trained garda&iacute; calling to 5th and 6th class primary school children and delivering a programme that includes such topics as personal safety, vandalism and the role of the Garda, as well as road and cycle safety.</P>
    <P>The Garda secondary schools programme forms part of the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s social, personal health and education programme that is being introduced on a nationwide basis. Specially trained garda&iacute; are available to deliver SPHE modules on substance abuse and personal safety. Both school programmes seek to provide guidance and assistance in helping young people advance their appreciation of the need to abide by the law within their own communities.</P>
    <P>The Garda juvenile diversion programme is an effective crime prevention programme. It was first introduced in 1963 and was placed on a statutory basis in May 2002 following the commencement of Part 4 of the Children Act 2001. The programme is administered by the Garda national juvenile office and delivered locally by juvenile liaison officers who are based throughout the country. I am delighted to report that research has also shown that three out of four children who are included in the programme do not re-offend over a three year follow-up period.</P>
    <P>There are 64 Garda youth diversion projects throughout the country. They are aimed at children who are aged between 12 and 18 years of age and who have offended or may be at risk of offending. These projects endeavour to engage the children in a range of activities designed to meet their specific requirements with a view to giving the child sufficient skills to allow them feel part of their community, school or place of employment. Various evaluations of the projects have concluded that they are a worthwhile and effective means of diverting children away from crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda national juvenile office has introduced a restorative justice programme for children who offend. Under the programme, victims of child offending are given the opportunity to meet the offender in order to discuss how the offence has affected the person as an individual. The Garda authorities state that early indications <Col N="2066"/>show this process to have significant potential for changing the behaviour of offenders.</P>
    <P>In addition to these national programmes, the Garda are involved in a number of local projects such as night time tours and splash week in <?oasys _dc24-?>Dublin south inner city and the youth achievement awards that take place throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The 2004 Estimates included a provision of &euro;58.359 million for routine overtime duties and an additional sum of &euro;7.519 million for overtime arising from EU Presidency policing duties. The total amount provided in 2004 amounts to &euro;65.878 million and equates to approximately 2.62 million overtime hours.</P>
    <P>The nature of policing duties is such that Garda management are obliged to immediately respond to all manner of emergencies. The most efficient and cost effective way to respond to these short-term demands for instantaneous additional Garda resources is through overtime working. Similarly the most cost effective way to respond to the additional demands placed upon the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a result of the EU Presidency was through overtime working.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of additional garda&iacute; will have an impact on the number of overtime hours worked by individual garda&iacute;. Given the nature of policing duties a certain amount of overtime will continue to be required.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 came into operation on 18 October 1999. It already contains comprehensive anti-discrimination workplace provisions directed at all employers in the public and private sectors. The 1998 Act contains detailed provisions aimed at promoting equality and combating discrimination and is based on the principle of equal treatment and non-discrimination in the workplace. The Act will be further enhanced by the enactment of the Equality Bill 2004 that transposes the following EU equality directives: the Race Directive 2000/43/EC; the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC; and the Gender Equal Treatment in Employment Directive 2002/73/EC.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Act prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on nine grounds, namely, gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the Traveller community. The Act is comprehensive and deals with all areas relevant to employment including access to employment, conditions of employment, remuneration, promotion and vocational training. It also applies to certain vocational bodies namely organisations of workers or employers and organisations that control entry to or the carrying on of a profession, vocation or occupation.</P><Col N="2068"/>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 also provides for the establishment of the Equality Authority, which replaced the Employment Equality Agency. The authority&rsquo;s remit is to work towards the elimination of discrimination and the promotion of equality of opportunity. Since the enactment of the Equal Status Act 2000 the remit was extended beyond the employment area to cover the provision of goods and services. The authority also provides information to the public on the Employment Equality Act 1998; the Equal Status Act 2000; the Maternity Protection Act 1994; the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 and the Parental Leave Act 1998.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority has broad powers to tackle discrimination and to promote equal treatment in the workplace. This includes its power under section 67 of the Employment Equality Act 1998, in cases which it considers to be of important principle, to assist a person in taking a case under the Employment Equality Act. The Equality Authority is also empowered under section 69 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to invite a business, group of businesses or industrial sector to carry out an equality review and-or prepare and implement an equality action plan and may itself carry out a review and prepare an action plan for that particular business, group of businesses or industrial sector. It is also empowered under section 85 of the Employment Equality Act to act in referring a case to the equality tribunal where it considers: discrimination or victimisation is being generally practised; discrimination or victimisation has occurred but the individual concerned has not referred the case; there is a failure to comply with an equal remuneration term or an equality clause either generally or in a particular case; an advertisement for employment is published or displayed which indicates or might reasonably be understood to indicate an intention to discriminate; a person has procured or attempted to procure another to do anything constituting discrimination or victimisation; and a person has procured or attempted to procure another to break an equal remuneration term or an equality clause.</P>
    <P>Recently the CEO of the Equality Authority suggested, at the launch of its 2003 annual report, that a statutory duty be placed on public bodies with a view to mainstreaming equality. The suggestion was considered in the context of preparation of the Equality Bill 2004. Regard was also given to section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 that creates a statutory obligation on public authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out their functions with due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in relation to religion and political opinion; gender; race; age; martial status; dependants; and sexual orientation. The Northern Ireland authorities commissioned an independent review of the implementation of section 75 focusing on how public bodies responded. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland is obliged to carry out a review <Col N="2069"/>of the effectiveness of section 75 next year. It would be wise to await the outcome of these reviews before further considering the creation of a similar legal obligation in this State.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am committed to enhancing and improving the capability of the courts system to respond to the many challenges faced by it. Earlier this year I signed new rules of court to facilitate the operation of the High Court&rsquo;s commercial list. The new rules provide for proceedings, where the claim or counter claim is not less than &euro;1 million, to be entered in a commercial list. The pre-trial procedure provides that a judge may fix time limits for the conduct of proceedings entered in the commercial list. He or she may also give initial directions to facilitate the determination of the hearing, including the holding of a case management conference to ensure that proceedings are prepared for trial in a manner that is expeditious and likely to minimise the costs of proceedings.</P>
    <P>In response to the increase in volume and complexity of the case load in the judicial review area, the president of the High Court assigned judges, on a dedicated basis, to deal with the judicial review lists. The president has also allocated judges time out of court to prepare the reserved judgments that are increasingly required in such cases. In assigning judicial personnel on a long-term basis to the judicial review lists it was necessary to give consideration to the competing needs of other areas of the High Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, in particular the need to secure, as a matter of priority, a substantial reduction of delay in trial of criminal cases before the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The object of the arrangements made by the president of the High Court, apart from ensuring the disposal of applications for judicial review with greater expedition, is to enable the Judiciary to identify accurately over a sustained period the sources of delay in disposal of judicial review applications. Another aim is to arrive at distinct case management approaches appropriate to the various categories of judicial review application. It is intended that at the end of the current legal year an evaluation of the experience of the judges assigned to the lists will be carried out with a view to formulating the most appropriate procedural solutions, and determining the appropriate level of judicial resources that should be allocated to disposal of cases.</P><Col N="2070"/>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the considerable reform being made in the area of personal injury litigation in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill that passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Also, the establishment by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It represents a radical new approach to the determination of personal injury claims. Provision is also being made in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill for the appointment of eight additional judges to improve services and reduce delays.</P>
    <P>The issue of merging the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court was examined by the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts established by the Courts Service after the Fennelly report. It recommended the retention of the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Court as separate jurisdictions. The report contains many other recommendations aimed at streamlining and improving the processing of criminal business before the courts. I am examining them with a view to implementation, where feasible.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2003 as many as 7,900 asylum applications were received. It represented a fall of 32% compared to 2002 when 11,634 asylum applications were received.</P>
    <P>At 30 June a total of 2,360 applications had been received in 2004, as compared with 4,089 received in the same period last year. It represents a decrease of approximately 50%. If these trends are maintained the projected level of applications for 2004 should be in the region of 4,500.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be absolutely certain of all of the factors involved in the reduction in asylum numbers in 2003. However, it is possible to say that the fall in applications was influenced by a combination of factors and strategies.</P>
    <P>The Government now has in place a comprehensive strategy for dealing with asylum claims. For example, there is a strengthened infrastructural and statutory framework for processing applications fairly and within shorter timescales to ensure that those in need of refugee protection receive it more speedily.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural framework is made up of two independent agencies, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Both were highly resourced over recent years with a result that applications were processed faster. At present 50% of appli<Col N="2071"/>cations are prioritised under the Refugee Act 1996 and those cases receive a first instance decision within six weeks of application. It is a well known fact that slow decision-making in a refugee determination process often gives rise to high numbers of unfounded applications being received. Enhancing the processing capacity of our refugee determination process so as to speed up decision-making without compromising fairness had an important impact on the number of unfounded claims.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of processing and the shortening of timescales for decisions was supported by the enhancement of the legislative base for dealing with asylum applications in the form, for example, of amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 by the Immigration Act 2003, that came into effect on 15 September 2003. These amendments were, <i>inter alia</i>, aimed at ensuring that asylum applicants participate more actively in the determination process and failure, for example, to co-operate with the asylum process can result in the rejection of an application. The Immigration Act 2003 also contains provisions for the accelerated processing of asylum applications, including prioritisation of certain claims; strengthened credibility provisions; greater use of appeals on the papers alone; designation of States as safe countries of origin and streamlined operation of the Dublin Convention and safe third country processes. All of the relevant amendments in the 2003 Act were based on the experience of operating the Refugee Act 1996 over the past few years.</P>
    <P>Central to the integrity of any asylum process is the ability to return persons found not to be in need of refugee protection, and who have no other protection needs, to their countries of origin. In this regard we are continuing to maintain the number of deportations being effected, with some 590 persons deported in 2003 and some 762 voluntary returns also taking place during this period. Up to end of June 2004 there have been 321 deportations effected and 358 voluntary returns. In the region of 90% of asylum applications received in the State are rejected on the basis that they do not meet the criteria for the award of refugee status as contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996 and in the 1951 Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>I am also of the view that the Supreme Court judgment in January 2003 in the case of Lobe and Osayande had an impact on the number of unfounded asylum applications being received in the State. The case dealt with the residency status of parents of an Irish born child.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence to show that our asylum determination process is being abused by criminal elements whose activities have clear implications for the security and authority of the State and the general economic welfare of its citizens. These activities also have implications for the preservation of the integrity and effectiveness of the <Col N="2072"/>asylum system as it operates in Ireland for those that are genuinely in need of protection. For the purpose of dealing with illegal immigration the Government provided increased resources to the Garda National Immigration Bureau. The bureau has also strengthened its international liaison arrangements with immigration authorities in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and France, that are major transit points for illegal immigration into the State, with a particular focus on trafficking activity.</P>
    <P>Amendments contained in the Immigration Act 2003 designed to strengthen our immigration procedures have also provided an enhanced legislative framework for the Garda to carry out more effective immigration controls. The 2003 Act makes provision for the introduction of carrier liability that obliges carriers bringing non-nationals into Ireland to satisfy themselves that the passengers whom they take on board at the point of departure have the correct documentation to allow them to disembark here. The provision operates in respect of traffic coming from outside the common travel area. It is having a major deterrent effect on illegal immigration.</P>
    <P>As with all policy areas for which I have responsibility, I will continue to review our approach to the asylum area. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that with an estimated &euro;353 million spent on asylum and immigration functions in 2003 alone, across a number of Departments, with &euro;120 million spent by my Department, it is incumbent on me to do so. Any changes that might be introduced in the future must ensure that our achievements in this important policy area are consolidated. The State must also continue to meet its obligations to genuine asylum seekers under the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and continue to respond in a fair but firm manner to abusive asylum claims.</P>

    <P>The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of garda&iacute; are examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question. One of the principal aims of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that will secure public confidence and that will address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.</P><Col N="2073"/>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the equality for women measure, my Department provided funding of &euro;380,000 for the ICTU project entitled Negotiating for Equality &mdash; Gender and Pay. It culminated in the recent conference held in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The most up to date figures on wage levels here shows that, on average, men earn approximately 15% per hour more than women. The data was compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute from the Living in Ireland Survey and encompasses overtime earnings, pensions and fringe benefits as well as regular wages. According to the ESRI, the main cause of the gender pay gap is the time lost from the labour market by women for child rearing. For example, by age <Col N="2076"/>45, women on average have nine years less experience than men. Women&rsquo;s over representation in low paid positions and their under representation in senior positions are also significant factors.</P>
    <P>As regards the pay gap between single and married people, this is explained by the fact that on average married people are older than single people and thus have longer labour market experience with resultant higher wages.</P>
    <P>My Department chaired a consultative group, set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to report to Government on actions required to address the gender pay gap. In November 2003 the group&rsquo;s report was finalised and formally presented to Government. It contains a number of recommendations addressing a wide range of Government policies including taxation, statutory minimum wages, education and training and the development of family friendly policies. In addition, my Department has commissioned to ESRI to research the gender pay gap among graduates. The report is due to be finalised at the end of 2004.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt><?oasys _cl10.5-?>
	<P>Strike action by prison doctors represented by the Irish Medical Organisation began on 4 May and is now in its tenth week. The action involves the complete withdrawal of medical officer services for prisoners and is in clear breach of Sustaining Progress. It is also contrary to the Irish Medical Council guidelines on emergency services and continuing care responsibilities in the context of a collective withdrawal of medical services.</P>
    <P>The strike has resulted in significant, unnecessary pain and suffering to prisoners. Since the outset of the strike prison nurses and medical orderlies have assisted prisoners, however possible, in these difficult and distressing circumstances. In addition, visiting psychiatric and dental services continue to be available. Where necessary prisoners are brought to the accident and emergency units of local hospitals.</P>
    <P>In view of the considerable suffering and risk posed to prisoners by the strike action, particularly in light of the inadequate emergency services provided by the striking doctors, a decision was made to seek the assistance of Army doctors to alleviate the worst effects in a small number of prisons. Both I and the Irish Prison Service greatly appreciate the assistance. It was sought solely to alleviate the unnecessary suffering of prisoners and not as an attempt to undermine the trade union rights of the striking doctors.</P>
    <P>The latest industrial relations efforts to resolve the prison doctors dispute have involved contacts between the Irish Prison Service and the IMO under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission. The latest contacts involved three meetings and correspondence between the parties <Col N="2078"/>over the past week. Last night they reached an impasse and no date has been set for a further meeting at the LRC.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is the ever increasing risk to the health and well-being of prisoners arising from the continuing widespread absence of general practitioner services for prisoners who are among the most vulnerable of patient groups. In light of the latest impasse, I have requested the director general of the Irish Prison Service to provide a full assessment of the current situation in the dispute and to indicate what possible further industrial relations options are available to assist in bringing the strike to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The provision of psychiatric services to prisoners was not directly affected by the dispute. All possible steps to comply with any psychiatric intervention recommended by the courts have been maintained. Discussions with the POA at the Labour Relations Commission are ongoing. It is hoped to conclude these discussions in the near future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that conflicting replies were given to the two parliamentary questions. It was never my intention to give less than full answers to them.</P>
    <P>The first question on 3 June asked if a particular person had, prior to his appointment as a judge, &ldquo;been previously appointed as a member of any State agency, board, committee, or similar posts.&rdquo; I answered that the person had been appointed by my predecessor as a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 3 August 2001.</P>
    <P>When I answered that question it had not been drawn to my attention that my predecessor had also nominated the person to a panel from which the Garda Commissioner can appoint a chairperson of a board to hear an appeal in a Garda disciplinary matter. If I had been made aware of that nomination I would have mentioned it in my reply even though the person concerned was <Col N="2080"/>never appointed as a chairperson of a disciplinary appeal board.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy asked a further question on 15 June, inquiring whether the person concerned had been appointed as a member of a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Appeal Board, the information on the previous nomination came to light and was brought to my attention. I immediately wrote to the Deputy, in advance of my reply to this question, to give him the information, whether or not it was technically comprehended by the previous question. I did this in the interest of full disclosure and with the objective of addressing the spirit and not simply the letter of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>As to the details of the nomination of this person to the panel in question, and As I explained both in my letter to the Deputy and my reply to the question on 15 June, the person was not appointed chairman of any appeal board. He automatically ceased to be on the panel when he was appointed a judge in November 2001.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>his views on the fact that parents in this State pay approximately 20% of their earnings on child care compared to the EU average of 8%; and the measures he intends to introduce to bring the figure for this State in line with the EU average.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assuming that the figures referred to by the Deputy in his question are from a report published in 1998 by the European observatory on national family policies called A Synthesis of National Family Policies 1996. Since the publication of that report, the Government has funded a wide range of initiatives in order to develop and increase the number of child care places available in the State and has also increased the amount of child benefit available to all parents.</P>
    <P>Child care has been identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This was in direct response to the recommendations of the expert working group on child care which was established under Partnership 2000 to develop a strategy for the development and delivery of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The report of the expert working group contained a series of recommendations in relation to the development of quality child care services to meet the increasing demand by parents for child care places.</P>
    <P>My Department was designated as the lead Department for the development of child care and introduced the Equal Opportunities Child care Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, which provides EU and Exchequer funding and aims, <i>inter alia</i>, to increase the number of centre based child care places by 50% before the end of the programme. Total funding available under the programme exceeds &euro;449 million. The programme provides capital grant assistance to create and enhance new and existing child care facilities; staffing grant assistance to community based and not for profit organisations whose child care services have a strong focus on supporting the child care needs of disadvantaged families and funding for quality improvement.</P>
    <P>To date, &euro;218 million in funding has been allocated under the programme to child care facilities, in capital grants to private providers and in capital and staffing support grants for community based and not for profit groups. It is estimated that this will provide for the creation of an estimated 29,000 new child care places and will support over 27,000 existing child care places. I am happy to inform the Deputy that, by the end of <Col N="2082"/>2003, almost 18,000 additional child care places had come on stream thanks to the support of the EOCP. The Deputy may be aware that the programme target is 28,000 new places by end 2006, so the progress to date is very satisfying.</P>
    <P>Government policy in the area of child support aims to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, it has been decided that, as a matter of policy, child benefit will be the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of income status. The monthly rates of child benefit since 1997 have increased by &euro;93.51 at the lower rate and &euro;115.78 at the higher rate, increases of 246% and 234% respectively, compared with inflation of 26.9%. This level of increase is unprecedented and delivers on the Government&rsquo;s objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to all parents. It is hoped that the increases in child benefit in conjunction with the substantial investment in child care under the EOCP will significantly increase the availability of quality child care</P>

	<P>As part of the development of the fixed charge processing system, or FCPS, a contract has been placed for the provision of services such as the printing and posting of fixed charge notices and other documents. In addition, a tender process has been also completed for the <Col N="2083"/>provision of payment facilities which will be brought on stream following the enactment of the necessary enabling legislation by the Oireachtas. The Deputy may be aware that an interdepartmental working group is also currently considering the scope for the provision, monitoring and processing of the output of speed detection cameras by the private sector. I am satisfied that these innovations, together with the FCPS, will considerably reduce the administrative burden on operational garda&iacute; and facilitate an increased Garda focus on the prevention and detection of road traffic offences.</P>

	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, or CE, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at 3 years, effective from April 2000. All time worked on CE after this date is taken into account by F&Aacute;S when determining an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for the programme. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training-education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals. At present there are 20,114 persons registered on CE schemes. Over the period 1 June 2004 to 31 May <Col N="2084"/>2005 approximately 3,478 of these participants will have reached the three year limit on completion of their current contracts.</P>
    <P>The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. Participants are considered for such an extension if on reaching the end of their normal entitlements on CE they are likely to experience difficulty in getting employment. A number of CE participants have difficulty in progressing to open labour market employment due to their age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the focus and the terms of participation on CE are under continuing examination including further consultation with the social partners. The outcome of this process will inform any future adjustments in the structure and the terms and conditions of participation on the CE programme.</P>

	<P>As part of the decentralisation programme, it was decided that a minimum of 250 of my Department&rsquo;s core staff would decentralise to Carlow. It was also decided that four of my Department&rsquo;s agencies, F&Aacute;S, National Standards Authority of Ireland, Health and Safety Authority and Enterprise Ireland, would decentralise to Birr, Arklow, Thomastown and Shannon respectively. The decentralisation to these locations was taken in the context of the wider decentralisation programme announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the Budget. In selecting locations, a wide range of factors was taken into account. The main factors and criteria considered by Government included <Col N="2085"/>the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices, the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within one region, the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved, the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected, including the existence of good transport links by road, rail and air.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 78 together.</P>
	<P>Arising from EU enlargement on 1 May 2004, Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on non-EEA labour changed fundamentally. On that date, Ireland lifted all work permit requirements in respect of workers from the ten new member states and it was decided that in future, most of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas labour needs and all of its needs for low and unskilled workers should be met from within the <Col N="2087"/>enlarged EEA. The EEA consists of the EU together with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.</P>
    <P>Applications for work permits are now being considered by reference to the following criteria. The job requires explicitly identified skills. The onus is on the employer to provide job and person specifications which show such requirements. Such skills cannot be sourced within the enlarged EEA, after a genuine effort and at a realistic wage; The Department will continue to refer employers to local F&Aacute;S offices and will develop, in consultation with relevant agencies, clear guidelines on testing the EU labour market and appropriate ranges of pay; training and upskilling of Irish and EU workers is not an option, for stated reasons; and the identified candidate can be shown to possess the required qualifications and skills. The employer will be required to demonstrate that this is so.</P>
    <P>My Department, informed by its experience of supply and demand, proposes that for the time being, it will continue with its current policy that has proven to be successful in reducing dependence on unskilled low-paid non-EU labour. This consists of using the current list of ineligible occupations as well as referring all applications for work permits, which do not meet with the criteria above, back to the applicant with the recommendation that EU workers are recruited instead. Work permits are not granted in respect of job categories on the ineligible list including child minding in domestic circumstances.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
     <Quest>the options available to a non-national working here with a work permit and not receiving the minimum wage; the options which are open to them if they decide to leave their current employer as a result of not receiving the minimum wage; if there are circumstances in which they would be granted another work permit to remain here with a new employer if they were to leave as a result of not receiving the minimum wage; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[21116/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Work permits are only granted where there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. When an employer applies for a work permit in order to employ a non-EEA national, the Department requires a statement outlining the main functions of the job, the salary, any deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. If there is evidence that a particular employer is exploiting workers for whom work permits are held I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate of my Department for investigation and further action and to the work permit section.</P><Col N="2088"/>
    <P>The main option open to an employee on a current work permit who finds that they are let go and without a job is to find a new employer who is prepared to apply for a work permit to employ them. In such circumstances, my Department is prepared to facilitate sympathetic and flexible consideration of a new work permit application in respect of that employee.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in reply to a related question by the Deputy yesterday where an incident involves injury to a member of the Defence Forces, a formal court of inquiry is convened to take evidence and to make recommendations on the matters referred to it. In this case, the court of inquiry has not been convened as the incident is currently the subject of a civil action in the courts. I am advised that, once the matter has been disposed of by the courts, a court of inquiry will be convened. As the matter is the subject of an action by the individual involved and as the matter is still before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time. I can assure the Deputy that, following the conclusion of the civil case, a court of inquiry will be held which will undertake a comprehensive examination of all aspects of this case.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget 2004 statement provides for the transfer of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin based Civil Service staff to Newbridge and the transfer of Defence Forces headquarters staff to the Curragh. A wide range of factors were taken into account and balanced in selecting locations, including the need to achieve a fit with the National Spatial Strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved and the existence of good transport links, by road, rail and air, and the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected.</P>

	<P>As I have outlined in previous replies the Chief of Staff received a submission from a retired army officer who served at Jadotville seeking a review of the events of September 1961. The Chief of Staff arranged for the submission to be examined by a board of military officers. The Chief of Staff received a report from the board of officers in mid-June and subsequently sought clarification on a number of matters arising. This clarification, which involved research of archival material, has been received by the Chief of Staff within the last few days and the full report is under examination. Pending the outcome of the examination, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. I will carefully consider any recommendations that the Chief of Staff may make on the issue.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted nine applications under the 2003 special beef premium <Col N="2090"/>scheme and also had 51 animals eligible under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme. Advance payment at the rate of 80% of premium has issued in respect of the first four applications under the special beef premium scheme and in respect of 32 animals under the slaughter premium scheme. The person named applied for premium on eight animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. The 80% advance instalment amounting to &euro;1434.56 issued on 17 October 2003.</P>
    <P>Further payments under these schemes cannot be processed pending the completion investigations into identification and registration issues in relation to bovine animals on the holding of the person named. He also applied for 2003 extensification premium but payment of premium cannot be considered until the above investigations are finalised. My Department will be <?oasys _jy?>writing to the person named in this matter shortly.</P>

	<P>In 1998, the person named included lands in his area aid application which were already included in another person&rsquo;s REPS plan. The person named was himself also in REPS. In these circumstances my Department had no option but to consider all the lands to be one single farming unit, which was eligible for only one REPS payment.</P>
    <P>Both parties were informed directly of this position. They were invited to submit a joint application for REPS including all the lands. They did not avail of this invitation and so my Department had to seek full recovery of all the REPS payments that both had received. Recovery of the REPS payments received by the person named is continuing by way of withholding payments for which he is eligible under other EU-funded schemes. These cases have been reviewed in my Department, and the foregoing is my Department&rsquo;s decision based on all the information available. It is open to the person named and the other party to seek to include all the lands in a new single application for REPS, subject to satisfactory arrangements for full recovery of the outstanding debts in both cases.</P>

     <QRef>[21017/04]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is referring to Johne&rsquo;s disease, cases of which have occurred in the national herd over at least the past half-century and which has been a notifiable disease in this country since 1955. The disease is widespread in other EU member states and worldwide. It is a chronic infectious disease of cattle which gives rise to gradual wasting, loss of condition and, in the case of dairy cattle, significant losses in milk yield. It is caused by infection with the bacterium <i>Mycobacterium avium</i>, subspecies <i>paratuberculosis</i>, known as MAP.</P>
    <P>Until early 2003, my Department&rsquo;s approach to notified cases of the disease was to slaughter the affected animals and pay compensation. On the basis of an assessment of the number of cases arising and from research data on a test and cull strategy, it became apparent that this approach was not effective in arresting and reversing the <Col N="2094"/>increasing prevalence of the disease. Consequently, such an approach has been dispensed with and a strategic review of our approach to tackling the disease was undertaken by my Department. It is clear that nothing less than a fully integrated strategy involving all of the relevant stakeholders and with each playing a defined role will be effective. My Department alone cannot eliminate the disease from the national herd. Accordingly, the strategic review has involved consultation with all the relevant interests. This process has indicated a common recognition of the problem, an acceptance that only a fully integrated and sustained strategy will be effective and a willingness on the part of stakeholders to play active roles in implementing such a strategy. The process also generated a number of very useful proposals of a practical nature.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the nature of the disease it will take a number of years of sustained commitment to effectively tackle it. The strategy will therefore involve elements which can be put into effect in the short term and others which will be implemented over a longer period. My Department, in conjunction with other interests, has been working on finalising a number of the short-term elements and will shortly be passing on the relevant information to stakeholders. Once this has been done, it is my intention that all elements of the new national Johne&rsquo;s disease strategy will be quickly drawn together in conjunction with all the stakeholders, announced, promoted vigorously by all concerned and implemented. Apart from any other considerations, the success of the new strategy is important if Irish livestock farmers are to be protected against the significant production and income losses associated with the disease.</P>
    <P>As far as any putative public health dimension is concerned, there are concerns in some quarters that MAP may be associated with Crohn&rsquo;s disease in humans. It is most important to accurately reflect the essence of current scientific thinking and research in the matter. While MAP organisms have been recovered from many Crohn&rsquo;s patients, and notwithstanding the fact that the matter has been subject to much research internationally, it is important to recognise that a cause-effect link has not to date been proven and to note that there remains significant divergence in scientific opinion on the matter. It should also be noted that in 2000, the scientific committee on animal health and welfare of the European Commission concluded that there was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion about the suggested link between these two diseases. Furthermore, when consulted by my Department in the matter, the scientific committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland advised that there is insufficient evidence to confirm a link between Johne&rsquo;s disease and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. As with all such matters, my Department will continue to monitor further scientific developments and thinking in this area.</P>

	<P>In his budget statement for 2004 the Minister for Finance listed the wide range of factors that were taken into account in selecting Departments and agencies for decentralisation and the locations for the new decentralised offices. These factors include, in selecting Departments and agencies for decentralisation: the imperative that customer service standards are not adversely affected by decentralisation; the core business and nature of the relevant Departments and agencies; the location of the customer base; and the need to ensure that the units involved are large enough to provide career opportunities for staff either within their own Department or in another Department within a reasonable distance; and, in selecting locations for decentralised offices: the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy in terms of the gateways and hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved; the existence of good transport links by road, rail or air and the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
     <Quest>the extent to which assistance is available to new entrants to farming with particular reference to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>One of my main objectives is to ensure a policy framework which will allow agriculture and the agri-food sector to develop to its full potential. The recent reform of the CAP will lead to the development of a sustainable and competitive sector. This in turn will ensure that agriculture will remain an attractive career option for young people.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are a number of specific measures aimed at encouraging young persons into farming. The principal mechanism is the installation aid scheme, which was established pursuant to the National Development Plan 2000-2006, and the early retirement scheme. Under the installation scheme, a grant of &euro;9,523 is available to farmers under the age of 35 who became established in farming for the first time on or after 1 January 2000. I understand that the person referred to received the full amount available under the scheme in February 2003. In addition, top-up grants are available to young farmers under both the dairy hygiene scheme and the farm waste management scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the early retirement scheme, older farmers are encouraged to retire early from farming in order to qualify for a pension which is jointly funded by the EU and by the national Exchequer, thereby encouraging their replacement by younger farmers able to improve, where necessary, the economic viability of agricultural holdings. The changes I introduced to the milk quota regime in Ireland in 2000 have been very successful in achieving the overall objective of putting quota definitively in the hands of active committed producers, at the lowest possible cost. The milk quota restructuring scheme is now the principal means by which additional milk quota is acquired by producers. Under the scheme, priority in the allocation of quota is given to specific categories of producers and in particular to new and recent entrants to dairying.</P>
    <P>In 2000, I put in place a scheme for the allocation of 5 million gallons of the additional quota negotiated under Agenda 2000 to young milk producers who satisfied certain defined criteria. The 3,099 eligible applicants each received an <Col N="2097"/>allocation of 1,700 gallons. Furthermore, in 2001, an additional 4.5 million gallons was allocated to young farmers and 3,442 applicants each received an extra 1,300 gallons under that scheme.</P>
    <P>I have also provided for milk production partnerships within the quota system in order to allow for flexibility in farming practice by combining two enterprises and quotas. Standard milk production partnerships were provided for in 2002. Following a review of the first year of the operation of the partnerships, I introduced new regulations to provide for the registration of new entrant-parent milk production partnerships. These arrangements allow a qualified young farmer to be part of a milk production enterprise in partnership with his or her parent without having to establish separate facilities. Such partnerships provide an opportunity for trained young farmers to get established in the industry and have access to quota, as a priority category, under a milk quota restructuring scheme. In light of experience, I have introduced some further flexibility into the partnership arrangements. In the new milk quota regulations which I signed in the last few weeks, I have made a number of amendments designed to help prospective partners.</P>
    <P>Partnership arrangements within the milk quota system have a very useful role to play in providing for the type of flexibility necessary to respond to the demands on today&rsquo;s milk producers. The uptake for the new entrant-parent partnerships has been particularly encouraging. I will continue to keep the arrangement under review to ensure it is best suited to the needs of the sector.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of tax incentives available to encourage young persons into farming, which include 100% stock relief for young trained farmers for four years after transfer; 100% stamp duty relief on transfers of agricultural land and buildings to young trained farmers; 90% agricultural relief on capital acquisitions tax; income tax exemptions for land leased by farmers over 40 to non-connected persons; and retirement relief on capital gains tax for farmers over 55.</P>
    <P>Teagasc devotes a considerable amount of time and resources into the promotion of farming as a career. National advertising campaigns are conducted twice each year promoting the full range of their education and training courses. A total of &euro;140,000 was spent in 2003 on advertising campaigns in this area. In addition, career events are held at all eight colleges twice each year. The purpose of the open days is promote the courses at the colleges and careers in agriculture and horticulture. Invitations are issued to all second level schools and to more than 900 guidance counsellors to attend these events and they are advertised in the national newspapers. In addition, parents and Teagasc clients are invited to attend.</P>
    <P>A detailed course prospectus is produced each year outlining the full range of Teagasc courses and these are also sent to every second level school and guidance counsellor. Teagasc aims to <Col N="2098"/>have a presence at all career guidance seminars and events. In addition, education officers and college teachers visit as many second-level schools as possible to promote agricultural education and training. Details of all Teagasc careers events and the full text of the Teagasc prospectus are available for downloading from the Qualifax website. In addition, full details regarding courses and colleges are available on the Teagasc public website, <i>www.teagasc.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>On 27 November 2002, I announced that a major review of national flooding policy would be carried out. The full published terms of reference of the review were to examine the causes and extent of the flooding, the impact of the flooding on different sections of society, e.g. farmers, householders and businesses, and how the State should respond the different categories of flooding and recommend which agencies should have responsibility in each case; to develop criteria for the prioritisation of expenditure between response programmes and within programmes where appropriate; to examine the extent and adequacy of existing powers and process and recommend any changes and any new or additional powers considered necessary; to identify strategies to manage any increase in the present extent of areas at risk of flooding, with particular reference to current predictions regarding the effects of climate change; and to examine criteria for initiation of any future humanitarian aid schemes.</P><Col N="2099"/>
    <P>A review group was established comprising representatives of the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, IBEC and the Irish Farmers Association. The group has met on nine occasions. At its first meeting in January 2003 the group agreed to undertake a public consultation process. Submissions were invited from the public through advertisements in the media on 24 January 2003. A total of 71 written submissions were received from all sectors of society. Following the closing date for receipt of submissions members of the review groups also held meeting with 14 key agencies and groups to facilitate discussions on particular issues.</P>
    <P>Following a number of drafts, a copy of the review group&rsquo;s final draft report was circulated to all Departments for comments earlier this year. On receipt of comments the final draft report was forwarded to the Department of Finance for consideration and submission to Government in March 2004.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that Dublin County Council exhibited a schedule of works in February of this year, as required under Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, which comprises the next phase of works to be undertaken on the River Tolka in the city area. The OPW has agreed to undertake a number of these works on behalf of the council <Col N="2100"/>and these include the construction of walls and embankments on the Northern bank downstream of Drumcondra Bridge and the lowering of Distillery Weir. Further works, which include the replacement of Distillery Road Bridge and the widening of some parts of the river around the bridge are the subject of negotiations between the council and property owners and developers as part of a proposed development in that area.</P>
    <P>The OPW mobilised on-site in early June and works have commenced on an earthen embankment immediately downstream of Tolka Park at the rear of Richmond Road. The lowering of Distillery Weir has almost been completed at this stage. Further works, including the construction of walls on the northern bank, will be commenced when the final design has been received from the council. In addition to these works, the OPW is completing top-soiling of the area around the new Woodville Road footbridge at present. Works completed in phase 1 last year downstream of Drumcondra Bridge included the repair of the river wall along 112-114 Tolka Road and the general cleaning of the channel to Luke Kelly Bridge. The OPW and the city council are committed to completing all aspects of phase 2 in the current year.</P>

The Deputy is further aware that at a meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation I indicated that the State would play its part in flood risk reduction and that in turn, the insurance industry would be expected to act in a reasonable manner. At my invitation the IIF made a submission to the flood policy review group and subsequently met with OPW officials. This meeting clarified aspects of its submission and provided an opportunity for the IIF to be briefed on the State&rsquo;s overall strategy on flood management, including the OPW&rsquo;s proposals for developing flooding hazard maps.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the movement of staff as a direct result of the relocation of the Collector General&rsquo;s office to Limerick commenced in 1993 and was completed by 1996. A total of 550 posts were transferred under the decentralisation programme to the office in Limerick. Over the three-year period approximately 290 staff took a direct move at the same grade. Of these 268 transferred into Revenue from other Departments for Limerick and approximately 22 Revenue staff transferred at their current grade. A total of 294 staff were promoted for Limerick &mdash; 150 Revenue staff and 144 staff from other Departments. Approximately 140 staff were recruited at clerical assistant grade for the Collector General&rsquo;s office in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of the Collector General&rsquo;s office to Limerick coincided with decentralisation to Nenagh and Ennis and resulted in approximately 134 staff moving to other offices within Revenue which were not decentralising. A total of 24 staff moved out of Revenue to other Departments. Over the three-year period, there was natural movement of staff into and out of the Collector General&rsquo;s office.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that tackling oil smuggling and oil laundering is a priority area for Revenue enforcement officers. By way of illustrating the priority given to combating illegality in this area, during the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, eight oil laundries were detected and 134,000 litres of laundered oil were seized, along with associated plant and equipment. Four offenders have been prosecuted and convicted of oil laundering offences, and a further eight cases are pending. On average, each of the laundries detected was capable <Col N="2104"/>of processing up to 50,000 litres of oil per week. This could have resulted in sizeable losses to the Exchequer if left undetected.</P>
    <P>In addition to the focus on oil laundries, checks are also carried out at filling stations throughout the country and in the past 12 months these have resulted in 17 detections being made and more than 237,000 litres of laundered oil being seized. Prosecutions are pending in 13 of these cases. In the case of oil smuggling, 23 seizures, amounting to 208,000 litres of oil, mainly kerosene, have been made during the 12 months ending 30 June 2004. In addition, six offenders have been successfully prosecuted and a further five cases are pending. The Revenue Commissioners also advise me that combating this illegal trade involves close interaction with other agencies and in particular with the Criminal Assets Bureau and with customs officers from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, the legislation and powers necessary for tackling oil fraud are kept under continuous review. Most recently, legislative amendments were introduced in the Finance Act 2003 to facilitate the prosecution of cases involving the use or sale of laundered oil.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>the credence which was placed on a dossier (details supplied) by the Government; the way in which Ireland&rsquo;s behaviour as a member of the UN Security Council was affected by this; and the reason the Government continued, realising the baseless and biased nature of the allegations contained in that dossier, to use that material to promote a patently lawless attack against the Republic of Iraq.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The contents of the British dossier in question had no bearing on the Government&rsquo;s position in relation to the threat posed by Iraq or on Ireland&rsquo;s behaviour as a member of the United Nations Security Council. The Government did not rely on UK or US intelligence sources.</P>
    <P>In arriving at a position on the threat posed by Iraq, the Government, like most governments around the world, was guided by a number of <Col N="2105"/>factors. First, the hard evidence that Iraq had at one time been in possession of chemical weapons and had used them both in its war with Iran and against its own people. Second, that it had sought to develop nuclear weapons capability. Third, that it had persistently defied the demands of the Security Council that it verifiably dismantle its WMD capabilities. Fourth, that it refused to co-operate fully with UN weapons inspectors. Finally, that the UN inspectors were not satisfied that Iraq had accounted for its stocks of WMD. I reiterate that the Government did not base its position on intelligence provided by the either the US or the UK.</P>
    <P>At the time when Security Council Resolution 1441 was unanimously adopted, the Security Council was acting in the belief that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. This belief was very widely shared in the international community. The General Affairs Council of the EU at its meeting of 18-19 November 2002 stated three times in the clearest terms its belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This was despite the fact that there was disagreement among many member states about how to deal with the situation. In his report of 6 March to the Security Council, Dr. Blix, head of Unmovic, the arms inspection team mandated to investigate Iraq&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction, said that many questions relating to Iraq&rsquo;s weapons of mass destruction remained unanswered. The fact remains that, whether or not these weapons still existed at the time, Iraq was in material breach of its disarmament obligations through its failure to co-operate fully with the arms inspectors in carrying out their mandate of verifying that Iraq no longer held weapons of mass destruction. War could have been averted if Saddam Hussein had co-operated fully with the arms inspectors mandated by the UN Security Council. Saddam Hussein was manifestly unwilling to do this. He began to offer minimal, but still thoroughly unsatisfactory, co-operation only when military pressure started to mount.</P>
    <P>I totally reject any assertion that the Government promoted an attack against the Republic of Iraq. We in fact worked at the Security Council to avert it. We also decided that Ireland would not participate in the coalition&rsquo;s proposed military action against Iraq. A motion to endorse the Government&rsquo;s approach was approved by this House on 20 March 2003.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In December 1999 the Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech that the Government intended to proceed with a new, more radical programme of decentralisation, involving up to 10,000 civil and public servants. That intention was also signalled in An Agreed Programme for Government 2002-2007. Subsequent to his original announcement, the Minister for Finance and his Department had extensive consultations about the issue with interested parties, including other Departments, civil service staff unions and associations and the Strategic Management Initiative implementation group of Secretaries General. The Minister also received submissions, representations and inquiries from or on behalf of a large number of centres throughout the country seeking to be included in the new programme.</P>
    <P>In proposing to the Government on 3 December 2003 the Departments, divisions of Departments and offices to be included in the decentralisation programme, the Minister for Finance had particular regard to their nature and core business and to the location of their customer bases as well as to the need to ensure a fit with the National Spatial Strategy. Other issues considered by the Minister and by the Government included the desirability of clustering a decentralised Department&rsquo;s units within a region, the scope for clustering of cross-departmental functions, staff retention and career opportunities and the ability of particular locations to absorb the numbers of new residents involved. Under the programme approved by the Government, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs will be transferred to Limerick. The Department is now working with the Office of Public Works in order to secure suitable premises in Limerick for the directorate.</P>

The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be &euro;36.54 million.

    <P>The second category consists of properties transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002.

At this stage, transfers of properties to the value of approximately &euro;27 million have been agreed in principle. A number of other properties have been identified which have the potential to finalise this schedule in the near future. I do not intend to give details regarding the identity of individual properties at this point. However, I hope to be in a position to publish the full list of properties in the very near future.</P>

	<P>My Department has received applications from the school referred to by the Deputy for special education resources, SER. It is my intention that all applications for SER received by 30 June 2004, including the application for the <Col N="2109"/>pupil in question, will be responded to before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year.</P>
    <P>The teacher allocations involved will be made in the context of a new weighted system which I announced recently. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs; for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all-boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all-girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all-girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year. The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher-incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence disabilities.</P>
    <P>My Department now proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</P>

	<P>My Department has received an application for an increase in special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. Special needs assistants may be approved to support a pupil who has a significant medical need for such assistance or a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a <Col N="2110"/>danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 07/02. This circular may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website under &ldquo;Children with Special Needs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to review existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. The basic purpose of the review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs. Since 1998, the number of special needs assistants in primary schools has grown from about 300 to more than 5,500 full-time and part-time posts. I assure the Deputy that special needs assistants posts will be retained in schools where there is a continuing care need in accordance with Circular 07/02.</P>
    <P>Account is being taken of existing levels of special needs assistant support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned. Details of the appeals mechanism will be set out in a communication to schools.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to Circular SP ED 09/04 which may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, under &ldquo;Children with special needs&rdquo;. The circular advises schools that have applied for special needs assistant support that they will be notified of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year.

	<P>The development plan drawn up by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, envisages that there should ultimately be seven educational psychologists in County Donegal. It has, however, proved difficult to recruit suitably qualified personnel to serve in the NEPS north-western region.</P>
    <P>At present, NEPS is in a position to assign 2.4 whole-time equivalent psychologists to the county. This allows for the provision of a psycho<Col N="2112"/>logical service to approximately 50% of all school pupils in the county but unfortunately this does not yet include the area mentioned by the Deputy. The north-western region has been identified as one of the priority regions for assignment of psychologists to be appointed in the future and every effort will be made to encourage new recruits to work in the region. From within NEPS, a new appointment has recently been made of a NEPS regional director for the north-western region and a senior psychologist has asked to transfer to the region. They are both in the process of moving from Dublin to the north-west.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this will allow for an increase in the level of service being offered to County Donegal during the next school year.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has provided annual funding of &euro;63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, this funding has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. Children with dyslexia have, up to now, generally been catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present, there are approximately 2,600 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system. The total cost of these services is in the region of &euro;180 million annually.</P>
    <P>Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. <Col N="2113"/>All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has recently developed a new weighted system of allocation of teaching supports for special needs pupils. An additional 350 teaching posts are being allocated to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new arrangements will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and dyslexia, and those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs. Further details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year. My Department has not had meetings with the Department of Finance to discuss possible funding assistance for parents of children with dyslexia.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of Sustaining Progress provide that the final two phases of the benchmarking increase and the general round increases is dependent, in the case of each grade, sector and organisation, on verification of co-operation with flexibility and change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action on matters covered by the agreement. The agreement also provides for arrangements to be put in place to verify that the conditions for the payment of these increases have been met.</P>
    <P>The trade union representing the school secretaries issued an instruction to their members not to make any supervision or substitution payments to teachers in respect of absences now covered by the revised supervision or substitution scheme. This action was regarded as industrial action which offended the stable industrial relations clause of Sustaining Progress and was only recently resolved in the context of agreeing a modernisation agenda for school secretaries in May 2004.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently consulting with the managerial authorities of schools to verify satisfactory progress on implementation of the modernisation agenda and to ensure that the con<Col N="2114"/>ditions necessary for payment of the benchmarking awards have been met. This approach has been approved by the Education Sector Performance Verification Group. This consultation process will be concluded shortly, which will allow the Secretary General of my Department to make his assessment of the progress achieved. If, following his assessment, the level of progress achieved warrants payment of the relevant pay increases, the necessary arrangements for payment will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

    <P>It is my intention that all applications for special educational resources received after 31 August 2003 and by 30 June 2004, which includes applications from the school in question, will be responded to before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year. Applications for resource teacher support that were received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 for which a response is outstanding have been considered and schools have now been notified of the outcome. This outcome indicates to schools the resources that may be put in place immediately.</P><Col N="2115"/>
    <P>The teacher allocations involved will be made in the context of a new weighted system which I announced recently. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs &mdash; for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all-boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools or all-girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all-girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils. It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</P>
    <P>The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher-incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence disabilities.</P>
    <P>My Department now proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model.

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences, with costed proposals totalling &euro;244 million extra, of which &euro;66.3 million is a recurring annual cost. Funds are not available at present to <Col N="2117"/>progress the strategy on the scale recommended in the report. Of the 39 recommendations, 4 are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>In particular, important progress is being made in the following areas: curricular reform and in-service support &mdash; with new syllabuses already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry; revised syllabuses in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04; and work under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national in-service programmes for teachers: resourcing &mdash; with substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002; an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment; allied with the announcement in 2003 of a once-off grant scheme, likely to cost of the order of &euro;12 million, to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus. To date some 614 schools in the free education scheme have opted to provide the revised junior certificate science syllabus from 2003-04, and grants of<?oasys _jy?>&euro;10.1 million were issued to these schools this year.</P>
    <P>The revised junior certificate science syllabus provides for a more investigative approach to science education, with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme. </P>
    <P>This hands-on approach is seen as critically important to enhance the attractiveness of the subject and encourage more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle. ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and the new TV Scope programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education. Provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path. Reviews of mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken. Awareness measures supported by industry and third-level colleges linking with schools. The launch of the new Discover Science and Engineering programme in October 2003, bringing together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy. </P>
    <P>The announcement by the T&aacute;naiste in December 2003 of plans for Ireland&rsquo;s first interactive learning centre for children and adults, designed to give visitors a hands-on experience and understanding of science and to be an education and outreach centre for teachers and pupils. The exploration station is due to open in <Col N="2118"/>2006 and will be sited in the OPW Heuston Gate development in Kilmainham, Dublin.</P>
    <P>This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</P>

	<P>The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003. The report indicates that for the 1994 cohort of students the adjusted senior cycle retention rate is 81.8%.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s commitment to the retention of young people who are at risk of early school leaving is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains the Special Initiative on Tackling Educational Disadvantage: Literacy, Numeracy and Early School Leavers.</P>
    <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issue of retention rates in schools comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as interventions to prevent early school leaving. The Education (Welfare) Act, which was fully commenced on 5 July 2002, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents and guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a number of programmes which provide additional supports for children in primary and post primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The Department&rsquo;s main programme for tackling early school leaving is the school completion programme, which was launched in 2002. <Col N="2119"/>This programme incorporates the learning experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level. It is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling early school leaving. There are currently 405 schools, 295 primary and 110 post-primary, participating in the school completion programme.</P>
    <P>With regard to curriculum reform, my Department&rsquo;s strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme, vocational preparation and training and the leaving certificate applied.</P>

    <P>A cross-governmental working group was established to consider proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit. Its terms of reference included defining the type of organisation which should come within the ambit of the vetting process.

    <P>My Department has been informed by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport service on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, that the pupil referred to in the details supplied is residing 1.7 miles from his nearest national school, which is referred to in the details supplied. The pupil is therefore not eligible for free school transport. The pupil may avail of concessionary fare-paying transport to his nearest national school, subject <Col N="2123"/>to no extra State cost being incurred by way of extending or altering the route of service and on condition that spare seats exist after all children who are fully eligible for school transport have been accommodated.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act was fully commenced on 5 July 2002. Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.</P>
    <P>To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally. It has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate and educational services and the necessary support and delivery staff. The overall staffing complement is 84, comprising 16 HQ and support staff, five regional managers, 11 senior educational welfare officers and 52 educational welfare officers.</P>
    <P>To date, 80 staff have been appointed by the board, including four regional managers, ten senior educational welfare officers and 52 educational welfare officers. I understand that the <Col N="2124"/>board is arranging to fill the vacancies at regional manager and senior educational welfare officer level in the near future.</P>
    <P>As provided for under section 10 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, I have arranged for officials of my Department to work with the board to ensure that any opportunities for integrated working between educational welfare officers and staff on other educational disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element are exploited to the maximum. I consider the implementation of protocols for such integrated working on attendance matters to be between the NEWB and, in particular, the home-school-community liaison scheme, the school completion programme and the visiting teacher service for Travellers to be very important. When in place, these will assist the NEWB in carrying out its remit and ensure that all available existing resources are utilised to the full. As I have stated previously, I consider it essential that the board should focus on ways in which it can deliver the service with the personnel it has the moment and with the help of other people involved in the area. When this has been achieved, I will consider the position again taking into account the available resources.</P>
    <P>At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed since early December in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school-going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an EWO allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>

	<P>Since the beginning of 2004, my Department has been engaged in the process of recruiting five additional psychologists to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Four of the five started on 19 April 2004, and a fifth is expected to join shortly. Two vacancies arising from resignations are also being filled.</P>
    <P>There are 127 psychologists currently employed in NEPS, including the four new entrants, plus three on career break. Further <Col N="2125"/>recruitment of psychologists to NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>
    <P>Pending NEPS reaching its full staffing complement, I have allocated funds to allow schools to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. The scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, is an interim measure, aimed at providing an assessment service to schools that do not yet have access to the full educational psychological service provided by NEPS.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of primary and secondary schools, which are privately owned. It would not be reasonable to expect the State to meet the full insurance costs of privately owned buildings.</P>
    <P>Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by way of <i>per capita</i> grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance. I have previously made known my view that moving to a position where the Government covers the insurance costs of secondary schools may encourage the insurance sector to keep increasing premia on the basis that the State would meet the cost. Such an approach would also reduce the incentive for school management to reduce risks.</P>
    <P>I am committed to improving the funding position of secondary schools in the light of available resources. At a time of increased financial con<Col N="2126"/>straints, the recent announcement of further significant increases in the funding of primary and secondary schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary schools the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57 in 1997 to &euro;121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. In the case of secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant now amounts to &euro;274 from 1 January last as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. In the case of disadvantaged schools this increase has brought the total <i>per capita</i> grant to &euro;312. In addition, the support grant that was introduced under the school services support initiative, was also increased from 1 January last and now stands at &euro;131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school per annum that was approved in December 2001. A measure of the increase in overall funding for secondary schools is that by comparison with 1997, a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives extra annual funding of up to &euro;108,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the T&aacute;naiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the T&aacute;naiste has announced a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Key initiatives in the reform programme include the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the undertaking of a joint study into insurance in conjunction with the Competition Authority and other initiatives in association with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <P>The adult literacy service is organised by and delivered through the vocational education committees throughout the country. The service is resourced and managed by the VECs, with funding from my Department.</P>
    <P>Funding for adult literacy has increased in recent years from just under &euro;1million in 1997 to over &euro;19 million in 2004. Client numbers rose in the same period from 5,000 to 30,000 per year. The increase in funding has also enabled the introduction of special programmes targeted at groups with particular literacy needs. Such programmes include family literacy, literacy for deaf people and workplace literacy.</P>
    <P>In the area of workplace literacy, joint initiatives have been developed at local level through co-operation between the vocational education committees, F&Aacute;S, the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and local employers.</P>
    <P>Funding has been provided for a course in workplace basic skills training for experienced group literacy tutors in the VEC service. The course is designed to familiarise the tutors with key issues in basic skills training in the workplace and also identifies strategies for the introduction and implementation of programmes in this context.</P>
    <P>Programmes under way at national level include the return to education programme, which is a joint initiative between F&Aacute;S, VECs and NALA, which provides an intensive literacy programme for community employment workers on F&Aacute;S community employment schemes. In addition, a focused workplace literacy programme, jointly funded by my Department and the local authority national partnership group, is available nationwide for local authority outdoor staff.</P>
    <P>The commitment and support of employers is a fundamental requirement for the successful implementation of workplace literacy programmes. In seeking to support and encourage employers to participate in such programmes, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has approved a project proposal from NALA to design and deliver a workplace basic education programme for SMEs.</P>
    <P>A pilot programme for the development of a certificate in workplace skills has also been approved by that Department under the ESF-aided in-company training measure of the human resources development operational programme.

	<P>At an extraordinary general meeting of IT&Eacute;, held on 18 July 2003, the company agreed to initiate a process of voluntary liquidation. This decision was a matter for the members in accordance with their memorandum and articles of association and relevant company law and was not related to financial considerations.</P>
    <P>A meeting of the executive committee of IT&Eacute;, on 5 December 2003, agreed a timetable for the appointment of a liquidator, who was subsequently appointed on 9 January 2004, and agreed to issue redundancy notices to staff in advance of this. I understand from the liquidator that he has extended the period of notice of redundancy for the staff in line with interim operational requirements and to allow for redeployment options to be pursued.</P>
    <P>My Department has given a commitment to provide every assistance to the company in giving effect to its decision, in partnership with the staff of the institute, and is working closely with the liquidator in this regard. This includes exploring possible arrangements for the continuation of certain research activities previously carried out by the institute and, in the interests of assisting with an orderly wind-up, facilitating appropriate redeployment or other appropriate arrangements for staff in line with general public service policy in these matters and subject to agreement with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In line with this, the redeployment of IT&Eacute; staff is now in progress and staff are kept apprised as developments occur. The entitlements of those employees for whom appropriate redeployment arrangements are not made will be determined in accordance with the terms of their contracts.</P>

	<P>In dealing with the question of PLC numbers, the Department is not in a position to approve all the PLC places applied for in any particular academic year.</P>
    <P>For example, a total of 40,733 places were sought nationwide for 2003-04 from a planned pool of approximately 28,500 places. Similarly, for the 2004-05 academic year, VECs and schools sought approval for some 39,994 places from a planned pool of 28,500 places.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that uncapped growth of the scale featured in the applications for PLC places may not be supported. There is a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers, to manage expenditure and provide for future investment and growth, within the context of overall educational policy and provision.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance in December 2003, the following factors were used in selecting locations for decentralised offices: the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial <Col N="2133"/>strategy in terms of gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved; and the existence of good transport links and the general infrastructural capacity in the selected areas.</P>
    <P>The headquarters of my Department will transfer from Dublin to Mullingar, reflecting the Athlone-Mullingar-Tullamore gateway in the national spatial strategy and the fact that my Department already has substantial staff in Athlone and Tullamore.

Similar considerations influenced the choice of Athlone, Edenderry and Portarlington as the new locations for a number of bodies under the aegis of my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162, 164 and 169 together.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that schools which have applied for special needs assistant, SNA, support will be advised of the outcome of their applications as soon as possible in advance of the next school year.</P>
    <P>Account is being taken of existing levels of SNA support allocation in schools. In cases where a reduction in the level of special needs assistant <Col N="2134"/>support is proposed, there will be provision for schools to appeal, having regard to the care needs of the pupils concerned. Details of the appeals mechanism will be set out in a communication to schools.</P>
    <P>SNAs may be approved to support pupils who have a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circular 07/02, which may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.education.ie</i> under the heading Children with Special Needs.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to review the existing arrangements for the allocation of special educational supports to primary schools. The basic purpose of the review is to ensure that each school has the level of resources required to cater for its pupils with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that special education support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources which are being made available in the special educational area have the desired effect of ensuring that all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require.</P>
    <P>Since 1998, the number of special needs assistants in primary schools has grown from about 300 to in excess of 5,500 full-time and part-time posts. I wish to assure the Deputy that special needs assistants posts will be retained in schools where there is a continuing care need in accordance with circular 07/02.</P>
    <P>I want also to say that my Department recognises the difficulties some schools and parents have been experiencing while awaiting the outcome of applications for special educational resources and the introduction of the weighted model of teacher allocation. The process has been complex and time-consuming and I am endeavouring to have all aspects completed as quickly as possible. I also wish to acknowledge the co-operation and support of schools in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together as I understand that they both concern the trade of vehicle body repair.</P>
    <P>My Department keeps the overall provision of apprentice places in the institutes of technology under ongoing review. Based on statistics provided by F&Aacute;S, I understand that the numbers of apprentices recruited to the trade of vehicle body repair was relatively constant during the years 1996 to 1998 but that a surge in recruitment occurred during the three-year period from 1999 to 2001. In 2002 and 2003 recruitment declined again to its former level and statistics available to date indicate a likely continued decline in numbers registering in this trade in 2004.</P>
    <P>Apprentices in the vehicle body repair trade receive phases four and six of their apprenticeship training in the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT. At the request of my Department DIT increased provision in this trade in the 2003-04 academic year in order to meet the increase in demand for training places arising from the surge in registrations outlined above. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with DIT with regard to the possibility of a further temporary increase in provision in the 2004-05 academic year with a view to eliminating the current backlog of apprentices awaiting training places.</P>
    <P>As regards the case of the individual to whom the Deputy referred, the position is that the selection and scheduling of individual apprentices for release to particular block release courses is a matter for an Foras &Aacute;iseanna Saothair, F&Aacute;S. My Department has no role in the scheduling of apprentices and it would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment on such matters.</P>

	<P>The school named by the Deputy has access to the psychological service provided by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Schools served by NEPS do not have funds assigned to them in respect of the psychological service. They are offered a level of service that is decided by a number of factors, such as disadvantaged status and incidence of special needs. In this instance, the school is recognised by NEPS as having many needs and is therefore offered as high a level of service as possible, given time constraints.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has developed a new weighted system for the allocation of teaching supports to pupils with special needs. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence, more serious, special educational needs.</P>
    <P>Special needs assistants may also be approved to support pupils with significant medical needs, significant impairment of physical or sensory function or whose behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or other pupils. The criteria used for the assessment of the need for special needs assistant support is outlined in the Department&rsquo;s circular 07/02 which may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.education.ie</i> under the heading Children with Special Needs.</P>

     <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 has never been assessed by NEPS; if an assessment will be arranged to determine their eligibility for further special education support; the reason this person did not meet the criteria for a resource teacher; and the impact which the new weighting system for the allocation of SETs will have on the level of support for this person and their school.</Quest>

	<P>The school attended by the named <Col N="2140"/>person has access to the service provided by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. As the person had already been assessed by psychologists and other professionals in the health sector, it was not considered necessary for NEPS to carry out a further assessment.</P>
    <P>The information contained in the professional reports that were initially supplied to my Department did not comply with the stringent requirements for eligibility for resource teaching. As a result of concerns about safety, however, NEPS made an interim recommendation for support from a special needs assistant, which was sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I understand that additional information that was later supplied to my Department confirmed the eligibility of the person for resource teaching hours. A recommendation has now been made to my Department&rsquo;s special education section which has allocated resource hours to the person and has so notified the school.</P>
    <P>The new system of resource allocation to which the Deputy refers will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs.</P>
    <P>The new system will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs. The person named is eligible for such an individual allocation and the new system will not affect this provision.</P>

However, I can confirm that in order to ensure that the transition to the weighted system occurs with the minimum disruption, the Department has decided not to place additional teachers on redeployment panels during the 2003-2004 school year as a result of the implementation of the new weighted model.</P>
    <P>My Department now proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
    <P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced physical education programme for pupils.</P>
    <P>At second level, while physical education is not a mandatory subject, it should form part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on the Department&rsquo;s approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The time recommended for physical education is two hours per week.</P>
    <P>As regards facilities, the syllabuses both at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that a well planned physical education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for our primary and second level students. Physical education in primary schools, as an integral part of the total curriculum, provides vital opportunities for the physical, social, emotional and intellectual development of the child. To assist teachers in planning and delivering the revised curriculum an extensive in-service support programme will commence in September 2004.</P>
    <P>Within second level schools, the physical education programme can contribute significantly to raising educational standards, cultivating social responsibility and citizenship, nurturing socialisation skills and ultimately, helping students to realise their individual potential. Goal setting, within the second level physical education curriculum, focuses on individual improvement and not on winning. A revised syllabus for physical education for junior cycle, as a non-examination subject, was introduced in 112 schools in September 2003 and a national support team was put in place to assist in its implementation. In September 2004, a further phase of 110 schools will begin to provide the revised syllabus. In the senior cycle, physical education is an integral part of the leaving certificate applied, LCA, programme. All LCA students must take two modules &mdash; Leisure Studies and Health Related Fitness, and there are four additional modules from which they can choose.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Physical education is included in the programme of pre-service education for all teachers in each college of education. A number of teachers also take additional elective courses in various aspects of physical education, such as aquatics and games. All college of education graduates are therefore fully qualified to teach the physical education curriculum in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should however address the question of the number of hours spent on physical education in pre-service education to the management authorities of the colleges in question. It is the management authorities of the individual colleges of education who are responsible for the delivery of physical education programmes to students.</P>
    <P>The position on the on-line course provided by the Hibernia College is that it is a privately run course. It has been accredited by the higher education and training awards council, HETAC, and, subject to adherence by Hibernia College to the conditions set out in the HETAC certificate and to any further conditions set by HETAC, will be recognised by my Department for the purposes of primary teaching. I have no role with regard to the specific elements of this course.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule <Col N="2144"/>is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. School authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The school referred to by the Deputy has had a staffing of a principal plus ten mainstream class teachers since the 2000-02 school year. It also has the service of two learning support teachers, one special class teacher, two resource teachers, one home school liaison teacher and one early start teacher. There are no proposed changes to these posts for the coming school year.</P>
    <P>The enrolment on 30 September 2003 entitles the school to a staffing of a principal plus nine mainstream class teachers for the 2004-05 school year. However, on the basis of the projected enrolment for 30 September 2004, provisional sanction to retain the tenth mainstream post under developing school status was given by my Department to the board of management on 20 May 2004, subject to the projected enrolment being achieved on 30 September 2004.</P>
    <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. Details of the appeals procedure are outlined in Department circular 03/04.</P>
    <?oasys _dc24-?><P>The school was prioritised under the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, GCEB, which was introduced in 2001. Schools prioritised under GCEB are in receipt of a range of additional supports including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The types of additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate.</P>
    <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The school in question is not eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school. However, the school benefits from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes, which will impact on existing schemes. I will be making an announcement in this regard once it has been completed.</P>

    <P>Applications received within the above timeframe are currently being processed and the outcome will be notified to schools before the commencement of the 2004-05 school year.

The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs.

	<P>I am satisfied that the new weighted model of teacher allocation for pupils with special educational and learning support needs will significantly improve the level of service provided for such pupils. To facilitate the introduction of the new system, an additional 350 posts are being made available. This will bring the total number of such posts for pupils with low achievement and special educational needs to almost 4,500.</P>
    <P>The new system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, for example, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability, and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</P>
    <P>The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the details of the new model will be set out in a comprehensive circular to issue to schools for the commencement of the new school year.</P><Col N="2146"/>
    <P>The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher incidence special educational needs and this will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in the higher incidence categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence disabilities.</P>
    <P>My Department now proposes to devise clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. The Department will communicate with schools in this regard before the commencement of the coming school year.</P>

Reclamation of State owned foreshore, on the other hand, requires authorisation by way of a foreshore lease granted under section 2 of that Act.</P>
    <P>In either event, consideration of the port company&rsquo;s application will involve a process of public consultation in which interested persons and organisations will have an opportunity to make submissions on relevant issues.</P>
    <P>The EIS prepared by the port company in respect of the proposed reclamation would be made available as part of any public consultation on the proposal. Certain matters relating to that document are under consideration at present. The port company will also have to apply for planning permission for the proposed reclamation.</P>

     <Quest>the projected demand for gas over the next decade; and the way in which it is envisaged to meet the demand.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 19 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act, 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is required to prepare and publish an annual forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system over a seven year period. The 2004 capacity statement will be published in the coming months and will include a range of possible demand scenarios that may be expected to arise over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In recent times, Ireland has developed a high standard of security of gas supply, through robust interconnection with the UK, to ensure sufficient importation capacity from external sources. We now have two gas interconnectors, with the second &mdash; IC2 &mdash; ensuring security of gas supply to 2025 and beyond by bringing Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply status on par with countries such as <Col N="2149"/>France, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, all of which have duplicated sub-sea pipelines to ensure the availability of alternative routes of natural gas supply.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to monitor developments in the UK market closely and this will inform the further development of security of supply policy. The Kinsale field continues to provide Ireland with an indigenous supply of gas and with potential supplies coming from the Corrib and Seven Heads fields, Ireland&rsquo;s import demands may be reduced in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that Ireland&rsquo;s demand for natural gas is growing, particularly for new power generation. My Department will be keeping this under review, including the question of liquefied natural gas, LNG, in the context of ensuring that we continue to have a prudent mix of fuels and supply sources that will enable the needs of the economy to be met without compromising energy competitiveness or security of supply.</P>

	<P>Upgrades to the electricity network generally are matters for the network operators in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
    <P>Grid upgrade requirements for the connection of wind farms are specific to the location and capacity of the proposed wind farms and interaction with other proposed wind farms in close proximity. As a general rule to date, even where wind farms secure planning permission, they proceed to the construction phase only after the award of a power purchase agreement &mdash; primarily under my Department&rsquo;s alternative energy requirement programme. Grid capacity demand cannot therefore be predicted even by reference to wind farm projects with planning permission. Furthermore, capacity demand cannot be identified in advance of formal applications for connections by wind farm developers. In these circumstances, it would not be cost effective to require the network operator to make significant investment in grid upgrades which might or might not subsequently be sought by wind farm developers.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government included a commitment to set up an independent licensing authority for sea-fishing boats. This promise was fulfilled with the establishment of the Licensing Authority on 1 July 2003, under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, and is headed up by the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior Department official.</P><Col N="2153"/>
    <P>The Licensing Authority has informed me that there are two main issues involved in the licensing of the fishing vessel concerned. The first concerns the person to whom the vessel is proposed to be licensed. The Licensing Authority issued a letter of licence offer to the applicant, the son of the previously licensed owner, on 5 February 2003. The conditions contained therein were not complied with by the applicant before the letter of offer expired on 5 February 2004. The applicant&rsquo;s father subsequently advised the Licensing Authority that it was now proposed to continue to have the vessel licensed in his name.</P>
    <P>The second issue relates to tonnage remeasurement of the vessel. In accordance with EU regulations all fishing vessels over 15 metres in overall length were required to have their tonnage converted from gross registered tonnage units to gross tonnage units by 31 December 2003. In order to facilitate this tonnage remeasurement, relevant drawings of the vessel were required to be submitted to this Department&rsquo;s marine survey office, MSO, in advance of that date. Drawings in respect of the vessel are understood to have been first received by the MSO on 23 February 2004. The drawings were found to be incomplete and were therefore returned. The drawings were re-submitted to the MSO last month and are currently being assessed.</P>
    <P>The Licensing Authority has advised that it will be in a position to issue a licence to the previously licensed owner as soon as the remeasurement issue has been satisfactorily resolved, and subject to confirmation that the vessel is still owned by him. In the event that his son wishes to have the vessel licensed in his name, he would be required to submit a new licence application to the Licensing Authority and to fully comply with the terms of any licence offer subsequently issued.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the December 2003 Budget Statement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on the Governments decentralisation programme. The Budget Statement set out the wide range of factors taken into account and balanced against each other in making the overall selection of locations. These factors included: the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved and, the existence of good transport links, by road, rail and-or air, and the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected.</P>
    <P>The subsequent decision to relocate the seafood and coastal zone divisions of the Department to Clonakilty was based on capitalising on the synergies of co-locating with an Bord Iascaigh Mhara to enhance overall service to the seafood and aquaculture sectors from a coastal location. The ensuing decision on relocation of the marine safety directorate followed analysis by the Department of a number of east coast locations. As a result of this analysis, Drogheda was recommended as the most suitable HQ location from which the directorate could deliver its broad range of services.</P>

	<P>The use of monofilament netting for drift net fishing in the salmon fishery was legalised as one of a number of measures, including a reduction in the season, the number of days per week and hours per day for fishing and so on introduced by my Department in 1997 aimed at reducing effort in the fishery.</P>
    <P>Since then the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations have been introduced, which, <i>inter alia</i>, limit the total allowable com<Col N="2156"/>mercial catch, TAC, of salmon for the season for all fishery districts.

    <P>My Department has not received any proposals from the central or regional fisheries boards&rsquo; managers to end the use of monofilament nets for salmon fishing. Any proposal for changes in the management of the fishery, including the type of gear permitted, would be considered by my Department if it is supported by scientific advice that the fishing gear used is in any way adversely effecting the conservation of stocks, evidence that all the relevant stakeholders and interested parties were consulted and had an opportunity to have their views taken into account on the matter, and the endorsement of the National Salmon Commission.</P>

These included the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchments; the location of existing decentralised offices; the desirability of clustering a Department&rsquo;s decentralised units within a region; the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved; the existence of good transport links, by road, rail and-or air and the general infrastructural capacity in the areas selected.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the relevant criteria are met in the case of Killarney, Mallow and Kilkenny, the locations to which it is proposed to move my Department and three of my Department&rsquo;s agencies, the Irish Sports Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Arts Council respectively.</P>

     <Quest>the reason the domiciliary care allowance and respite cease at the age of 16 when the respite grant is needed for the rest of a person&rsquo;s life; and if his attention has been drawn to the views of a person (details supplied) in County Carlow.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is a monthly allowance administered by health boards and may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for one year.</P>
    <P>When the child is approaching the age of 16 he or she should be advised to apply for disability allowance, DA, which is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The boards should notify the parent(s) of the child at least six months prior to the child&rsquo;s 16th birthday. DA is a weekly payment for persons with a disability and generally someone who satisfied the medical conditions for DCA will satisfy the medical conditions for DA. However, the claimant must also satisfy a means test. Entitlement to DCA ceases on the child&rsquo;s 16th birthday.</P>
    <P>In this regard, as DCA is paid to recipients up to the age of 16, the respite care grant cannot be paid by the health board after the child reaches 16. To be eligible for the grant at this stage from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the applicant must be in receipt of the carers allowance or the carers benefit. My Department&rsquo;s attention has been drawn to the views expressed. However, these issues are a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>The European Working Time Directive, EWTD, requires a reduction in the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHD, to 58 hours by 1 August next, and ultimately to 48 hours by 2009. My priority is to maintain safe, high quality services to patients while continuing to maximise compliance, currently without the co-operation or agreement of the Irish Medical Organisation. I do not under-estimate the challenges faced in this regard, some of which have been highlighted in my Department&rsquo;s submission to the ongoing review by the European Commission on the working time directive.</P>
    <P>Management representatives have been ready and willing to participate in local working groups, representative of key stakeholders, to implement the directive&rsquo;s requirements. These groups would <i>inter alia</i> monitor progress in relation to the reduction in NCHD hours, examine skill-mix issues and undertake the type of research-audits on duties-services being provided by NCHD&rsquo;s on-site and off-site on-call during day and night-time periods, as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Organisation has refused to agree to the establishment of these groups. This position, coupled with their failure to substantively engage on the industrial relations issues has severely limited progress on implementation and prevented an agreed solution being reached. Not<Col N="2163"/>withstanding the lack of co-operation by the IMO, every effort will be made, subject to maintaining safe patient care, to press ahead with implementation of the directive from 1 August.</P>

	<P>On 23 July last, I announced that I had convened a review panel to conduct an independent review of the events surrounding the tragic death of the person concerned. The members of the panel are: David Hanly, management consultant; Ms Kay O&rsquo;Sullivan, director of nursing at Cork University Hospital; Dr. Shakeel A. Qureshi, paediatric cardiologist at Guy&rsquo;s and Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, London. The terms of reference of the panel are: to consider the report of the ERHA in relation to the events of 30 June 2003 at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin and to make such further inquiries and conduct such interviews as the panel considers necessary; to address the questions raised by the family; to examine protocols and procedures relevant to this incident having regard to prevailing standards of best practice, and to examine their application in this case; to report to the Minister and to make such recommendations as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>Following the review, both reports will be made available. The work of the review panel is ongoing and I am not in a position to say when the report will become available.</P>

    <P>While preliminary work has been taking place on decentralisation, my Department is awaiting a final decision by Government on the location of the headquarters of the health service executive and associated agencies. This decision is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of the GRO to Roscommon town will be finalised by early 2005, <Col N="2166"/>subject to the completion and fitting out of the new office premises, work on which is at an advanced stage at present. The number of posts moved to Roscommon to date are as follows. There are now 40 staff employed in the Roscommon office. Of this number seven staff transferred from my Department, two staff were directly recruited and the balance of 31 transferred from other Departments over a number of years. None of these posts were filled on promotion at the time of assignment. There are a small number of additional staff moves, approximately 15, scheduled to happen between now and the end of the year to complete the decentralisation of the GRO to Roscommon. These moves will not involve promotions and will each trigger one and possibly two follow on moves by way of filling the Dublin based vacancies arising as part of the exercise.</P>

	<P>The estimate for mental health expenditure in 2004 is &euro;661.35 million or 6.7% of the total health budget while in 2002 expenditure on mental health was 6.9% of the total health expenditure. When evaluating these figures, it must be borne in mind that in-patient care has always been the most expensive element of the mental health service and with the consistent reduction in psychiatric bed numbers and the ongoing transfer of intellectually disabled and elderly patients to other settings, it is to be expected that expenditure relative to other services would fall.</P>
    <P>Since 1997, approximately &euro;90 million additional revenue funding has been invested in the mental health services. In the main, this funding is being used to provide additional medical and health professional staff for expanding community mental health services, to increase child and adolescent services, to expand the later-life psychiatric services, to provide liaison psychiatric services in general hospitals and to enhance the support provided to voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. I am committed to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health and I will be endeavouring to secure additional funding for this sector in the coming years. The further development of our mental health services will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2005 and subsequent years.</P>

	<P>To help alleviate service pressures, I provided &euro;8.8 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority at the end of 2003 to facilitate the discharge of 286 patients from the acute system to a more appropriate setting thereby freeing up acute beds. An additional &euro;5 million was provided recently and it is anticipated that over 180 patients will benefit from this further funding. The ERHA have informed my Department that it is continuing to monitor the situation and work with hospitals and the area health boards to ensure that the number of delayed discharges are being minimised in acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have placed a high priority on dealing with the pressures in emergency medicine departments, particularly in the eastern region and, in this context, I have met with the management of the major hospitals over the last week. Further to discussions which have taken place between my Department and the ERHA, a number of new initiatives proposed by the ERHA have recently been approved at a total cost of &euro;2.4 million.</P>

	<P>Under the Health Act 1970, the determination of eligibility for health services is based on residency and means and is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.</P>
    <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    <P>Persons in category 2 &mdash; non-medical card holders &mdash; are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;45 per night, up to a maximum of &euro;450 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of &euro;45 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
    <P>A person in category I or category II who is referred by a general practitioner or a consultant to a public hospital for an X-ray as a public patient is not liable to be charged for this service by the hospital. However if a patient is being referred for out-patient services, for example, tests, X-rays, arising from a private out-patient consultation, he or she is automatically private to the consultants providing the service in the hospital and is liable to be charged.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act 1991 and the Health Services (Out-Patient) Regulations 1993 clarify the eligibility status of consultant&rsquo;s private patients. The regulations state clearly that a person availing of out-patient consultant services as a private patient of a consultant is the private patient of all consultants providing out-patient services in relation to that particular consultation.</P>
    <P>The position regarding consultants fees for private patients is that the level of the fees is a private matter between the consultants concerned and those persons in receipt of their services. Under the health insurance regulations, the payment of hospital charges and consultants fees by health insurers, for example, BUPA, VHI, for out-patient services provided by hospitals to members is a matter for these insurers. It should be noted that my Department is committed to the preparation of new legislation to update and codify the whole legal framework for eligibility and entitlements in regard to health services.</P>

	<P>My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Belfast, DHSSPS, commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) for the island of Ireland. The decision to commission the study followed a recommendation by a cross-Border working group on pre-hospital emergency care, one of a number of groups established under the North-South Ministerial Council to examine areas of North-South co-operation in the health field.</P>
    <P>The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April <Col N="2175"/>2004 and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The study identifies possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service as follows:</P>
    <P> &ldquo;Primary Response&rdquo; &mdash; travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take the patient to hospital. &ldquo;Inter-hospital Response&rdquo; &mdash; the planned, rapid transfer between hospital of patients requiring specialist care, escorted by skilled professionals. </P>
    <P>The study concludes that an inter-hospital transfer service would be the most appropriate in an all-island context. The study indicates that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The estimated cost is &euro;12 million capital and &euro;4 million annual operating costs for a single helicopter. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost for each aircraft of over &euro;3 million.</P>
    <P>An air ambulance service is currently provided to the health boards by the Air Corps on a request and availability basis. The Air Corps provides this service subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Air Corps helicopters operate from airports and, where available and deemed safe, hospital helipads. Most transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance. The service is well regarded and appreciated by those in the health service who avail of it.</P>
    <P>My Department is exploring options in relation to HEMS development in the light of the recent study. As part of this exercise, it has initiated discussions with the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Irish Coast Guard).</P>

Based on trams running at five minute intervals at peak times, the Green line will have a carrying capacity of 3,780 persons per direction per hour, while the capacity of the Red line will some 2,820 passengers per hour per direction.</P>
    <P>Current Railway Procurement Agency&rsquo;s RPA estimates of patronage on the total system suggest that after a ramp-up period of approximately 18 months, there will be an annual patronage of approximately 20 million passengers on the network in a fully operational year. This translates as a daily Luas patronage of approximately 60,000 passengers per day. There is scope for increasing frequency of service and the capacity of trams substantially beyond these initial numbers, to meet growing demand.</P>
    <P>Based on estimates of revenue from fare box, and projected operations and maintenance cost for Luas, determined prior to operations commencing, the agency expects that the Luas will operate at approximately break-even from 2006 onwards. However, these estimates will be <Col N="2180"/>revised over the coming months as a pattern of demand for the services emerges from actual operations.</P>

	<P>At the request of my Department, the DTO is currently undertaking a review of the bus market in the greater Dublin area so as to provide a strategic framework for the development of the bus market over the coming years. This study will take account,<i> inter alia</i>, of planned land use and other developments arising from the recently adopted strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, entitled the Platform for Change and the developments in public transport since that strategy was adopted.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Irish Rail that the company carries approximately 21.6 million passengers annually on the DART and 2.7 million on the outer suburban services in the Dublin Area. In 2003, the company earned &euro;26.8 million from DART operations and &euro;5.9 million from outer suburban operations.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the company that, in normal circumstances, it would expect traffic to grow on these lines at a rate broadly in line with the rate of economic growth, with stronger growth occurring at peak times. However, the current interruption to services arising from the DART upgrade project is affecting patronage. Furthermore, the outcome of the current review of the bus market will also influence future growth.</P>
    <P>Revenue is expected to grow broadly in line with economic growth, provided fares are increased in line with general inflation. Operating costs will also grow due to inflation and market expansion, while subvention needs are also expected to increase on a commensurate basis. However, the company has in place a cost reduction programme which is having an overall downward pressure on costs. It is the overall objective of the company to achieve break-even at operating level.</P>

	<P>Under the public service vehicles regulations, whenever a person requests the driver of a vehicle used as a taxi standing for hire in a taximeter area to drive him or her to a specified place in that area, the driver must comply with the request unless, <i>inter alia</i>, the person making the request fails to tender the lawful fare or the driver has other reasonable excuse for refusing or failing to comply with the request.</P>
    <P>Other regulatory provisions require the driver to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of persons in, on, entering or alighting from the vehicle. Interpretation of the regulations and of any other statutory provisions in any particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. In general, each occupant of a passenger car is required to wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint, as the case may be. The driver of a vehicle is obliged to ensure that an occupant of the vehicle who is under 17 years of age is either restrained by an appropriate child restraint or, provided she or he is four years old and upwards, is wearing a safety belt.</P>
    <P>The requirement to wear a safety belt does not apply in respect of the use of a vehicle in which the fitment of safety belts is not mandatory. However, cars registered on or after 1 January 1992 are required to have safety belts fitted to all forward facing seats. Fitment of an appropriate child restraint is not mandatory in vehicles. Accordingly, the duty of the driver to ensure that a restraint is worn is subject to the availability of such a restraint in a vehicle.</P>
    <P>The regulations which deal with the fitment and wearing of safety belts and restraint systems, the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1991 &mdash; S.I. No. 359 of 1991 &mdash; define an appropriate child restraint as an approved child restraint which is appropriate to the user by virtue of the weight range indicated on the restraint. The regulations specify approval authorities and approval marks.</P>
    <P>There appears to be gaps in the regulations, which have given rise to some confusion, particularly regarding the status under the regulations of the law regarding the carrying of children under four years of age. As the safety of children in this age category is paramount it is my intention to tidy up the regulations and to close the gaps.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On 18 September 2003 my Department received two applications from a private bus operator for designated bus services into the Citywest business campus. The applications were for limited morning and evening services between the business campus and Sydney Parade DART station on the one hand, and between the business campus and Westmoreland Street on the other.</P>
    <P>My Department is required under section 11(3)(a) of the 1932 Act to apply a public interest test to applications for licences. It must consider whether the service proposed is in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service. It concluded following a thorough examination, that it was in the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; to grant the applications. The critical considerations which led to this decision were: Citywest business campus has over 100 companies employing several thousand people; Citywest management confirmed to my Department that it had approached Dublin Bus about the provision of dedicated bus services for workers in the business campus, but Dublin Bus did not take up the request; Citywest management then approached the private operator in question to provide the services concerned to cater for commuting workers employed in the business campus; the Department had no other prior proposal for a bus service to the Citywest business campus service.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing, my Department concluded that it would be in the public interest to grant the applications from the private operator concerned and on 2 June 2004 the Department proceeded with the issue of two licences to the private operator to operate the proposed services. Both licences are for the carriage of passengers to and from the business campus only and provide for a limited number of services, namely, two morning services from Westmoreland Street with three return services in the evening; one <Col N="2183"/>morning service from Sydney Parade DART station with two return services in the evening. My Department operates due process and fair procedure in the administration of the bus licensing and authorisation system. Dublin Bus effectively remains the monopoly provider of bus services in the Dublin metropolitan area. The company has the same opportunity as private operators to propose the introduction of additional or new services to meet specific or growing customer demand. In this case, Dublin Bus did not take up the request from the business campus and the private operator was duly awarded licences following due consideration by my Department.</P>

	<P>A review of the present speed limit structure was carried out in 2003 against the background of the requirement to changeover to metric units of measurement for speed by end 2004. The broadly based working group who carried out the review recommended that maximum speed limits should range from a high of 120 kilometres per hour &mdash; equivalent to 74.580 miles per hour &mdash; on motorways to 50 kilometres per hour &mdash; equivalent to 31.075 miles per hour in built-up areas. The working group also recommended that a special limit of 30 kilometresper hour &mdash; equivalent to 18.645 miles per hour &mdash; should be applied on a very restrictive basis in residential areas where traffic calming measures have been provided. Within that range, the working group recommended that the speed limit for national roads should be 100 kilometres per hour &mdash; equivalent to 62.150 miles per hour &mdash; and that the speed limit on non-urban regional and local roads should be 80 kilometres per hour &mdash; equivalent to 49.790 miles per hour. The latter represents a significant decrease on the speed limit of 60 miles per hour that applies to what is the vast majority of the rural road network.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Bill 2004, published on 11 June, proposes legislative measures to provide for a new metricated speed limit structure based on the recommendations made by the working group. The Bill is awaiting a timetable for its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

There are foot patrols carried out by local uniformed garda&iacute; on a regular basis and these patrols are assisted by the detective unit, the divisional crime task force, the special resource unit, the Garda mountain bike unit and the community policing unit. I am informed by the Garda authorities that steady progress is being made in their investigations into recent crimes carried out in the area. I am assured by local Garda management that they are satisfied that the current Garda strength in the area concerned is adequate to meet current policing needs and that policing in the area is kept under constant review in order to ensure that it is tailored to meet changing circumstances as they occur.</P>

The applicant&rsquo;s previous convictions came to light in the course of processing of his application. The applicant was then interviewed separately regarding these offences by two Garda officers in the Carriage Office during the processing of the application.

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that the figure for prosecutions in respect of the compulsory fitting of speed limitation devices on buses and coaches with more than eight passenger seats, excluding the driver&rsquo;s seat, with a design gross weight exceeding ten tonnes and heavy goods vehicles exceeding 12 tonnes, referred to in my reply dated 10 February 2004 is still provisional. The final figure will be published in the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s annual report for 2003.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of legislation and the allocation of resources in respect of the matters raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner and, as such, I have no role in relation to these matters. However, the Garda authorities have advised me that they consider the level of enforcement for breaches of the regulations in respect of the compulsory fitting of speed limitation devices to be appropriate. I am not aware of any request to my Department for <Col N="2193"/>additional resources in this regard. If such a request were to be submitted, it would be considered in the usual way.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, it is open to self-employed and private child care providers, small and large-scale, to apply for a capital grant under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 which is operated by my Department. The grants of up to &euro;50,790 are available for the purchase, building, renovation or upgrading of child care facilities or for the purchase of child care equipment. This strand of the programme was developed in line with the recommendations of the expert working <Col N="2194"/>group on child care established under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>Funding for the programme, through the EU and the Exchequer, was recently increased to &euro;449 million. To date, &euro;218 million in funding has been allocated in capital grant assistance under the programme to child care facilities. Of this, nearly &euro;24.3 million has been allocated to 730 self-employed or private child care providers. It is estimated that this will provide for the creation of 13,270 new child care places and will support 8,250 existing places. I am satisfied that the current grant level is meeting the requirements of self-employed and private child care providers.</P>
    <P>In the case of private sector child care provision, these services are operated for profit and are expected to generate income to sustain the enterprise. Funding by state authorities within the EU is restricted in terms of the level of aid that can be provided to private enterprise. This is especially relevant in the case of supports for staffing or running costs in private enterprises.</P>
    <P>In addition to the direct funding available under the programme, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced capital allowances for capital expenditure on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, extension and refurbishment of a building which is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service or a pre-school service and day care or other service to cater for children other than pre-school children.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that employment grants are available through the city and county enterprise boards and I understand that, during the period 1 January 2002 to 30 April 2004, more than &euro;1.3 million has been allocated to 130 child care enterprises. These grants have the potential to create 255 full time and 62 part time jobs in the child care sector. The measures in place reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.</P>

	<P>The total funding committed for projects under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 for counties Cavan and Monaghan amounts to &euro;4,936,758 and &euro;7,306,703, respectively. Sixty nine child care grants in Cavan were approved funding under the programme and includes the following. Fifteen capital grant applications from community-based or not-for-profit groups were approved for funding and a total of &euro;1,542,458 has been committed; 14 capital grant applications from private providers and the self-employed were approved for funding and more than &euro;442,703 has been com<Col N="2195"/>mitted; and 28 staffing grant applications from community-based or not-for-profit groups were approved for funding and more than &euro;2,230,142 has been committed. Funding to Cavan county child care committee was approved to enable it to carry out its day to day activities and to deliver on its strategic action plans, including the implementation of the childminders&rsquo; initiative. The total amount of funding approved to date is &euro;638,922. A local child care network was awarded &euro;82,533.</P>
    <P>In County Monaghan, 60 child care grants have been approved funding under the programme to date and they are as follows. Twelve capital grant applications from community-based groups were approved for funding and a total of &euro;3,364,766 has been committed; seven capital grant applications from private providers and the self-employed were approved and more than &euro;159,988 has been committed; 27 staffing grant applications from community-based and not-for-profit groups have been approved for funding and &euro;2,217,664 has been committed; a local network covering the Border counties was approved &euro;914,482; Monaghan county child care committee was approved a total of &euro;649,801 towards the implementation of its action plans together with funding towards development grants and the childminders&rsquo; initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department has completed a comprehensive document which gives the key information sought by the Deputy, that is, project type and level of grant assistance approved in each child care service. I will arrange for a copy of the document to be lodged in the Oireachtas Library in due course.</P>

The Garda authorities have informed me that it is their policy to concentrate enforcement activity on collision-prone locations and points of high visibility. Such locations are determined in consultation with the NRA and the relevant local authority under the collision prevention programme. I have been informed by the Garda authorities the focus of Garda activity is to change and prevent offending driver behaviour through visible enforcement.</P>

	<P>The restatement of the Succession Act 1965 has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, in accordance with section 8 of the Statute Law (Restatement ) Act 2002. I can also inform the Deputy that before the 2002 Act was enacted, my Department had made informal restatements of the Refugee Act 1996 and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, each incorporating the various amendments to date, which are publicly available on its website. The informal restatements have been kept up to date. I intend to process them under the 2002 Act as time and resources allow in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the programme for Government includes a commitment to codify all substantive criminal law in a single crimes Act. As a first step in what will be a major undertaking in terms of criminal law reform and reorganisation, I have established an expert group, chaired by Professor Finbarr McAuley to undertake a study of the possible approaches to codification and to consider the scope and extent of such approaches. The group was asked to consider the respective ideas of consolidation and statute law restatement in developing and maintaining a criminal code. The expert group reported on 30 June 2004. I am currently considering its findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999, I gave a commitment for a restatement of the proceeds of crime legislation and expressed the hope that such a restatement will be published by the end of the year. While it is hoped to prioritise this work, it is, as always, subject to change in response to developments at both national and international level. A restatement of the law on corruption is to be undertaken by the end of this year and that project is currently with the statute law revision unit of the Office of the Attorney General. No staff <Col N="2197"/>in my Department are working on restatements on a full-time basis. The process of preparing and publishing restatements under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002 is undertaken in my Department in conjunction with the advancement of the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme by various officers to whom particular subjects have been assigned at any one time.</P>

    <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 2 of 5 May last, when I said I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval to publish a Bill on judicial conduct and ethics in the current year. In response to a supplementary question on that date, I indicated that when the heads of the Bill are in a reasonable format, it is my intention to bring it before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, as I did with other important legislation, so Members of both Houses can have a pre-emptive look at how it is developing. I have not changed my view in that regard. It is proposed that the Bill will establish a judicial council, which will be responsible for judicial conduct and ethics. It will also have among its functions the work being carried out by the Judicial Studies Institute and other activities of an educational nature beneficial to the Judiciary, as recommended by the committee on judicial conduct and ethics in chapter 7, paragraph 7 of its 2000 report.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has kept the use in other jurisdictions of electronic tagging systems to monitor offenders under review for some time. As I explained in my previous replies to the House on this matter, difficulties have been encountered in other jurisdictions in developing fully effective electronic tagging systems, but recent developments in technology may provide solutions to these. The developments are being considered by my Department, in consultation with the prison and probation and welfare services, with a view to drawing up an enabling provision in due course. As the examination is still in progress, I am not in a position to indicate definitively what the possible uses of electronic tagging might be in this jurisdiction.

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s legislation programme contains a commitment to bring forward an enforcement of fines Bill to provide for new ways to enforce fines and, in particular, to end as far as practicable imprisonment for non-payment of fines. In that context I am undertaking a comprehensive review of the system of fines enforcement, with a view to bringing forward such legislative proposals in due course. Until I have firm proposals I cannot comment on the specific queries posed in the question. I would add that I intend to bring forward a fines Bill which, while primarily intended to update existing fines and provide a mechanism for indexation, will also include provisions for the payment of fines by instalment.</P>

	<P>Government policy in relation to waste management is firmly grounded on the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste management options of prevention, re-use and recycling, energy recovery and environmentally secure disposal of residual wastes. Waste management approaches have been and will continue to be the subject of review and debate internationally. Proponents of the &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo; approach have argued that it is possible to rely entirely on prevention, minimisation, re-use and recycling. However, my Department is not aware of any country or jurisdiction in which waste management strategies have actually delivered on the solution of &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo;. Effective waste minimisation and recovery is central to the Government&rsquo;s approach to waste management and I am bringing forward, and allocating funding towards, a range of new initiatives, including the recently announced national waste prevention programme and the market development programme for recyclable materials. There will, however, continue to be residual waste and the challenge is to ensure that this is managed in the most environmentally appropriate manner.</P>

If development is proposed in a flood-risk area, the risk of flooding can be carefully evaluated and planning permission refused, if necessary. These provisions came into effect on 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>In 2003, the EPA published comprehensive research, undertaken at NUI Maynooth, on Climate Change: Scenarios and Impacts for Ireland. This and other research specific to Ireland, and international policy analysis of the impacts of climate change through the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, will help inform long-term planning in coastal zone management, and other policy areas, to allow the expected impacts of climate change to be integrated into policy formulation and the costs of adaptation to be best managed.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for national policy in relation to flooding rests with the Office of Public Works. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, established a review group under the aegis of the OPW in 2003 to devise a clearly defined and comprehensive policy approach to flooding nationally and a precise definition of the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders involved. My Department was represented on the review group as were the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Food and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, along with the IFA, IBEC and local authorities. I understand that the review group&rsquo;s report will be submitted to Government in due course.</P>

	<P>Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides for a licensing system for appliances and structures, including street furniture, placed on, above, under or along a public road, including footpaths. This licensing system is intended to ensure that the authority can control appliances being placed on public roads, in particular to prevent obstructions or other hazards to persons using the public road. Therefore, in considering an application for a licence, a local authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal, must have regard <i>inter alia</i> to the convenience and safety of road users, including pedestrians. In view of the relatively straightforward notice of the above procedures, there are no proposals to issue a guidance note to local authorities especially in relation to the licensing of street furniture.</P>

	<P>In 2003, I provided funding of &euro;168,357 and &euro;469,930 to Monaghan and Louth county councils on a once-off exceptional basis in recognition of the particular difficulties which arose for those authorities in responding to instances of illegal dumping of oil-laundering residues, particularly in relation to costs incurred by them in arranging for the safe disposal abroad of the hazardous materials involved.</P>
    <P>The real solution to this problem, however, is the effective, co-ordinated enforcement of the law, both from a customs and waste management perspective. To that end, a meeting has recently taken place, at my request and that of my Northern Ireland colleague of all of the relevant enforcement authorities from both sides of the Border, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI. The purpose of this meeting was to consider how efforts should best be co-ordinated so as to ensure the effective enforcement of the waste regulatory code. The recently established Office of Environmental Enforcement will be co-ordinating developments in relation to this joint initiative.</P>

    <P>A wide range of factors were taken into account and balanced against each other in the selection of the locations for decentralisation. In the case of Knock Airport, these factors included: the existence of good transport links by road, rail and air and the general infrastructural capacity in the area selected; the accessibility of much of rural Ireland from this location; the fact that Knock Airport is in a CL&Aacute;R area. In the case of na Forbacha the main factor was the fact that my Department already has functions relating to the Irish language, islands and Gaeltacht located there.</P>

     <Quest>the way in which land is taken into account when persons are assessed for social welfare entitlements; and if the assessment is based on income, for example, headage payments or money derived from letting agreements or the valuation of the property.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In calculating means for the purposes of social welfare entitlements where land is taken into account, the gross yearly income which the farmer and his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive from farming or any other self-employment, less any expenses necessarily incurred in carrying on the business is assessed. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year. Income from the sale of animals is taken into account where it occurs.</P>
    <P>The assessment is designed to form a basis on which entitlement to Social Welfare payment can be determined. This means that the assessment of the expected annual income is based on normal output and costs appropriate to normal stock levels, capacity and market trends. Where an applicant disagrees with a means assessment, he or she may appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. In addition, where an applicant feels that his or her circumstances have changed since the most recent assessment, he or she may request a means review.</P>
    <P>With regard to cattle headage and cattle premium schemes, these are two completely separate and distinct schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The headage schemes are payable in certain designated areas only, while the premium schemes can be applied for anywhere in the State. Where land is leased, the income from the leasing will be assessed as cash income &mdash; the land is not assessed on a capital value basis. In the case of a lessee, the annual leasing price will be allowed as an expense in the case of the lessee, in assessing his or her income from the use of the land leased.</P>
    <P>The house in which a person resides, together with furniture and personal effects is not assessed. Property must be capable of being sold, let or put to profitable use before a capital value assessment is applied. The most common example is where a person owns a second house. If the house is let, the owner is assessed with the capital value of the property, not with the income from the letting. Similarly, the market value of leases and <Col N="2212"/>ground rents is assessed as capital; the income is not assessed.</P>

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which provides for the payment of rent supplements, is subject to a means test.

	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear for children attending mainly primary or post primary schools.</P>
    <P>A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and has household income at or below certain set levels. The income limit for a lone parent with one child is &euro;238.90, increasing by &euro;21.60 for each additional child. The limits are raised each year in line with increases in weekly social welfare payment rates.</P>
    <P>Lone parents who participate in CE schemes receive a full-rate CE payment as well as retaining almost all of their one-parent family payment. As a result of the significant increases in both one-parent family payments and CE wages in recent years, CE participants who are also lone parents have incomes which are in excess of the qualifying limits for back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>the number of positions moved and the number filled on promotion in respect of the most recent decentralisation undertaken by her Department; and the number of follow-on moves which were triggered by the decentralisation.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent decentralisation programme undertaken by my Department was the relocation of the accounts branch to Dundalk in 2002. A total of 95 posts were relocated to Dundalk under the programme. The only post filled by promotion was that of principal officer.</P>
    <P>The remaining posts were filled by the lateral transfer of serving civil servants or by direct recruitment. Some 36 posts were filled by the relocation of staff from within the Department, 44 posts were filled by the redeployment of staff <Col N="2214"/>from other Departments and 14 staff were recruited directly for Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate the number of consequential staff moves necessary in other Departments. However, in my Department, of the 36 staff who relocated to Dundalk, five staff were already serving in accounts branch and, accordingly, there were no consequential vacancies, and six people moved from other areas of the Department and follow-on moves were required.</P>
    <P>The remaining 25 were clerical staff recruited for the Dublin offices of the Department during 2001 and 2002 who were interested in relocating to Dundalk. They were assigned directly to the accounts branch in anticipation of the move.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is estimated that it was necessary to redeploy some 70 staff from accounts branch to other areas of the Department as vacancies arose during 2001 and 2002.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
     <Quest>if she will take measures in order that social welfare claimants on means-tested payments are reminded of their obligation on at least an annual basis to notify her Department of income changes in view of the fact that <Col N="2215"/><?oasys _fc?>much anecdotal evidence suggests that large overpayments have arisen due to the fact that claimants were genuinely not aware of that obligation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>All applicants for means-tested payments are advised at the initial claim stage of the requirement to notify my Department of any subsequent change in their means.</P>
    <P>Customers receiving long-term payments, such as pensioners and one-parent families, who are paid by personalised payable order books, have reminders printed on their cover. In the case of unemployment assistance, the monthly declaration of unemployment which they sign contains <Col N="2216"/>a notice advising recipients of their obligations to notify any changes in circumstances.</P>
    <P>My Department takes other opportunities to inform customers of the need to notify it of any changes in their circumstances, for example in our recently published customer charter. The charter is on display in public offices and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>In addition, from time to time my Department sends mailshots to customers about the need to notify it of any changes, including changes in means. Customers receiving means-related payments have their cases reviewed by inspectors at regular intervals. My Department has a policy of reviewing its procedures on an ongoing basis. The issue of reminding customers of their obligations to keep the Department informed of changes in their circumstances will be kept under review. </P>
