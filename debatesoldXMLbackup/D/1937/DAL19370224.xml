      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has received any communication from the British Government regarding the proposed Coronation Oath in connection with the accestion of King George VI; if he will state the terms of the proposed Oath, and whether the Executive Council have agreed to the terms of the Oath.</P>

      <P>I was kept informed of certain changes which were being introduced into the Coronation Oath for the purpose, on the one hand, of bringing it into harmony with the Statute of Westminster, and, on the other, of making it clear that that part of the Oath which deals with the Protestant reformed religion concerned the United Kingdom alone. The question of obtaining our approval for the Oath did not arise.  I had made it clear that our attitude towards the whole Coronation ceremony must be one of detachment and protest while our country was partitioned and while the Coronation Service implied discrimination&mdash;as it still does&mdash;against the religion to which the majority of our people belong.</P>

      <P>Legislation to prevent the recruiting, transit and dispatch of their own nationals as volunteers for Spain was in force prior to the 16th February, 1937, in the United Kingdom and Belgium.  Since the 16th February legislation for the same purpose was brought into operation by the following countries:&mdash;France, Germany, U.S.S.R., Portugal, Italy, Poland, Norway, Netherlands and Luxembourg.

      <P>According to the certificate submitted by the local medical officer of health at the local public inquiry recently held into a housing scheme of the Offaly Board of Health, there were 18 houses definitely condemned as unfit for human habitation in the town of Edenderry.  The proposals of the Edenderry Town Commissioners for the rehousing of slum dwellers have not been held up in the Department.  The town commissioners have been very unpunctual in the repayment of the loan charges to the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of the housing schemes already carried out by them, and at present they are in arrears with their repayments.  The Commissioners of Public Works have stated that they cannot under any circumstances recommend any further loans for sanction while any arrears of instalments in repayment of existing loans remain undischarged.  The Offaly Board of Health, under the scheme to which I have referred, have submitted proposals for the provision of 98 houses in the town.  I am not yet in a position to state how many of these will eventually be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>The information asked for by the Deputy is not classified in the Departmental records by reference to dispensary districts, and it has accordingly been necessary to consult the secretary to the county board of health.  On the information supplied by him and that is available in the Department, the number of houses condemned by the medical officer of health for the Clara dispensary district is 166, of which about ten houses have more than one family residing therein.  The number of new houses (a) erected since 1932 under the Labourers Acts is 30, (b) in course of construction 14, and (c) yet to be commenced 8.  In addition, the board of health and public assistance have submitted proposals for the provision of 161 new cottages, but I am not yet in a position to state how many will eventually be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether there is any prospect of a shortage in domestic supplies of butter; and, if so, in how far does this shortage arise as a result of exports of butter to Continental markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to unfavourable weather conditions, the winter production of creamery butter has fallen below normal since the beginning of this year.  There is, however, no danger of a shortage in butter, as the importation of a comparatively small quantity between now and the end of next month will be sufficient to compensate for the decline in domestic production.  Butter intended for Continental markets was stored at the period of high production last year.  If it had not been reserved for that purpose, it would have been exported to the United Kingdom at the time.  Consequently, export of butter to the Continent is not in any way responsible for the shortage in domestic supplies.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on the improvement of estates is not allocated annually for particular counties in the manner the Deputy suggests.  For improvement purposes estates are treated individually, irrespective of the counties in which they are situate.  It is therefore not possible to state beforehand what the total expenditure from the Vote for the Improvement of Estates will be for the current year in respect of the counties mentioned.  For the ten months from 1st April 1936 to 31st January, 1937, a sum of £9,796 was expended in Leix and a sum of £12,802 in Offaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I should first like to pay a tribute to those brave men of our race who lost their lives in the sacred cause of fighting militant Communism. Their readiness to sacrifice everything in that cause will ensure them an abiding place in their country's memory.  But a higher reward is theirs and it is the best consolation we can offer to their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We refuse, Sir, to accept the Government's plea of urgency in this matter. We cannot consent to their attempt to steamroll this Bill through the Dáil until they have satisfied the very reasonable demand that we have put to them.  That demand, Sir, was reasonable and moderate.  It is the very least that the people of Ireland have a right to expect of any Government here, and until that demand has been granted, we must oppose the policy of the Government in this particular matter.  I admit there are things in international affairs that require urgent consideration, but there are things that require urgent consideration more even than this Bill, more even than getting this Bill through the House to-day, and one is the matter of the clarification of the attitude of the Government on certain vital issues, a clarification that, on every occasion and on every opportunity that was offered to them, they have refused to give up to the present. I suggest to the President, who is Leader of the House and head of the Government in this State, that he should realise that Parliament is not the place, and now is not the time, to indulge in the trivialities and in the dialectics of which we had such a striking example to-day.  We had the Minister for External Affairs, the <Col N="897" /> President, juggling in his usual fashion to-day with important matters. Does he know, and, if not, has he not been informed, that a Minister or an Ambassador is accredited personally to the head of a State?  He is not accredited to a nation; he is not accredited to an impersonal thing called Spain, he is accredited to the head of the Government that this Government recognises and he is accredited to nobody else.  We saw a discreditable attempt to-day to get out of that plain issue, and yet the Government that trifled with such important issues have come down to this House to plead urgency for a measure of this kind.  There are things that are urgent but we are convinced that if the fair name of this country is to be saved, if the aspirations of the people of Ireland in this matter are to be satisfied, the thing that is really urgent is the withdrawal of the credentials to the Caballero Government in Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War.  On Friday last, two reasoned amendments were submitted to the motion for the Second Stage. There did seem to be doubts about the relevancy of these amendments but the Chair admitted them.  They were disposed of by a vote of this House, hence the question of recognition or non-recognition of either Government in Spain does not now arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I shall follow your ruling, Sir.  I was merely giving the reasons why we are opposed to this motion.  I was not asking the House or the Government to reverse the decision previously come to. I was merely giving the reason why we cannot consent to this motion and why, though we still believe in the policy of non-intervention, we feel it necessary to oppose the Bill at this stage.  I want to make that clear, and I had hoped that I was in order in doing so.  I am not asking the Government now, though I hope an opportunity will arise when that will be possible, to deal with the matter of the withdrawal of our Minister.  I am giving the reasons why I, for one, <Col N="898" /> cannot accept this motion before us now.  The Minister, speaking on the first occasion on which he addressed himself to this particular matter, said that he did not wish to use his majority.  What do we see here to-day? We now see the fulfilment of that promise by the President in a typical manner.  He is using his majority, which he had practically pledged himself not to use.  He will not use that steamroller, if he gets approval for what he wants from every part of the House but otherwise he is going to use it; otherwise he has no reluctance or no hesitancy in using it.  The guillotine has seldom, if ever, been used by the present Government to secure the liberty or the advantage or safeguard the honour of the Irish people.  It is not being so used to-day.  We shall admit that he has this majority.  We shall admit that all those ranged on the opposite benches can carry this guillotine motion through.  Of course they can; but it is an outrage on the feelings of the Irish people that they should attempt to do it.  It is an outrage when we consider the depth of feeling of large masses of the Irish people on this particular matter.</P>
      <P>Our attitude on this has been clear from the start.  We made it clear last November that we considered that if a policy of non-intervention could be carried through, in the interests of the Franco Government itself, and in the interests of the peace of Europe, that was the sounder policy.  I pointed out that there were other nations capable of intervening more effectively than we.  Taking this Bill in the circumstances that prevail here to-day the circumstances for which the President, by his inaction, the majority here by their vote, the Ministers by their speeches, are responsible, there is no other possible course open to us except the stand that we are now taking. Nobody can say that we have been unduly pressing the Minister for External Affairs or his Department in so far as giving information to this House is concerned.  There again the President has obstinately refused to give us any information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, owing to the ruling of the Chair, touch on certain matters.  All <Col N="899" /> I can say is that we tried last November to lift this whole Spanish question out of the realm of Irish party politics and it was immediately pulled down into the political arena by the President and it has been kept there by the members of the President's Party, by his Ministers and by his Press.  That is the atmosphere prevailing in Ireland, or at least in a certain portion of Ireland, amongst a certain portion of the population of Ireland, and that confronts us when we are faced with this resolution.  Attempts have been made to drag this question down to the level of party politics, and those attempts reached, not their zenith, but the lowest point possible, a point beyond which they could not go, in a speech made last Sunday.</P>
    <P>I think that, in regard to this matter, this country, with its traditions, with its beliefs, should take up a certain attitude.  I cannot accept what was, practically speaking, the burden of the speech of the Minister for Education about our powerlessness and our insignificance.  I admit he did not use the word &ldquo;insignificance,&rdquo; but that is what it came to.  I refuse to think that in any international conference this country should be reduced to the position of a back-bencher of the Fianna Fáil Party, a mere yes-man, merely giving assent to anything put forward there.  That was the burden of the speech of the Minister for Education last week.  How is it reasonable, when we hear statements of that kind, when we see such disrespect paid our country, to expect a Party like this to accept this proposal or consider this Bill divorced from all the surrounding circumstances that give it its real significance for the people of the country?</P>
    <P>On one occasion&mdash;you may remember it&mdash;down in Cork the President spoke of how this little nation might lead the world&mdash;&ldquo;This little nation will lead them.&rdquo;  Here he had an opportunity and all that he can do, all that his Ministers can do, is to reduce this nation that could give such a lead, to a position of following, without discussion or consideration, behind the tail of the other nations, reduced to <Col N="900" /> the position of a mere yes-man in a general assembly, without a word raised, without any attempt made, so far as we know, to consider the circumstances or the issues that were at stake.  It is because we strongly believe that, owing to the attitude of the Government, owing to the statements of Ministers, owing to the campaign conducted by the <i>Irish Press</i>, which, remember, is one of the circumstances I must take into account because of the atmosphere created in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite; I never suggested they were, and that is the reason I phrased my statement in the way I did.  What I have to take into account is the atmosphere that is created.  I am not saying that the Ministers are responsible to this House for the <i>Irish Press</i>, and apparently the <i>Irish Press</i> is not responsible to Parliamentary Secretaries.  I am not saying that, but there is a certain atmosphere created and that is an atmosphere that we must take into account in discussing whether there is reason for urgency and whether this request on the part of the Government should be granted&mdash;whether their plea of urgency should be heard.  As a result of these things that I mention, we feel that the real interests of this country, the highest interests of this country and the honour of the country, are being sacrificed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked by the leader of the House, the President, to accept a guillotine motion on an important measure of this kind.  It is impossible to do it.  No self-respecting Irishman should vote for such a motion.  We ought to have led.  It might have made a tremendous difference in the whole aligning of forces if we showed at least there was one &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; country that held certain views.  We had our opportunity and we threw it away, and by throwing it away we gave our support, so far as this House is concerned, to the lie that this is a struggle between Fascism and democracy.  We have helped in that direction as much as we could by what we have done.  Ireland's <Col N="901" /> place at the conference should have been very different from what it has been.  In the international conferences that took place under our régime very different was the position occupied by this country.</P>
    <P>I cannot pick and choose between the different statements of the President and his Ministers.  I have no doubt that if careful search were made, it great energy were spent in the search, statements could be got from the President when, on some remote occasion, he did condemn Communism. Several years past he did something of the kind&mdash;we have it on his own authority that he did, and we accept that.  But before this House passes this motion it is entitled to something more definite than we have been able to extract from the President.</P>

      <P>The question of Communism does not arise on this motion, which is to decide whether the Committee and other stages will be taken at certain times.  Our social problems are not relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the value or the extent of Communism, but the extent of Communism elsewhere and the danger of it here constitute one reason for our opposition to this motion, which, on the plea of urgency, asks us to allow this Bill to be steam-rolled through in a day, to allow all the concluding stages to be taken. Because of the situation created generally by Ministers, because of the evidence we have that that situation is largely accepted by the Government's followers&mdash;not by all of them, but by many of them, and I merely adduce, as evidence of that position, the campaign of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;it is necessary for us to explain our attitude. I will admit that they are not responsible as Ministers&mdash;I made that quite clear&mdash;but that this House can hurriedly discuss a Bill of such import as this, that it should be asked to give freedom to the President to dispose of all remaining stages in a single day&mdash; that we could intelligently discuss that without any reference to the wishes of the country on the matter and the campaign in the country, I find it diffcult  to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> I can only attach one significance and one meaning to the attitude taken up by the Government&mdash;that, despite everything that has been said, despite, as I believe, the feeling prevalent in their own Party, in the country, amongst many of their followers, and important followers at that, they are determined not to give way; having taken the wrong course, they are determined to continue on the wrong course.  There is no explanation otherwise of a motion of this kind being tabled to-day.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of misrepresentation. If there was any misrepresentation, it was not ours.  If anybody misrepresented the President, it was himself in his attempt to explain away what he said.  That was the real misrepresentation.  If there has been any doubt as to his attitude on the questions raised by this Bill and by this motion, there is only the one person to blame, and that is the man who refuses to give a straight answer to a straight question.  I am not going into the question of misrepresentation. I, amongst others, have been accused of misrepresenting the President.  I leave it to anybody who reads the report of the proceedings of this House to determine which of us gave the truer interpretation of his meaning. A man who can give a harmless inter pretation to a statement attributed to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance which that Parliamentary Secretary never made, and which he denies is true, but which the President shows is quite harmless&mdash; that man can do anything in the way of explanation, and he has done it.</P>
    <P>How can we give to the Government what they want in this particular matter?  How can we trust the Government? What right have we, even if we wanted, to give powers to the Government to pass in a single day a Bill of this kind when one of the principal Ministers of the Government, the Minister for Finance, speaking last Sunday, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This land required the service and sacrifice of every son of Ireland and had no blood, no zeal, and no enthusiasm to spend in any other cause or in any other country&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> After that statement by the Minister for Finance last Sunday, we are accused of misrepresentation and we are asked by that same Government of which he is such a prominent Minister to give these facilities to-day.  I think it would be degrading if for a moment we considered anything of the kind. There are certain aspects of the Minister for Finance's speech last Sunday into which I do not intend to go.  Events have occurred quite recently that make me avoid some particular parts of that speech and I shall not deal with them.  But from that speech alone you know, Sir, and the House knows the views of the Government, who are asking us to do this to-day.</P>
    <P>What must be the atmosphere in which these Ministers move if the Minister for Finance was able to make a statement of that kind?  Why talk of misrepresentations about &ldquo;isms&rdquo; when the Minister for Finance states: &ldquo;This land required the service and sacrifice of every son of Ireland, and they had no blood, no zeal and no enthusiasm to spend in any other cause or in any other country&rdquo;? We all love this land of ours and are proud of it.  We are proud of this land, of her traditions, of her history, and of her steadfastness to ideals.  I hope everybody here, each in his own particular way, tries to serve that land and these ideals.  But despite the Minister for Finance, and despite some other Deputies, such as Deputy MacDermot, I suggest that there is a higher cause even than the particular ones mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  I think it is a shocking thing that a Minister for this State should make a statement of that kind.  High as we rate and deeply as we respect the interests of this country, there is an even higher cause than these.  And yet a Government of which that man is a Minister come down here to-day and ask this House to display their confidence in that Government by passing this guillotine resolution.  The same enlightened Minister said: &ldquo;There was a civil war being waged in Spain, and why should Irishmen fight on one side or the other?&rdquo;  Let me point out that it was not whether, <Col N="904" /> as part and parcel of an international agreement, this Bill should be forced through, but that it was the merits of the case that were being argued.</P>

Why that statement about &ldquo;isms&rdquo; did not go half the length to which the Minister for Finance went last Sunday. He absolutely crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and <Col N="905" /> dotted every &ldquo;i&rdquo; in the statement of the President.  But he was only expressing what was the policy of the President, a thing the President might let slip in an unguarded moment&mdash;he is much too clever to do it often&mdash;an indiscreet member of the Government could fully reveal to an astonished public.</P>

      <P>We can only read this Bill in the light of the Governmental statements, and we can only discuss this motion in the light of <Col N="906" /> such statements.  As it was put yesterday by one of the Dublin newspapers, &ldquo;the cat is out of the bag,&rdquo; and I suggest that the President will have great difficulty in getting the cat back again.  He has tried to get several cats back, but I have very grave doubts if he will get this cat back.  How can we consent to the policy the Government has outlined in the motion? How can we consent to their request when a Minister said that the people of Ireland have no interest in this matter?  In order to show that they have, and that, therefore, this motion should be refused, may I give a quotation?  This is a statement made by the Minister for Education to the Caballero Government to the Russian anti-God Central Council of Moscow. I have not seen the original statement, but I quote from <i>The Universe</i> of last week:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your struggle against religion is also ours.  It is our duty to make Spain a land of militant atheists. The struggle will be difficult, as there are still a great many reactionaries in the country who oppose the absorption of Soviet culture.  All schools will be branches of Communist schools.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that the people of this country have no interest in that struggle between two foreign sects is to show a complete misunderstanding of the whole position.  I could hardly believe it to be otherwise than a deliberate failure to recognise the vital issues at stake.  Yet men guilty of that failure go on and ask us in a single day to pass a Bill of this kind. You cannot divorce this Bill from all the surrounding circumstances&mdash;at least I am not capable of doing so. My mind is not subtle enough for that. Before this Bill becomes law&mdash; apparently that will be to-night&mdash;I should like to give Ministers an opportunity of sleeping over it, to see if they could not meet our wishes in this particular matter.  I oppose this motion.  I should like a plain, definite and clear statement of the Ministerial attitude on the vital issues involved. They have neglected opportunity after opportunity.  Let us give them another opportunity, by postponing the final decision on the matter, at least, until <Col N="907" /> to-morrow.  How can we believe that Ministers responsible for this Bill and this motion really know what the whole struggle is about?  Can any reasonable man who has followed this struggle, and who has tried to see what was involved in it, believe that the President really knows what it is all about?  I am taking the most charitable interpretation of his conduct. If he does realise it and grasps what is at stake, then, Sir, his guilt is heavy indeed.  Let him, before this Bill passes, before giving this gesture of solidarity with European nations, make another gesture, a gesture of solidarity with the traditions and the ideals of his own people.  He has that opportunity.  If he wants time to think it over, let this Bill proceed in the normal way and let us have it again to-morrow or next week.  The President likes a policy, I understand, of &ldquo;keeping them guessing.&rdquo;  The issue involved in this Bill is too vital for that.  That is not a time to keep the people of Ireland guessing, and this House, no matter to whatever Party Deputies belong, should not pass this motion until we have a clear and unequivocal statement from the Minister for External Affairs as to what his attitude is.  I venture to say that this is one of the most vital questions this or any other country in the world can face at the moment.  For my part, considering the nature of the issue at stake, I fail to see how this question could be discussed without reference to religious and moral principles.  If there are vest-pocket Machiavellis in this House who think that it is possible to discuss this issue and leave such vital considerations out, I profoundly disagree with them.  I say you cannot do it.  I do not mind the sneers thrown at us for that, because we undertook to do what is our duty&mdash; sometimes a painful duty.  Our duty we consider clear, and that duty we have followed.  I think we did accomplish a little in dragging a quarter of a statement from the President.  You could hardly call it a clarification, but it was, at least, a dawn of clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is his skill. It was not his fault.  It would be a fault in an ordinary man&mdash;very much a fault.  If we could, between now and the final passing of the Bill, persuade him to be quite definite, I feel something would be achieved.  If we could induce him to give a lead to the country, to his followers in the country, and to his Ministers when they speak in the country, which would show beyond yea or nay where he stood, and where the people of Ireland stood, I think we should have done a good day's work for this country.  I will admit it might be some advantage to his Party, and that is, perhaps, a heavy price to pay, but it would be worth even that price.  I say again that before the House is asked to pass this resolution, he ought to seize the opportunity of at least making an effort to assuage the uneasiness that prevails in the breasts of very important members of his own Party, who have been to a certain extent horrified by the line he has adopted, representing a certain campaign that has gone on in this country, suggesting that this is a struggle between two &ldquo;isms.&rdquo;  To a man who could take that view&mdash;or to a man who could emphasise it like the Minister for Finance emphasised it last Sunday&mdash;we cannot give those facilities for which he asks to-day, in so far as we can withhold them.  He has had an opportunity, and he should have clarified the position.  He has had various ways of doing it; he has done it in none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had from Deputy Donnelly a statement that when the time came there is no doubt a remedy would be found.  If churches were to be burned, he would be the first to defend them. I will accept that.  We do not want to let it come to that.  That is where we differ.  The country ought to be reassured on this important matter. The House ought to be reassured before it passes this particular motion. <Col N="909" /> As I say, if there is anything urgent in connection with this whole matter, it is a clarification of the Government's attitude, and we have not got that.  I have no doubt that an isolated passage or sentence may be taken here or there out of a statement of the President, or one of his Ministers&mdash; possibly even of his Press&mdash;to show what is the attitude of the Party.  You can always do that with isolated statements. But we have to take the prevailing tendency of their remarks.  That prevailing tendency, Sir, is such as to cause us grave disquiet, and to cause grave disquiet to everybody who has the good name and the interests of this country at heart.  That is the really urgent matter.  It is much more urgent, I suggest, than the motion which we are now discussing.  Let him allay that profound uneasiness which has sprung up in many quarters, even amongst many of his own followers, in the last four or five months&mdash;uneasiness to which he and his Ministers have contributed; uneasiness which they have done their part to build up.</P>
    <P>I have tried&mdash;I admit I was not able, owing to your ruling, Sir&mdash;to traverse quite the ground I had at first intended, to make it clear to this House what the attitude of this Party is, and what the attitude of the House, in my opinion, ought to be.  From the start, owing to the greater facilities possessed by other countries, I was definitely of the opinion that a policy of non-intervention was the soundest policy, first of all on the grounds that, if intervention happened, people at Spain's border would be able to utilise the opportunity much better than we could, owing to their propinquity and their size; and secondly, because of the dangers of a European conflict. But from consideration of the wisdom of that policy, we cannot divorce the attitude of the Government on this whole matter.  I think, Sir, that the attitude of the House, if they have the interests of this country and its honour at heart, ought to be clear on this particular motion.  I oppose the motion, Sir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall vote for this motion for the paradoxical reason that I believe that those who support <Col N="910" /> non-intervention in principle should also support it in practice by their votes.  Deputy O'Sullivan has exercised remarkable agility in trying to show that there has been no inconsistency in the attitude of the Opposition; in trying to show that it was quite reasonable of them to declare themselves in favour of non-intervention last November, and to oppose the necessary steps for making non-intervention effective to-day.  Once again, instead of discussing the merits of the actual Bill before us and the merits of the motion, we have been treated to a discourse about speeches made by Ministers, and statements made by them have, in my opinion, been tortured and twisted out of their true sense.  But were that not so, and had the utterance, for example of the Minister for Finance carried all the implications that Deputy O'Sullivan says it carried, I would still have considered that there is very little reason why we should bother our heads about the statements that Ministers have made. What we ought to bother our heads about is whether measures of non-intervention are good or bad, and whether they should be expedited or not.  Those matters with regard to a diplomatic representative and with regard to the alleged Red or semi-Red tendencies of the Fianna Fáil Party, even if the Opposition statements were well-founded&mdash;which they are not&mdash;would, in my opinion, be irrelevant to what we have to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has taken the opportunity once again to suggest that only on the Opposition Benches is the true nobility recognised of the cause for which General Franco is fighting. I absolutely deny that.  I do not think anyone has painted that cause in more glowing terms than I myself did in this House a day or two ago, but the merits of the two causes in Spain are not what we have to decide.  You would hardly realise, you would hardly believe, listening to the sort of things the Opposition Deputies have been saying that if you scanned the columns of the newspapers and looked to see what has been going on in the Parliaments of all the other countries concerned in this matter, you would not find one Government that is being attacked on <Col N="911" /> the same lines that our Government here is being attacked for doing no more and no less than what the other Governments are doing.  Why should that be so?</P>
    <P>We all agree, or practically everybody in the House agrees, in having warm sympathy with the cause of General Franco, but we recognise that the considerations which count here, are, first of all, the importance of maintaining European peace, the terrible danger that a general war will throw the whole of Europe into misery and Communism if intervention is allowed to go on.  There is also the consideration to which the President drew attention that, in the long run, the fate of Spain must be settled by the Spaniards; and there is the further consideration that, according to what we can judge from what we read of the position in Spain, and, according to statements that have been made to-day in Italy and Germany, the effect of these measures being brought into operation for non-intervention at this particular moment will be not to hinder General Franco but to help him. The Franco cause is secure if no new factors are introduced into the situation, and measures of non-intervention ensure that no new factors will be introduced into the situation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition declare that the Government and their supporters have dragged Party politics into this matter.  How have the Government and their supporters dragged Party politics into this matter?  What advantage from the Party point of view had the Fianna Fáil Party to gain from the policy of non-intervention? What Party advantage had they to gain from maintaining diplomatic representation with the Caballero Government?  Obviously they had no Party advantage to gain.  By doing that, they were doing something that every nation in Europe has done except Germany, Italy, and Albania. It was stated here the other day that Portugal had acted along with Germany and Italy in withdrawing recognition from the Caballero Government, but that is not so.</P>

      <P>At any rate one thing is quite certain and that is, that except for Fascist countries and states under the control of Fascist countries, nobody has acted in the way the Opposition suggest our Government ought to have acted, and, therefore, there is not the smallest <i>prima-facie</i> evidence that our Government, for the sake of some Party advantage, have taken a course which they would not otherwise have taken.  Until the Opposition forced it on them by the line they were taking, there was no attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party, and there could be no attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party, to make any hostile reflections on the Fine Gael Party in reference to Spain.  The whole impetus to the Party battle arose from the Opposition and the Opposition only, and I say that was discreditable. I say that the course of action the Opposition are taking here is unparalleled in Europe at the present moment, and I say what I said the other day, in spite of the excitement it aroused in the breast of Deputy Dillon, that they are exploiting, or trying to exploit, the religious sentiments of our people for Party advantage.  That is an accusation that has often been made and truly made by many politicians in this country, including, I am pretty certain, Deputy Dillon himself against the Orange leaders in the North, of trying to exploit religious feeling for political purposes.  There is nothing novel in the thing, unfortunately, and there is nothing novel in the accusation, and to suggest that it is an unparalleled sort of personal vituperation is simply to fly in the face of the facts.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Deputy O'Sullivan professes great concern for the fair name of this country.  The fair name of this country is in no danger whatever from the policy of the Government.  How could it be, associated as we are with so many other Catholic States in this matter?  It is the fair fame of the Party to which they belong that the Opposition ought to be taking heed of rather than the fair fame of the country, which is perfectly safe in this matter in the hands of the President.</P>

      <P>The main point about this Bill is that it is a Bill not favouring Communism but against Communism, and every vote on it and on the measures necessary to expedite its passage into law should be given with that consideration in mind.  We are told that the country needs to be reassured.  It does need to be reassured, but why does it need to be reassured?  Simply and solely because of the propaganda of the Opposition. The country could hardly have been thrown into a fever on this subject, in so far as it has been, if politicians had not confused the public mind and disguised from it the fact that in this we are acting normally and acting as other countries do.  I have not the smallest hesitation in supporting this motion, and I only wish that, even at the eleventh hour, now that these amendments with regard to diplomatic representation have been defeated, that pretext could be laid aside and regarded as disposed of, and that the Opposition would carry out the policy which they themselves praised a few months ago of making non-intervention in Spain effective.  They say one moment that they are, in principle, in favour of non-intervention, and the next moment, when they think they can score points by doing so, they make speeches which suggest that it is wicked to prevent our young people from engaging in the struggle and that it is wicked to suggest that it is unwise of them to do so.  Nobody, I am sure, in any Party wants to depreciate the courage of young men who have gone <Col N="914" /> out, and no one wants to suggest that their motives are other than the highest, but we ought all to be agreed, if we are in favour of non-intervention, that it is desirable that they shall not go.  I wish the Opposition would show a little more logic, a little more courage, and a little less love of Party advantage, and co-operate with the Government in the cause of peace.</P>

      <P>I want to intervene just for a moment. It has been suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan that the Government are steamrolling this Bill through the House.  There is no attempt being made by the Government to steamroll this Bill through the House.  When this Bill was introduced last week, two amendments were submitted, one by the Opposition and one by Deputy Belton.  These amendments were debated here, and we find the Bill to-day clipped of these trimmings and clipped of these amendments, and we have to deal simply and solely with the Bill as one for non-intervention.  I have been trying to follow the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan, and I confess I have not been successful. On the issue of non-intervention, we have, as was quoted here by the President on the last day, the statement made in the House by Deputy Cosgrave last November which leaves no doubt in anybody's mind where he stood and where his Party stood on this question of non-intervention, which is the matter at issue here to-day.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of that policy we on this side of the House approve.  I believe that the intervention of outside Powers would, as far as our human intelligence can judge, almost certainly lead to a general conflagration, a conflagration that might bring upon us at once the disastrous consequences that would follow inevitably but at a slower pace on the victory of the Red forces in Spain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Even one would gather from Deputy Belton's speeches in 1936 that he did not approve of people going to Spain and taking part in the fight there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that while he admired them, he certainly did not approve of them.  So far as I can follow Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks, his objection now to this Bill going through is that he wants first to have a definite statement from us as to our attitude towards Communism or something like that.  Now that statement was made by the President here on the last day on which this Bill was debated.  That statement was made as clearly as any Deputy who wishes to see and read it, could expect.  The statement is not wanted for the people here but it is wanted for the people outside, so that certain people can be able to twist it for propagandist purposes.</P>
      <P>I can quote statements from the other side and I ask them now what they meant by them.  I quote here a statement made by Deputy Mulcahy on the 5th December, 1936, as reported in the <i>Western People.</i>  The statement is headed &ldquo;WHY THEY WENT&rdquo; and reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was a time not so long ago,&rdquo; continued the speaker, &ldquo;when the young men of this country established democratic rule here&mdash;a rule which will stand for all time, if we are only watchful. Some of these men are amongst those who have left to fight for Spain and the reason they are gone there is that in spite of their work for this country (Ireland) the country is not able to offer them an honourable living so they have gone to fight for our religion in another country.  Who sent them there?  The forces that sent these young men to Spain are the forces that sent a hundred times as many men from here into the British Army during the last few years.  There is not a single person in Ireland who is blind to that fact.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same forces that have compelled these men to go to Spain are the same forces as have driven men into the British Army during the past few years.  I do not want to go on on those lines except just to say this&mdash;the people who are so anxious to distort simple statements for propagandist purposes can have the honesty of these <Col N="916" /> statements tested by their own attitude in the past&mdash;by the statements they have made themselves.  So far as the present stage of this Bill is concerned, we can say that the Bill has been very fully discussed by this House already and discussed before we came on to the Committee Stage at all. Very few points were raised on the Second Reading that would be relative to the Committee Stage.</P>

Then what is the point now being made by Deputies that we are closuring discussion?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not without discussion, and the Deputy knows it. For two days last week we discussed and debated this Bill.  One Deputy spoke for almost three hours on the Bill, and it is not with regard to the merits of the Bill that we have doubts. It is clear that the aim of the Opposition is to twist and distort and misrepresent the Bill in some way or other, simply and solely for propagandist purposes and for nothing else. We have a charge made to-day, and that charge has been made despite the statement made by the President on last Friday.  That statement of the President left no doubt or uncertainty as to the sentiments, feelings and sympathies of the people on this side of the House in the present conflict in Spain.  Deputies on the opposite benches know that, and it is unfair, unjust and beneath the dignity of any political party to try, by stooping to such miserable methods as these, to fool the people and get Party and political credit for their actions.  These statements of the President are there to be looked at and read by anybody who wants to read them.  So far as the stage that is reached now is concerned, we want to get that stage and the other stages through because we have entered into this non-intervention pact with other nations.  As has been pointed out by Deputy MacDermot, we see no such discussion attempted to be raised in other Parliaments abroad that have to deal with this question.  It is only here, since this Bill was introduced, that such attempts have been tried.  We want this Bill with the least possible delay to be put into effect, so that we can do what we undertook to do in the non-intervention pact.  We should have got this Bill in the ordinary way by midnight on Saturday, but, seeing that the Opposition were not prepared to give us the further stages then, we put the Bill back until this week.  If anybody had any complaint to make in connection with this Bill, it would <Col N="918" /> not be with regard to the details of the Bill, because no details were referred to on the Second Stage.</P>

It is extremely distasteful to me.  The representation as to urgency that has been made by the Government is the essence of the case for getting the Bill through to-day.  But it is not an hour ago since the President told us that seven States who are parties to this non-intervention agreement have done nothing at all in the matter of introducing legislation, and that 11 States are still discussing the legislation they introduced.  We are told that if this non-intervention pact is not to be held back this Bill must be guillotined through this House to-day.  Deputy Thrift on the Second Stage spoke without accuracy when he said that he had a feeling that if we did not give the President all the stages of this Bill on Saturday last, the non-intervention pact might collapse, because the failure of one State to pass the Bill might imperil that pact.  But from the President we learned to-day that seven of the States have not yet introduced legislation.</P>

      <P>As I understood the representations from the Government last Friday, they were that it was vital to get this Bill through; that, otherwise, our action would imperil the entire non-intervention pact.  That was the representation made to us. We were held up to public odium that, in an irresponsible moment, we did not care and were prepared to postpone the whole matter.  Now, we understand that 11 States are still legislating and that six have not started to legislate yet.  We are told that our Government requires our Parliament to stampede the whole business through, ours being virtually the only unicameral system of Government in Europe.  Practically every other State in Europe has two Chambers.  Ours is virtually the only system having one Chamber and it is the one State in which it is a vital duty to guillotine the whole business through.  When you ask why, echo answers why.  The only answer I heard, so far, is that Great Britain wants it, that France wants it and that the Great Powers want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I believe in co-operation with members of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I have always believed that and I was not afraid to say so on public platforms when some of the recent converts to that doctrine were shouting &ldquo;West Briton&rdquo; at me. While I am prepared to bend my mind to understanding the instinctive reactions of the peoples of the other States-members, while I am prepared to co-operate, in so far as it is possible to co-operate, with the British people, I was not aware until to-day that the time had yet come in this country when we must not only act with Britain but think and feel with the British people, at the same time. So far as I am concerned and so far as most of the Deputies on these benches are concerned, we are prepared <Col N="920" /> to bend our minds to the task of understanding things we do not instinctively feel when they manifest themselves amongst the peoples who are now our fellow-members in the Commonwealth but we never can instinctively feel as the British people feel and we never can instinctively think as the British people think.  It is a task for us to adjust our minds to theirs.  It is a task we should gladly undertake because we believe it would be in the best interests of our country to do so.  But there is no use in quoting what England or France did.  We are prepared to co-operate with them but we are not prepared to deliver ourselves body and soul into their hands.  I do not feel as Great Britain feels about this matter of non-intervention and I do not feel as France feels.  I want non-intervention because I believe it will bring victory to the Burgos Government.  If I believed that non-intervention meant that the Burgos Government would be defeated, I should be against non-intervention. Let us be clear on that.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that there is a difference between ourselves and the members of the Irish Brigade but it is a difference of method and not of sentiment.  We do not take the view &mdash;because we do not take the view, we cannot consent to the despatch the President asked for&mdash;that this is a cause other than our own.  I do not know whether, on reflection, the Minister for Finance would take that view. Let me at once repudiate the suggestion that we are trying to fix on members of the Government Party responsibility for words which may have been spoken in haste.  I know the reputation of the Minister for Finance as a public speaker.  I know that, on public platforms, he sometimes unwittingly betrays himself into indiscretions which he subsequently bitterly regrets.  He described the issue joined in Spain as &ldquo;a cause other than our cause.&rdquo;  We do not accept that.  As I understood the President he said that he recognised that this was a battle between God and no God, a battle between Theism and Atheism. Granting him all credit for boldly saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They let their tongues run away with them and say this kind of thing in public, and then blame their neighbours for saying that it is evidence of the atmosphere in which they are allowing themselves to live.  It is because I see that the attitude adopted by the new Liberals of this country is leading the country into paths of considerable peril that I am anxious that, at this juncture, we should meet this situation boldly, resolutely and unequivocally.  The Minister for Justice gets up and thinks he confounds us by quoting a speech made by Deputy Cosgrave last November. Every word, syllable and sentence of that speech I adopt.  He stood for non-intervention, as we stand for non-intervention.  Our case is that this Bill, coupled with the return of Mr. Kerney to the Red Government in Valencia, is not non-intervention but intervention&mdash;moral intervention.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Donnelly would restrain himself he would find <Col N="922" /> that I would not delay the House very long.  Our assistance, in substance, to the Spanish Government at Burgos or to the Communist Government at Valencia is not going to make very much difference one way or another. Our resources do not extend to giving formidable help to either side.  But our moral assistance can be immense. I believe it is in the interests of Spain and in the interest of the cause being fought out in Spain that there should not be intervention.  But I believe that it is in the interests of the cause being fought out in Spain, in the interests of Spain, in the interests of this country and of the world that our moral influence should be felt perfectly clearly.  To pass this Bill with despatch, to let it out to the public that the Irish Government is forcing this Bill through the House before many of the other signatories have put their hand to the work, coupled with the despatch of our ambassador to the Red Government in Madrid, must lead, as the slowest Deputy must perceive, to a certain interpretation of our attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise it.  It was thrust upon me by the Deputy sitting on my right hand.  There is no doubt about that question of representation.  We are told that it is a matter of dismay that we should ask our Government to do something that no other Government is doing in this matter.  Are we always to trot along in the wake of every pink Liberal Government in Europe? Are we never to lead?  Would it be presumption on the part of this nation to strike out a course of its own?  May we not say that we believe in non-intervention, but that if it is to be non-intervention it should be real non-intervention, not non-intervention in the sense that France or England understands that phrase, but non-intervention which will make it manifest to the world that if we put up anything which any person can interpret as a block between ourselves and Franco that we will raise a wall 10,000 times as high between ourselves and <Col N="924" /> Caballero.  That is the kind of non-intervention that we are asking for.</P>
      <P>I spoke of the legitimate construction that could be put on the words of the Minister for Finance.  I ask him to withdraw those words. Perhaps more zealous partisans of the cause which I am proud to support would think me wrong in opening a way of escape for him from the printed words he spoke.  I do not think any useful purpose can be served by driving any man in this country into the arms of the pinks or the reds, and I know, or I believe I know, that this Minister of State has no desire to find refuge in such company.  I would welcome from him, now that he is here in the House, a clear statement that when he said that this cause was a cause other than our own, it was merely a turn of speech, the exact meaning of which he subsequently realised and desired to withdraw.  But, if he chooses to stand upon that statement, then the issue is joined between us, because if his position and that of his Party is that this is a cause other than his own cause, for us, at least, this is a cause which is identical with ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some people who profess, I well believe with an assumed innocence, to find it impossible to understand our position.  Lest people be misled by that kind of feigned detachment and painful honesty which we sometimes observe in this House, let me state in words of as near one syllable as I can find what the position of this Party is. We believe in the policy of non-intervention because we believe that policy will help the Burgos Government. We believe that our moral contribution to the issues joined in Spain can be far more effective than any material contribution our people can make.  We believe that before the world the guillotining of this Bill through this House coincidentally with the return of the Irish ambassador to the Communist Government in Spain, is bound gravely to misrepresent the moral position of our people, and to suggest to the whole world that here in a Catholic democratic country there is <Col N="925" /> grave doubt as to whether Franco or Caballero is in the right: that there is not much to choose between them.  We believe that that would immensely mitigate the moral force which we can, and ought to, throw into the scale on the side of Burgos and Salamanca.</P>
    <P>We are charged with seeking to parade the members of the Fianna Fáil Party as Communists.  That is not so, but we do say this, that if the mentality capable of declaring that the cause in Spain is other than our cause prevails and continues, we are travelling the road when there will be aligned in this country a group and Party in defence of radical views which may, before history is finished, be dominated by forces quite other than those contemplated by the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not want that.  I want on this issue a united front.  I want a united front amongst all Parties in this country on the thesis that that cause is our cause: that the Irish nation as a whole has no two minds about it, and that we are all prepared to co-operate in what we believe to be the most effective way in helping General Franco and the Government of Salamanca.  Be careful lest the attitude on the other side is not hardening into the view where we are to take up the position of united neutrality as between the two, because, remember, if that is the position into which the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are being dragged, unwittingly perhaps, it is the first step to the establishment in this country of what in France is the <i>Front Populaire</i> and what in Spain is the <i>Frente Populaire.</i>  I want to tell the Fianna Fáil Party now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The fate and end of them all has been that they have been swallowed up by their own Left Wing.  I am ready and willing to co-operate on these fundamental facts in making a united front on the things we want, but be careful of the paths that you are travelling along, leading to the Popular Front. I warn you of this, that while we are ready and willing to make on these fundamental questions a united front with every Party in this country, if we have got to choose between splitting this country and joining the Popular Front in the vain hope of dominating it in the end, we will make our choice of splitting this country from top to bottom before we will unite with anyone under the banner of the Popular Front.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 20, after the word &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; and before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and after Dáil Eireann has been supplied with and approved of the scheme for enforcing non-intervention.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have been discussing non-intervention for two or three days.  I was glad to hear Deputy Dillon to-day saying that his view of non-intervention is that we in this country want General Franco's side to win and, if non-intervention is conducive to that end, he is for it; if it is not, he is against it.  That is precisely my attitude. Seeing that the signs do not indicate that non-intervention will be conducive to the success of General Franco, now that this Bill is forced upon us by the majority machine in this House without giving the matter much thought, I put down this amendment to ensure that, as far as possible, if we are going to have non-intervention, we should know the mechanism of that non-intervention and whether it is likely to be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that the indications are that non-intervention will not be good for General Franco.  My reason for <Col N="932" /> saying that is the message appearing in the papers this morning from General O'Duffy.  An officer of the Spanish Army could not get out such a message through the censor if General Franco wanted non-intervention. That in itself should have made us go cautiously.  But the guillotine had been moved after the House heard the eloquence of my friend on the left. He told us that the only use for Christianity is to cash in on it&mdash;that was the diatribe used in this House, and, as Deputy Dillon said at the time, no honourable man would use it.  The Deputy who used it cheered for General Franco that day; he cheered for him to-day, but he is voting to crucify him.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have non-intervention, what sort will it be? Have we any evidence as to how effective it will be?  Nobody from the Government side has told us what steps will be taken to protect, above all, the French frontier. Had those holding that frontier not allowed so many of the Reds to cross over it, the war would probably have been over long ago.  Who is going to watch that frontier now?  If that frontier is not going to be patrolled and guarded so that the proverbial crow will not pass through, then we are only being hoodwinked in this country and we are doing something that is a crime.  I am perfectly convinced that we have committed a crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice and other Ministers said we are doing nothing beyond what other nations are doing. Why were Irishmen let out and then betrayed?  My phrase on that was referred to by the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;that though I did not approve of the wisdom of Irishmen going out to fight in Spain.&rdquo;  Those were my exact words, delivered in College Green six months ago.</P>

      <P>What about them?  You did not see them outside the <i>Irish Press,</i> and it is only one of the many wild geese and untrue statements made by that organ, so far as I am concerned.  In order to know <Col N="933" /> exactly what we are doing, I submit that these few words proposed by me as an amendment should be inserted in this section.  This country should not be committed to anything unless it knows what it is being committed to.  We are committed now to non-intervention.  Let us at least have effective non-intervention.  I would like to know from the Minister in charge of this Bill what steps the Government contemplate taking.</P>
      <P>President de Valera kept us for an hour the other night to tell us he was misrepresented, when he was quoted exactly.  He was misrepresented! Because he saw the difficulty of facing the public with the obvious meaning of the words he had spoken, he cried: &ldquo;I was misrepresented.&rdquo; He was misrepresented over &ldquo;isms.&rdquo; He said nobody was helping the Franco Government except Italy and Germany, who were seeking there a Government after their own heart. That was his speech.  Therefore, when he recognises the Caballero Government, he must be seeking a Government after his own heart.</P>

      <P>In this way.  Before this country is committed to non-intervention we must see that it is not one-sided non-intervention.  In <Col N="934" /> order to know exactly what we are doing we should have the scheme proposed to be adopted to implement this Non-Intervention Pact before us here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of the policy enshrined in this Bill and I am in favour also of the most complete and effective form of non-intervention. That is why I should like a little bit more information from the Minister for Justice as to what is likely to happen when the Bill becomes law. I would support the Bill whole-heartedly if it had been brought in and passed six months ago, because if it had been passed six months ago and had come into operation at that time it would have saved the politicians and people of this country the trouble of trying to explain to the outside world how Catholic Ireland should think fit to send two sections of its citizens to fight in a civil war in Spain.  I think every politician in this country with any responsibility during the civil war we had here found it hard enough to explain, if it could ever be explained, how it was necessary for us to have a civil war in 1922 and 1923.  I think it would be impossible for anybody on any side of this House to explain why two sections of our Catholic citizens should go out to fight in a civil war in another country and force us to read in the newspapers that some of these men have been killed while engaged in a civil war in a foreign country.  If this Bill had been passed six months ago it would, at any rate, have saved us that trouble and that trial.  The Germans, the Russians and the Italians who are on one side or the other in this war, are united and have their full forces thrown on either one side or the other but, unfortunately that is not the position of the brigades who left this country to take part in this conflict in a foreign land.</P>

I am in favour of a complete and effective system of non-intervention, and by that I mean, at any rate, the refusal on the part of this Government to recognise the so-called Government of either Caballero or Franco.  Deputy Belton told us here the other night that 99 per cent. of the Irish people were in favour of the recognition of the so-called Franco Government.  From where did he get that information?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin tells us that he wants to see democratic government re-established in Spain. Part of the struggle we are carrying on here for the past couple of days is to see democratic government re-established in this country.  We want to deal with an important question like this in a way in which a Parliament erected on democratic principles, and carrying on with respect for these principles, would deal with it.  I sympathise very much with this amendment, as I think it bears on the general lines of the attitude the House would have towards this Bill.  We have emphasised repeatedly that we stand for non-intervention.  But we would expect, when putting such a measure before the House, after non-intervention in the matter of arms had been tried and failed, that in a measure dealing with non-intervention in the matter of men as well as arms, the Government would put before it a plan indicating how that plan was expected to work.  We are interested to see what countries are going to be responsible for enforcing the Non-Intervention Pact, and what machinery they are going to adopt.  We should like to have that information as an indication of what the end of non-intervention is likely to be in Spain.  Part of the difficulty that has arisen from the <Col N="940" /> closure of the Second Reading discussion, and from the closure of the Committee and Final Stages, is that the Government have given no information good, bad or indifferent.  The country is asked to accept a non-intervention Bill as a measure that is going to ensure success of the Franco Government and, therefore, the rehabilitation of a Government in Spain that will give fair play, to say nothing more, to the religion of the vast majority of the people there.  From the information we are able to get in odd ways, here and there, we know that certain countries have intervened on one side and have sent men to Spain.  Certain opinions have been expressed as to what non-intervention is going to mean, but I should like to put before the House one or two quotations from volumes of reports on foreign affairs that I was putting before the House on Friday night when I was stopped, as indicating the problems raised and the necessity of getting information on the amendment.  In the Non-Intervention Committee in September last the representatives of Great Britain and France held that non-intervention was in favour of the Madrid Government. It is fair to say that the Madrid Government did not accept that opinion.  Subsequently it is stated on page 663:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No convincing estimates of the numbers of these foreigners were available by the end of December, but it was reliably asserted that by that date not less than 15,000 Germans, 5,000 Italians and others had joined General Franco's Army and, on the Government side, not less than 10,000 experienced soldiers from other countries had joined Largo Caballero.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another extract from the report states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;General Franco's military position was becoming critical through shortage of good fighting man-power.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain facts existed in Spain, and these facts were <Col N="941" /> influenced because soldiers from other countries had gone to Spain and were fighting on both sides.  The machinery that is going to be set up to enforce non-intervention is, I take it, going to be provided by these countries, and supervised either by their representatives or by a combination of them.  If the position is that from Russia and other countries 10,000 experienced soldiers have gone to join Largo Caballero, we want to know what position that Government is going to have in the control of the non-intervention machinery; and if 15,000 Germans and 5,000 Italians have gone to Spain, we are interested to know what is the position of the German and the Italian Governments in relation to the non-intervention machinery; whether we can have confidence that the machinery being set up is not going to assist the nationals of one or other European Governments to continue the kind of interference in the Spanish war that has been going on up to the present.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin had difficulties when Deputies were putting questions to him.  I think I am in order in saying that if the Deputy is in any way interested in this matter, particularly when he thinks there is something in Deputy Belton's amendment, if he listens he will get some facts that he did not get from the Government, and that it is questionable if Deputies in their ordinary daily reading could get.  However, these Governments to that extent have intervened. It was the opinion in September of the French and British representatives on the Non-Intervention Committee that non-intervention favoured the Madrid Government, and the military position in Spain, as indicated in the Foreign Affairs Report at the end of December was that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The struggle itself became more acute, because of these outside factors.  General Franco's military <Col N="942" /> position was becoming critical through shortage of good fighting man-power.  His foreign legion and Moors had grown thoroughly exhausted from having borne the brunt of nearly all the heavy fighting, and he could not rely upon the garrisons of regular army units to take their place in the front line. Hence, foreign aid was essential to replace the weary Moors and legionaries, if he should win.  On the Government side there was no shortage of man-power.&rdquo;</P>

After all the talk that we have heard from the Government Benches, and from other benches in this House, as to how they stand, we ought to have some statement of the facts as regards the present situation in Spain, and some statement of the facts as to what is proposed under this Bill.  If we are a democratic Government, taking decisions that are going to be helpful in Europe, and are going to be helpful on the side that we want to see win in Spain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we are passing a non-intervention law in this country, or standing for it, we ought at least to get a chance of opening our eyes as to what the facts are; we should be helped by the Government, who alone has the information, to open our eyes to them.  Is the non-intervention machinery going to be operated in a way that is going to allow Russian troops in to assist the Caballero Government, which is declared here at the end of December to be in no want of man power?  That is the matter that this House is concerned with and, therefore, I think the amendment put down by Deputy Belton is a reasonable one, as an amendment endeavouring to extract some information from the Government on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has really answered the point of Deputy Belton's amendment.  My own point of view, and I think it is representative of the ordinary point of view in this country, is that, irrespective of what may be the feeling in the other 26 countries, the people of this country quite rightly think that involved in this fight now going on in Spain are certain transcendent values.  We do not regard it as a matter of indifference to us what the outcome is.  With regard to non-intervention, we are prepared to participate in non-intervention under certain conditions.  We are not prepared to do so if that agreement is used to the advantage of the wrong side and to the disadvantage of the right.  Usually, bringing in a law, the Government is exercising its own powers.  It is taking certain powers which it can use effectively.  In this, the actual creation of a condition of non-intervention in Spain is not possible for our Government.  They can only participate in that with others. The Minister says here that so far as this country is concerned, at any rate, they intend to make non-intervention effective.  That will be acceptable, provided we are satisfied that the same applies to every other country.  If he says that all that matters is that so far as we are concerned, non-intervention shall be made applicable, I entirely disagree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want, and want earnestly, is that the Franco side in Spain should win and anything we can do to assist them we are prepared to do.  We are quite prepared, judging the circumstances there, to participate in a real non-intervention.  Now, what do we <Col N="947" /> find?  First, as I pointed out the other day, a sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee came to certain decisions, announced that they had come to these decisions and that people who were not on that Committee were necessarily going to agree to them, and we duly agreed. The Minister for Education said&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him but the effect of his statement was&mdash;that it was too much to expect that our Government, when participating in any international gathering, should dare even to ask a question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should quote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quote, but I do not want to misrepresent the Minister.  He rather ridiculed the idea that when there were big countries present, with big interests involved, we should go out on a line of our own, or even ask a question. That, I think, was implicit in the Minister's words.  Our Government, a member of the outside body, allowed the special select body, the inside body, to decide with regard to this. What has happened?  When the fighting began, everybody knows that thousands of recruits passed over the French frontier.  The one specific case of definite Government participation in intervention that one can point to is that of Russia.  In Russia, there is no producer, no owner, no trader and no exporter, except the Russian Government, and in as much as everybody knows that in Spain at this moment fighting for the Communist-Anarchist side are Russian tanks, Russian arms and Russians, we know that those tanks were produced by the producer in Russia, the Russian Government, that they were Russian Government owned tanks and were shipped on Russian Government owned boats, manned by Russian Government employees, to Spain.  Therefore, the only Government we can definitely accuse of participation is the Russian Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not apparently take sufficient interest in this matter to bother reading the newspapers, but <Col N="948" /> the newspapers indicate that the Russian fleet were allotted a certain part of the North Coast of Spain for their area of patrol, and that they have protested, and that they want a part on the East Coast of Spain, which, incidentally, would be a very nice part for anyone to control who wanted to allow free ingress of arms and men to assist Communism in Spain.  I myself happen to know very well the northern frontier of Spain.  I have travelled the Pyrenees from Cerbere to Hendaye, and only once since passports came into operation have I ever got into a country without a passport. Walking from Catalonia across Andorra, with a passport in my pocket ready to show to the first French official, I got right into Hospitalet and afterwards into Aix-le-Thermes and never met anybody to ask me for my passport.  Everybody who knows that frontier, where the mountain range is very wide and where smuggling has been an occupation, and a very satisfactory occupation for those who pursued it, knows perfectly well that it is practically impossible for the French Government, if it wanted to, and for the local governing authorities in the south of France to effectively prevent recruitment across that frontier.</P>
    <P>Now, we are asked here not to question what any other people is going to do, although, admittedly, their Governments have participated in and have connived at the breaking of the non-intervention arrangements to which they had already been parties. Not only is our Government to say that, so far as we are concerned and so far as this country is concerned, we will see that nobody and no assistance goes from this country to assist the cause that we think is of transcendent importance, but it is unthinkable that we should even try to find out if anything approaching that same condition is being produced in other countries.  We know perfectly well that the Russian Government has not bothered about keeping its word already in this matter, and we know that at this moment they have already been allotted a portion of the Spanish coast to patrol, and that they are asking for a portion of the Spanish coast which would enable them most effectively  <Col N="949" /> to thwart the object of non-intervention by allowing recruits and arms in to support the Reds in Spain. This amendment, as I understand it, merely asks that before this is made effective, information will be given to the Dáil to allow us to judge whether the agreement that is entered into is going to be as effectively implemented by other countries, who are anxious to assist the Reds in Spain, as it obviously is going to be implemented in this country, where we are all anxious to assist the anti-Reds in Spain.</P>
    <P>I think that when the Minister got up what he might have said was whether or not he was accepting Deputy Belton's amendment, and, if he was not accepting it, to give a sound reason for not accepting it. Instead of that, he merely showed that the President is not sufficiently interested as Minister for External Affairs to come in and deal with this Bill.  He was more anxious the other night to try to prove that the words he said meant what they could not possibly mean, and to suggest that they did not possess the only meaning they could possibly have.  He has wasted the time of this House by talking for a long time also with a view to explaining that Deputy Hugo Flinn's words meant what they could not possibly mean.</P>

He has left in charge a Minister who obviously does not know as much about this situation as any ordinary man or woman walking up and down the street.

      <P>Commonsense tells us that the powers interested in this matter of non-intervention will watch each other like hawks.  It is very unlikely, indeed, that Italy and Germany, to name no others, would allow Russia to get away with breaches of the Non-Intervention Pact; and very unlikely that Russia and, perhaps France, would allow Italy and Germany to get away with breaches of the pact on their side.  I suggest that if every nation that is concerned in this matter is going to wait until it has proof positive that non-intervention has worked, then non-intervention will never begin to work, because every nation will be watching every other nation.  Surely the commonsense view to take is that the arrangements will work satisfactorily.  We are assured that there are to be foreign observers on the French frontier and foreign observers on the Portuguese frontier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The main task we have to perform here is similar to what is being done in every other country concerned, and that is to get on with our own job.

      <P>The President, on the Second Reading, indicated his desire for unity of action and co-operation. He invited the co-operation of all Parties in favour of an effective scheme of non-intervention.  I think a very reasonable and sound case has been made in support of this amendment.  I think so because the case put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald has not been answered.  I understand from the President's Second Reading speech that this country is free, without consultation with any other nation in the Commonwealth, to take its own line in connection with the policy of non-intervention.  That makes it more desirable, to my mind, because of the peculiar situation in this country, that there should be united action on the part of the Dáil.  My view is that a very reasonable case has been made in favour of the amendment.  Another argument is that we are now under a Single Chamber system of government here, and I think, rather than allow our Government to go ahead on lines which they might afterwards find would be wrong, it would be better, in the interests of the country as a whole, to accept this amendment, especially after seeing that our country is likely to take a different line or view-point from the other nations of the Commonwealth. That is one of the reasons why I think this amendment should be accepted.  In that way the Government could secure the co-operation of all Parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The long title of this Bill is &ldquo;An Act to carry into execution <Col N="953" /> the international obligations of Saorstát Eireann in relation to the civil war now being waged in Spain ....&rdquo;  As I understand Deputy Belton's amendment, it is aimed to secure that as we are by this Bill undertaking international obligations, the Dáil, and, through the Dáil, the people of Saorstát Eireann who have undertaken these obligations, ought be assured that the other parties to this agreement who have undertaken similar obligations, internationally, will carry out these obligations in the same full measure as we intend to carry them out, and that the Dáil should have information as to the method by which that end will be secured.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot said there is no need for the extreme distrust that is being displayed in reference to the other international parties to this non-intervention measure.  I suggest that there is every need for this distrust. It has been made abundantly clear from these benches what our attitude is on the question of the policy of non-intervention. We are in favour of non-intervention on the lines and for the reasons suggested by Deputies O'Sullivan, Dillon and Mulcahy.  I want to say for myself that, while I fall in with that policy of non-intervention, I see nothing sacrosanct embodied in that policy.  That policy has been put forward by some Deputies as if it were some sacred principle of international relations that we almost adore and as if there was something fundamental in this policy of non-intervention. The real truth is that it is a pure question of expediency and that there is nothing at all sacred in it.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot asks who said there was.  He has been almost saying his prayers to this policy of non-intervention for the last few days.  There is, I submit, every reason for this need for distrust.  The policy of non-intervention is founded on pure expediency.  The nations who are gathered together in the Non-Intervention Committee in London, or represented there, are, each and every one <Col N="954" /> of them, playing for their own hands and we have got to watch out to see that we are not led or misled by any other nations along a road that we ought not to travel.  Therefore, there is every need for this distrust.  I have the greatest admiration for British diplomacy, but I have no delusions about it.</P>

      <P>When I find France and Germany agreeing upon a course of action with regard to Spain I look upon that agreement and the policy which they adopt with extreme suspicion. Therefore the people of this country ought not to be and will not be deluded into the belief, as some Deputies who spoke here would have them believe, that there is something sacrosanct in this policy of non-intervention. When we find France and Britain, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Republics joining together for one alleged common object, then we ought to begin to take notice and examine our own political and international consciences to know if we are not in some extraordinarily strange company.  We are in a terrible hurry under this Bill to honour our international obligations.  I think that the country is entitled to know, by means of the information that would be given if Deputy Belton's amendment were carried, what effective provision is to be made to secure that other countries, equally with this country, will honourably carry out their international obligations.  That is the object of the amendment, as I understand, and that is why it has met with my approval.  Deputy Mulcahy spoke about the impression the Minister's speech made upon his mind.  It made precisely the same impression on my mind.  I had, as a matter of fact, taken a note to refer to it.  The only emphasis the Minister placed on any portion of his speech was on the sentence: &ldquo;We are going to see immediately that there will be no recruiting from this country.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall tell you if you wait a moment.  It was almost impossible to hear the other portion of the Minister's speech but he came as near to heat as he is capable of attaining when making that statement.  While the Minister was speaking in this fashion I had a mental vision of what was operating in his mind.  He was thinking of General O'Duffy and his Fascist army, as described by the Minister for Finance.  This is not a Bill to honour our international obligations at all.  It is a Bill to prevent General O'Duffy bringing recruits to Spain.</P>

They left good jobs for Spain in what they believed to be in the interests of their religion and not in the interest of Fascism.  I believe that this Bill is brought in because it was General O'Duffy started the Irish Brigade. That is the real reason.  An unanswerable case has been made for Deputy Belton's amendment.  We are going to honour our international obligations. When we find ourselves in such strange company as that of Socialist France, Protestant England, irreligious Russia and Germany, and Fascist Italy, I want to know to what we are going to commit ourselves.  What steps are we to be committed to by those other people who regard one another with extreme disgust and who will be playing their own hands for their own diplomatic ends?</P>

      <P>It is rather a tribute to the virtues of parliamentary government that Deputy Davin should have found himself so swayed by one argument that he is now a definite adherent to a proposal of which he knew very little before he came into the House.  Perhaps he will become <Col N="956" /> even more enthusiastic for it.  The amendment ought to be properly considered. It is in relation to a section which is headed &ldquo;Commencement and duration of the measure.&rdquo;  Deputy Belton has a very clear aim.  It is that this measure, which establishes an addition to the criminal code of the country and under which certain people may be made criminals, should not come into operation until we see whether the mess of pottage for which, in a certain sense, the national soul is being sold, is worth having.  How can we see that?  In the first place, should we have any say in the matter at all? The Minister for Education angrily objected when it was put to him that, in the course of his speech here on Friday, he created the impression that it was not for a small nation like Ireland to intervene in these questions.</P>

      <P>Let me give a quotation from the Minister's speech which is not in accord with that interpretation. The Minister was adverting to the fact that I had asked whether, when certain discussions were taking place at the Non-Intervention Committee, our representative had even asked a question, not to speak of proposing a resolution or bringing forward a scheme.  Here is what the Minister said in relation to what a certain argument had got to do with Spain:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has got to do with the statement of Deputy McGilligan that our representative at the Non-Intervention Committee should have got up there in front of the representatives of Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, England, and the 20 other nations represented, and asked questions, demanded that certain things be done and, presumably, be satisfied in the name of the Irish Free State Government before he gave his consent to the proposals submitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, it was a natural thing to ask if our representative on this committee <Col N="957" /> had been informed and to ask that the House be told whether he agreed that the information given him was sufficient to win his adherence to whatever proposals were put forward. The Minister thought it was amazing to expect our representative to stand up in front of these big people and ask certain questions.  Later in his speech he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I question myself whether we should stand out and take an independent attitude as if we were a big power capable of carrying into effect in some way the policy which our independent attitude indicates.  It is very well known that we cannot very often take up an independent attitude in these matters, no matter how much we might desire it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the confession from the Minister for Education that it is not possible for this country to take up an independent attitude on these matters and that the proposals that have come from the Non-Intervention Committee may not have met with the acceptance of our delegate.  He may somehow have been browbeaten or overawed into some sort of tacit adherence to what was proposed.  This Bill is intended to carry out our international obligations and is not confined to the sending of volunteers.  The question of non-intervention, in so far as proposals were put forward at that Committee, may be divided into three parts.  The first part is concerned with the export of arms and ammunition. The President told us, in introducing this Bill, that all these same nations had pledged themselves to prevent the export of arms and ammunition to Spain and had failed to carry out their promise.  We are asked to stand behind proposals which our representative on the Committee did not question and behind proposals put forward by a group of nations which previously put forward proposals to prevent the export of arms and ammunition to Spain and failed to carry out their guarantees.  There are two proposals now before the Committee. The first proposal, with regard to the sending of volunteers, was effective as from Saturday night last. The next proposal is with regard to <Col N="958" /> the patrolling of the coasts.  The scheme has not yet been arranged and it is not proposed to make it effective before the 6th March.  In addition to that, General Franco, by letter, raised two points and another representative raised another point as to what was going to happen in the case of aircraft, propaganda and the influx of finance to back up one or other of the two sides.  We are proposing to block intervention.  Intervention may be by means of arms and ammunition going into Spain, by men going into Spain, by aircraft going in there, by propaganda or by gold having its effect. Deputy Belton says that we should not commit ourselves to degrading certain of our citizens and treating them as criminals until we know what the scheme is and whether it is likely to be effective.</P>
    <P>We are asked to turn that down as an unreasonable proposition. Deputy MacDermot, who wants another pat of commendation from some Government Deputy, distorts the argument and says that we should wait until we see the scheme working. Deputy Belton is not even asking that, although it might be reasonable to do so in face of the fact that the big nations which gave other guarantees on the matter of arms and ammunition broke down on their performance.  Delay on the part of this country until we see the scheme working is not asked for. What is asked for are details of the scheme to see whether it is likely to prove effective or not, and whether it covers all the points that have been mentioned.  We have been told that the big nations will be watching each other like hawks.  Of course, they will, although on the question of arms and ammunition they did not find it possible to find a scheme which they could keep to. We have a representative on the Non-Intervention Committee.  Surely we might, at least, expect that if he is powerless in the matter of action, he would be alert in reporting as to what takes place.  In that way we might expect that some information would filter through to this House as to what the proposals are, and the likelihood of their being <Col N="959" /> carried into effect.  Apparently, he has not even reported correctly to the Minister.  In any event, the Minister is not possessed of the information which Deputies in this House could get, and that some have shown they have got, through reading the newspapers.</P>

      <P>No definite conclusion has been come to on the matter at all.  The Minister was, therefore, talking of the proposals. It was stated here with accuracy on Thursday night that there were at least two proposals with regard to patrolling the coast.  There were to be four sectors, each to be patrolled by one of the four fleets. The Russian counter-proposal was that there should be one fleet of mixed units.  Recently there was a move forward from this, and there was a suggestion that Russia should <Col N="960" /> be assigned to some area around the Bay of Biscay.  The Minister, apparently, has no information as to the Russian view-point on that. The matter has not yet been decided. When we are asked to take a definite step on this, Deputy Belton's attitude is &ldquo;Pass your measure if you like, but stay your hand in bringing it into operation until such time as the details of the scheme are revealed to this House and approved of by it.&rdquo;  It appears to be an easy answer to that to say: &ldquo;If non-intervention proves to be a farce, we can denounce it and get out of it.&rdquo; But can we?  Can we repair all the harm that has been done in the meantime?</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to look at Section 5, which must be read in conjunction with Section 2.  It is provided that the Act will come into operation after a certain date.  That may be a month hence.  If it does come into operation a month hence, any person who, under Section 5, has attempted to obtain a commission in the belligerent forces as from the date of the passing of the Act is declared to be a criminal. Suppose that in a few months' time we have a number of men in jail, and suddenly discover that this grand scheme of non-intervention is a futile thing and decide to get out of it, what happens the poor men in jail?  They have been jailed because they decided to make an attempt to get in amongst the belligerents in Spain, and here it is proposed to make them criminals in the interests of non-intervention which we may hereafter discover to be an impossible thing.  But the harm will have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, in the light of the answers given to me to-day, to say that we are only doing what is our bounden duty under an international obligation is a gross exaggeration of the facts.  I asked two questions to-day. First of all, I wanted to know whether we were stepping in in a hurried way into the breach, and I endeavoured to find out what all the other members of the non-intervention countries had done.  I wanted to know which of the countries represented on the Non-Intervention Committee had legislative authority, or had introduced <Col N="961" /> legislation, to prohibit their own nationals going as volunteers to Spain.  One is Great Britain, but Great Britain is operating through the old Foreign Enlistment Act.  If Great Britain is going to operate on the lines of preventing nationals of other countries going to Spain, she can only operate on nationals going from this country as British subjects and as nothing else, because that is the only legislation Great Britain has at her disposal.  Belgium is also said to have legislation.  These are the only two countries that had power in regard to their own nationals prior to the 16th February.  Since then legislation for the same purpose was brought into operation&mdash;I will have to query this later on&mdash;by nine other countries. Those nine are said to be taking measures.</P>
    <P>In my second question I sought to find out how many countries had covered the same territory that we proposed to cover in relation to prohibiting not merely their own nationals but in taking power to prohibit the nationals of other countries moving about their own country with a view to going to Spain.  I find that the Department are unable to say that any legislation contains these powers.  The only thing is that there is a pious hope, an expression, that the Governments' representatives are taking the necessary steps towards this end.  I note in the typescript of the reply to my first question that the person who drafted the answer anticipated that the Governments represented on the Non-Intervention Committee &ldquo;will take&rdquo; the necessary steps towards this end, but the words &ldquo;will take&rdquo; are transformed into &ldquo;are taking.&rdquo; So that without any information we are jumping in ahead of anybody else to do what none of the others are doing.  We are doing that at the behest of the President who, speaking last week of the same Non-Intervention Group, said of them that while they came to a conclusion that arms and ammunition should be stopped going into Spain and gave guarantees to that effect, they failed to carry out their guarantee.  We are represented on this Non-Intervention Committee <Col N="962" /> by a man who apparently does not want to take any action on the committee, and our Minister for Education feels that he should not even ask a question on it.  Deputy Belton takes a much more democratic view, which is that this House should not be committed to an enlargement of the criminal code until this House has had put before it, and is satisfied, that there is a good scheme likely to be effective for the purpose of achieving the end of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that Deputy Belton's amendment only asks for details of the scheme of enforcement. Every argument that can be used in favour of the amendment can be used more strongly in favour of waiting to see how the thing is actually working.  I put it to the House and to Deputy McGilligan in particular, is it a practical suggestion that we who will have little to do with the enforcement of non-intervention outside our own country, should sit back and refuse to act until we hear all the details and how the various fleets are going to be distributed around Spain, how many observers there are going to be on the French frontier and on the Portuguese frontier?</P>

      <P>Yes, but how is the House to make up its mind on that matter?  Will we not hear the same kind of speeches as we have heard already this evening?  Deputy Costello said that we were being faced with a kind of trap, and that we were being asked to walk into the trap.  The fact that certain nations, such as Germany, France, Great Britain, Russia, and other countries, are working together, seems to fill him with suspicion.  Why is that?  One would imagine that the coming together of such great nations as these would hardly be for a purpose, as the Deputy practically suggested, of conspiracy between them to the disadvantage of a nation like ours.  I suggest that, while it is true that the whole policy of non-intervention is founded on a policy of expediency, the need for that expediency is overwhelming and that the motive that could have brought such countries as Germany, France, Russia, and the other countries involved, together, is the motive of preventing a European war.  I think that that motive stands out to be seen plainly by anybody who does not wilfully refuse to see it, and I say, and protest, that the line or argument that has been hitherto used in support of this amendment is purely obstructive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that certain details have to be arranged before that scheme can come into operation.  It is not claimed, I think, by anybody who has an understanding of the situation, that the work of the Non-Intervention Committee is likely to be perfect. Apart from being satisfied as to the details, we would have to be satisfied that these great nations, which have entered into this agreement, have done so <i>bona fide,</i> and that they are sincere in their intentions of carrying out these proposals honourably. In what way could this Dáil, <Col N="964" /> at any time, in a discussion, except by action of the Government in bringing the matter forward, satisfy itself that the Governments in question were not carrying out their intentions honourably, except through the machinery of having an observer on the Non-Intervention Committee?  We are quite satisfied that, in the circumstances, the proposals which have been made at that committee are fairly satisfactory and that, if they are loyally carried out, they are likely to achieve the end in view, so far as is possible.  No doubt, it will be possible for individuals to get into Spain and for small quantities of arms to be brought through unless every square yard of the Spanish coast and of the Spanish frontier is guarded, which is an absolute impossibility; but because that state of affairs exists, are we to withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee? Should we not be satisfied, when these great nations have come together, that there is a genuine and honest desire to carry a non-intervention policy honestly into effect?  I submit that we can never be definitely assured that these nations will do so, and that we can only wait and see how the situation develops in order to satisfy ourselves that these nations are in earnest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice has suggested, if at any time the Government should be satisfied that the non-intervention proposals are plainly not being carried out, then the Government can report the matter to the House with a view to seeing what further action, if any, may be taken. I stated on the last day, and I still adhere to my belief, that it is not the business of the delegate from the Irish Free State to take a foremost part, as we are not concerned in the actual supervising arrangements&mdash;we may not even be in the position of being represented among the supervisors to be appointed.  What I do say is that our representative should be there in order to see what is going on, but that he should not attempt to take upon himself the task of questioning these Powers, if he were unable to do so. If the Government, and the Department of External Affairs in particular, <Col N="965" /> felt that it was the duty of their representative to question any of these arrangements, or that it would be his duty in the future to do so, I have no doubt whatever but that the Government would issue the necessary instructions to him.  We know, of course, that up to the present the committee is not being carried on in a perfectly unanimous manner.  We know, as Deputy MacDermot said, that some of the nations there represented are violent opponents of one another in some cases and that there is a certain amount of dissension.  I think, however, that the Irish Free State should not take any part in that dissension unless we have solid grounds for suspicion.  If we see any move being made which might give reasonable grounds for suspicion, then we should intervene, and that has been our policy, not alone now but for months past.  If the Government feel that they are wrongly informed or that these proposals are not being carried out in the way in which they think they should, then they will review the whole matter and come before the Dáil again.  If we are satisfied that, having regard to all the difficulties of the situation, the proposals are satisfactory and as good as can be, then we shall endeavour to co-operate to the fullest possible extent.</P>

      <P>I must confess, Sir, that I have been astonished by the tone of the speech which we have just heard from the Minister for Education and at the, to my mind, extraordinary doctrine he has laid down.  What is it?  There is to be international discussion between great Powers and small Powers and, because we are a small Power, it is our duty to have a representative there who shall be nothing better or nothing other than a mere dummy: a person who is never to open his month to favour or put forward any suggestion; a person who is never to do anything except to see what has happened. That is supposed to be the attitude which our representative is to take up, according to the Minister for Education.  I protest, Sir, against such a doctrine being put forward.  It is quite true that we are a small <Col N="966" /> nation.  It is quite true that, as far as military power goes, we are negligible in the world when we are dealing with great Powers such as Great Britain or France or Russia.  It is quite true that, as a naval power, we do not exist; but I do protest against the doctrine preached here by the Minister for Education to the effect that, as a moral power we do not exist, and that, when great questions concerning international morality or concerning the eternal principles of right and wrong are being discussed, because they are being discussed by strong men or by the representatives of great Powers, never should the voice of our representative be raised in the cause of right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, the Minister addressed me in the same fashion, and so, I am afraid we are both at fault.  However, Sir, as I was saying, no matter how small a nation may be, it does not follow that that nation, in putting forward a suggestion, may not carry great Powers with it; but, if we are to believe what we have heard from the Minister, we are too small to have courage; we are too small to have brains; we are too small to have intelligence; we are too small to put forward sensible views, and we are too small to preach, in international assemblies, the principle of right against wrong.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; the Minister says, &ldquo;our representative can tell the Government, and if the Government think that there is anything wrong, they may afterwards give him <Col N="967" /> instructions.&rdquo;  In other words, after the horse has been stolen, and stolen for a very long time, our representative may get instructions to shut the stable door.  That is the principle which is put forward by the Minister for Education in the, to my mind, extraordinary speech which he delivered to the House in the last few minutes. My idea is quite the opposite.  My idea is, no matter how small we may be, by our force of argument and our moral courage, by putting before the world what is right, no matter how small we or any other nation may be, our representative and the representatives of these nations will have a moral influence in the discussions carried on between even the greatest Powers, and our representative, in my humble judgment, should exercise that influence.</P>
      <P>To come back to what is really more germane&mdash;I wandered after the Minister for Education on an issue which is hardly germane to this present amendment; it seems to me that the Minister hardly knows what this amendment before the House is&mdash;here we are giving completely untramelled power to the Executive Council.  I am very glad, incidentally, to note that the force of my criticism has compelled the Minister for Education to withdraw from the House.  The Executive Council ask in this sub-section for time.  It does not tell us that it will ever put this Bill into force.  When the time arrives at which it wishes to put this Bill into force, why should it not put its reasons before the House and the country? There is no doubt that it can carry the Bill.  We know perfectly well that the Executive Council, with the potent aid of Deputy MacDermot, can certainly carry any motion here.  What we do ask, and what Deputy Belton's amendment seeks, is that the whole of the country should know, through discussion here in this House, what are the reasons which are animating the Government in taking the course they are taking and what methods are being adopted to put these non-intervention proposals into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real difficulty in enforcing non <Col N="968" /> intervention will be found along the French frontier.  If the Minister for Justice takes up last week's <i>Spectator,</i> he will find a long article there from a correspondent who travelled from France into Spain with a whole train full of men, every single one of whom was going to Catalonia to fight for the Red Government in Catalonia.  I think it will be extremely difficult to prevent French Communists from joining the Spanish Communists.  We would like to know before we pass this Bill through all its stages, what steps it is proposed to take to prevent such a thing happening.  That is all we ask. We ask that before the Government puts this Bill into operation it will come before the House and tell the House exactly what is happening, the reasons which are actuating it, that it will assure the House that it will not act in the dark or behind closed doors, and that it will let the country know, through this House, what is happening. If it is not afraid of criticism I do not see why it should not accept this amendment.</P>

The Deputy wants brought into this House, in support of Deputy Belton's amendment, the detailed scheme, I presume, as to how non-intervention can be put into practical effect.  Somehow or <Col N="969" /> other I would have expected rather a different viewpoint from Deputy McGilligan because nobody knows better than Deputy McGilligan the trouble that is entailed in putting all these schemes into effect.  When Deputy Belton was introducing his amendment, I followed his arguments as closely as I could, and one of the main reasons why Deputy Belton suggested the holding up of this Bill was the difficulty of guarding the French frontier.  There are other frontiers as well as those of France, and there is also the sea end.  All these things have got to be carefully considered, and I do submit to Deputy McGilligan that it would be a practical impossibility to do what he suggests.  I think it would be foolish to hold up this legislation until a definite scheme has been formulated.  Deputy McGilligan's viewpoint must be reconciled with that of Deputy Costello.  I was rather surprised to note Deputy Costello's outlook on this amendment.  He said the Bill was originally introduced because General O'Duffy had recruited the Irish Brigade to take part in the war in Spain.</P>

      <P>That is what I gathered from Deputy Costello's remarks. This Bill would have been introduced by any sensible Irish Government if General O'Duffy had never been born.  It applies to all volunteers; it applies to anybody taking up a similar attitude.  What is wrong with the Bill?  The quicker it is put into operation, in my opinion, the better.  We may go down the country and talk about these subtle little remarks and objections put forward by Deputy Belton, but if you go to Mullingar or to any other town in Ireland you will find the people do not understand them.  What the ordinary citizen does understand&mdash;and <Col N="970" /> no one knows it better than Deputy Belton&mdash;is that we do not want young Irishmen going out to Spain.  The quicker that is stopped, the better.  We do not want to have them taking part in a war where, as the President has already pointed out, the big Powers are trying out their machinery of war and are merely making a cockpit of that unfortunate country.  With the very least delay, this Bill should be put into operation.</P>
      <P>There is something to be said for the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. It does not follow that, because we are a small nation, we should not do something to make ourselves felt.  There was a very proud boast at one time made by prominent members of the present Opposition about this country being able to take its place amongst the great Powers of the world at Geneva.  It is also taking its place amongst the big Powers at the Non-Intervention Committee.  Surely there is nothing wrong in this Twenty-Six County unit emulating the example of the big Powers and contributing their quota, in so far as they possibly can, in the interests of the Spanish people?</P>
      <P>I have no doubt Deputy Belton's mind rankles slightly because of the defeat of the bigger amendment last Friday night.  The suggestion in that amendment was that this Government should recognise Franco's Government in Spain.  We all know that he has not a Government there yet, and we also know that the Caballero Government do not speak for the whole of the people in Spain.</P>

      <P>The Government are in the position that they can give us no information.  The amendment has served at least this purpose; it has exposed the whole sham.  Crocodile tears have been shed here about the stopping of bloodshed.  Anyone who knows anything about the conditions in Spain is aware that no Non-Intervention Committee or pact will stop bloodshed there.  There have been too many massacred there and it has to be fought out.  It is a strange thing to observe efforts at non-intervention just now.  It was stated by Deputy McGilligan, or perhaps it was Deputy Costello, that there was no talk of this sort for months when Great Britain and France considered that intervention would favour Caballero. When there was a hold-up at Madrid there was no talk of non-intervention, but now that Franco has got on the <Col N="973" /> move, we are to have non-intervention and we are being used as the tools.</P>
      <P>What is the secret about this whole matter?  If the Minister knows anything he should tell us the truth, he should tell us what is at the bottom of this.  In my opinion there are two Spains, the Red and the White Spain, at the bottom of it.  That is what Great Britain, France and Russia are angling for and we are to be used as the tools to help that.  The Minister for Justice, because of his spite against General O'Duffy, takes up a certain attitude.  When he mentioned the Irish Brigade here he almost ground his teeth.</P>

      <P>In the amendment I ask the Government to produce the scheme which would implement non-intervention and when you drew my attention to it I was just quoting the Minister, the way he replied and dealt with my request.  Has the Minister any information as to how this job is to be done?  Is there any engineer, any business man, any man of 21 years and upwards or any boy of 10 years and upwards who would give his promise to do a thing until he knew first how it was proposed that thing should be done?  That is the type of thing we are being committed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a couple of Ministers here a while ago.  A few days ago they were able to talk for hours, <Col N="974" /> but now they are not able to tell us how this job will be done.  I want to remind them of what is operating.  I heard it discussed in high quarters in Spain that what Great Britain and France wanted was to divide Spain.  Are we going to be parties to that?  Deputy Davin talked about electing the Government that the Spanish people want and so stop this bloodshed.  I have been over all the fighting fronts in Spain, with the exception of the southern, and all this talk about electing the Government that the people want, or to know what sort of Government they want, is really laughable.  I am surprised at Deputy Davin, in the teeth of the civil war going on in Spain, talking about electing a Government.</P>
    <P>If there is going to be genuine intervention, how is it going to be carried out by the people who have failed in the much easier job of keeping out war munitions?  Is there any responsible person in the Government here able to tell us?  I do not mind Deputy Donnelly's little bit of a speech.  I want the Minister to tell us how they propose to succeed in the matter of non-intervention when they did not succeed in keeping out munitions.  The same parties are contracting now to do the larger thing when they failed to do the smaller thing before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear on one matter that Deputy Donnelly referred to.  I support this amendment as moved by Deputy Belton to-night.  If the Government had agreed to withdraw the Irish Minister, now resorting in St. Jean de Luz, from being an accredited agent of ours to Spain, I would still, in the interest of an effective non-intervention policy, ask that this amendment should be accepted.  I only did that because I thought we still preserved this as a remnant of the old-time system of government in the country&mdash;that we are supposed to operate on each other's minds by argument, and that people would be asked to vote for what they considered feasible and proper in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> It is easy to distort argument. Deputy Donnelly and Deputy MacDermot made play with &ldquo;You would want all the details and so on.&rdquo;  All you want to know is the scheme.  The word &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; is not used in the amendment.  It may be said that the scheme includes particulars.  All that is required is that such a scheme should be put forward to the House and should commend itself to the House when discussed.  The method by which it would commend itself to the House might also fall for criticism.  If it were done under the closure of guillotine, obviously there would be something suspicious about it.  Deputy Donnelly, as a person who, having been a democrat once, pretends still to adhere to the democratic view-point, ought to be in favour of matters coming before the House for discussion and for the victory of argument.  He is against that.  He thinks that we ought to accept what?  That we ought to accept something put up at a Non-Intervention Committee at which our representative has now twice been declared by a Minister here not to be able to do anything.  Apart from not being able to do anything, he is not required to do anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>My objection is that we should not seek to make any people of ours liable for criminal penalties until such time as we are sure that the matter which we are aiming at is likely to be effected&mdash;nothing more than that. But the whole idea at the back of the <Col N="976" /> scheme is that of the old nursery rhyme: &ldquo;Open your mouth and shut your eyes and let down what the anti-Gods will give you.&rdquo;  There you have the case not merely on the Non-Intervention Committee but in this House.  Deputy Donnelly advances the amazing argument in a democratic assembly that it is dishonest to put up this when Deputy Belton knows it will not be carried.  The new scheme of legislation is to consult the Whip of the majority Party, and if he says it will not go through, it is dishonest to bring it forward.</P>

Surely democracy demands that one should be entitled to put forward reasons, even though you are beaten, and continually beaten.  Deputy Donnelly is against that.  I have never thought fit in this House to describe Deputy Donnelly as a coward, but he is the worst type of coward because he is afraid of reason.</P>

      <P>I think the inquisition has gone far enough, and that, as a man can be got at the present time, the sword should not be held over his head for years. In the light of the discussion that took place on the previous amendment, this measure may have to be withdrawn very soon, yet there is power of retrospective legislation.

      <P>If it were not for the fact that this sub-section is as inelegantly drafted as it could possibly be, the amendment should be accepted. The sub-section provides that a person may be convicted for an offence alleged to have been committed.  It is quite obvious that the last phrase in the sentence should have been put up near the top of the sub-section. Apart from that point, it shows how rushed this Bill has been, that it could not be even properly drafted.  There is a fundamental principle underlying <Col N="979" /> the amendment.  If the Government refuses to accept it, and insists in retaining the sub-section, they are presenting themselves in advance with &mdash;and the Minister for Justice is accepting in advance-a certificate of incompetence.  The object of the section is to enable people who have committed an offence or, who are alleged to have committed an offence, under this measure during its currency to be prosecuted after the Act has lapsed.  The whole purpose of this Bill, if it has any purpose, is to prevent people from going to Spain.  If anybody in the teeth of all the powers that the Government is allocating to itself succeeds in eluding the vigilance of the Minister, the Guards, the British Navy, the Soviet Navy, the French Navy, the Italian Navy, and the German Navy, surely to goodness that person ought to be immune from prosecution when he comes back to his native land, having in spite of all these Powers got to Spain and survived the civil war.</P>

It may not come into force for a very long time.  It is visualised in sub-section (3) of Section 2 that for a whole year there may be no promulgation of this Bill, no putting it into force by the Executive Council. Accordingly, let us say two or three months may elapse between the passing of this Bill and its coming into operation. <Col N="980" /> During that time it is perfectly lawful for any person to go to Spain. Until the Bill comes into operation nobody is breaking the law if he goes to Spain.  But very carefully the words are chosen in Section 5 (1) (a) &ldquo;at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;after the coming into operation of this Act&rdquo; are used in one section, clearly and definitely, but the words in Section 5 (1) (a) are not &ldquo;after the coming into operation of this Act&rdquo; but &ldquo;at the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  Therefore, a person will commit no offence by going out to Spain between the passing of the Act and the coming into operation of the Act; he may be given a long time to do so, and he may do so.  But if he goes out to Spain during the period between the passing of this Act and the coming into operation of this Act he has committed a criminal offence, because the Act is made retrospective as far as he is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed that out on the Second Reading.  If this was not the intention of the Government they could have brought in an amendment inserting the words &ldquo;coming into operation&rdquo; and not &ldquo;passing of this Act&rdquo; in Section 5.  They have allowed the words &ldquo;passing of this Act&rdquo; to stand; therefore, they must really mean it. Applying that to the present sub-section, a person may go out to Spain perfectly unconscious that he is breaking the law.  As a matter of fact he is not breaking the law; until the Act comes into operation he is not breaking the law.  But the Act does come into operation at some future date; then a man, although in Spain, although fighting in an army in Spain, under Section 5 (1) (a) has committed a criminal offence retrospectively.  He then comes back after the Act has ceased to be in operation, and he discovers that under this sub-section (4) of Section 2 he can be prosecuted and convicted.  Although he went to Spain quite legally&mdash;the Act came into operation after his going&mdash;when he comes back, after the Act has expired, he is to be caught and prosecuted.  I think Section 5 (1) (a) is a monstrous piece of retrospective legislation, but it makes this sub-section (4) possibly the worst monstrosity which has appeared <Col N="981" /> in any Act or any Bill which has come before this House for consideration, because after the expiration of the Act a person who has committed no criminal offence at all, except being caught by a retrospective piece of legislation, can be arrested and tried, and if convicted punished under this Act.  It seems to me that this is certainly a sub-section which should not be allowed to pass this House, and I sincerely hope that the Minister for Justice, who is now in charge of the measure, will express his intention of accepting Deputy Belton's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section (4) appears to me to be a monstrous proposal. In order to understand the implications of the sub-section, one has to turn to Sections 6 and 11, so as to see in Section 6 what the offences are, and in Section 11 what the penalties are.  We find in Section 6 that a person may be accused of endeavouring to go to Spain by going from one place in Saorstát Eireann to another place in Saorstát Eireann; according to Section 11, the Guards may, without a warrant, apparently years afterwards, arrest him on suspicion that that particular journey was for the purpose of going to Spain even though he did not get to Spain, and he may be convicted of that.  What appears to me to be the monstrous thing about it is this: of course the Government will have a right to repeal the Act at any time, but they apparently have not the right to repeal the consequences. The consequences of the Act will still continue.  Although the Act expires and goes out of commission, still the Guards, and apparently the Courts, will continue to operate.  I should like to know from the Minister for Justice how he is going to end that situation, because apparently as far as this sub-section and any other part of the Act is concerned, there does not appear to be any end to it; its consequences are going to continue indefinitely.  According to Section 11, fines to the extent of £500 or two years' imprisonment may result for years after the Act itself has expired. That appears to me to be a monstrous proposal.  I think that, as Deputy Belton pointed out, the thing has gone <Col N="982" /> far enough without having those far-reaching effects.  Once the Spanish war is over, as it will be over some time, surely we ought then to forget what people have done with regard to intervention.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to accept Deputy Belton's amendment for the following reason: It is a rather peculiar thing that the Irish Government undertakes to do what the British Government failed to do against the Papal Zouaves in 1870.  Although the Foreign Enlistment Act was in force when the Papal Zouaves came back, there was no attempt to prosecute them, and yet we have the Irish Government here to-day attempting to do what the British Government failed to do at that particular time.  Suppose the remains of somebody from Ireland who was killed in that war in Spain are brought back here next week, by some of his comrades, before this Act comes into operation.  If they go back to Spain, they then commit an offence, and when they return&mdash;if they ever do&mdash; when that war is over, you are going to make criminals of them for coming back and performing the ordinary virtue of charity.  I have stressed that before, and in fair-play to everybody I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  This section was put in for the purpose of being a deterrent.  Such a case as was mentioned by Deputy Belton, where this thing might come to an end quickly, is one of the influences that might have something to do with people going out to Spain and ignoring the other sections of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not.  The Government can only do its best to make the Act effective.  This is not retrospective legislation, or at least, it will not operate as such. It has not been contemplated that this Bill should become an Act to-night and that it should be brought into operation in a week's time.  I <Col N="983" /> hope that if the Bill passes to-night, it will come into operation to-night, or in a very short time.  There is no such thing as contemplated by Deputies opposite as having an Act hanging for some time without being in operation.  That is not contemplated at all and, in fact, I think that was quite clear from the attitude we adopted here in trying to come into line with other countries who are parties to this Non-Intervention Pact.  We wanted to fall into line with them as quickly as possible, and that was pointed out as one of the aspects of its urgency when it was before the House last week. None of the difficulties and none of the hardships which Deputies have in mind are likely to arise.  As soon as this Bill becomes an Act, there will be practically no delay in bringing it into effective operation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why, if that was the object of the Government, they put in sub-section (1) of Section 2 providing power for the Executive Council to bring this Act into operation by Order in Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that their whole object from the start was to have the Bill operate <i>instanter,</i> once it was passed, and here we find this provision in the first sub-section of Section 2 to enable the Executive Council to defer bringing the Bill into operation until they make an Order in Council.  It again shows that this Bill has not been thought out.  The Minister says this section is not intended to be retrospective. It may not be intended to be retrospective, but, in its effect, it will be retrospective.  Deputy MacEoin has put one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I put two different instances of the way this will work if it becomes law as it stands&mdash;and the Government have introduced no amendments to this Bill so satisfied are they with the Bill as being perfect drafting.  There is no power in this Bill to enable an Irish Catholic clergyman to go out as <Col N="984" /> chaplain to the Spanish forces.  He cannot do it under Section 4 if it passes.  No Catholic priest can go out to Spain and I understand from the newspapers that there is a Catholic priest at the moment in Spain.  He cannot come home to see his religious superiors, nor can he come home for a holiday.  Once he comes, he is caught in the net of this Act and he cannot leave again.  If he does, he becomes a criminal under the Act and in 20 years' time can be prosecuted. In reference to that particular state of affairs, it must be remembered that those who have already joined General Franco's forces in Spain have committed no offence and it is specifically made clear in this Bill that it is not intended that they should be guilty of any criminal offence.  There you have a provision in the Bill that those who have already got commissions, or have become engaged in General Franco's army in Spain, are doing something which they had a legal right to do and which they have a legal right to continue to do, so far as this Bill and the law of Saorstát Eireann is concerned.  But dare they come home to see their relatives who are dying for a few days, they are at once caught under the Bill. No chaplain can go out and no chaplain who is out there at the moment can come home without being a criminal. Is that what is intended by the non-intervention policy of the Government and the provisions of this Bill?</P>

I think it is very unreasonable, and I have never heard of such a thing before. It is without precedent as far as I know, and the Minister ought really to consider it very seriously.  It remains for all time, because there is no point set down at which it ceases to be a criminal offence.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Stage I desire to say a few words as to why the Bill should not pass.  The Minister for Justice, who has left the House, quoted some words of mine, from a speech made at Swinford, on, I think, the guillotine motion to-day about the Irish Brigade having gone to Spain.  I accept completely the quotation given from the paper in so far as the Minister read it, but he might have gone a little bit further back and read the following, which went before the particular passage that he quoted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have seen where some 50 men recently left the Free State to fight for religion in Spain; but we know in our hearts that if there is any place where Irishmen can stand together and fight for Catholicism, it is here in Ireland.  The young men who went out to fight against Communism, which is attacking European civilisation in Spain, are not representative of a great Catholic nation helping another Catholic nation in distress.  If we sent men to Spain, we did not send them from our strength but from our weakness.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I indicated that the reason why we were weak as a Catholic nation, standing by and able to do very little for a Catholic nation like Spain that is in the death struggle with Communistic forces, as it is to-day, was that because instead of developing resources of this country in the way in which they could be developed, instead of linking up international friendships on sound international principles with a decent sustained morality in international affairs, we had put a Government into power here that has turned its back on all these things.  What is being done to-day is weakening further the position of this nation here as a Catholic nation, with a Government of its own, from being of any help to any State fighting for Catholicism, or fighting for religion throughout the world against the forces organised from Moscow that are being spread in a most systematic and effective way from one country to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a non-intervention Bill. In all the circumstances in which this Bill has been discussed and is being passed, this is an intervention Bill, and it is intervention on the side of the Madrid Government.  The Government Party have complained of the misrepresentations that have been made in this House and elsewhere both of themselves and of their policy.  It is nothing to the misrepresentation of the situation that is being brought about by their action in stifling discussion in this House and in withholding <Col N="993" /> information from it on perhaps the most vital struggle that is going on in Europe to-day.  If the weaknesses of this country, arising out of the political and economic policies that are being pursued here, are grave, every step that the Ministry has taken in connection with the Spanish matter from the time that the question of an international examination of it arose, has made the country still weaker.</P>
    <P>The President had to state the other day that our representative in Spain was not an accredited representative to a popularly elected Government.  The thing is very far from that.  In the brief space of time at our disposal we have been able to point out that the Government that was elected there as long ago as February of last year was a minority Government, that the Cabinet that was set up there represented nearly 1,000,000 votes less than the Opposition represented, and that if it was possible to set up that Government it was because there was unity amongst the Left sections in Spain and that the Right sections could not get unity amongst themselves.  Systematic disorder was organised throughout Spain, and one Premier followed another until the forces of disorder put Caballero at their head.  The Spanish Government set going the forces of disorder. The fact that we are passing this Bill while leaving the present representative in Spain and allowing the type of misrepresentations that have been made in this House about the situation to stand, weakens us as a nation and weakens us as a people.  It weakens our minds, our will and our unity on the present situation.  It was possible for a Deputy to rise and say in this House that the present movement of General Franco in Spain arose from an aristocratic military reaction against interference with land in Spain, and it would also be possible to show that land legislation, that was at least as good as land legislation in Great Britain or here, was introduced in Spain in 1935, and that, if land was in any way responsible for the organisation of Franco's forces and the organisation of the Right to combat the Government that was put into power through Communistic force, it was the circumstance in which, over <Col N="994" /> whole provinces, thousands of the peasants seized the land and, I think, hundreds of thousands of acres were taken over in that particular way.  No systematic information, however, with regard to the position in Spain was put before us here.  No systematic information was put before us here as to what was going to be the possible outcome of the situation there, and, in the face of, admittedly, a gigantic Communist movement in Europe&mdash;particularly active in Spain at the present time&mdash; having captured the Government of Spain by force, we are preventing in this House a thorough understanding of the situation.  We are keeping our representative with that Communist Government, and that can do nothing but weaken us in our efforts to be of use to any progressive forces with any respect for religion in the world.  In fighting any battle in the world, or from the point of view of any respect for religion in the world, the kind of situation we have here at present and the type of action that the Government have been responsible for can do nothing but weaken us.  I just want to put one small picture before the House of the programme of the people who dominate the Government in Spain to which the Irish Free State has now its accredited representative.</P>

      <P>Twice to-day I have had occasion to remind the House that on the Second Stage reasoned amendments, one advocating non-representation with one Government in Spain, and another advocating the recognition of another Government were defeated. On the Fifth Stage of a Bill, argument should be confined to what is in the Bill and, certainly, the question of representation to either side in Spain is not in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, the Bill proposes that no intervention of any kind, whether by the sending of men or by the sending of arms, may take place with regard to Spain at the present time, and we have argued here that representatives of nations like Great Britain and France have, on the Non-Intervention Committee, indicated <Col N="995" /> their opinion some months ago, at any rate, that non-intervention was in favour of the Madrid Government; and we have pointed out here that such reports as are available through those persons whom the Members of Parliament in South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and such Governments other than the Government in Great Britain, rely on for information with regard to European affairs, indicate that the Franco forces, towards the end of last year, were weakening and that the Madrid forces, therefore, were strong and that time was on their side.  I hope, therefore, that I am in order,in a discussion where there was so much suppression, in indicating briefly the programme of the Madrid Government to which our representative is accredited, and in pointing out that our accrediting of a representative in that manner is making this Bill, in our opinion, an intervention measure rather than a non-intervention measure.  The quotation I am about to give is very short, but these reports state that, about September of 1934&mdash;that was 18 months before the general election of January last&mdash;the official organ of the Communist Party published a programme and manifesto.  The report reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Before it was suppressed by the Government, the official organ of the Communist Party published a programme and manifesto calling for the establishment of a Government of Workers and Peasants which should confiscate, without compensation, all land belonging to great landlords, Church municipalities and State, this land to be divided amongst workers and peasants. Industries, banks, railways and all means of transport, should likewise be confiscated and controlled; Catalonia, Galicia, and the Basque Provinces should be granted autonomy and, if they wished, separation; the Spanish colonies likewise should be freed; all debts owing to capitalist enterprises should be annulled; armed and civil forces should be recognised on a Soviet basis.  It was pointed out that the masses in Spain <Col N="996" /> were more and more faced with the necessity of seizing power, and the public &lsquo;must decide whether it was to receive its inspiration from Rome or Moscow&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the plan in September,1934 &mdash;the published programme and manifesto. After a minority Government was set up in Spain in 1936, the forces of disorganisation brought about a position in which the leaders of the two Left organisations dominated the situation in Spain and took over the reins of Government.  Now we are asked by the Minister for Justice here to shut our eyes to what the Spanish conditions are; to shut our eyes to what may possibly be done actively by non-intervention people, and to simply take our own country and say that nobody must leave here to go to Spain or to take part in any military operations there, while we stand with a representative solemnly accredited to the Government in Spain that has run towards that plan.</P>
    <P>Now, we stand for non-intervention, and it is because we stand for non-intervention that we have fought so strongly for a discussion of this measure.  Why the Ministry could not calmly discuss the measure, even if they wish to continue their representation in Spain&mdash;why they should go off the deep end and reduce this Parliament to impotency, when they had plenty of time to argue the matter and plenty of people on their own Front Bench to argue it, is a matter that I find it hard to understand. There was plenty of time to do it, but instead of that, they have taken a Parliament&mdash;set up with so much effort in this State, set up with so much democratic effort &mdash;and practically crushed it out of existence from the point of view of being able to discuss in a reasoned way the most serious crisis that, perhaps, Europe has had before it for many a long day.  I do not want to labour the matter, but I say that that is our attitude in connection with this Bill.  We stand for a policy of non-intervention&mdash;and this Bill is a policy of intervention, and of intervention in the worst possible way one could imagine.  The <Col N="997" /> fact that we have a representative accredited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been twice informed that, on reasoned amendments, that whole matter was debated.  The question as to where the representative of this State is accredited to does not arise now, and the debate on Friday last may not be reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reopen it, Sir, but how we can allow that Bill to go from this Parliament in the present circumstances, and after the shutting down of discussion in this House, without pointing out what is the dominating factor in our minds in this matter, I do not know.  We stand for non-intervention, but, in the circumstances in which we have a representative so accredited, we think that it is a scandal that this Bill should pass here, and particularly that this Bill should be rushed through by the Government in the manner in which it is being rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which is about to pass the House in its Final Stage and become law, demands even yet a final consideration from every Deputy in this House irrespective of Party.  The fact that the terms of the Bill are so obscure seems to me to be the most dangerous feature of the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister who is responsible, if he intends to reply to the final criticisms of the Bill, to say whether this Bill precludes a protest by the Government, if events demand, as they have demanded in the past-a protest against the treatment of Christianity by certain forces that are operating in Spain.  Does this Bill preclude and debar moral intervention, say, by criticism and protest? If so, I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in that regard.  There is not the slightest doubt that if the time comes when other nations refuse to carry out the policy of non-intervention, this country has only one weapon and that is the weapon of moral support&mdash;a weapon that can only be <Col N="998" /> exercised by a definition, through the Government, of how this country stands.  If other nations do not subscribe conscientiously and fairly to the policy of non-intervention, we, under the terms of this Bill, can do nothing but retire from the present arrangement and retire, I presume, after long vacillation on the part of other nations to the arrangement. There will have to be some machinery devised afterwards through which the Government can voice their protest. I can see, a Chinn Comhairle, that you are going to call me to order and, possibly, you are justified.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  If this country wishes to make that protest I should sincerely like to know how we stand.  I understand the situation in Spain as well as anybody else here. There are many of us who have been students of the conditions that exist there as described by both sides, and by people who have visited the country, who know the conditions there and who have written real impartial reviews of these conditions.  I should be long sorry that we should tie ourselves up here by an Act in such a way that we really could not come out and give voice to our opinions on behalf of the nation, if such action were called for.  Everybody knows that the existence of Christianity is at stake in Spain.  We, who are for Christianity, must admit that two-thirds of the population are Catholics.  If we are debarred as Catholics by our Government, as a result of this Bill becoming law, from making any strong protest should the occasion demand it, I hold that this Bill should never become law, no matter what it may mean.  To us material things do not matter as much as spiritual things.  I contend, and I am sure the House will agree, that the Catholic Church in Spain is entitled to as much democratic rights as any other institution.  We have seen that the clergy in Spain have received a terrible crucifixion.  We find also that Catholic churches have been wrecked and that sacred images and even the Blessed Sacrament in the Tabernacle <Col N="999" /> have been desecrated.  Whatever its effect on the policy of non-intervention, outrages of that sort should not be allowed to pass by the Catholics of this country without protest.  The Catholics of this country will at all times unite in one voice in showing their abhorrence of occurrences of that kind and in giving their full moral support to those in Spain who are fighting against those guilty of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not say much further at this stage beyond that I think the Bill should not pass. Deputies on the Government Benches have said that we have been inconsistent in our views.  I should like to know exactly where the Government stand on this particular matter, because on Second Reading we had speeches made by Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Rowlette, who are both supporters of this particular measure. Deputy MacDermot went out of his way to assert that the reason he was supporting the Bill was that he wanted General Franco to win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make his own speech afterwards.  At any rate the Deputy gave as a reason that he wanted General Franco to win. Deputy Rowlette, on the other hand, supported the Bill because he believed that General Franco was the enemy of democracy and therefore, suggested by implication, that he wanted the other side to win.  I want to ask does the Government know which side this Bill is going to assist?  Are they clear on it, or which of these two views are they backing?  Are they backing Deputy MacDermot's views or Deputy Rowlette's views?  Deputy Rowlette stressed the point that the Government which General Franco was opposing was a democratic Government.  It is very peculiar that that democratic Government has on its programme the confiscation, without compensation, of all lands belonging to great landlords, the Church and the State.  If that is democracy, it is hardly the brand that we on these benches, or in fact that any country which has a sense of responsibility, could stand for.  I fail <Col N="1000" /> to understand how Deputy Rowlette could call that democracy, or how he could give it his support in any way.</P>
      <P>I would like to know by what right democracy could confiscate Church land in Spain and be unable to confiscate it in this country, even for a social service.  Apparently it is quite all right to take land from the Catholic Church in Spain in the name of democracy, but if we interfere with Church property in this country, even in the County Longford, it is an infringement of the rights of certain people.  I do not want to be misunderstood. I stand positively and definitely for the rights of property, but I cannot see how Deputy Rowlette could put forward an argument that it is quite legitimate to confiscate Church property in Spain without compensation and argue that as regards certain people to whom he belongs or with whom he is associated it would be unfair to confiscate Church property in this country, in particular in County Longford, even with compensation. You cannot have it both ways, and that in the name of democracy.</P>
      <P>The Report I have here is the Report on Foreign Affairs.  It is connected with the Empire Parliamentary Association, so I presume it is all right and there is nothing wrong with it. This is what it reports:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Perhaps the most striking demonstration of the rise of the Left occurred in the province of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suppose I will be like Deputy Belton, I cannot get my tongue around these names&mdash;anyway, in some province&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;60,000 agricultural workers, under the leadership of Communistic Deputies, to all intents and purposes took possession of the whole province. They confiscated the big estates and proceeded to partition the land amongst themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy in action!  And yet we have these two Deputies making such statements.  Deputy MacDermot wants this Bill because it will help Franco to win.  That is one of his reasons&mdash;I must be careful.  Deputy Rowlette wants it because it is in the interests of democracy.  Where do the Government stand in the matter?  Is it not only right that they would give us <Col N="1001" /> some indication as to which view they accept&mdash;or is it a fact that they are only hoping for the best and do not know what is going to happen?  I believe they are running into this in the same way as they have run into other things within the last three years; they rush in, and the moment something happens, &ldquo;Oh, only for so-and-so the thing would have been all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They have charged us with diverse opinions, but surely there never was such a display of diverse opinions as we have had from the few Government people who did speak in the course of this debate.  The Government should positively declare what is going to be the net result of this legislation.  I oppose the passing of this Bill because, as I said before, it contains a section which makes criminals out of our countrymen who are fighting for what they believe to be correct, and what I believe to be correct.  Why should we do that?  Why should we make criminals out of them?  A law may make a criminal all right, but that law will not be honoured by the Irish people.  There is no question about it, these men, some of whom have given their lives, and others who are prepared to give their lives for this ideal, should not under any circumstances be branded as criminals.  Under no circumstances should any attempt be made so to brand them.  What an outcry there would have been in 1866 and 1870 when the Papal Zouaves came back if the British Government arrested them and charged them under the Foreign Enlistment Act!  And yet an Irish Government proposes to brand those men in this way!  As has been stressed, so far as those who are out are concerned, if they come back for any reason, if by any chance they succeed in getting away, under no circumstances should an attempt be made to brand them as criminals, to give them two years' penal servitude and fine them £500.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I submit that the Dáil should not pass this Bill as it stands.  It has not been fully considered in Committee.  The arguments that were put forward here in connection with the amendments show how little the Government have considered <Col N="1002" /> the matter.  It is quite clear that if a chaplain comes back here he cannot return to Spain and he cannot send anybody to replace him unless the Minister finally states that it was not the intention to refuse permission to the chaplain to return.  Therefore, the Government apparently are prepared to smash the law themselves. Surely you are not going to start that sort of a game, passing a law for one section of the community and interpreting it in another way for yourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are drawing to the close of the debate on this Bill.  There have been some very notable speeches and, I regret to say, on a few occasions we have had statements which one would rather were left unsaid.  Deputy MacDermot, for instance&mdash;it has been referred to already&mdash;said that we in this Party were endeavouring to cash in on Christianity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Electorally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Electorally on Christianity, meaning, I suppose, that we were taking a political advantage of the war in Spain.  If I might be allowed to make a pecuniary allusion to our attitude on Christianity, I should like to say to Deputy MacDermot that our Christianity and the Christianity of the people of this country is an asset.  It is banked and bearing interest to redound to our credit and the credit of this country some day.  And it is not something that should have been alluded to in slighting terms by any Deputy here or outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another statement, made by the Minister for Finance, when he alluded to the volunteers who, rightly or wrongly, thought it was their duty <Col N="1003" /> to go and fight the cause of Christianity in Spain.  He said that their motive, perhaps, in going there&mdash;I think he did not even say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;was that they might return to fight the cause of Fascism in this State. Was there ever a viler statement made?  One might not agree with these young men, that they took the right course in going to help militarily the Christian side in Spain.  One might argue that they could have offered greater help by giving pecuniary assistance here towards certain medical or other outfits.  But most of these young men had not the wherewithal to offer monetary help for their fellow-Christians in Spain and they thought that perhaps the best thing they could do was to offer something of greater value to them than money, their very lives, in the interests of the cause which they felt sacred. Who shall say that Hyde or Chute were not sincere when they laid down their lives in that cause?</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate a great many reasons were given against the Bill and not very many reasons advanced from the Ministerial side as to why the Bill should pass, or at least why it should pass in a hurry.  We got more material against the Bill from Deputy MacDermot than from any Minister who has spoken, including the President.  Deputy MacDermot said to-day, I think, that practically every nation had taken the course we were taking now, and there was no reason why we should not take it; that no nations, except the Fascist nations, had done anything similar to what we were asking to have done.  Perhaps there is a reason why we should at least not be in a hurry to take this particular action.  There may be reasons why we should go as far as accepting the amendment Deputy Belton proposed&mdash;the complete recognition of General Franco.  It was argued, I think, by the President that there was an international code in that respect and that most of the great nations had fallen in with it.  Germany and Italy broke the code, if there was a code, and nothing serious happened <Col N="1004" /> to them because they departed from the international code.  Was anything serious going to fall upon this little State if we imitated Germany and Italy and recognised General Franco's Government?</P>
    <P>There was one reason perhaps more than any other why we should at least not be precipitate in our action in regard to this measure, and it was this: that we are practically the only Catholic democracy at present.  There are other Catholic States, but they have either gone Fascist or some other way. We are practically the only democratic Catholic State, and in this fight for Christianity in Spain, because it is a fight of Christianity against Communism&mdash;I think that has been proved &mdash;it behoves us to offer some sympathy to the side that is fighting the battle that we accept as just, and to offer some condemnation of the side fighting against them.  One thing at least we should have done before we embarked upon this Bill, and that was to make the greatest protest we could to what the President calls the existing Government in Spain, and to express our disapproval of their action by withdrawing our representative to that Government.</P>
    <P>All the useful arguments have already been made against the passing of this Bill.  What was missing was any fair attempt on behalf of the Ministry to prove that there was any urgency for the passing of the measure. Nothing was said which would prove to us that if the Bill had been delayed until next week anything serious would happen to this country, or to the nations of Europe.  As was pointed out by Deputy McGilligan, the Minister and others made no attempt to elaborate what precautions were taken by the various Governments or by our Government to put this Bill into effect when passed.  In fact, we leave this Bill when passed, not knowing whether it will ever prove an effective weapon for doing what it is proposed to do. Because we take this action we are described by a Deputy as endeavouring to &ldquo;cash-in&rdquo; on Christianity.  If there was one thing that the people of Ireland were proud of it was the great heritage that spiritual things matter to us more than material things. <Col N="1005" /> Generations of our people have accepted that and have been willing to fight for spiritual rather than material matters.  I believe that the bulk of the people of this State are actuated by that sentiment, and it is mainly because of that we are opposed to the hurried passing of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been two misapprehensions indicated in the course of the last 20 minutes or so in regard to the Bill that seem to be worth alluding to.  One was a suggestion by Deputy Minch that as a result of the passing of the Bill it would be impossible for us in this country to voice any protests against outrages that might occur in Spain.  Needless to say, no one can find any clause in the Bill to that effect.  Then it was suggested by Deputy MacEoin that the result of this Bill would be to turn Irishmen serving in Spain into criminals.  There is nothing in the Bill to do that.  If, after the passing of this Bill, people deliberately disobey its provisions, then of course they become subject to the penalties that are established by the Bill.  It is the merest rhetoric and the emptiest of rhetoric to suggest that the effect of the Bill is to turn gallant young Irishmen now serving in Spain into criminals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett in the early part of his speech accused me of having referred slightingly to Christianity. That statement is absolutely false.  I am not accusing Deputy Bennett of saying that knowing it to be false.</P>

      <P>The personal abuse that was poured out from the start of the debate by Deputies Belton, O'Sullivan, Dillon, McGilligan and others is not going to intimidate me into withdrawing one iota of what I said.  It was not personal vituperation but an attempt to sum up to the best of my ability what I believed to be the character of the opposition to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin complained that some who favoured the Bill are supporters of General Franco and that others in favour of the Bill are supporters of the opposite side.  I do not know if that is true.  I was not here to listen to Deputy Rowlette's speech.  If it is true what does it prove?  It proves nothing against the Bill.  It is perfectly legitimate for people to support the Bill with different outlooks.  The one overwhelming motive for the Bill, the one that the Opposition Deputies conspire to forget is that it is an effort to prevent a European war.  Either it is justified by that or it is not justified at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the Government have been throttling discussion and treating our Parliament in an arbitrary manner.  What justification is there for that?  As a matter of fact we have been slower than most other countries.  The speeches of Ministers have been perfectly satisfactory from the point of view of treating the case for this Bill as fully and as calmly as they knew how to treat it. They have not treated questions and <Col N="1007" /> criticisms in an arbitrary manner or refused to discuss the Bill.  They made very full and very fair statements on the subject and if anybody has gone off the deep end, as Deputy Mulcahy suggested, surely it has been some of those speaking against the Bill and thundering along for hours on end about irrelevant matters.  It was Deputies who neglected to address themselves to the question whether the Bill was likely to prevent war, and pretended like Deputy Dillon that the real issue was whether God is in Heaven or not.  Some of the backbenchers of the Opposition may be taken in by that sort of talk but I do not believe that the experienced men on the front Opposition bench can say that sort of thing except with their tongues in their cheeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy complained that this Government has shown no sustained morality in international affairs. He said nothing to illustrate that.  I do not know the occasions on which he accuses them of lack of sustained morality on international affairs. On the only occasion that I can call to mind in recent years when the Opposition criticised the attitude of the Government in international affairs my impression was that the cause of morality was sustained not by the spokesmen of the Opposition but by the spokesmen of the Government. Take their attitude with regard to our obligations to the League of Nations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill, as I have done from the beginning, whole-heartedly, not with the smallest feeling&mdash;far from it&mdash;of hostility towards those who have made sacrifices in the cause of the Catholic side in Spain; not in any supercilious attitude towards those throughout the country whose feelings have been stirred by the struggle in Spain, as the feelings <Col N="1008" /> of Catholic people everywhere have been stirred by the struggle in Spain; but with sincere indignation at the unscrupulous uses to which the Opposition have attempted to turn it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who have been listening to the debate to-day and who will read it in the newspapers to-morrow, will agree certainly that a sustained effort has been made by the Opposition to carry on the discussion on the same lines which they entered upon last week.  In spite of the fact that almost every speaker on the opposite side has proclaimed his strong belief in the policy of non-intervention, we find, after a further day's discussion, that we are now having a closing debate which to all intents and purposes resolves itself into another debate as to whether non-intervention is a good policy for this country or not, in which the Opposition, whatever they may feel, are certainly at pains to give the impression that they are opposed in some way that is not very clear&mdash;least of all to themselves &mdash;to the policy enshrined in the Bill. I should think that the important factor to which Deputy MacDermot called attention, the question of peace in Europe, should have some relevance to this discussion and should get some attention from the Opposition. What is the position going to be if these two groups of nations, which have proclaimed that they are interested in the struggle in Spain are to continue the policy of intervention? Has it not been stated and made clear that they are already &ldquo;trying-out&rdquo; on the Spanish people the full weapons of war which they intend to use in the next conflict? Is it not the duty of this country and of every small nation to take such action in international affairs, if small nations have any influence, to use their best efforts on the side of reason and on the side of peace? I think it is an extraordinary thing that on this, the second occasion on which we have had to undertake serious obligations, in common with a large body of other European nations, in the cause of peace, we are going to be attacked because <Col N="1009" /> we have not seen fit to take up an independent attitude.  I should like the critics of the policy of co-operation in European affairs to show us where we are going to stand, and where the small nations in Europe are going to stand, in five or ten years time if they do not pull their weight and do their level best to bring the big Powers of Europe to their senses, to get them together in matters that seem to threaten war. If the cause of international peace does not appeal to the Opposition, surely the contemplation of the frightful horrors of this war&mdash;the murder of priests, the burning of churches, the bombing of cities, the destruction of women and children by bombing from the sky and the piling of the streets with corpses&mdash;must.  Does anybody think that that kind of conflict, if it was going to continue, is going to lead to anything but anarchy for a long period?  If it were the case, as I said on the last occasion I spoke on this Bill, that the Government saw its way to take some definite and effective steps which would help to bring this conflict to a speedy termination, and if they failed to do it, they would be wanting in their duty.</P>
      <P>But when we are asked to proclaim loudly our belief in one party or the other, and when it is going to stop at that, when there is no proof whatever that any good is going to result from it, when moreover we consider our position as a small nation which, no matter how it may strive to keep apart from those international disputes, may &mdash;if Europe is threatened with a dangerous situation&mdash;whether we like it or not, find ourselves forced into a difficult position, is not that all the more reason for our Government examining the position calmly and clearly, and being quite sure before they take any step that that step is the step which is necessary, and the step which is going to help the thing that we would like to help?</P>

      <P>I certainly think that no evidence whatever has been brought forward to show that the Government <Col N="1010" /> is in any tittle or degree lacking in its responsibility in this matter.  The Bill we are now passing through the Dáil is based on a well considered policy over a long period of time.  It is a policy which has been agreed to by the Opposition even so far back as last November, and it is no credit whatever to the Opposition that when the Government sincerely and honestly has pursued that policy, and when they have not pleased certain people by not doing something that they themselves do not consider to the advantage of the country, that they should be met with the type of criticism they have been met with here to-day.  One would at least think that the Opposition would give some credit to the Government for having honestly and sincerely pursued their policy, for not having deviated from the policy which they embarked upon, and which they gave other States participating in the Non-Intervention Committee to understand that they were going to act up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every possible kind of red herring has been dragged into this discussion to-day.  And what is the object of it all?  Simply to try to give the impression that the Government is in some way false to Irish ideals, false to the things which the Irish people hold dear, if it is not indeed false to its responsibilities to the citizens whose interests it has been elected to look after.  We were told, for example, when we said that we would like to see the end of this conflict, that it was very questionable whether we had the right to express such an opinion. Why, it was almost heresy to suggest that the Government of this State should do whatever it can&mdash;and I certainly believe it should&mdash;to bring this conflict to an end if it is not clear in advance what side is going to win. This State is not in a position to say what side is going to win.  We have a strong idea that the people of Spain themselves will in the long run have to decide that question, that it will not, as the House was reminded here last night, be decided by foreign bayonets.  Even the great Napoleon Bonaparte had to realise that foreign bayonets could not conquer the Spanish <Col N="1011" /> people, and there is no Napoleon in Europe to-day.  We had again dragged into this debate to-day that the Government regard this as a question of one &ldquo;ism&rdquo; as against another, when it was made quite clear that what was said was that with the people who are seeking to intervene in this conflict in Spain it is very largely a question of one &ldquo;ism&rdquo; versus another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, perhaps, has a right to speak for those people; I have no right to speak for them.  I simply say that, as a matter of opinion, it might be very well said that a great many of them are more interested in those &ldquo;isms&rdquo; and in those particular national policies for which they stand, than in the spiritual things which the Irish people hold dear.  Again, is it to be thought that an international war can help the cause of Christianity, or can help&mdash;as Deputy MacDermot very rightly pointed out to us last week &mdash;to kill Communism?  Rather it would give new birth to Communism, and help to revive it in most of the countries of Europe.  Why is it always assumed that it is a wrong thing spiritually, that it is in some way acting unfairly towards our spiritual ideals, if we do not put ourselves in a position of committing ourselves in advance, committing our people, and committing our country?  I again repeat what I said to-day and said on the last day, that when the Government considers the time opportune, when they consider that they can get out of so doing advantage for the cause that they have at heart, they will certainly not be slow to take suitable action, either in the recognition or non-recognition of representatives, or any other matters in the international scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy even told us&mdash;after his Party has wasted three days of the time of Dáil Eireann telling us that they are fully in favour of the policy of non-intervention, but they are against the Bill&mdash;that they are against even the provisions in the Bill which impose penalties.  But there is not a single suggestion as to how this policy <Col N="1012" /> can be made effective unless it is accompanied with bans and penalties. The suggestion, I understood from Deputy Mulcahy, is that the Bill in some way helps the Madrid side.  It might be very well argued, and has been argued in the House, that the Bill is helping the other side.  We cannot know.  We are not in a position to know what side it is going to help. It was not on the consideration, in the first instance, of what side it is going to help, but on general considerations of peace, of creating a better spirit in Europe, of doing what we can in that sphere, and also of doing the right thing in the interests of our own people, that we have recommended this action.  It is our responsibility. We mean to accept responsibility for that action.  I think it will be recognised that in international affairs Governments are in a better position to understand the situation, are in a better position to be informed of what is going on, than other parties.  We take the responsibility.  We are the Party who speak for the Irish people at the present time, and I think we can also claim to be the Party which understands the situation, because our understanding is based on whatever knowledge of the situation is available. Our Party is, therefore, best qualified to lay down the policy.  It is again I say an extraordinary thing that, in this small country, because we happen to have a deep sense of religion and a deep attachment to our traditions, that for that very reason we should have an Opposition challenging a Government which is predominantly Catholic, which is in no sense whatever different to the Irish people it represents, in ideals or in any other way that can matter in this particular issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that the Bill cannot be disentangled from the other issues which it calls up.  It cannot be disentangled because the Opposition do not want to disentangle it.  They do not want to disentangle the plain, simple, and straight question as to whether we should stand in with the other European nations in this matter of non-intervention, or whether we should not.  I suggest that in no other parliament in Europe will we have such a futile, and, if I may say so, such a <Col N="1013" /> nauseating discussion as we have had in this House.  The attempt will fail, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, because the Irish people are no fools.  While they hold their religious ideals dearly, they have understanding enough from our own history, and from the experience we have had of the interests that foreign nations have taken in our affairs from time to time, to realise that things are not always quite so plain or quite so simple as they seem to be.  These arguments that we are wanting in our duty to the people, that we are forgetting our traditions and so on, are simply on a par with the arguments that we have been hearing for the past few years, lectures on Marxism, and the suggestions that the Government, in its social policy, mind you, is going to bring this country into the position of Spain, that, because of our social policy, we are going to bring about Communism in this country.  The Party that could start off with that argument and could try to have it accepted by the Irish people are, it is quite plain, sufficiently out of touch with the situation and with all reasonableness to account for the fact that, at this stage in the day, they are taking up the argument that because we take a plain, simple and clear policy and fall in with it, in this matter of non-intervention, we are to be dubbed as in some way Red or in sympathy with the Reds.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced to-day was that British diplomacy, as in the case of sanctions, is apparently responsible for our attitude.  Our attitude has been taken up quite independently and always has been, both in the past and at present, and is based solely on a consideration of what is the right policy for our people, and, tomorrow, if we should see fit, and if we should think it the right thing, we are not going to be bound to remain a member of this Non-Intervention Committee or to take part in any other concert of nations, or any other council that is there at present or likely to be there.  But we believe that at present we are in the same position as other small nations, and that it is good and sound policy for us to exercise whatever influence we can for the general <Col N="1014" /> good feeling and general peace of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has apparently been appointed acting-Minister for External Affairs by the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is a very important measure, we are told by Ministers, and there is very great urgency with regard to it.  The Bill has been discussed for nearly six hours in the absence of the Minister for External Affairs.  Deputy MacDermot takes himself very seriously.  He has taken it upon himself, not only on this Bill but over the last couple of months, to explain Government policy, and the President himself has accepted that. On more than one occasion, he has told the House that Deputy MacDermot has put the matter quite clearly and we had the Minister for Education calling to his aid again to-night the utterances of Deputy MacDermot. The Government, I am sure, are very pleased with the assistance they get from Deputy MacDermot and it is quite obvious that it is welcomed by them.  Deputy MacDermot takes it upon himself to lecture members of this House and members of this Party on their motives in regard to the attitude they have taken up on this Bill.  The Deputy is a very superior sort of person, too superior altogether for this House, this Parliament and for this country.  The Deputy said he did not mean to be offensive when he told Deputy Professor O'Sullivan that his speech was a discreditable one and that he and the members of the Front Bench were &ldquo;cashing-in&rdquo; electorally on Christianity. The Deputy repeated it to-day and his excuse was that it is not the first time that it has been used in this country, that it has been used before and used by the Orange leaders in Belfast.  Perhaps it was there, or in similar circles, that Deputy MacDermot got the phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to give a Final Reading to this Bill and to pass it under a guillotine.  We are asked by the Minister for Education why we did not talk about international and European peace under a guillotine motion, and we are told by Deputy MacDermot that far from the Bill being rushed and <Col N="1015" /> closured and guillotined, the Government has given by far too much time for its discussion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly says &ldquo;hear, hear.&rdquo;  I am not surprised at Deputy Donnelly saying &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that because Deputy Donnelly told us earlier in the evening that it was dishonest to advance any amendment or any point of view in this House that was not going to be accepted by the majority.  I see that the Minister for Finance has at last been able to work up a smile.  I had thought that the chastising he got for his indiscretions of Sunday last had wiped whatever smiles were there from his face for a considerable time. We are asked to give those powers to a Government consisting of persons who are capable of giving utterance to the statements that were made by the Minister for Finance on Sunday last, who were capable of giving the description of conditions in Spain that the President gave on the Second Reading, and to a Government and Party who have the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that this is a fight between Fascism and democracy and Fianna Fáil has no use for Fascism.</P>
      <P>We are told by the Minister for Education that the Government are carrying out the wishes of the majority of the Irish people.  Does the Government claim that they have a mandate for the recognition of Madrid as mentioned by the Minister to-night?  Is there any member of either the Front Bench or the Back Bench who will claim that they have the majority of the people behind them in continuing that?  There is not a single member will do so.  &ldquo;The Government is going to take action which will bring matters to a conclusion in Spain.&rdquo;  It is a pity the Minister did not develop that and tell us what actions they were going to take that were going to bring matters to a conclusion in Spain.  He told us quite clearly that he had no idea to which side any action taken by this Government would bring victory in Spain.</P>

This is clear anyway, that this Bill is aimed at seeing that this country will not give any assistance, good, bad or indifferent, to General Franco. And when this Bill passes, the only official connection that the people of this country will have with Spain will be with the Red Government of Spain.</P>

      <P>I hope it is not. When I was interrupted I was proceeding to say that when this Bill is passed by this House to-night and becomes law, the only connection that our Government will have with Spain will be with the Caballero Government. The Deputy cannot deny that and no member of the House can deny it.  The Minister for Education tells us that the Government have the sanction and the authority of the Irish people for this measure.  The Minister does not believe that and neither does the Government.  They know quite well that they have not the Irish people behind them in this Bill.  I am quite sure that a majority <Col N="1017" /> of the Irish people are not, and will not be, in favour of the position in which we will stand in relation to Spain when this Bill becomes law. Those are the facts to which we have to face up.  All the talking and all the misrepresentation of the President on last Friday night is not going to get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President started his speech on Friday night&mdash;having got an opportunity at a time in the debate when he should not be allowed to get in and talked about the people on this side of the House and said they were not dealing with this matter on its merits, that they were not discussing it honestly, but that they were misrepresenting him and the Government Party.  And he proceeded himself immediately afterwards&mdash;it can be read in the Official Report&mdash;to indulge in the worst piece of misrepresentation that was ever attempted in this House. He quoted from the <i>Irish Catholic,</i> and then turned to this side of the House and said: &ldquo;If you are going to class as Communists the 204,000 members of the Irish Trade Union Congress...then, of course, you can very rapidly increase the number of Communists.&rdquo;  And when he was told by this side of the House that that suggestion was never made by the Opposition and that it was an absolute misrepresentation on his part, what did he say: &ldquo;If the Deputies make it quite clear that they withdraw that suggestion I shall certainly be glad.&rdquo;  Any Deputy on any side of the House can read that passage in the Official Report of the President's speech delivered here last Friday night.  And that is the President who talks about misrepresentation and honesty in debate and honesty in speech.  The whole thing can be boiled down to one point and that is this: that the people of this country if they want any intervention at all in Spain want intervention on the side of General Franco.  The Government of this country are passing this Bill which says they are to have complete non-intervention.  But when this Bill becomes law, and I want specially to emphasise that, the only connection we will have with the <Col N="1018" /> Spanish people will be the connection we will have with the Caballero Government at Valencia.</P>

      <P>The speech to which we have just listened might, for crude claptrap and pompous blatherskite, have been delivered by Deputy Belton. The Deputy, Sir, made one point of substance during his tirade of the last 15 minutes.  It was that he had made the Minister for Finance smile.  Well, Sir, I smiled because I thought it would have been impolite to yawn.</P>

      <P>The Dáil should pass this Bill for three reasons: first, because it is our duty and our obligation to Christianity as well as to humanity to act in concert with the Powers of Europe when the aim of such concerted action is the maintenance of peace.  All history teaches us that religion and morals in general are ill-served by the conditions of war. The moral decay which is so widespread in Continental Europe to-day is within the knowledge of every one of us, those who are canting about Christianity on the opposite benches, those who sit here, those who preach from the pulpits, those who work in our cities and towns and those who have the hard task of looking after their flocks.  In Germany and Russia and in most of the Continental cities of Europe to-day the moral decay which is so widespread and general was greatly accelerated by the conditions of the World War in 1914, when the nations of the world were embattled against each other.  We know that the mentality that dominated those at the heads of the warring nations was a mentality of materialism.  It is a mentality of materialism that dominates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister will make the reference relevant.  To the Chair it does seem relevant.  If the conflict in Spain precipitates another war the Minister's point is that the conditions in Europe will be worse.  That is the analogy, I take it, the Minister is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I was making.  I was saying that the mentality which dominated the world in 1914 was one of absolute materialism.  That also will be the mentality that will dominate the next world war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Spain to-day representatives of almost all religions and irreligion&mdash; Catholics and Protestants, heretics and infidels, primitive pagans and neopagans&mdash;are fighting side by side, as well as face to face, with a bitterness and intensity of hatred beyond our conception.  The national prestige of foreign States is engaged on one side and the other.  Is it not clear to every thinking man that this present conflict in Spain is the crater of a volcano that may yet destroy religion and civilisation in Europe?  The words that he who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword are a warning for militant Christians as well as for militant pagans.  Anyone who has any regard for religion or for Christianity cannot contemplate with equanimity the prospect of a new European conflict.  It is our duty, therefore, as Catholics and Christians, to circumscribe and confine the war in Spain to the narrowest possible territorial limits.  The Non-Intervention Pact, to which, by the enactment of this Bill, the Government is empowered to give its practical adherence, is the only machinery that human intelligence or human experience has been able to devise to that end.  I repeat and emphasise that this House is bound to pass this Bill not merely in the interest of humanity but in the interest of Christianity, and, aye, of Catholicity.  If this civil war, which to-day is confined to the Iberian peninsula, were to spread over Europe, what do Deputies think would be the <Col N="1020" /> position of the Catholic religion in those States which, because of their own territorial interests or foreign policy, would range themselves on the side of the Valencia Government? If there are cathedrals desecrated in Spain&mdash;and it is a terrible thing for Catholics to think that the House of God should be so desecrated&mdash;do you think that if from Spain there goes out this fire of irreligion, cathedrals and Catholic shrines in other countries will not be desecrated as well?</P>
    <P>When a fire breaks out in a prairie or in a forest, wise men try to make a clearing around it, and they do not go heaping on that fire dry grass or brushwood in an attempt to put it out.  We have recognised the wisdom of that, and we are endeavouring to prevent our people from intervening in that conflict not merely on one side but on the other as well.  Let us not forget that while Irishmen died fighting at Madrid on one side, whose deaths were announced in this morning's papers, Irishmen died in the fight at Madrid on the other side, whose deaths were announced some few weeks ago.  There are Frenchmen, there are Germans, there are Italians, there are representatives of every nation of Europe in exactly the same position.  Some day or other, if this thing goes on, it may be that those who feel that the tide of battle is going against the side they have espoused may think that, by precipitating a European conflict, they can make their side victorious in the present war.  If this thing is permitted to go on and European nations outside Spain take a part in it, one day or another an international incident is going to happen just as it happened in July, 1914, and Europe is going to be face to face again with the early days of August, 1914.</P>
    <P>The purpose and the policy of the Government is, so far as the Irish people are concerned, to do everything it possibly can to prevent that happening. I say that every man who believes in Christianity, every man who follows the precepts of the Sermon on the Mount, every man who stands for the Gospel of peace for <Col N="1021" /> which our Church stands, will, on this issue, stand behind the Government.</P>

      <P>Those who support this Bill are more concerned with the cause of Christianity than those who, for mere Party gain, would trail the garment of Christ in the arena of politics.  They see that Christianity would be imperilled by the extension of the Spanish conflict and they are resolved, in the face of misrepresentation and with the full knowledge of the utter unscrupulousness of the Opposition in this regard, to do everything they can to ensure that that will not happen.</P>
      <P>This Bill deserves to be supported for another reason.  It should be passed by the Dáil because we are bound, in the national interest, to do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of another world war.  If such a war were to break out, we have no assurance that our people would be permitted to remain outside the ambit of such a conflict.  Our history has been a sorrowful and a distressing one and it is a record of many sufferings, but that record would pale before that which would have to be written if the full force of modern warfare visited our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Less than 30 years ago, we might have been content to take a passive attitude in the face of a European conflict, because our geographical position would have kept us immune from its horrors.  The ingenuity of <Col N="1022" /> mankind had not then succeeded in overcoming the problem of distance. To-day, however, the aeroplane is almost annihilating space.  Only a few days ago, an aeroplane carrying half a ton of cargo, in addition to its crew, flew 2,500 miles without stopping in less than 15 hours. In the event of another world war, there would be hundreds of even more powerful planes in the air, able to traverse almost equal distances at greater speeds and carrying a heavier load&mdash;a load of death and destruction. We, a small people, cannot guarantee to our country immunity from attack in such an event.  The very need and urge upon our people to live might compel them in war time to be one of the main food suppliers of one of the possible protagonists in that struggle. If they were, it would not matter whether we proclaimed our neutrality or otherwise.  Those who were concerned to use again the weapon of the blockade against Great Britain, as it was used in 1914, would take care that Britain's food supplies would be cut off at their source before they could be transhipped to the other side of the Irish Sea.  Because a European war means that death by bombing and aerial warfare may visit our shores, I say it is the duty of this Government and the duty of this House&mdash;a duty which they owe to the people&mdash;to pass this Bill so that we may keep our country out of the Spanish conflict and, so far as we can, prevent that conflict from engulfing Europe.</P>
