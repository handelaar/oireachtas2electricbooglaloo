    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether any preparatory work has been done by the Departments of State of Saorstát Eireann with a view to preparing the ground for the making of trade agreements between this country and the other States members of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the occasion of the Imperial Conference to be held in London this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade relations between Saorstát Eireann and the States members of the Commonwealth are constantly under review in the Departments concerned and are the subject of frequent correspondence with those States.  The presence of Ministers and officials of the Dominions will be availed of for discussing trade matters should the time appear opportune for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the negotiation of trade agreements amongst the States of the Commonwealth concerns only the States immediately involved.  The recent conclusion of a trade treaty between Great Britain and Canada and the negotiations between the latter country and Australia indicate that these States do not consider an Imperial Conference a suitable occasion for making trade agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Minister for External Affairs contemplates entering into trade negotiations with Ministers from the States members of the Commonwealth of Nations in London and, at the same time, not attending the Imperial Conference to be held in London at the same time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the President's position that he will not tell Dáil Eireann what the Executive Council's intentions are in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said in my reply that the presence of Ministers and officials of the Dominions will be availed of for discussing trade matters should the time appear opportune for that purpose, and I can add nothing to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions, Sir, have been set out on the Order Paper to-day with a view to ascertaining what this State is going to do in connection with the forthcoming Imperial Conference. The Executive Council, it would appear, must have made up its mind, one way or the other, as to what it is going to do at the Imperial Conference next May, in six weeks' time.  Is it the President's position that he will not tell Dáil Eireann what are the intentions of the Executive Council in the matter, and, if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy and Dáil Eireann and the country, and everybody who read the reply, on a previous occasion, that a decision had not been taken, and that is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the President continue to wobble in this matter? Cannot he make up his mind what to do, one way or the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Because on the Government rests the responsibility for dealing with these things in a proper manner.  I have said that there is no need for doing so, and, therefore, it has not been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply, will he make representations to the corporation to induce them to accelerate house building, having regard to the fact that such a small number of houses is being built now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I read last week the very comprehensive report submitted to the Dublin Corporation, a copy of which was sent to my Department by the housing section of the corporation.  In that report there were some references to a shortage of plasterers.  I think that is the only skilled trade in which it was definitely ascertained that there was a definite shortage of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more marked in the plastering trades than in other trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has intimated to county councils that, in order to qualify for relief grants during the coming financial year, it will be necessary for them to raise the requisite local contribution in ordinary revenue, and, if so, if he has considered that, owing to this policy being responsible for an increase of rates, it might result in a refusal by some councils to strike this rate, and thereby prevent the unemployed from having advantage of moneys voted by the Oireachtas for their benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As to the second part, I am satisfied that local contributions towards the cost of employment schemes on roads should be raised in revenue in the year in which the schemes are to be carried out, and I do not anticipate that councils will refuse to make the necessary provision. The fact that the amounts are to be provided from revenue has been taken into consideration in fixing provisionally the amounts of the local contributions for 1937-38.</P>

    <P>(2)  The figures given as &ldquo;total cost&rdquo; include pay and allowances of staff, food, clothing, bedding, medicines, fuel and light, repairs to buildings and gratuities;</P>
    <P>(2)  Portlaoighise convict prison is the only prison in the Saorstát used exclusively for convicts.  In Mountjoy female prison female convicts are detained as well as ordinary tried and untried prisoners.  A few male convicts are occasionally detained for special reasons in Mountjoy male prison. Separate figures for cost of convicts in Mountjoy, as distinguished from ordinary prisoners detained there, are not conveniently available and could be arrived at only by approximate apportionment of costs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention was directed to a criticism, by the judge in the Circuit Court in Dublin, of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, and in particular to the fact that the circuit judge felt unable to give a declaration in favour of an applicant to which he believed the applicant was entitled in equity; whether, in view of these pronouncements from the bench, he is prepared to introduce at an early date proposals for amending the Act so as to remove the defects adverted to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. Reidy)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number of married British ex-servicemen with families, receiving small pensions, are not eligible for employment on relief schemes, and if he is further aware that, as a result, their families and themselves are suffering severe hardships, and if he will take the necessary steps to make them eligible to obtain the much-needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to eligibility for employment on relief schemes, British ex-servicemen in receipt of pensions are in precisely the same position <Col N="1600" /> as any other class in the community who have pensions or other income which must be taken into account in calculating their means under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  In relation to this kind of employment, British ex-servicemen are affected, in the same way and to the same extent as other persons who have means, by the operation of the rule under which preference in such employment is given to recipients of unemployment assistance, priority being given to those in receipt of higher rates over persons in receipt of lower rates.  The scheduled rates of assistance applicable to all persons are affected alike by their means, amongst which pensions are reckoned.  British ex-servicemen are already as eligible for employment on relief works as any other class and I cannot adopt the Deputy's suggestion that they should be given preferential treatment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in respect of the months (1) January and (2) February, 1937, the number of external firms who indicated to (a) his Department or (b) the employment exchange in Dublin, that they had openings for (1) male and (2) female workers in places outside the Free State, and if he will state in respect of each such notification (1) the class of work indicated, (2) the number of workers required, (3) the place at which the work was said to be available, (4) the terms of employment, including duration; (5) the number of persons registered at the exchange (a) with claims current, (b) without claims current, to whom the information was conveyed; (6) the manner in which the information was conveyed to them; (7) the nature of any facilities provided on official premises for (i) interview and (ii) working demonstration by the firms' representative; (8) the number of persons with claims current (a) who refused to offer themselves for the work, (b) who offered themselves for the work, and (i) were accepted, and (ii) were not accepted; (9) the number of persons without claims current who (a) refused to offer themselves for the work, (b) offered themselves for the work and (i) <Col N="1601" /> were accepted, and (ii) were not accepted; and (10) if no official record is kept of (8) and (9), (a) the reason for not keeping such record, and (b) the number of persons (1) with claims current and (2) without claims current, to whom the information was conveyed and whose names disappeared off the employment list (a) within one week, (b) within two weeks, and (c) within three weeks after notification.</P>

      <P>By &ldquo;external firms&rdquo; I assume that the Deputy means firms whose factories or other places of business are situated outside Saorstát Eireann.  No &ldquo;external firm&rdquo; indicated to my Department in January that they had openings outside the Saorstát for male or female workers. In February one such firm enquired at the Dublin Employment Exchange whether women workers were available for employment in a factory in England.  It is a rule of my Department that notification of vacancies outside An Saorstát is not accepted from the employers concerned; the employers' representative was so informed in this case and advised to notify the requirements of her firm to the appropriate local office of the Ministry of Labour in England.  Meantime she was permitted to interview such girls at the Dublin Employment Exchange as were considered suitable and might be willing to consider the employment.  The further information requested by the Deputy in regard to this inquiry is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The work in question was the making and dyeing of felt hoods for hats at a factory in Buckinghamshire.</P>
      <P>The number of workers from this country that the firm might be prepared to take was not mentioned, and the employment was stated to be permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of workers registered at the Dublin Employment Exchange to whom information as to the possible openings was conveyed cannot be stated as no record was kept.  Such a record was unnecessary in this case for the reason that there was no offer of employment involved.  The information that employment might be available <Col N="1602" /> was conveyed to applicants by counter clerks at the employment exchange by word of mouth.  The firm's representative saw applicants who desired to be interviewed in a room in the employment exchange provided for that purpose in accordance with the ordinary practice of the exchange in such circumstances. There were no special facilities afforded.  The firm's representative explained to the applicants the nature of the work and produced for inspection two felt hoods for hats. There was no working demonstration.</P>
    <P>Attendance at the interview was voluntary.  No offer of work was made, consequently no person was accepted or rejected.  There was nothing more than a suggestion that work might be available and applicants were given the opportunity to interview the firm's representative before she returned to England.</P>
    <P>As there was no offer of work there was nothing to record in regard to refusals of work or the acceptance or rejection of candidates.  No record was made of the persons who were informed of the possibility of vacancies occurring.  Therefore, it is not possible to say how many of these persons have ceased to register at the employment exchange.  No person lost unemployment benefit or assistance or otherwise disappeared from the registers of the employment exchange in consequence of inquiries made at any office of my Department by the representative of this firm, and no question did or could at any time arise in regard to stopping payment of benefit or assistance in any case in which a person was unwilling to accept employment outside An Saorstát.</P>

The barracks are occupied only by Volunteers and I suggest a hall would be more suitable for their requirements. Therefore, the military requirements would be amply met by the building of a new hall and there would be considerable employment given both in respect to the building of an hospital and a hall, which would be utilised as a barracks.</P>

      <P>May I suggest, in view of the very peculiar circumstances surrounding this matter, that it would be very much better if he would build a suitable establishment which would be available for the kind of equipment that I think both he and I have in mind?  No ordinary old house will meet the requirements of the situation here, because the health and the surroundings of the children are of a kind that make it very necessary that the building which will be chosen for their detention will savour somewhat of an hospital, and it is extremely difficult to adapt any old building for that purpose.  One can imagine cleanliness is a very vital consideration, and one can readily see that an old building will be difficult to adapt to that purpose.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment into the Pensions Investment Account created under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of such annual contributions as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to amend and extend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 and 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on the Money Resolution and then I imagine the remaining stages of <Col N="1614" /> this Bill will pass with considerable despatch.  This most excellent social service is to be further extended, and as the Minister said in his opening remarks, this appears to be the kind of social service which, from every point of view, social and economic, is good.  It avoids many of the pitfalls associated with other social services which could conceivably interfere with the desirable working of the economic system under which we live.  Nobody in the House wants a widow of 55 years of age or one who has children dependent upon her to become a wage-earning person in order to live. It is infinitely preferable that such a person should be safeguarded against distress, and it will be no loss to the economic life of the country that she should be relieved from any kind of inducement to go out and seek remunerative work.  Therefore, no economic objection of any kind can be raised to this service except the usual one of making sure that we have made prudent provision for the finances necessary to maintain it.  That question can arise on another occasion, with general reference to all social services.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to take this occasion to make a suggestion relating to this particular social service and to all others obtaining in the country at the present time.  Since this State was founded, the object of each Administration has been to mitigate, in so far as their resources permit, the rigours of the capitalist system, and the rigours which inevitably arise out of a social system founded upon individual enterprise, by improving the social services.  That has meant that we set up one service after another and, in doing that, I think we did very well.  I hope that our resources and inclinations will permit us to continue in that course.</P>

    <P>But we are now reaching a point when we have so many social services that co-ordination is becoming necessary, and it is becoming vitally necessary from two points of view.  The first is this: that where you have seven or eight funds, out of which indigent people have a right to get relief, you will find that the cute fellow, who is <Col N="1615" /> probably not strictly entitled to help from any of them, is able to wangle assistance, sometimes not only out of one fund, but out of two or three.  You will find that the person for whom these funds are primarily intended, that is the simple person who cannot understand the machinations of red-tape, who is really deserving, who has no one to help him to get what he is entitled to under the law, finds himself driven from pillar to post when looking for the relief which he stands in need of.  He or she asks for employment assistance and is told, &ldquo;You ought to get outdoor relief.&rdquo;  The person goes to the relieving officer and he says, &ldquo;Why have you not got the widow's pension?  Try to get the widow's pension and you will not want relief.&rdquo;  He or she tries to get the widow's pension and is told that he or she is probably a charge on another fund.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's jocular intervention, but this is not an easy point to expose and I ask the Deputy to postpone his jest until I finish.  What I want to secure is that in certain fixed areas, say, in each county there would be a co-ordinating officer for all our social services and that eventually we would have a Minister for social services.  So that, if any person, however simple, was destitute or in grave distress, but could not bring himself within the ambit of any scheme known to him, that person would be able to go to some individual in his own county and say to him: &ldquo;I cannot make out what I am entitled to, but I know that your duty here is to see that the citizen gets his rights under the law when he stands in need of relief of one kind or another.  These are the facts of my case.  Do not start reading the law to me.  Do not start telling me that somebody will look after me.  I want to know from you what you are prepared to provide for me.&rdquo;  I want that co-ordinating officer to examine the facts of that case and see that the aggrieved individual gets whatever assistance he is entitled to, and if it <Col N="1616" /> appears, under the peculiar circumstances existing in this particular case, that the person is not covered by any existing scheme, that it will be his duty immediately to prepare a memorandum and forward it to the responsible Minister to say: &ldquo;This is a class of case which has come under my notice and I bring it now under yours, so that if similar cases are arising in other counties you may have the requisite material to form a judgment as to whether further social legislation is not desirable to cover this peculiar class of case which has so far been overlooked.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one very special reason why this matter should be attended to. There is another immensely important reason, and it is this.  If you examine our present social services, you will find that they are being administered by all sorts of different Departments. Each Minister who is responsible for one service must set up a machine in his own Department adequate to operate that service efficiently, or as efficiently as the existing law will permit. That means that you have an immense increase in the overhead cost of getting money, voted by this House, out to the indigent people entitled to it.  I think we could effect immense economy in the overhead charges of these social services if we could coordinate them all, and made one Minister and one Department responsible for their administration.  I know that certain social services are administered by the Government, and others by the local authorities, but I do not think any such difficulty should be allowed to stand in the way, and that whatever steps might be necessary effectively to co-ordinate them ought to be taken. It would be impossible for anyone casually to adumbrate a complete scheme to achieve that purpose here and now, because it is a matter on which there would have to be careful inquiry and expert evidence heard from those in direct touch, but I feel that very important work urgently awaits us in regard to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last aspect of this question that I want to touch upon is this, that if we are to devise social services in this House, we should be extremely careful&mdash;if and when a desire from <Col N="1617" /> existing charitable institutions manifests itself&mdash;of the form of assistance we give, because it would be an unmitigated disaster if existing charitable institutions were brought under any kind of bureaucratic control, or made the subject of any bureaucratic interference, in consideration of any contribution they might get from the State or from local funds, because the whole essence of the successful working of charitable organisations is that the persons working them are acting <i>bona fide</i> and disinterestedly.  If not, no amount of bureaucracy will make the charity what it ought to be.  We have further to consider if we desire to make State or local funds available to charitable institutions.  I am not arguing that that should never be done, as there are exceptional circumstances in which it may be necessary to do it, but we ought to bear this in mind, that if it is known that a particular charitable organisation is receiving funds from the Government, many charitably disposed persons will inevitably say: &ldquo;If I have 10/- or £1 to give in charity this year what is the use of giving it to such and such a society?  Their funds are guaranteed by the Government.  All they have to do is to spend as much as the object of their charity requires, and if there is a deficit at the end of the year they can get a contribution from the Minister for Local Government for whatever amount is necessary to make up the deficit.&rdquo;  If that is so, people will turn their charitable donations elsewhere, and will begin to get the impression that if one charity gets assistance of that kind then other charities ought to get the same kind of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has raised a point to which I adverted on a previous occasion.  There is considerable merit in his suggestion, as in respect to local government we seem to have built up the Department on the example furnished by Great Britain, where the equivalent Department does approximately the same kind of work and discharges the same functions as the Department of Local Government here.  If we look at the position in France, Belgium, Holland and the Scandinavian countries, we find that they thought it desirable to separate the functions of local government proper from other functions; for instance, social services are here combined under the Department of Local Government.  Since 1922 a variety of legislation has been passed here, a large proportion of which is administered by the Department of Local Government.  Such administration has, in my view, tended to make that Department a large and from the administrative point of view rather a cumbersome Department.  I think it is a tribute to the efficiency and the loyalty of the staff of that Department that such legislation has been carried through with relative smoothness, but the time has arrived, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, when some consideration should be given to the question of detaching social services from the Department of Local Government and combining them with social services administered by other Departments.  For instance, we have rather a piecemeal method of adminiistration of social services, such as the widows' and orphans' pensions under the Department of Local Govment, unemployment insurance and <Col N="1619" /> unemployment assistance under the Department of Industry and Commerce, payment of old age pensions by the Revenue Commissioners, while national health insurance is administered by the Department of Local Government.  Actually we have three Departments concerned with the administration of our social services because of the piecemeal character of these services.  Owing to the manner in which they were introduced and the uneven dates of their introduction, it was not possible to provide a proper scheme of co-ordination for such legislation.  The Minister has already had representations from the trade unions urging him to do something in the way of co-ordinating certain social services.  For example, there is no reason for having to affix three separate stamps to three separate cards.  The trade unions have urged that there should be co-ordination there, so as to get these services combined in one card by the simple process of having a single stamp.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon said that if grants were to be made to certain organisations they should be charitable organisations.  There was no provision for that in the Bill.  I am calling the attention of the Minister to the fact that with more comprehensive widows' and orphans' pensions legislation more burdens will be placed on the Department of Local Government.  Here, Sir, I just want again to enter a plea for the separation of the social functions of the <Col N="1620" /> Department from its ordinary functions in respect of local government, in the hope that I can excite the Minister into bringing this matter before the Executive Council so that when we are having a new Constitution some provision will be made for the creation of a separate ministry of social services, and the co-ordination under that ministry of the various social services at present dealt with by a number of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise on this Bill one point that I raised on the Second Reading.  I should like, in particular, to raise it on the Money Resolution, because it may be more convenient to do so than to wait for a section of the Bill, as the matter at issue is not dealt with specifically in any section of the Bill.  I suggested to the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill that provision ought to be made so as to enable a person who has been in insurable employment, but who went out of insurable employment and in fact does not follow any particular employment, to become a voluntary contributor.  Take for instance the case of a person who has been perhaps in the State service.  While there, he is covered for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes under the main Act. If he is superannuated on the grounds of ill-health or old age, in either eventuality he is probably not able to follow any further employment, but the risk of death is always there, and the risk becomes particularly terrifying in view of the smaller income which a person has in retirement.  I inquired from the Minister on that occasion whether it would be possible for him to introduce an amendment to this Bill, so as to enable persons in such circumstances to get themselves covered under the contributory sections of this Act as voluntary contributors, in the same way as they are permitted to become voluntary contributors if, being in insurable employment at a rate not exceeding £250 per annum, the rate should pass over that limit.  In those circumstances they are entitled under the main Act to get themselves insured for the purpose of contributory pensions which, under this <Col N="1621" /> Bill, are very much better than under the non-contributory sections.  I asked the Minister on that occasion to look into the matter and he promised to do so.  No amendment has been submitted by the Minister for the Committee Stage, and I should like to inquire from him what the result of his consideration has been.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there must be some misunderstanding on this particular point.  A person who is in insurable employment, that is a person who is insurable for national health purposes, or is in an excepted class, is compulsorily insured for the purposes of widows' and orphans' pensions.  So long as that person is employed in an insurable capacity or in an excepted class, he is compulsorily insured for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  Suppose, for instance, that person retires from insurable employment because his health is bad, and he does not then <Col N="1622" /> follow any particular employment, that person it seems to me under the main Act is not empowered to become a voluntary contributor.  If the Minister now says he is, I should like to know under what section of the main Act he is entitled to become a voluntary contributor.</P>

      <P>I can understand that in certain circumstances.

In the case of a man who is not following any employment at all, but living on a pension of, say, £1 per week, under what section of the Act can he become a voluntary contributor?</P>

      <P>(1)  Where any person who has been employed in an excepted employment to which this Act applies (not being a married woman) ceases after the date of the passing of this Act to be so employed, such person may, subject to the prescribed conditions, become a voluntary contributor under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a man who is not an insured person marries a woman who is an insured person by or in respect of whom one hundred and four contributions have been paid under this Act, he may, if he gives notice within the prescribed time after the marriage and in the prescribed manner, become a voluntary contributor under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>

I have not lost sight of the matter.  I have discussed it&mdash;I will not say frequently&mdash; a few times with responsible officials in the Department, but it has perhaps not got all the attention it might get, or all the attention that it could get, in view of the fact that I and the Department officials have been so busily engaged on constructive matters in relation to social services.  I feel, like Deputy Dillon and like Deputy Norton, that sooner or later a step in that direction will have to come, that co-ordination of social services must be secured, but when it can be tackled I cannot say at <Col N="1624" /> the moment.

Under Section 4 of the Principal Act, persons who are engaged in what are known as excepted employments are made insurable for the purposes of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and excepted employment is defined in Section 4 of the Principal Act.  Under sub-clause 2, paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Principal Act, persons who are employed by a local or public authority in an employment which is excluded from national health insurance by an Order made under the Act of 1913 are in excepted employment and are consequently insurable under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  The <Col N="1625" /> employments referred to are all employments under a local or public authority which are permanent and pensionable, and also certain employments, such as that of chaplain, for which insurance under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act is obviously not required.

      <P>Before Section 23 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 57 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion at the end of the said section of the following additional sub-section, and the Principal Act shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  Nothing contained in sub-section (4) of Section 23 of this Act or in sub-section (5) of Section 26 of this Act shall, in any case in which a pension has been paid as the result of any statement or representation (whether written or verbal) which is to the knowledge of the person making it false or misleading in any material respect, be construed as affecting the operation of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 23 of the Principal Act is a new sub-section which it is proposed to insert under clause 15 of the Bill, and sub-section (5) of Section 26 of the Principal Act is also a new sub-section which it is proposed to insert under clause 17 of the Bill.  The effect of these new <Col N="1626" /> sub-sections will be that where after the award of a pension, the means of a widow or orphan change, then, any resulting change in pension shall take effect as from the Friday following a decision by a deciding officer that the change has occurred.  These new sub-sections are required mainly for purposes of administration.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Principal Act provides for recovery of pensions overpaid. If no amendments were made to this, the new sub-sections referred to above would have the effect that Section 57 would be inoperative because all overpayments up to the date of revision of the pension would have been legalised and this would apply even though the old rate of pension had been paid as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations.</P>
    <P>The amendment now proposed is for the purpose of ensuring that in all cases of fraud, the power of recovery given in Section 57 will still continue, notwithstanding that under the new proposals, in clause 15 and clause 17 of the Bill, the pension is reduced or discontinued only from the Friday following the deciding officer's decision.</P>

I have enough to do with the administration of my own Acts, and I know with regard to national health insurance that frequently more than six months have elapsed before we have discovered fraud.  There are provisions whereby, by an order or declaration of the Minister, the length of time can be extended, and it is to make it administratively easier for the Minister that this change has been introduced into the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  In the case of national health insurance, we are not prohibited from bringing people before the court when we discover fraud, even after six months, but there is certain procedure necessary&mdash;orders to be made by the Minister and a good deal of formality to be gone through&mdash;and this would make it administratively easier for the Department and for the Minister to follow people who have been found to be guilty of fraud.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we have got into a difficulty out of which there is no escape, and the matter will have to be postponed until Report Stage, but there does seem to be obscurity in the way the amendment is set out. Are we to understand that in the draft of the 1937 Bill the words on the Order Paper, after the figure 5 in brackets, will be inserted, or are all the words from &ldquo;Section 57&rdquo; going to be inserted in the 1937 Bill?  That is not the question.  If all the words from the words &ldquo;Section 57&rdquo; are inserted the thing may mean sense.  If only the words after the figure 5 in brackets are inserted, then this amendment does not achieve the purpose which it is designed to achieve.  The simple way out of it is to direct the Minister's attention to it with a view to his examining it between now and the Report Stage, and, if an amendment is necessary, to bring in such an amendment.</P>

      <P>This is the usual statutory Bill confirming a number of Orders which were made during the <Col N="1629" /> course of the past six or eight months. The Orders which are set out in the Schedule to the Bill all involve alterations of duty of one kind or another on the commodities that are named in column four of the Schedule.  These Orders require to be confirmed by statute or else they cease to be operative. Although none of them has yet reached the stage where there is immediate danger of expiration, at the same time it was considered desirable to bring them forward at this stage and get them confirmed, so that they would be done with before the House begins to be occupied with the finance business of the year.  None of these Orders is of major importance.  Most of them relate to slight changes in the existing duties.  Any questions that Deputies desire to ask in relation to them can best be asked in the Committee Stage.  It is proposed to take the Committee Stage after Easter.</P>

      <P>Would I do the Minister an injustice if I said he was a little bit disingenuous when he said that these were statutory regulations confirming Orders made, and which were of no consequence at all and might be discussed in Committee after Easter, seeing that reference No. 12 is the only legislative step it is necessary to take whereby to implement the Coal-Cattle Agreement that was made between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the Saorstát?  I think I am right in saying that it is open to this House now to discuss in detail the terms of the Coal-Cattle Agreement recently entered into.  This is our consideration in exchange for certain economic concessions secured from Great Britain.  Is it any wonder that the Minister for Agriculture has softly and silently slipped away?  That is not surprising.  Is it any wonder that the Minister for External Affairs is conspicuous <Col N="1630" /> by his absence?  That is not surprising.  We are engaged in a death struggle with Great Britain, a struggle that is described as an economic war. This war is being fought on a sacred principle about which the President of the Executive Council says no compromise of any kind can be contemplated. Accordingly, for the last three months of the calendar year, three of the chief civil servants of this State were sent over to engage in a discussion with Great Britain as to how our trading with Great Britain could be adjusted in such a way as to secure that every penny that Great Britain claims from this State would be safely collected by the British Government and safely delivered by the Irish Government.  In the course of the discussion it apparently emerged that it would convenience the Irish Government if that part of the annuities, pensions and local loans which were heretofore paid by tariffs on horses were taken off horses and put on to cattle.  The British Government replied: &ldquo;Certainly; if you are sending a larger number of store cattle, a larger number of fat cattle, and a larger number of milch cows and bulls to which the existing duties will attach, we are quite content to take it off horses and to put it on to cattle.&rdquo;  This was accordingly done.  Surely we are entitled to inquire, not of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but from the Minister for External Affairs, how it is that they can go and negotiate tariffs off horses on to cattle, and how is it that it would be contrary to principle that he should take tariffs off everything.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs repeatedly admits that there is no difficulty in negotiating with Great Britain on a different question.  The Minister for External Affairs has got up in this House and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We deny that these moneys are due to the British Government, but we freely admit that the British Government are getting everything they claim and, in fact, a little more; we freely admit that they are getting it in a way that is doing this country much more damage than it used to do when these moneys were paid by cheque.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> If there is any breach of principle from the point of view of the Minister or of the Executive Council in undertaking to pay these moneys through cattle, sheep and pigs instead of paying it through tariffs on horses, would it not be far more convenient for everybody and far more profitable for this country to pay it through a banker simply and say to the British Government: &ldquo;Look here, we do not admit your right to a penny piece of this money; we say you should not get it, but if you are going to take it, it is much more convenient for you to take it through our bankers than through our cattle, sheep and pigs.&rdquo;  If the Government insist on paying the last penny&mdash;and that is their present proposition while protesting loudly that they do not wish the British Government to get a penny&mdash;would it not be better to pay it that way by cheque?  As far as I can point out the reason the Government are not prepared to adopt the course that Fine Gael believes should be adopted forthwith and which would avoid, in our judgment, the necessity of paying these moneys directly or indirectly, is because Fianna Fáil desires to maintain certain theses. The thesis they desire to adhere to is that the President of the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann who founded this State, who built up the State in the teeth of violent opposition and of the armed opposition of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, is a traitor and a corrupt person.  Our Government insists that before they will settle this business, the British Government shall join with them in describing the first Government of Saorstát Eireann as a treacherous, corrupt and dishonest body who entered into a dishonest and secret agreement whereunder the moneys of the Irish people were fraudulently transferred to another authority.  Because the British Government say: &ldquo;We were no party to fraud, we never found Deputy Cosgrave's Government to be treacherous, fraudulent or contemptible; we always found that they stood sternly for the rights of the country they represented; we found them vigorous <Col N="1632" /> in negotiation, solicitous for the interest of their own people, and the bargain we made with them was open and above board and, in their judgment, a good bargain&rdquo;&mdash;because the British Government say that that is their belief, our Government say: &ldquo;No, until you admit that they were fraudulent and dishonest, we shall not negotiate.&rdquo;  That is the contention of this Government.  President de Valera has repeatedly said that until the British Government say that this was a fraudulent agreement, a secret agreement and an agreement not binding on the conscience of anybody, he will not deal with them.  That is the position of the Fianna Fáil Government at the present time&mdash;that they will only discuss or negotiate terms of settlement on that hypothesis. Outside Bedlam, did ever a national Government take up such a position?  Why should they be concerned to defame and blackguard men who built up this State and who, as they have learned since they came into office, defended the interest of this State time and time again&mdash;and successfully defended it?</P>
    <P>From our point of view, this Coal-Cattle Pact is a mistake.  We take the view that the settlement of matters outstanding between ourselves and Great Britain by piecemeal arrangements is seriously detrimental to the best interests of this country.  What is happening at present is: we are giving to Great Britain many of the trade concessions which we ought to hold in our hand for the purpose of making the ultimate trade agreement with Great Britain, and we are getting no adequate return for them.  A lot of people forget that we voluntarily threw away not alone a free entry into the British market for our agricultural produce, but a preferential position of 10 per cent. in that market. We threw that away, and we are now painfully buying back from Great Britain, with a monopoly of our coal trade and a preference in regard to our cement trade and our steel imports, the very market we ourselves rejected and for which we had to pay nothing four years ago.  If the present business goes on of gradually buying back with these immense concessions <Col N="1633" /> what we gave away for nothing, what will we have wherewith to bargain when the time comes to make a comprehensive trade settlement with Great Britain?  We of the Fine Gael Party have repeatedly stated on public platforms and in this House that we are convinced that if the present Government or their successors in office go to the British Government and offer to deal with them with a view (1) to clearing up all outstanding misunderstandings that have arisen during the past five years, and (2) with a view to improving trade relations between the two countries, an immensely valuable deal can be made for out people.  I know that the Minister delights in making silly, schoolboy points and saying: &ldquo;You say you are going to settle with the British.  On what terms are you going to settle?&rdquo; Nobody can announce before he goes into negotiation what the terms of the settlement to which that negotiation is directed are going to be.  The terms are going to be the most advantageous that can be got, and, whatever they may be, they will be better than the existing condition.  I believe they can be made very good indeed.  I believe that the British want to settle.  I believe that the British would be glad to settle.  At present Great Britain is a willing buyer of almost everything of which we are a willing seller.</P>
    <P>Great Britain has announced its intention of spending £1,500,000,000 on armaments.  This is the country, mark well, which was going down, which was getting poor and whose market was shrinking.  This is the country whose market was &ldquo;gone, thank God,&rdquo; according to Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The British are going to spend on shot and shell, and for ancillary purposes, £1,500,000,000.  All their expenditure on shot and shell is going to avail them nothing if they have no food wherewith to feed the gentlemen who are to fire the shots and explode the shells.  We have got the capacity to produce that food.  If all the farmers in Great Britain and all the farmers in Ireland worked night and day for 365 days of the year, we could not supply all the food the British are prepared to consume.  But in a time of emergency, when the <Col N="1634" /> British would be threatened with starvation and would be prepared to ration themselves and hold out until the immediate peril had been overcome, I believe the farmers of this country and Great Britain could, between them, provide the British people with that measure of food which would make the difference between defeat and ultimate victory. That is an immensely powerful bargaining weapon in our hands.  I urge on the House to consider that if the British Government, who have got to make provision immediately for the possibility of war, are driven, by our refusal to make a bargain with them, to seeking other sources of supply and other means of meeting the emergency which may confront them, the day may dawn when we are still willing sellers and Great Britain is an unwilling buyer.  If that day dawns, then God help the unfortunate man who is trying to make a trade agreement for Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have seen the futility of the Government's attempt to get alternative markets&mdash;eggs for oranges, and butter being sent to Germany for 8d. per lb. while our people are paying 1/5 for butter coming in from New Zealand.  There is one market where we can sell our goods profitably, and if that market becomes an unwilling buyer of the goods we have to sell, then the only effective market in which we can sell our exports is gone, and we are at the mercy of any buyer who chooses to come and make an offer for what we have got.  We are in an immensely strong bargaining position at the present time, and we got into that position through purely fortuitous circumstances.  We did nothing to bring it about.  It is a situation that may pass, and I want to impress on the Government the vital urgency of seizing the opportunity that presents itself.</P>
    <P>Now, we have passed through the stage when the Government spokesmen were saying from public platforms in this country that &ldquo;the British market is gone, thank God.&rdquo;  We have learned.  It is part of the education to which Deputy MacDermot referred last night.  We have spent five weary and expensive years teaching the <Col N="1635" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture that the passing of the British market was nothing to thank God about.  In evidence of that we discover that these very Ministers negotiate with Great Britain to get the duty off horses. Why?  Not because the duty itself represents a very large sum.  As well as I recollect, the duty recovered from horses was in or about £160,000.  The reason is because they had come to see that it was not actually the cash on the horses that was so grievous a burden, but rather the appalling dislocation of the whole horse trade that those tariffs involved; that the only useful contribution was not a reduction in the tariff, but the abolition of the tariff, so that the channels of trade might be cleared and that there might be a free flow between the two countries.  Now, if it is manifest to them, and it certainly ought to be, that the tariff on horses was ruining the entire horse trade, why cannot they see that the tariff on cattle is ruining the cattle trade?  The tariff on cattle is much more pernicious than the tariff on horses, because the tariff on cattle is graduated.  You have a heavy tariff on a beast with four permanent teeth, a medium tariff on a beast with two permanent teeth, and a low tariff on a beast with no permanent teeth.  The result is that our people are all shipping out of the country young cattle, and none of that eminently desirable feeding process that used to go on on our holdings can be profitably conducted at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the olden days a man grew oats, barley, turnips, mangolds and crops on his little holding.  He cashed those crops by feeding them to good store cattle.  He sold the store cattle when forward stores.  They went to England to the stall-feeders, who then fattened them in the stalls.  Now you cannot keep a beast until it is a forward store, because if you do, and you give him hay, roots and cereals, when he gets the four permanent teeth you discover that he is worth less to you than when he had only two permanent teeth, so that all your feeding is gone for nothing, because the extra tariff takes £2 10s. 0d. per head off the beast. <Col N="1636" /> The result of all that is that our farmers are being driven into this young cattle business, which is comparatively unprofitable.  A lot of the more obscurantist Deputies in this country said: &ldquo;Ah, what do we care about the rancher, the rancher who is concerned only with cattle?&rdquo;  What I want to drive home is this: that this humble little reference No. 12 is putting a blister, not upon the back of the grazier or the big farmer, but on the back of the man upon whom this whole cattle pact is leaning&mdash;the three-cow man&mdash;the small man who has from ten to 15 acres of land.  That man depends for his economy on three cows, a pig or a couple of pigs, and the crops raised on his land.  He sells so much of his milk as he does not use to the local co-operative creamery, or makes it into butter and sells it.  He also depends on the price that he gets for three calves.  Their value means a great deal to him.  At the present time the price of his milk is gone to blazes.  The price that he gets for his eggs is practically finished.  Deputies should remember that at one time the production of eggs was no small part of the economy of those people. Many Deputies forget that eggs represented £7,000,000 worth of exports every year, practically all of which was from the three-cow men.  That trade has been practically wiped out. The price of the calves has been reduced to about half of what it was, and this Coal-Cattle Pact is going to do nothing to relieve the man that I speak of.  The price that he gets for his milk is admitted on all sides to be uneconomic.</P>
    <P>What is that man going to live on? Fianna Fáil Deputies have been inclined to say that we have been prophesying disaster year after year, and that nothing has happened.  They say, &ldquo;You tell us that we will be bankrupt, but we are not bankrupt yet.&rdquo; Is the emigration that is going on at the present time not a symptom?  How did Deputies expect that this country was going to show signs of bankruptcy? Did the members of Fianna Fáil expect that some morning the Minister for Finance, when coming down Upper Merrion Street, would stop a Civic Guard and say to him, &ldquo;I cannot pay <Col N="1637" /> you your wages any longer; you had better go home and take off your uniform?&rdquo; How did they expect that financial stringency would manifest itself in the country?  The way it is manifesting itself at present is that the people are finding they cannot live on the land, and they are going away from it.  The Government, by their policy, have crippled the small farmer.  They have made it impossible for him to earn a living.  The young people who used to be able to help on the land, and out of whose joint activities the family was able to make a comfortable living, all helping to keep the wheel turning at home, have made up their minds, seeing the way that things are now going with their fathers and mothers, that there is nothing for them on the land, and they are clearing off it.  They began by coming to Dublin.  The result of that was that Dublin began to boom. Henry Street, Mary Street and Talbot Street did not extend in length, but the number of customers living around them, requiring food and clothes, increased enormously.  The country towns began to die, and Dublin, to the amazement of all, began to prosper.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who would not know one end of a cow from the other, and whose native heath is on the cobblestones of Dublin, said it was looking prosperous. He said that the cinemas were full, that the shops were full, and that business was booming.  Of course it was. The cities always boom when the country begins to decline.  I do not know if the Minister has ever read a book called <i>Gone With the Wind.</i> The philosopher in that book says there are two occasions on which one can make a fortune&mdash;one is when a country is growing and another is when it is falling to bits.  We have gentlemen here who are making fortunes, some of the small manufacturers whom the Minister was responsible for bringing into the country.  They are making fortunes that they never dreamed of, and they will go on making them until the collapse comes when they will clear out of the country and blow across the sea like a storm-tossed seagull. What I object to is that when the <Col N="1638" /> birds come home to roost they should roost on my shoulder instead of on the Minister's.  You have that position in the country at the present time.  The people are leaving the country.  I remember that on one occasion the President of the Executive Council reckoned up what was the average loss to this country of an emigrant.  That, of course, was in the days when emigration was considered to be the peculiar sin of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. The President reckoned the loss to the country of each emigrant at £400.  That is a symptom of the national bankruptcy that we warned the Government was in the offing&mdash; the emigration of the young people from the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, however, that the emigrants who went to America&mdash;and I saw them go&mdash;were people who, in comparison, were well off.  They were well clad, well furnished with cash, and they were going to prosperous relatives who were waiting to receive <Col N="1640" /> them.  Not a single one of these people went to America, practically since 1901, who did not go out to an aunt or a cousin or a friend who was waiting to receive them, look after them, and put them into a good job almost as soon as they landed, and the moment that condition of things passed away, emigration to America stopped.  We did not fill the quota that the American Government permitted us to send there.  Our people would not go.  Why would they not go?  They would not go because they knew it was much better to stay at home.  Now an entirely different situation has arisen, because now they realise that they have no means of finding a living at home, and the people who are emigrating now are people who are going with their possessions in handkerchiefs in their hands, and they are going, not to a job, as they went in former times to America, but in the hope of getting a job and, in many cases, with no friends, no relatives, and no guidance awaiting them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I know the people.  They are my own neighbours. I left the station at Ballaghaderreen a few days ago with a whole trainful of them.  I saw them go.  I knew their mothers, their fathers and themselves. I saw a girl of 14½ emigrating to London last week, looking for domestic employment&mdash;14½, a mere child, going to London to look for domestic employment in England.  I know dozens of girls who have gone to England looking for a job.  Now, Sir, that arises directly out of this policy which has destroyed the three-cow man.  All those people, all those boys and girls, are the sons and daughters of three-cow men, of the small farmer.  Now, I shall be perfectly frank.  I do not want to overstate the case at all.  If the Government finds itself in desperate difficulties, the emigration of young fellows does not particularly alarm me.  If the country improves, they will come home again, and it will do no particular harm to an adventurous young fellow of 18, 19, 20 or 21 to go to <Col N="1641" /> England and work there for two or three years.  I went to England and worked there and I went to America and worked there, and I was able to come back at the end of it.  It does no harm to a young fellow to see the world for a bit.  Of course, he should not be forced to emigrate, and it is a pity that economic circumstances should force young men to emigrate, but it does not unduly alarm me if a young man has to take his chance for a while.  As I said, that does not alarm me unduly, but it is alarming, and it is something to which the gravest attention should be given, that there should be this exodus of girls from this country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  Sir, I shall amend the words.  That was not what I meant.  I do not propose to wrangle at all.  I do say, however, that there are consequences to the small farmer, arising out of the Coal-Cattle Pact, which give rise to the greatest possible alarm, and I want to emphasise that there is no analogy at all between the situation of the people in 1937 and the situation of the people in 1927.  What was going on then was purely the result of a search for a higher standard of living than the comparatively high standard of living that then obtained in the country.  What is going on now is a flight from the fear of severe hardship or destitution in this country, <Col N="1642" /> in the hope&mdash;the vain hope in many cases&mdash;of getting work outside the country, and that particularly applies to girls rather than to boys.  All that can be made an end of.  We can turn this country into a country with the highest standard of living in Europe by common sense.  Some people get impatient because they say: &ldquo;Why go on labouring this business about agriculture?&rdquo;  The reason it must be laboured is that social services, civil services, and every other type of expenditure in this country depends for its supply on the surplus produce of the agricultural industry.</P>

They distil barley or grain and they are a great national asset because they are adding something to the value of the produce of the soil which they purchase, but their use of the grain which is grown on Irish soil is merely an instance of the successful and profitable exploitation of the agricultural land, of the arable land, upon which that barley or grain was primarily grown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial income which is derived from industries conducted in this country, behind tariffs, depends for its prosperity on the power of the Irish people to consume their products.  Few, if any, of these highly tariffed industries, the Minister will agree with me, have developed an export trade or can hope to do so.  We must have a purchasing power in the hands of the agricultural community or the industrial community will not be able to earn a wage sufficient to purchase the commodities that that community requires.  We will assume the industrial worker buys some of these products himself, but unless there is a home market for his products he cannot buy anything and cannot therefore support the agricultural worker.  Ultimately, it all comes back to the question of getting for the agricultural producers a ready market for their goods so that they in turn may be able to buy the products of the industrial worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Deputy to set aside in the right lobe of his brain the fact that 5,000,000 acres of land is sufficient to feed all the industrial workers, all the agricultural workers and the entire population of this country.  Unless the remaining 7,000,000 acres of land, seven-twelfths of our natural resources, are properly exploited, where is the demand going to come from for the products of Irish industry?  If there is no demand for the products of Irish industry, where is the income of the industrial worker going to come from?  If there is no income for the industrial worker and no demand for the products of Irish industry, what national income have we?  Do you not see that the whole question of the successful <Col N="1645" /> exploitation of that 7,000,000 acres is bound up with the matters concerned with Order No. 12?  If you will give the people a chance to sell every agricultural product that that land can produce better than any other land in the world, at the preferential price that Britain is prepared to pay at the present time, so as to secure in this country not only the present-day food supply, but a guarantee that in time of war there will be an agricultural industry in this country so sufficient that it can be expended almost indefinitely, to meet the peculiar emergency that will confront the British people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that he is entirely mistaken. She is doing it for her own farmers, and one of the reasons that the cattle trade of this country has been saved from absolute destruction, is the fact that the British Government pay a bounty of £2 10s. per head on fat cattle to their own farmers. Our store feeders are drawing off about 35/- of that bounty into the Irish market.  If we had the tariffs taken off our cattle, and had free access to the British market for our live stock, we would drain as much of that off as we could produce cattle to drain. We could make common cause with the British farmer.  We could make his interest our own on the British market and, acting together we would be in a position, with the British farmer, to guarantee the British Government against the danger of starvation in time of war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of doing that if Britain will pay me for doing it. On the other hand, if Britain says: &ldquo;We do not want your supplies,&rdquo; we have got to come back to the Irish people and tell them: &ldquo;You have got to go down to the peasant standard of living.  You must live on the natural resources that the Lord Almighty gives <Col N="1646" /> you, because you cannot do anything else.  You will have to get down to the peasant standard.&rdquo;  But if we can get profitable markets for our produce, markets by which we can get a higher standard of living for our people than that of any other people in Europe, why should we not do it?  Ministers say we cannot do it because to do it we would have to jettison a sacred principle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss the dairying industry now, because the Chair would not allow me.  The conditions in the dairying industry are not so simple as they seem.  It is not a question of world prices.  We can discuss that matter on the Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture.  It is a very wide question.  I want to confine myself now to Order No. 12, and I ask, if you have negotiated the tariff off horses, why not negotiate the tariff off cattle, sheep and pigs?  If you can do that, you can get an infinitely better financial settlement from Great Britain. You can remove all the obstacles in the way of our trade, and you can build up in this country a splendid life for everybody.  Deputies on the far side may ask: &ldquo;How are you going to do it?&rdquo;  I do not see anything dishonourable or anything dishonest in going to the British Government at the present time and saying to them: &ldquo;The settlement under which you were to receive an annual sum in lieu of local loans outstanding, an annual sum in respect of certain pensions you are paying, and a certain part of the land annuities payable under certain Land Acts, was made at a time when you saw your way to make a similar settlement for the payment of moneys that you owed to the United States of America by annual instalments.  You have found that altered economic conditions make it impossible for you to perform that understanding in its entirety.  You will say, and rightly say, that you admit it is due, that you know it is due, and that you would gladly honour your bond if you were financially able to do so.  You are not, and the United States have admitted that you are not, but they have not declared war on you. <Col N="1647" /> We now say that we believe that the agreement made by our predecessors in office was a bad agreement and an uneconomic agreement.  We know they made it in good faith, but we think it a bad agreement.&rdquo; I think that Fianna Fáil could, consistent with their position, take up that attitude.  They could say: &ldquo;We have been amply vindicated in our view, because the agreement has proved unworkable in principle and in practice.  Though we think these moneys are not due, we recognise that you take up the position, with equal honesty and equal <i>bona fides</i>, that the moneys are due.  Very well.  You want a deal with America; we are prepared to deal on a basis of compromise with you.&rdquo; Does any serious Deputy in this House believe that on that basis a comprehensive settlement could not be made?  Does any Deputy seriously pretend that if we got a settlement of that character it would not be of immense benefit to every man, woman and child in this country?  Does anybody believe that a settlement of that character would not immediately check emigration and restore prosperity all over the countryside? I am convinced it would, and I am sure every Deputy on the far side agrees with me.  All we ask the Government to do is to abandon the contention that they have made before the world that their predecessors in office were traitors, frauds, and men who betrayed their trust to this State. Let them go and admit what they know to be true, and that is that Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues, in making the settlement they made in 1925, acted in the best interests of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what year it was and I do not care either, but the agreement described by the Fianna Fáil Government as a secret agreement, let them now admit was not a secret agreement.  Let them admit it was made by honourable men defending, with the best ability they had, the interests of the people whose interests they undertook to defend. Let them admit everything done in pursuit of that agreement was done <Col N="1648" /><i>bona fide.</i>  I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce now to say that anything was done in pursuit of that agreement and in the process of completing it that in any way reflects on the honour or integrity of any one of the Ministers concerned in the transaction.  Let him criticise the scheme on its merits as much as he likes; let him disown all responsibility for it when he goes to Westminster. All he has to do is to admit its validity, which is unquestionable, undoubted and unavoidable, and to say it has as much practical validity to-day as has the Washington Agreement. Let him say &ldquo;We admit we have been bound by our predecessors in office, but we tell you that our people are not in a position to pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us not wrangle as to how that position came about and what are the reasons why they cannot pay.  It is certainly true to say that to attempt to pay them now would create a very serious difficulty in this country and any idea of going back on the system of payment for the last 60 or 70 years is out of the question.  Let a fair compromise be made now without any sacrifice of principle.  Let an end of cod agreements of this kind be made. Let us join in an effort to build up our country and put an end to the need for futile coal-cattle pacts.  Let us get back again the market which we so foolishly and sillily threw away. Let us get back the whole of that market and let us undertake that we will not deliver anything to Great Britain that Great Britain is not prepared to pay us a good price for.  If she is prepared to deal with us, then we are prepared to deal with her and in the long run we will find that such an arrangement will be for the ultimate benefit not only of Ireland but Great Britain as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the concession with regard to horses, I must protest that the agreement has not gone far enough.  I would like to remind the Government that at the 1933 election they promised the people that if they got a majority over all other Parties they would settle the economic war.  They then realised the hardship it was imposing on the <Col N="1649" /> people.  They said &ldquo;Give us a majority over all Parties and England will be jumping to settle with us.&rdquo; What has been the position since? England has been getting her pound of flesh, and there is no denying that. The President has admitted that we have been paying the land annuities, and in a more painful way than ever we paid them before.  That is quite true.  I have met small farmers who said it would be a good thing for themselves if they were asked to pay five or six times the amount of the annuities rather than be deprived of their markets.</P>
      <P>In order to bring this home to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has not as much experience of agriculture as many Deputies here, I would like to point out to him the effect of the tariff imposed on our cattle going into Britain.  If at a fair in a country village or town there were 100 cattle exposed for sale, two and three years old, the tax per head on those animals going into England would be £4 5s.  For the one fair that would mean £425 and for 12 fairs it would mean £5,000.  Take a fair where there would be 200 cattle.  It would mean for the one fair a sum of £850 and for 12 fairs, £10,200.  If there were 300 cattle at the fair it would mean a total tax of £1,275 and for 12 fairs that would represent £15,300.  If there were 400 cattle at a fair it would mean £1,700 and at 12 fairs it would mean £20,400.  Suppose there were 500 cattle at a fair, it would mean a total tax of £2,125 and that would represent for 12 fairs £25,000.</P>
      <P>I would like to impress on the Government the seriousness of the situation, the seriousness of depriving the people of their purchasing power. If the people were in receipt of those moneys I have indicated, they would be in a better position to provide food and clothing for their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly they would. Is it not a fact that they have to pay £4 5s. on every beast going into England?  You are up against definite facts there.  When the tariff was put <Col N="1650" /> on coal, Deputy Moore and the Minister for Agriculture tried to persuade us that the English people were paying the tariff on the coal.  Everybody here has had experience of that tariff and the Irish people know well who had to pay the tax when it was in operation.  The people have not even got the benefit of the reduction. Last night Deputy Moore declared that some banking institutions had expressed the opinion that there was an upward trend in prices for some time past.  I quite agree, because at one time two and three-year-old cattle in Kerry and West Cork were sold at £1 5s. and £1 10s. each, and the price has certainly improved since then.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Government should take their courage in their hands and settle this question once and for all.  We hear about the economic war between this country and England but, as a matter of fact, there is no economic war.  The Fianna Fáil Party have settled the economic war because they have agreed to give England what she demanded.  They have made arrangements to supply England with so many cattle on condition that we are supplied with so much coal.  The English have a monopoly of our coal supplies and hundreds of their miners have been put to work in consequence.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the banking institutions and the way in which they made reference to improvements in this country, Deputy Moore said there should be some expert evidence given to show the real position of agriculture here.  I told Deputy Moore I had a document here from the farmers of Ballyvourney, practically all small-holders, relating to a meeting held there recently.  I was not at the meeting, but I have it on good authority that the majority of those present were people who supported the Government Party at the last election.  For the information of Deputy Moore I shall read a copy of a document sent to the Minister for Agriculture recently from this meeting in Ballyvourney:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This document was sent about a month ago to the Minister for Agriculture, but so far he has done nothing more than to acknowledge it.  If Deputy Moore will get that translated, I am sure that he will be satisfied that the people who were present at that meeting and who were responsible for the sending of that statement are at least authorities on agriculture.  On <Col N="1654" /> more than one occasion I appealed to the Government to set up a commission to inquire into the real position. Within the last fortnight I appealed to the President in this House to have this document considered and to send down a representative to report on the situation in that district.</P>
    <P>In the past we have had members of the Government talking a good deal about the 1/- taken off the old age pensioners some years ago.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that within the last fortnight there were 40,000 small farmers signing on for unemployment assistance.  Is there not some reason why these people are seeking unemployment assistance?  The Government are now setting up a commission to inquire into their own allowances.  At one time they were satisfied that they could live on £1,000 a year.  Now evidently, after further experience, they are satisfied that there is nothing to shout about in that.  As they are setting up such a commission, I appeal to them to set up a commission to inquire into the position of those unfortunate people who are being placed in this position by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This new Coal-Cattle Pact has been a great disappointment to farmers.  Indeed, I might say that the disappointment which it has caused has been very considerable indeed. As a farmer going amongst the people every day, I have reason to know that. I know the way in which the people were anxiously waiting for the result of the negotiations, and I know that the Government have cost the country thousands of pounds owing to the delay in announcing the terms of the Coal-Cattle Pact, because people had to feed cattle for a longer period than last year and the cost of feeding stuffs has gone up.  The result is that all these cattle are left on their hands, and they are nothing better off after the extra feeding which they had to give to the cattle.  The pact has certainly given relief to the horse-breeding industry. As a horse-breeder I must say that I felt great relief and a great load taken off my shoulders when the duties were removed from horses, because I know that I am now free to bring them over <Col N="1655" /> to England, or that Englishmen need not be afraid to come over here to buy them.  Heretofore men in England who bought horses could not come over here to do so and had to act through a recognised auctioneer.  If they did not do their business in that way, but came over and bought horses and gave a cheque, when the horses were sent forward the customs authorities would not accept their statement. As a result these buyers did not know what to give for horses.  Now that the duties on horses are gone, we will have Englishmen coming over to buy.  As a matter of fact, they have come within the last fortnight to two neighbours of mine, who got £300 for two-year-old colts that they could not sell three weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cattle trade, I beg of the Government to look at the position in the country and at the poverty of the farmers.  At least 600 cattle were loaded and shipped from Mullingar every month.  The average tax on these cattle would be £3 a head, representing £1,800 every month collected at Mullingar fair.  That is only one fair in County Westmeath. There would be a couple of hundred cattle shipped from Castlepollard, about 500 from Moate, and also 500 from Athlone every month on which tax would have to be paid.  That amount of money is leaving the county every month, along with what is leaving other stations in the county every day.  Take my own case to-day. I sold ten heifers for ten guineas each. If there was no tariff on them I would have got £42 10s. 0d. more for these animals.  They cost the Welshman who bought them £18 15s. 0d. before they left the ring, but all I got for them was 10 guineas a head.  If the tariff was not there I would have got £18 15s. 0d. a head.  My half-year's annuity amounts to £50, and it would be nearly paid if I got that price for my cattle.  The Government should think of these things, because at present the farmers are being slowly but surely robbed.  There is no use denying the fact but that the farmers are broke, and the smaller they are the worse is their position.  I have some chance of carrying on, as when <Col N="1656" /> I get 10 guineas for an animal I can go and buy other stock at £7.  What about the poor man who sells young cattle to me at £7 a head?  If he buys a weanling he has to pay £5 or £6 for it.  Because it has no teeth he has to face the competition of English buyers for such stock.  I ask the Government seriously to do something for the cattle trade.  If they do not settle the economic war they should give a bounty on cattle in order to recompense the farmers.  Otherwise they should not collect the annuities, because the farmers are paying the annuities three times over.  I only sold ten cattle to-day, but if I got the full value for them it would nearly pay my half-year's rent.  How many times have I paid my annuities on the cattle that I turn over in the year?  I know more about cattle and about the farmers of Ireland than any Deputy in this House.  I sell and buy more cattle than any other Deputy.  I challenge contradiction of that statement.  I know that the farmers of Ireland are broken, because they are head over heels in debt, and the smaller they are the worse off are they.  I had a letter recently from a farmer who has three yearlings to sell every year and no other income, craving me to try to get a job for his daughter, as he said that he had nothing else coming into his farm except from two cows.  Last year he said that he could make a little bit on butter, but now inspectors went round looking into the baskets when his daughter went into Mullingar to see if she had any butter for sale. I beg the Government to think seriously about the position of the farmers and to note the report of a meeting of cattle traders that was held in Dublin recently.</P>
    <P>In connection with the issuing of licences, I wish the Minister for Industry and Commerce would call the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to this question.  Last year the quota for fat cattle was not nearly filled.  This year the farmers are not applying for any licences.  I suggest that licences should be given out at the boat or at the ports, because we have not enough fat catle for all the licences that are available.  The farmers will not give 1/6 for the <Col N="1657" /> licences.  They did so in December and January, but some of them could not be used.  The position would be made easier for everyone concerned in the cattle trade, and there would be less loss caused to the Government, if the licences were available at the ports, where they could be got easily and without expense.  I ask the Minister to urge the Minister for Agriculture to do something in the way of giving a bounty on cattle. Otherwise something serious will happen to the cattle trade.  At present the country is on the verge of a beef shortage.  People from Galway and Mullingar and other places are coming to Dublin to buy beef.  What is the reason for that?  Because people are getting out of making beef.  The Government will have to give a bounty to people here to feed beef.  It is being done in England.  From the way things are going at present it looks as if there will be no beef for sale by June.  The people have got out of feeding beef, and something should be done to encourage them to continue feeding beef in the winter months.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt about the sincerity of the Deputy who has just spoken, and about his anxiety for farmers, but I claim to be equally anxious about their position.  We seem to approach the matter from different angles.  The Deputy forgets that the Government has a responsibility to the people, and that at two general elections and at one local election, they approved of the line of action that has been taken.  The country is now faced with another general election, and knowing the feelings of the people I have no doubt what the result will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want either of these settlements.  What did the Government ask the British Government to do in connection with the economic war?  They asked that Ireland should be allowed to plead her case before an international tribunal but England refused to agree.  Are we to agree to have the matter decided as the Feetham Commission decided the Boundary question, while our representative sat there until partition was signed, sealed and delivered? To-day, some of the people who were the means of putting that commission there are charging us in this House with not declaring a republic for the whole of Ireland.  The very people who put the Boundary there are asking us to do that.  We heard Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Fagan counting up what the farmers are losing, and giving from their angle what the farmer losses are.  Let us take the case of a farmer who bought out his land under the Land Act; who has roughly 30 acres of land; whose rent would be roughly £26, and whose valuation would be about £28.  I think that is a typical case.  That farmer will be doing well in mixed farming if he keeps six cows.  He will be equally lucky and doing well every year if he sells five yearling heifers.  On those five cattle he pays £1 15s. a head, and his rent of £26 has been reduced by £13.</P>

      <P>To start off with, that man has a profit through the halving of the annuity.  Of course, the people opposite, when the last election was about to be won, said: &ldquo;If you put us in we will halve the annuities,&rdquo; but the people ridiculed the idea of it because they had the Feetham Commission before them.  Where was the money going to come from except by keeping the annuities here?  Will it be denied in this House that the Opposition asked time for payment of £250,000, and were refused?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>We came into office and that money is kept here to-day. What is it used for?  I said at the start of this speech that the farmers are not as well off as I should like to see them.  The Government realised that; they halved the annuities. Every man with a valuation of £25 got a free grant of £40.  They have derated up to £20, and they have given an allowance on everything over £20.  The argument of the Opposition seems to be that if we could get the whole country into cattle the country would be saved.  I should like to ask Deputies opposite if there is a big European war within the next year what provision for food is going to be made in this country? Is it a cattle ranch we want?  In case of a world war, the John Bradburys for cattle will not feed our population. In the case of that war breaking out to-morrow, it would be the duty of the Government to meet immediately and see what food was available for the people of this country.  How does the Opposition think they would act in similar circumstances?  The Government, having fought two Dáil elections and one local government election would be unfair to the people who sent them here if there was to be any surrender, more particularly if it was on the lines which I say are enshrined in those two first questions to-day.  If we are going to have a <Col N="1660" /> settlement we must have it on the basis of pound for pound.  We are not going to hand over to any commission set up by England the right to say what this country will have to pay, or what they must take from England.  If the settlement is not on an equal basis we will fight the matter out in the way we are doing.  That is the wish of the Irish people, and unless they decide otherwise at the election, I say that there is no inclination to surrender on the part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious that the Minister has forgotten some of those promises himself, as was evident from listening to his speech yesterday on another subject.  Talking about emigration, he threw up his hands in despair, saying that there is no solution for the problem of emigration, forgetting the promises that he himself made on the subject of emigration when on the Opposition Benches, and even prior to the <Col N="1661" /> last general election when he had had the responsibilities of government thrust on his shoulders.  It is certainly amusing to hear members of the Fianna Fáil Party now trying to recant every one of those pre-general election promises.  Deputy Victory talked about the farmers being in as good a position to pay their annuities to-day and meet their debts as they were at the time when the last Government was in office.</P>

      <P>I have a return here which I am sure will be very interesting to the Deputy, a return furnished to members of the Dáil only yesterday by the Minister for Finance himself.  We know perfectly well that the British collect the full amount of the annuities.  That is perfectly clear from returns issued by the British Treasury.  They collect every penny.  The farmers of this country are paying their annuities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the loans as well, as Deputy Bennett has reminded me. In addition to that, what do we find? From a reply given by the Minister for Finance yesterday to a question by Deputy O'Leary, we find that since August, 1932, the farmers, by way of annuities and revised annuities, have paid into the Exchequer of this State the sum of approximately £11,000,000. Mark you, they have paid their full annuities to England.  They have paid the full amount of the withheld moneys which gave rise to this dispute, and in addition they have paid into the Treasury of this State the sum of approximately £11,000,000&mdash;to be more accurate, £10,800,000 odd&mdash;according to the reply given by the Minister for Finance.  Yet, according to Deputy Victory, after paying the sum of £11,000,000, in addition to the annuities and to the other withheld moneys, the farmers are better off to-day than they were during the lifetime of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not remember hearing the Minister's explanation of this Bill.  I <Col N="1662" /> do not know whether he condescended to offer us any more information on the subject of the recent pact than the Minister for Agriculture gave us a few nights ago in the Dáil.  In any event, it would be interesting to have some explanation from some Minister as to what the latest Sugar-Horse Pact does really mean.  What really are its terms? What are the full benefits which the farmers of this country will gain by the conclusion of this particular pact? We heard a great deal during the last few weeks, especially at the crossroads and occasionally in this Dáil, about freedom and national advance, and so on.  Surely to goodness the Minister is not prepared to state here in the Dáil to-day that we were improving our national position by the conclusion of the latest Sugar-Horse Pact? The late Arthur Griffith said on very many occasions that political freedom was valueless unless we had fiscal and economic freedom as well.</P>
    <P>We did secure fiscal and economic freedom under the Treaty, but, with the conclusion of every one of these Coal-Cattle Pacts, and the latest Sugar-Horse Pact, we are sacrificing the fiscal and economic freedom we secured under the Treaty.  With every successive Coal-Cattle and Sugar-Horse Pact&mdash;and I do not know what the name of the next pact will be&mdash;we are surrendering in ever greater degree all that fiscal and economic freedom we secured under the Treaty, and to-day we are reduced to this humiliating position, that the number of cattle we can send into the British market is to be determined by the amount of coal which the people of this country can purchase from Great Britain at a price to be fixed by Great Britain.  That is the position, and, surely, it is a humiliating position.  Yet, we have the President telling us that if we effect a settlement, we are surrendering. Surely, when we negotiated the first Coal-Cattle Pact, we surrendered our initiative in the matter.  We have placed ourselves in the humiliating position since that we have to accept whatever terms the British are prepared to offer us, and it is perfectly obvious, from the conclusion of the latest Sugar-Horse Pact, that the British <Col N="1663" /> Treasury officials who are responsible for negotiating these trade agreements will insist on getting every penny piece of the withheld moneys due to them by this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Victory talks about the general prosperity of the country being on the same level as it was in 1931 when the present Government assumed responsibility.  The Minister has only to look up the returns of his own Department to know that the internal consumption of agricultural products in this country itself has declined as compared with 1926.  In 1926-27, there was approximately £23,000,000 worth of agricultural produce consumed in this country, and for the financial year 1934-1935, the last year for which returns are available, the figure was £16,500,000 or, if the Minister likes, I will say £17,000,000, which shows that, notwithstanding the much-boosted self-sufficiency policy of the Government, the consumption of agricultural produce in this country is declining, and the alternative markets which the Minister and other members of the Government were to find for the people to compensate them for the loss of the British market have vanished. We hear no more about alternative markets now and yet, notwithstanding all the evidence there is on every side that the wealth of the agricultural community is diminishing, that the standard of prosperity amongst farmers is steadily going down and that many farmers at present are in really very straitened circumstances, the Government still persists in pursuing this policy which is so detrimental to the country as a whole and, according to the last statement of the President, no effort whatever is going to be made to bring about a settlement.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time that the members of the Government showed some appreciation of the hardship which is being inflicted on the people to-day, some appreciation of their own responsibilities and some appreciation also of what the future of this country requires, if we are to exist normally or attain the same standard of prosperity as the peoples of other countries.  Surely it is time the <Col N="1664" /> Government showed some responsibility and made an effort to negotiate some settlement that will be satisfactory to the people of this country.  I do imagine that if the members of the Government dropped all this nonsense which we hear so frequently from the Government Benches, and especially from platforms down the country, and if they set seriously to effect a settlement of this problem, they could negotiate a settlement that would be satisfactory, not alone to the Government, but to the people and that would be the means of saving the agricultural industry in this country.  In the absence of such settlement, I fail to see how the agricultural industry can survive on any sort of a satisfactory basis for many years longer.</P>

      <P>I am sure the renewal of the Coal-Cattle Pact has come as a disappointment to the farmers.  They expected some concessions and they expected that a little would be taken off the British tariffs.  We have backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party making speeches in which they say they are not going to surrender.  The President says he is not going to surrender.  There is no surrendering about it at all and if the farmers who have to carry the entire burden are not going to surrender, I think it only fair that they should get a bounty equal to the British tariffs.  The people have to carry the burden on their backs and, up to now, they have carried it very patiently, but they have almost exhausted any money they had from the old days and, as the House is aware, they will get no credit from the banks.  The President says it would be madness on the part of the Government to surrender and that he is asking the farmers to pay only half the annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When members of the Fianna Fáil Party were seeking power, I heard it stated from every platform, &ldquo;We will have alternative markets,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We really believe we do not owe Britain the annuities or the other £2,000,000.&rdquo; There is no one would be better pleased than I if we could get out of paying Britain anything.  I do not want to pay anything to Britain, but where are the alternative markets?  The British <Col N="1665" /> Treasury told you last year that the one bright spot for them was the Free State.  They wanted to collect £5,000,000 from the Free State farmer in respect of annuities and £2,000,000 for which he had no responsibility, and they collected £5,500,000.  Now the Government say they will not collect half the annuities, and that that is £2,000,000.  That is not half the annuities, and what the Government are collecting is a land tax and not annuities at all.  If they got the alternative markets, it would be up to the British to do what our Government did with the hard-pressed farmers, that is, to seize their stock and furniture. Those alternative markets, however, were not on the map of the world. There are no alternative markets.  You would have no Continental buyers coming in here if it was not for the British tariffs.  I know a little about the Continent.  I have sent stock to the Continent, but what class of stock was it?  Cast horses, and they would not be buying our beef only for the British tariffs.  If there was a settlement to-morrow, we would see no Continental buyers in this country.</P>
    <P>It was rather laughable in Wexford town last Saturday to see people giving 2/- a lb. for farmers' hand-made butter, while our Government supplied the British consumer with Free State creamery butter at 11d.  We are so fond of the enemy that we butter his bread on both sides.  It is time the Government woke up.  They say they have been elected twice, but if they were, they got in on false promises.  They told the people all the things they would do except the way they are persecuting the people at present.  It is nearly time that Fianna Fáil back benchers began to talk as farmers. Two or three of them have spoken and they say that the people are satisfied with their policy.  I tell you that they are not satisfied.  They have swallowed the sugar-coated pill in the past, but they are not going to swallow it for ever.  We had Deputy O'Reilly here last Thursday shedding crocodile tears for the British farmers because they were so badly off.  The Government there is giving them 5/- a cwt. live-weight as a bounty on home fed cattle <Col N="1666" /> and they are not satisfied.  They want 10/-, and, through the policy of this Government and the policy of the British Government, the farmer here is taxed £4 5s. a head on two-year-old cattle.  That means that the British farmer is getting £7 a head more than the Irish farmer for his cattle.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Government realise where they are the better.  This country will be no good to anybody if agriculture, the staple industry, is killed.  If that becomes bankrupt, the State becomes bankrupt.  I admire the Minister for Industry and Commerce as an energetic Minister who is doing all in his power to start new industries. I will help him every way I can, but I must tell him that you cannot build up new industries in a bankrupt country. There must be money to buy the products of these new industries.  Is it not deplorable to see agricultural labourers in County Wexford going home to their wives with 10/&mdash;and they are not all getting that?  How far will that go when they go to a country shop to buy the necessaries of life?  It would not support a man, his wife, and three children for two days.  The condition of the country, and especially the agricultural part of the community, is very far from being right.  The sooner the Government realise that fact the better.</P>
    <P>We heard some talk here recently about increasing Ministers' salaries.  It is all very fine to talk about increasing the salaries of Ministers.  Those Ministers, when seeking power five years ago, told the electors that £1,000 a year was enough for any man.  Now, after five years in office, they tell us that a Minister could not get on all right on less than £1,700 a year, and they make that statement in view of the fact that a very large proportion of the people down the country have not £1 a week on which to live.</P>
    <P>The agricultural people want the economic war settled and the sooner this House awakes to that fact the better it will be for the country.  That settlement need not be a surrender. Before attaining office the members of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party generally were very confident <Col N="1667" /> in their assertions about the existence of alternative markets.  Now they find that they have no alternatives to the British market.  There is one and only one market for Irish agricultural produce, and that is the British market.  The Irish farmer has been deprived of that market.  How in face of the farmer being deprived of his market can he give his workers or his own family a decent living? I tell the Government that there are in the Free State to-day many working farmers who are not only badly off, but hungry.  While that is the actual state of things, we have Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers telling us that the condition of the people is improving and that agriculture is improving.</P>
    <P>I am aware that farmers in the County Wexford are selling their fat cattle at 23/- to 24/- a cwt.  Anyone who knows the cost of foodstuffs will tell you that it would be better for such farmers they never saw these cattle.  No man can make a living by producing fat cattle at 23/- to 24/- a cwt.  We all know how much the prices of foodstuffs have gone up and in that state of things it is utterly impossible for a County Wexford farmer to live by fattening cattle and selling them at 23/- a cwt, especially when stores are being sold at 32/- to 33/- a cwt.  Let Deputies ask themselves how long that state of things can continue.  Prior to the 1932 General Election the people were told on every dead wall and cement wall in the country, &ldquo;burn everything that comes from England but English coal.&rdquo; The Government have on their lips the cry of &ldquo;no surrender.&rdquo; But what has really happened?  While we were listening to all this cry of &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;boycott of English goods,&rdquo; the Government entered into a pact under which we could burn no coal but British coal. The British can charge anything they like for that coal.  There is no competition now in the matter of coal. Surely that is a ridiculous state of things.  Is it not time for the people to wake up and make up their minds what they are to do?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> Another matter that is causing great loss to the farmers at present is this question of the distribution of fat cattle licences.  These licences are sent to the county councils in the Free State.  In many places the farmers are not applying for them and the licences are lying dead in the offices of the county councils.  In the Dublin Cattle Market, dealers buy one, two or three cattle off farmers, but because they have no licences they are unable to complete the sale. Last week I introduced a deputation to the Minister for Agriculture on this matter.  I must say the Minister met us fairly and tried to do all in his power to help us.  But that is little good to us.  I saw one dealer who bought 350 fat cattle in the Dublin market.  There were licences available for only 100.  That meant that 250 fat cattle were kept hanging around the Dublin lairages waiting for export licences.  Is not all that to the prejudice of the farmers?  All this loss comes out of his pocket.  If these men had their licences on Thursday night they could have shipped their cattle.  That meant that the cattle would be slaughtered before Sunday and the farmers would be saved the cost and delay of having the cattle on their hands and perhaps great deterioration in the condition of the cattle.  Considerable sums of money are lost to the farmers in this way; everything the Government are doing in this matter of exports of live stock and agricultural produce they are doing wrongly.  Surely it is time for the people to open their eyes and to ask themselves how long can this state of muddle hold.  We heard a great deal of talk some time ago about wheat growing being a source of great wealth.  Being a farmer myself, I know that is not so.</P>

      <P>I suppose anything I say does not arise.  I suppose if I am not quite up to the point I will have to go out; therefore, I bow to your ruling.  I appeal to the Government and the President not to be up in the air as they are and not to go on telling the people that any settlement of the economic war would be a surrender. It must be settled sometime for it cannot go on for ever.  There is no country in the world that is in the same position and has the same advantages for the supplying of store cattle to Great Britain as Ireland has.  As long as the British Government is giving the farmer there a bounty of 5s. a cwt. on home fattened cattle there is an excellent market there for our stores.  According to Deputy O'Reilly the British farmer wanted a bounty of 10s. but the more he gets in the way of bounty the better it would be for the Free State farmer. Again I say to the Government that the sooner they settle the economic war the better it will be for themselves and for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Coal-Cattle Pact was first agreed upon, more than a couple of years ago, we all looked on it with relief, for we all hoped it was the beginning of the end of the nonsense that had been going on, the end of the so-called economic war.  But once that Coal-Cattle Pact was signed there was an end of the economic war for that was a complete surrender by our Government on that issue.  The signing of the Coal-Cattle Pact by our Government was simply an abandonment of the only weapon that this country could use against its supposed enemy.  That weapon was its refusal to buy British coal.  The signing, therefore, of that pact meant that we had surrendered the only weapon with which we could strike back.  It is strange, in the face of that, to find the President standing up here and making the statement that any compromise now on this economic war <Col N="1670" /> would be a surrender.  I confess I cannot understand that attitude.  The British, by that pact, were given a monopoly in the supply of coal to this country.  I do not know that that was altogether a surrender.  It was a sensible agreement when better terms could not be got.  There was no question of surrender because there was nothing to surrender.  If two combatants are engaged in a fight and if one lays down his arms while the other fires away any reasonable person would conclude that the one who laid down his arms had surrendered.  By continuing in the fighting line he was only making himself a target for the other fellow.  In this matter of the economic war and its settlement the word &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; should not be used. I think the time has come when the people are beginning to understand the meaning of these things.  I think those phrases about surrender used by the President are nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I believe that the Coal-Cattle Pact was a relief to the agricultural community and the Sugar-Cattle Pact was a relief also to a certain extent.  Now if these were good things would it not be much better to have the whole question settled?  This country would be surrendering nothing by a settlement.  Surely it would surrender less by making a good settlement than by laying down its arms and allowing the other fellow to fire away.  That is what has happened up to now.  At the time the Horse Sugar Pact was signed, I happened to read some comments in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It seems that that paper went to great trouble to get the opinions of different people throughout the country.  I was very much surprised to learn what a boon and a blessing it was to the people of this country.  I understand that the total relief in respect of horses was about £40,000. Although that £40,000 was taken off horses, it was put on other things. The whole of the money is still being collected.  Not one penny was taken off the tariffs.  The parmers are paying it all the time.  If the pact meant anything, it meant that the more prosperous farmers were relieved and that the small farmers who rear pigs and <Col N="1671" /> cattle had to carry the whole burden. There was undoubtedly, relief in respect of horses, but that only went to the men who had horses to sell.  It increased the burden on the farmers in the county I represent.  That is why I do not consider it any boon.  The reason why we welcomed the Coal-Cattle Pact at the start was that we hoped it was the beginning of the end and that it was an indication of a return to common sense on the part of the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The President was recently asked to state his attitude to the imperial conference which is shortly to be held. There will be a good opportunity to make a decent settlement at that conference. His answer to that question means that he is not going to make a trade settlement with Great Britain until Britain compels the Six Counties to come into a thirty-two county republic.  Until Britain does that, there will be no settlement.  Is not that what the President's answer amounts to?  On another occasion he told us that he never expected to see that republic, but that he hoped to lay the foundation in his lifetime.  What is called the &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; is, therefore, to go on for the President's lifetime.  I hope the President will enjoy a long life, but I hope he will not have the right to say whether or not this conflict is to continue during his lifetime.  That is the only conclusion that we can come to from the attitude of the President and of the Fianna Fáil Party on this question.  A few minutes ago Deputy Victory used the old argument, which has been used a hundred times to answer every question raised in this House&mdash;that Fianna Fáil had won two elections, the election in 1932 and the election in 1933.  He did not tell us that they won the two by-elections in Galway and Wexford. They did win these elections, but they won them by false promises.</P>

      <P>The people were told that they were to get a good settlement.  Did not the President go over and tell them in Galway at the by-election to give them &ldquo;the last <Col N="1672" /> year&rdquo; so as to make a good settlement? They were to reap the fruit of the five years' work in that year.  Did the Vice-President not tell them that negotiations were actually pending and that a good settlement was in the offing?  Was it not on these promises the by-elections were won?  Did the President or Vice-President or Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister tell the people that what they were to get was a Coal-Cattle Pact or a Horse-Sugar pact? Was it on promises like that they won the election?  There was no talk then about the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; policy. They knew what would win the election. They knew that by promising a good settlement they were going to win.  The people are not going to be taken in by that promise again.  On the next occasion they will want to get something new.  Perhaps the new Constitution will serve, but I am afraid the other game is played out.  They have got five years and they have not got a settlement.  A few months still remain, and I hope that in these few months they will redeem their promises and relieve the position of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the people on the land is indicated by the flight to the towns and to the slums, not alone of this country, but of England, where these people have to take up work that would only be accepted by the most needy.  On this question of emigration, the Minister yesterday compared the figures of the present time with those for the 1920's.  There is no comparison.  The conditions that tempted the people to go from this country ten years ago are very different from the conditions obtaining across the water, where our people are going, at the present time.  These people are anxious to get off the land because the Fianna Fáil Government have reduced them to a condition of impoverishment. The Minister for Agriculture told us that in 1926 the farmer was getting £94 and the agricultural labourer £66 per annum for their work.  In 1934 the Fianna Fáil Government had reduced the income of the farmer to £51 and the income of the farm labourer to £55.  That is the answer to Deputy Victory which was supplied by the Minister for Agriculture himself to this <Col N="1673" /> House.  There is no necessity for anybody on this side to make that case, because it has been made by the Minister for Agriculture.  No matter how the Minister for Industry and Commerce may try to misrepresent the position, these figures prove that the condition of the agricultural community is very much worse than it was four or five years ago.  Anybody who looks at the value of our exports for 1931-2, and compares them with our exports at the present time, will see what the country has gained from this Government.  He will see that the value of our exports has been reduced by half, while the consumer has to pay more.  It is little wonder that the numbers of those who are being relieved by means of home help and dole are increasing and that the people are getting sick of it all and are fleeing from the country in the hope of getting a job somewhere. Deputy Victory told us that the farmers were only paying £1 15s. 0d. per beast as a result of this economic war, and that they had gained by the reduction in the annuities.  The Deputy did not tell us about the £5,000,000 which is in dispute between this country and Great Britain.  Does anybody on that side of the House deny that Great Britain is collecting all the money she claims and a little bit in addition?  Does the Minister for Agriculture deny that?  That sum of £5,000,000 is about £2,000,000 more than the whole of the annuities.  Does the Minister deny that we are also paying tariffs to Germany and Belgium on whatever stock they buy, because they are buying at even worse prices than those obtainable under the British tariffs?  Not only are we paying these £5,000,000 odd to Great Britain, but we are paying on our exports to the countries that purchase the remainder of our produce.  We never owed those countries anything, and yet we have to pay them, so that our farmers are paying very much more than £5,000,000. In the payments that they are making to Britain, Germany, Belgium and Spain they are paying more than double the amount of the annuities on their exports, and in addition they are paying half the amount of the old annuity to our own <Col N="1674" /> Government.  If the farmers are as prosperous as we are told they are, why is it that the sheriff has such a busy time and that the rates have had to be increased by about 2/- in the £ in most counties?  In some counties the increase in the rates has been greater, because the farmers are not able to pay their annuities.</P>

Let them make a good settlement and redeem their promises. I hope that, if the Government avail of this opportunity to make a settlement, and if they send over representatives for that purpose, that when a settlement is made, the President will accept it, thereby redeeming the promises that he and his Government have made.</P>

      <P>It would be idle to deny that the remission of the duty on horses, which we are dealing with in this Bill, did not give a certain amount of satisfaction to a great number of farmers.  It is also true to say that a great deal of disappointment is felt at the fact that the pact does not go further, and provide for a remission of the duties on cattle, which affect the bulk of the farmers of the country. The sum of money involved in connection with the horse duties is not very large.  The great thing which the pact achieves is the freedom to trade.  If satisfaction is felt at the remission of the duties on horses, the Government should realise the measure of satisfaction that would be felt if steps had been taken by them to secure a remission of the major duties on cattle and farm produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an interesting speech from <Col N="1675" /> Deputy Victory.  He is the first Fianna Fáil member that I have heard make a candid admission that the farmers of the country are not better off now than they were under the previous Government. That was interesting, because when we have stressed the poverty of the agricultural community, we have usually been met with the argument from the opposite side that the farmers are better off now than ever before. Deputy Victory does not share that view, so that the conversion of even one member of the Government Party to a realisation of what is the true position in the country, is all to the good.  There has been a good deal of argument on this particular pact, as to whether it is a good bargain or not. It can be said, however, that since the dispute with Great Britain started, the farmers have got the worst end of the bargain.  The original sum in dispute was about £4,000,000.  It was alleged that we owed that sum, but whether we did or not, as a result of the policy pursued by the Government during the last four years, the position arising out of the dispute is this: up to the spring of this year the British have collected from us the sum of £17,200,000; they estimate to collect £4,800,000 during the year, making a total of £22,000,000. According to a statement issued yesterday by the Department of Finance, a sum of about £11,000,000 has been collected directly off the tenant farmers of this country during the same period. That gives a gross total of £33,000,000 collected in the four years since the dispute started.  That is the sum that has been collected directly off the farmers.  The original sum in dispute was £4,000,000, so that if the farmers had continued to pay it over the last four years, they would have paid a total sum of £16,000,000, as against this £33,000,000.  Indirectly they have paid a far greater sum than £33,000,000.  For instance, the farmers ship 40, 50 or 60 per cent. of the cattle that they produce, and on these their losses during the last four years have amounted to £16,000,000 or £17,000,000.  They have certainly lost a considerable sum also on the cattle sold at home, whether on the local fairs or to the factories in <Col N="1676" /> Roscrea and Waterford.  Those cattle were sold at a figure much under the price that they would have realised if trading were carried on under normal conditions.  Therefore, more millions have to be added to the £33,000,000 before one can arrive at the total losses that the farmers of this country have sustained since this dispute started.  In addition to all that, it became necessary for us to meet the British attempt to coerce us into paying to them the amount in dispute.  Resort had to be had to the passing of resolutions, Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders, and other legislative enactments. A considerable sum of money was collected from the people of this State in that particular manner.  Then there were bounties and subsidies and other aids in order to try to carry the people over what was supposed to be a war&mdash;which really ought never to have been called a war, because it was not a war&mdash;but what the number of millions that were incidentally spent on the whole thing besides, added to the direct contribution of £33,000,000, would eventually amount to, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The state of the farmers, collectively, at the present time, is that they are at least £20,000,000 to £30,000,000 worse off than they would have been if there had been no interference. These figures are rather illustrative if they are correct, and they must be correct since they are taken from official figures.  For a sum of £4,000,000 we paid the sum of £33,000,000.  If we paid nothing except what we have paid directly, it means that the farmers have paid, in four years, eight years' purchase of the original sum in dispute. When the farmers were bargaining with the old landlords, some of them paid 17 and 18 years' purchase for their lands, and they bought their lands out from the landlords.  If we continue to go on in the manner in which we are going on, it will mean that the farmers will be able to say in a few years more that they have redeemed their land from the State and that the least that should be done for them is that they should have the land free for ever because they have already paid eight years' purchase, <Col N="1677" /> and that means that in a few years more the land ought certainly to belong to the farmers.  The whole thing is rather Gilbertian, and one does not see any possible reason why there should not be a similar approach to a final settlement as there was to the settlement with which we are immediately concerned now.  Nobody is accusing the Ministry of surrender because they made a settlement in the matter of sugar <i>versus</i> horses.  I certainly should be the last to say the Ministry surrendered because they made that pact.  Perhaps, if we were to examine more closely into the matter, it might be found that the figures might be a little against us and in favour of the other side to the pact, or <i>vice versa</i>, but in any case nobody has accused, or is going to accuse, the Ministry of surrender because they made that pact, nor will anybody accuse them of surrender if they make a similar pact in relation to the other items of agriculture in dispute.</P>
    <P>If they can start the cattle industry and the butter industry and other things going on the same terms as they have settled the question of horses and sugar at the moment, nobody is going to accuse them of surrender.  It would only mean that there would be rather a magnified expression of the satisfaction that has been everywhere expressed at the settlement that has been come to within the last week or ten days.  That expression of satisfaction would be magnified many times over.  Even if they were to make a settlement now, between this and the election&mdash;and I make a present of it to the Government themselves&mdash;I, for one, believe that if even now, within the next few months, the Government were to take their courage in their hands and settle this dispute, they would be presenting a greater programme in their favour to the farmers and the industrialists and every other section of this community than any other programme they could put forward, and I, for one, would wish them luck in it.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure that I would not.  Now, there was a lot of trash talked here and a lot of red herrings drawn across the track. Deputy Victory, speaking of the Government's policy, said that if they had not acted as they did in regard to agriculture, the people of this country would all starve if there were a war in this country.  We have not altogether such short memories as Deputy Victory seems to think.  There was a great war all over Europe 20 years ago, and we did not starve.  As a matter of fact, we were the best-fed people in Europe.  We were the very best-fed people in Europe during that war.  We laughed and grew fat when all Europe was suffering and it is idle for any Deputy, or for anybody else, to tell us that we could not feed ourselves. Not only did we feed ourselves during that war, but we fed a lot of other people outside of this country, and we are able to do that any time we are called on to do it again.  So that sort of argument leads one nowhere.  Deputy Victory, again, tried to prove that the half remission of the annuities was better for the farmers than any settlement of the economic warbetter than the whole of it. The figures, however, beat the Deputy there, if nothing else does.  The half-year's remission amounts to £2,000,000 a year instead of £4,000,000, and they have paid £33,000,000 under the new system instead of £4,000,000.  If Deputy Victory holds that one is as good as another, it is useless to engage in any debate in this House along those lines.</P>
      <P>If it is not altogether hopeless, I would again appeal to the Ministry, having embarked on two or three different occasions on trading agreements, or pacts as we might call them, with the so-called enemy across the water, to take their courage in their hands and to extend their efforts towards making these agreements.  I appeal to them to make, once and for all, a great, big, generous, honest agreement, which would include all the things in dispute, and then I can assure them that general satisfaction would be expressed in this House, because we would be debating the final settlement of the matters in dispute.</P>

      <P>It is now close on five years, Sir, since the present Government promised the people of this country, if they returned them to power, that they would have an almost immediate settlement of the economic war.  Five years have gone by, and the people of this country find themselves in the same position.  We still have the economic war, and the greatest shock the people of this country got for a long time was the announcement made by the President here some few days ago of the terms of this latest pact.  For the past four years the farmers of this country have paid to Great Britain in penal taxes the sum of over £20,000,000, and they have paid to the Irish Government a sum of over £11,000,000 in annuities.  They are still collecting the annuities with the help of the bailiff and the flying squads&mdash; harassing the unfortunate bankrupt farmers of this country, who are unable to meet their liabilities, and it is all due to the continuance of this economic war.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about surrender. We on this side do not want the Government to surrender, but we hold that it is the duty of the Government, since they started this economic war, to end it.  We see the effects of it all over the country, not alone on the farmers, but on the business people and on the unfortunate workers.  There is no business doing in our towns.  For six weeks previous to the announcement of this latest pact there were never greater sales for the daily papers of this country, because the people were hoping that they were going to wake up some morning and find that the economic war was settled and that they could start off again and make an honest living.  They are still buying the papers, however, and there is no settlement of the economic war.  The farmers of this country were never in such a state as they are in at the present time.  Their sons are flying from the land and going into the industrial centres in the hope of getting employment.  If they are lucky enough to be the sons of Government supporters, they have some chance of getting jobs, if they have a pull.  If they have not, they will have to take the boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> The same is true of the sons of the decent workers of this country.  Before they would take free beef from the Minister for Agriculture they prefer to take the boat.  The workers of this country do not want free beef or unemployment assistance from their native Government.  They want work and it is the duty of the Government to find work for the workers of this country.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce last evening boasting of the industrial expansion that he was carrying out in this country.  We agree with that and we shall help him to carry on that industrial progress, but it is no use in trying to carry on industries in this country if at the same time the main industry of the country is crippled by Government policy.  In the few industrial centres we have like Dublin, Cork and Limerick&mdash;there are only a few&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one can see signs of prosperity, but it would be well worth the Minister's while to go down the country and into the homes of the small farmers to see the conditions there.  It is the small farmers and the workers of the country who are paying for the upkeep of the new industries that have been started here.  If the people of the country who are buying the products of these industries have to pay an increased price, as compared with that which they paid previously for the same commodities, in order that these industries may be maintained, I think it is most unfair to the people of the country. For the past few years we have seen a great increase in the taxation of our people.  We have had to pay an increased price for bread, butter, flour, sugar, coal and other commodities. At the present time the people are paying 1/5 per lb. for butter that is being imported at 9½d. per lb.</P>

      <P>I shall confine myself to the matter before me.  I say that the standard of living of the agricultural community at present is deplorable, and that it is the duty of the Government to settle this economic war. There seems, however, to be no hope that the present Government will settle the economic war.  We had that from the President himself in answer to a question by Deputy MacDermot last week.  We are to have an election this year, I believe during the summer, and when the Government go to the people again to ask them for another five years, and tell them that the economic war will be settled in three weeks after the date on which they are returned to power, I am afraid they will get a very different answer from that which they expect. I am very hopeful that they will.  If the Government of this country have been educated during the past five years, one thing even more certain is that the people of the country have been educated for the past five years, too.  They will not be fooled by the election programme that will be put forward by the Party opposite.  The people of the country have been let down by the Government.  They were returned in 1933 by the people in the <Col N="1682" /> hope that the economic war would be settled and that they would carry out the great agricultural and industrial policy that they put before the people. What have they achieved?  They have ruined the agricultural industry in the country.  They have hunted the young men who made a decent honest living in this country previous to their coming into power.  These young men have gone across to John Bull, to the people whom this Government detest, but to whom, at the same time, while they are in office, they have given everything they asked.  They have given them aerial rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Never prophesy unless you know.  If I would be permitted <Col N="1683" /> to indulge in a prophecy, I would say that after the next election the present Government will still be where it is and the opposite Party will just be where they are.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not hear any acceptance of it; no backers, the odds are too great.  We have heard a lot of what I may describe as little better than raiméis.  The old economic war stalks across the horizon as gaily as ever, but all the oratory of the Opposition cannot galvanise it into life, for it is as dead as Queen Anne.  It is the Opposition who, by their actions in the past, were mainly responsible for its continuance.</P>
      <P>We have been lectured about the shock of the last pact.  I do not know that the last Coal-Cattle Pact, or, as one Deputy opposite christened it, in his eagerness to find new epithets, the sugar-horse pact, has resulted in any shock at all to the agriculturists.  The agricultural community are fairly solid and fairly enduring; the people are possessed of great commonsense and do not expect miracles in season and out of season.  They may or may not have hoped for a more considerable amelioration of their circumstances than they actually got, but I am confident that the sugar-horse pact, or whatever type of pact you may wish to call it, came as no shock.  If there were a shock, then, according to the evidence of the horse-breeders of the country, the most famous of them, it must have come as a very pleasant shock.  One of the leading horse-breeders of our State gave it as his declared opinion that the last pact resulted in the taking of the first trench in the economic war.  That was his stated opinion, and I do not think that this gentleman could be accused of having any partiality or any bias in favour of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told by the last Deputy who spoke that he did not want us <Col N="1684" /> to surrender.  If he, or the other gentlemen now in the wilds of opposition, do not want us to surrender, why did they not back us up when we took up an uncompromising position with John Bull and declared our intention of not paying the annuities?  When we made our position extremely clear, why did not the members of the last Government, who are now in the wilderness, say to us: &ldquo;We may not approve of your policy or your coquetting with the Left Wing, but in this case we recognise you are fighting the common enemy and we are behind you to the end&rdquo;?  If they did that, I feel confident there would be no economic war now.  They and they alone are, in my opinion, primarily responsible for the existing state of affairs.  They gave the British Government to understand, tacitly and by implication, that if they held out long enough they would best us.  To that extent, and I say it is a very considerable extent, they are responsible for the continuance of the economic war.</P>
    <P>We have had a cheap jibe from the Deputy who just sat down about the exodus of the young men.  He told us that the young men were being hunted from the country and he told us also about the getting of jobs for the sons of Government supporters.  I think that jibe well worthy of the calibre of the Opposition we have to confront. The Deputy told us it was the duty of the Government to find work for the unemployed.  I welcome that tardy conversion.  His leaders in days gone by did not say that.  It was the oftdeclared dictum of the occupants of the opposite benches, when they were in office, that it was not the duty of the Government to find work for the unemployed.  I welcome the Deputy's conversion, tardy no doubt, but if it is any evidence of a changed mentality on the part of the Opposition, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversion to what?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversion to commonsense. The Deputy also suggested that the Minister should go into the houses of the small farmers.  I maintain that our Ministers are as thoroughly conversant with the problems of the small farmers as any man <Col N="1685" /> on the Opposition benches.  The mentality of many Deputies in the Opposition is not such as would make them weep over the woes of the small farmers.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to our social services.  Why is it that, necessary as they have been and are, these social services were not conceded in the days when we were told that Ireland was flowing with milk and honey&mdash;in the days of the Fine Gael or the Cumann na nGaedheal régime?</P>

I would like to know why it is, when these social services could have been given without the community at large being asked to shoulder too heavy a burden&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, I will not proceed any further along that line.  Apparently, from what Deputies opposite say, it is the duty of the Government to settle the economic war.  I agree it is the duty of the Government, but it takes two sides to settle a quarrel.  Why is the assumption always made from the opposite benches that we alone are at fault?  That assumption is futile, provocative and fallacious.  I do not see why it should be assumed that our men are to blame.  They have done the best they can to settle this so-called economic dispute.  Why should it be assumed that they are in the wrong and that our British friends, with whom, as a matter of fact, the Opposition ought to have more in common than we, are always in the right?  We have done everything possible, consistent with the exigencies of national honour, to settle this matter.  I think I am <Col N="1686" /> entitled to make that statement and to base my arguments upon it.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the exodus of our people.  There is nothing new about an exodus in this country.  We all know the condition of things in England at the moment conduces to high wages, and high wages are definitely an attraction, whether they are given in America or England or anywhere else. There will always be a certain proportion of our people lured by a spirit of adventure, by high wages or by the roll of the drum, and no Government will stop them.  Anyone who will argue that people will remain here, no matter how satisfactory conditions may be, is arguing on a false basis; there will always be a certain element who will go away from this country, and the Opposition know that as well as we do.</P>
      <P>The economic war and all its consequences have been laid at the door of the Government.  I deny that the Government are responsible.  I say that the economic war and all the dire consequences which it is alleged have arisen from it are to be laid as much at the door of the Opposition as at our door.  If they are to be laid at our door we do not shrink from any responsibility.  We went to the country twice and we will go soon a third time, and I am quite willing to indulge in the old Asquithian axiom,&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo; Deputies on the Opposition Benches are like the small boy passing a graveyard; they are merely whistling to keep up their courage.  There is one thing, anyway, about their prognostications &mdash;they are reassuringly predictable. We can always envisage Deputy O'Higgins telling us to face the consequences and, incidentally, throwing a few bricks at the President.  We can envisage Deputy Belton who, whatever other faults he has, is more cognisant of the agricultural situation than his quasi, his pseudo colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKeogh" hpid="Mr. Kehoe Mr. Kehoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny nothing.  We can envisage Deputy McGilligan coming in with a sheaf of quotations and asking <Col N="1687" /> virtually in other words: &ldquo;What did Gladstone say in 1889?&rdquo;  But Opposition Deputies must envisage one fact anyway.  It may be a galling one, but it is condensed in the little French axiom, <i>J'y suis, J'y reste.</i>  In spite of all the jeremiads put forward by them in the past, in spite of every allegation as to why we should not exist, nevertheless we do exist.  We went to the country twice, in fact I might say three times, and the country sent us back.</P>
      <P>I beg leave to deny what was said in another debate.  At the last election we did not go before the electorate on the new Constitution.  We went to the country and faced our opponents and stated what our Government had done and what they intended to do, if possible.  We were not ashamed of their exploits in the past; we foresaw their victory in the future, and simply said: &ldquo;If you like our programme elect us again.&rdquo;  We did not deceive them in any way.  Speaking as one man who was on many platforms, I can say for myself and my colleagues that we did not go before the people on any Constitution or vague promises whatever. We made the thing perfectly clear.  We made clear the pains and penalties they would have to undergo, possibly, if they adopted our programme and, with a full knowledge of what that entailed, they sent us back. I for one have absolutely no doubt of their verdict in the future.  Even if their verdict was adverse to us, it would not alter our opinion that we are right.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches should really think out a set of new arguments.  The arguments which they adduce on occasions like this are so painfully similar and familiar that really one becomes positively somnolent when one hears the speeches and contemplates the people who utter them. Appeals have been made to the Government. I do not wish to differentiate, but may I appeal to Deputies on the opposite benches at least to adduce some original arguments and find some original way of presenting them; otherwise I foresee the occupants of these benches all turning into Rip Van Winkles, a consummation which I, for one, do not wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speech was very entertaining certainly, if not very illuminating.  The Deputy told us that the Governments were not responsible for the economic war, neither for the starting of it nor for its continuance, and that all the responsibility for it is on this side of the House.  We are accustomed to hearing that.  Before the Minister for Agriculture leaves the House, I should like to say this to him. He made a statement here, by way of interjection, that the price of creamery butter in this country has never fallen below 1/5 a lb. to the consumer since 1914.  That statement from the man who is Minister for Agriculture just shows how conversant the Minister is with the industry which he is, unfortunately, in charge of at the moment.</P>
      <P>What I got on my feet for was to ask some questions about the other side of this Pact&mdash;the coal side of it. I should like to know from the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has any information about the coal side of the Pact; whether he is satisfied that guarantees were obtained regarding the questions of price and quality of the coal to be supplied here; whether he is satisfied, in view of present conditions in the coal industry in Great Britain, that the people of this country will be able to obtain the supplies that they need at the price agreed upon; whether it is true that the price of coal in this country is to be increased very soon; and, if so, can the Minister say whether that was part of the agreement; how much the increase is to be; and when the increase is to be put on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that, in the very natural anxiety about the cattle part of it and the other agricultural products affected we are inclined to forget the other side, which is of very great importance to us.  Under this Pact we have given a complete monopoly to Great Britain for the supply of over 3,000,000 tons of coal.  We are not allowed to import coal from any other country.  Is the Minister satisfied that this country will be able to obtain its full needs in the way of coal without any substantial increase, or without any increase, over the period of this Pact which has been concluded?  I should be glad if the <Col N="1689" /> Minister could give us any information that he can on that matter, because it is of very great importance.</P>
    <P>I am not going to try to go into all the statements made on one side or the other.  But, unquestionably, it is impossible to believe that Deputies like Deputy Victory and Deputy Kehoe are so completely divorced from touch with the ordinary people of this country that they believe what they have said here.  It is utterly impossible to believe it.  Deputy Victory told us that farmers were in fact worse off five, six, seven or eight years ago than to-day.</P>

Does Deputy Allen know how much Great Britain collected by way of tariffs in 1935-36?</P>

      <P>Therefore, he knows that Great Britain collected £5,420,000. The Deputy knows also, I presume, that in the same period this Government here collected under the various Land Acts £2,500,000.  The Deputy is perfectly aware of that?</P>

      <P>That is approximately £8,000,000 and that has had no effect on the farmers; not only has it had no adverse effect, but it has had a beneficial effect.  There is no farmer in this country, even the most enthusiastic supporter, if there are any enthusiastic supporters left, of the present Government that will subscribe <Col N="1690" /> to that statement.  When we get, not a relief, mind you, but a transfer of approximately £40,000 off horses on to cattle, sheep, and other things, the relief is supposed to be so tremendous that the <i>Irish Press</i> features it as a wonderful gain for the people of the country.  We cannot have it both ways. There was no reduction of the £40,000.</P>

      <P>The people of this country.  I would not advise the Deputy to say much about the Coal-Cattle Pact, or about the coal tax, as the Minister might not be at all grateful to him.  They cannot talk about the Coal-Cattle Pact, or the new addition of it that we have got, while at the same time the President talks about no compromise and no surrender. Deputy Kehoe spoke about the uncompromising attitude of the Government.  Have they not given a complete monopoly of the coal trade to the enemy and put people here in this position that they cannot buy one pound of coal from any country other than Great Britain?</P>

      <P>With all respect, I submit that I am not responsible, but if these matters are introduced I am entitled to defend myself.  If I misunderstood what the Deputy said I apologise to him.  I am concerned about another side to this pact, because there are rumours across the Channel that there will be difficulty in obtaining supplies owing to a greater demand for coal in Great Britain at present than for a number of years.  Prices are rising on the home market and on the Continent, and I want to know from the Minister when this pact was being negotiated if any steps were taken to safeguard the coal supplies of this country, so that adequate supplies will be available under the monopoly; and if any steps were taken to see that there will be no increase in prices.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with what I heard of Deputy Kehoe's speech.  I concede that to him and to the Government without equivocation, so that the country will wake up to the exact <Col N="1692" /> position and that those responsible will know that the responsibility is theirs.  I concede that in 1932 the Party to which Deputy Kehoe belongs won the general election.  It put forward the policy of retaining the annuities and, of course, was lavish in its promises about what could be done with the money.  The outstanding promise was that there would be complete de-rating of agricultural land. That was not carried out.  It was also stated that England would not retaliate.  It is an historical fact that in 1932 £2,250,000 was voted by this Government for the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he boasted, and made it the bedrock of his argument, that the Government had gone to the people twice in the last five years and were returned to power.  I mentioned de-rating when conceding the net claim made by Deputy Kehoe.  I may say in passing, as an opponent of the Government, that if there is one section of the people more than another that the Government may thank for their return to power, it is the farmers. I say that without fear of contradiction.  If the farmers are in the bad condition that I know them to be in, let them take that home and ponder over it.  They have nobody to blame but themselves. I say that as a farmer and as a supporter of the farmers' cause.  The Deputy will concede that after the 1933 election there was not the same measure of relief given to the rating of agricultural land.  He has this in favour of his argument, that the farming community knew in 1933 what they did not know in 1932, that the economic war was on, that the £5,000,000 was being withheld from Great Britain, and that Great Britain had retaliated and was collecting that money by duties on our produce.  The <Col N="1693" /> Deputy should remember that this fight had only started, being only six or seven months in existence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Item 12 in the Schedule deals with the remission of duties arising out of the Coal-Cattle Pact. Listening to the debate as it developed here, it was on the Coal-Cattle Pact; it was on the position created by the withholding of those payments to Britain.  I am sorry if I am lacking in understanding, but I submit, with all deference to the Chair, that in my opinion I am not going outside the bounds marked by previous speakers. I do not want to do so, because there is plenty of scope within those confines to put up all the relevant arguments that there are.  However, if, in your opinion, Sir, I am transgressing, I will narrow my bounds.  In passing, I should like to submit that I do not think it is an argument in favour of a certain course, of the rights or wrongs of a particular line, simply to say that an election has been won on that point, with others, because the presentation of a case very often wins a case rather than the intrinsic value of it.  The whole thing has arisen out of a policy rather than a conviction, because I know quite well that there was no conviction in the Government Party that those moneys were not due; it was only taken as a political stunt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, they were withheld. Britain said, &ldquo;Well, we will collect them,&rdquo; and Britain is collecting them. I submit that this Coal-Cattle Pact and its predecessors were a surrender to Britain's policy of collecting those annuities; they were an agreement that Britain should collect them in this particular way.  The only difference between the present state of affairs and the old state of affairs is a difference in the method of collecting the annuities and the other payments.  There is also this difference, that instead of <Col N="1694" /> the whole community bearing its share &mdash;as those debts were incurred in years gone by before the advent of the Treaty &mdash;the agricultural community now has to bear its own share, plus half its own share, plus what the whole community had to bear.  The figures were given roughly by Deputy Morrissey when he was speaking.  Let us leave politics and the winning or losing of general elections out of it, and deal with the equity of the case before the House.  I would challenge any farmer or any man in this House who knows anything about agriculture to give the names of a dozen farmers in this country who are better off than they were five or six years ago.  Let us be candid about this matter when we come in here.  I know farmers who voted for the Government at the last election and will vote for them again. To-day, I drove into town with one of them.  He came to me to ask whether I could get the county council to accept from him arrears of rates that were due on 31st March last, without any of the rates of the current year.  That farmer will vote for the Government again, although he will tell you that conditions are appalling and he cannot carry on.  I cannot understand his mentality.  That will be a No. 1 vote from this neighbour of mine for the Government candidate at the next general election, and the man cannot pay his rates and will tell you that that is because of this economic war. He is a friend of mine&mdash;in other respects a very decent man.  I see the meaning that draws the laughter.  I will make you a present of it, because it has cheered up the sad faces I was looking at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pity to spoil your sense of humour, especially when Deputy Jordan is about; he has a sense of humour which I very much appreciate.  What is the difference in principle between our paying the annuities into the Land Commission to be transferred to Britain, and agreeing to pay them £4 5s. a head on a certain kind of cattle, £2 10s. a head on another kind of cattle, and I think 25/- or £1 a head on another class? <Col N="1695" /> What is the difference.  Our Government have made a commercial agreement on the principle of allowing Britain to collect this tax on our cattle going over.  What is that tax for?  It is deliberately to collect those moneys.  Is not that agreeing to pay them?  What is the use of perpetuating the farce and saying, &ldquo;We will not pay them; we will not surrender?&rdquo; Each Coal-Cattle Pact has been a surrender.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen interjected a remark about the relief of the tax on horses. But is it a relief?  Is there going to be remitted to us the £<i>x</i> which Britain was collecting off our horses?  Is it any part of the disputed moneys?  Is Britain going to reduce her collection in the current year by the amount she takes off the tax on horses?  Of course she is not.  Deputy Allen laughed when he got the reply to his interjection from Deputy Morrissey.  Deputy Allen had asked: &ldquo;Who paid the coal tax?&rdquo; Deputy Morrissey, of course, said that the consumer here paid it, and Deputy Allen laughed.  If that laugh was genuine, and if that represents the mentality of the farmers of this country then we can understand how the farmers' eyes are being wiped; we can understand it if their mentality is not above that.  Coal landed here on the Dublin quays came in at a commercial price.  When 5/- per ton was put on it, that had to be paid by the consumer. The price to the consumer was increased by that 5/-.  If Deputy Allen sends a bullock to Birkenhead there is no tax collected on that bullock when he lands.  He is sold in the Birkenhead market or in some other British market at the commercial price there.  Instead of adding a tariff to that price, the British tariff is taken off that price. The Minister for Industry and Commerce shakes his head?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If, when he says &ldquo;the Deputy,&rdquo; the Minister is referring to me and the argument I am putting up, I should like to say that I have been putting up this argument until I am tired putting it up.  No Minister on the Government Benches has ever taken up that argument, or attempted to refute it, because it is irrefutable. It is not my argument; it is the country's argument.  It is not increasing the price of cattle to the British consumer by one penny because our cattle are sold in the British market at the British market price and handed out to the consumer at that price, without any additions.  When the Irish exporter, however, comes to be paid out of that market price, in addition to the other deductions for commission, etc., there is the deduction of the tax, and I have produced here documents, returns of sales in the Birkenhead market, showing that that is how the transaction takes place.  I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deny that.  The reverse happens here.  This is not a tariff the British are putting on our stuff going over&mdash;it is a tax taken off the market value of our stuff.  Consequently, the person who suffers the deduction has to bear the loss, whereas, if it were in addition to the market price, it is the consumer would have to pay it.  In the case of our stuff going over, it comes off the market price, and, therefore, we who send it over have to bear that tax. The opposite was the case when coal was tariffed here at the ports.  It came in here at the world price, the market price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just admitted that now.  That is the transaction he defended last year and that is the transaction he is here to-night to defend&mdash;a perpetuation of that monopoly for Britain to send what quality coal she likes and to charge whatever prices she likes for it.  We have given her that market and we are agreeing in the same document to pay Britain her £5,000,000 which we are codding the country <Col N="1698" /> is not being paid and will never be paid to Britain again.  We are appealing to the people not to surrender and we know why the people are cajoled into it.  We know the Government is trading on the patriotism of the people.  We know that they are trading on what they call &ldquo;the centuries-old conflict with England,&rdquo; instead of this being a new conflict of a few years ago.  They are trading on that, appealing to the patriotism of the people and asking them not to lower the flag now, when they know that they themselves have lowered it and that they only have pulled it down.</P>
      <P>We do not want to go into the background of this matter.  We have seen ragged documents alleged to be secret agreements and alleged to be 12 or 13 years old produced here last year, or the year before, when we were discussing this pact, and everybody who followed public affairs at that time knew that a deal like that had taken place, and that the very people who are resurrecting those documents were conspicuous by their absence in looking after the interests of this country during those years. Now, they refuse to admit that they are responsible for precipitating this. Of course, they are.  Who else is responsible?  If they genuinely believe that we do not owe these moneys and if they are prepared to fight to the last ditch in their determination not to pay them, why agree to the Coal-Cattle Pact?  The official Opposition Party here, when in office, accepted the position that these moneys were due, and I could understand the Opposition making a Coal-Cattle Agreement with the British for the payment of the annuities if some dislocation in the method of collecting the annuities arose; but I cannot for the life of me appreciate the mentality of the Government who say that these payments are not due to Britain, and that they will not pay them, and who then sign a document agreeing to pay them by agreeing to a tax on cattle going into England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have observed your ruling, Sir, on the development of the argument about emigration, but I just want to say that, in the reference I make to <Col N="1699" /> that subject, I do not propose to develop the question of emigration.  It has been pretty well argued in the last couple of days and whether it could be worked in on this occasion is immaterial.  But the very serious part and the very serious consequence of this economic war, this economic peace if you like, this economic surrender if you like, or this economic swindle is a tragic affair for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the basic industry of this country and if it is not flourishing, if it is not showing a profit no other industry can be sustained here.  For it is out of the profits of agriculture that industry can be built up.  There are no profits in agriculture now.  One Wexford Deputy spoke here to-day.  I heard some of his speech; he did not go deeply into the question of agriculture. I was told that Deputy Victory spoke and I am sorry I was not here at the time because the Deputy happens to represent my own native county in this House.  I know the condition of farmers in the County Longford&mdash;very well I know them.  I know even the condition of farmers in the County Wexford.  Only this morning I had a long letter from a Wexford farmer depicting the conditions of agriculture there.  I am sure that farmer will read with interest the speech Deputy Kehoe made here to-day. I hope he will see the whole of that speech and read it and I hope also that he will get the interjection made by Deputy Allen.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard to reconcile the cases put up here by Deputies Kehoe and Allen with the information that I got this morning from a County Wexford farmer.  I am sure they and every country Deputy here knew the usual course of life in a farmer's house prior to this economic war.  As the family grew up, according to the size of the farm and according to the size of the income, the parents were able to place the sons and daughters in some kind of a position in life.  If the farm were a substantial one they were able to educate their children for the professions.  Some of the children developed a taste for agriculture and out of the profits they were able to make during their young years of <Col N="1700" /> manhood and womanhood they and their fathers were able to buy other farms and go into occupation of these farms.  Is there any farmer doing that to-day?  Are not the farmers' houses throughout the country getting filled up with young men and young women from 15 to 25 years of age whose parents are unable to put any of them into any profession or any calling in life and unable to save any money to buy farms for them so that they could start out on their own?</P>
    <P>Is not the position really that these farmhouses are filled with young men and young women who have no prospect in life?  And how is farming being carried on?  By the slavery of these young men and young women working on their parents' farms for the bit they eat.  That is the story all over the country, in Wexford, Galway, Roscommon, Donegal, Cork, Dublin and the Midland and Southern Counties.  That is the precise position. Were those young peope to get the lowest wage that is paid to farm labourers in this country, their parents could not carry on.  It is only on the slavery of the farming community of this country that this economic war is possible.  That is the answer.  If anybody wants to investigate the position he will find that that is precisely what is happening and that is the answer to the jibe thrown from the Government Benches about people in this House who prophesied two or three years ago that we were heading for bankruptcy.  That prophecy was true.  But we are told we are not bankrupt.  This country is not bankrupt because of the slavery of the farming community.  I would ask any Deputy here who would like to contradict that statement to get any farmer or any group of farmers anywhere, no matter what their politics are, to contradict it.</P>

      <P>Evidently they did.  I do not want to repeat what I said in the beginning of my speech in which I dealt with the matter from this angle. I am not making an anti-Government speech.  I am not making a partisan speech.  I am putting the case, as I see it and as I understand it and as I know the conditions obtaining in farming at the present time.  I would be glad if any Deputy on the Government Benches would attempt to refute the case I am making.  What is the wage being paid in agriculture under the conditions arising out of the economic war and continued under the Coal-Cattle Pact?  What are the overheads in agriculture?  Five millions instead of four millions, and one and a half millions for half the annuities.  Five millions are collected off our export produce to England.  That lowers the wholesale price for the produce that is sold by the farmers in the home market.  We are losing five millions on our export produce and we are losing as much more on the home market.  No wonder agriculture is impoverished. Those homesteads heretofore provided for the previous generations of young men and young women who were raised in those houses; now owing to the economic war or the economic peace they are not able to provide for them. It is from these houses that the stream of emigration is now flowing to Great Britain and that is one of the direct <Col N="1702" /> results of the economic war.  It is because of this economic war that the rates are not being paid and that the overdrafts from the banks to the local bodies have gone up.  The policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has just a passing success, simply through the exploitation of agriculture and simply through the impoverishment of the farmers' families.  Will any Deputy here who knows agricultural conditions in his constituency tell us that wages are being paid to farm workers?  Do they pay farm workers 25/- a week in Laoighise, Wexford, Galway, Meath, Westmeath or Donegal?  Of course they do not.  Can any man live and rear a family on 25/- a week?  Is there any industry that is being created by the Minister's policy and that depends for its existence on the exploitation of agriculture paying a wage of 25/- a week to adult men?  Of course there is not; so that the whole economic policy of the Minister is being carried out on one condition only, and that is the slavery and exploitation of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The economic war relieves the Exchequer of payments but it does not relieve the taxpayer.  Were there no economic war, were those payments not withheld, the Exchequer would find three millions from the farmers in the way of annuities.  But there would be two millions more to be found by the Exchequer.  Now there has been no remission of taxation to balance that two million pounds, so that if the economic war were ended two million pounds extra would have to be found by the Minister for Finance out of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £2,500,000 that come in as annuities to the Exchequer would not be coming in if the farmers had to pay their annuities to only one Government. The Government have a gift of between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 which agriculture has to pay above and beyond what it had to pay before the economic war. It is this money, scattered in grants for public works throughout the country at election times, that is giving this Government its grip rather than the policy it is putting over.  Perhaps the only solution is to let the thing wear <Col N="1703" /> itself out.  There is a terrible responsibility on this House and particularly on the Government, who understand the position as well as, and perhaps better than, ony other body of men in the country.  Yet they keep the thing going.  This has euphemistically been called a war.  It has lasted for five years.  The President stated in effect only a few days ago that there was no hope of a settlement and that we must carry on.  When a dispute has gone on for five years with no serious attempt at settlement, something must be wrong somewhere.  A settlement of the Great War came after four years.  Why is not some attempt at settlement of the economic war made now?  The President saw Mr. McDonald.  What happened between them?  I have not read an account of it in any paper. Surely if the President makes a pact with the British Government to continue the collection of these moneys off our goods and if nothing better can be done, he ought to come to this House and tell us what obstacles are in the way.  He has not done so.  In effect, he says: &ldquo;Carry on; pay the annuities by way of tariffs on the goods going into the British market.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If no better arrangement can be made than that which the President has made, it would be much better for this country to revert to the old arrangement and have the annuities paid directly by the Land Commission. We would win on it.  No sinking fund is being provided.  The Land Commission is keeping its accounts as if the land annuities had not been halved. Remember, all these things are on record, to come before us for settlement in the future.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that.  The halving of the annuities is only eyewash, because it is there recorded that they are still due, and the accounting system is carried on accordingly.  Why should not we revert to the old arrangement if the President cannot produce anything better than this pact?  The farmers, as a whole, had £3,000,000 as annuities to pay to <Col N="1704" /> Britain, and that finished the job. Now they have to pay £5,000,000 to Britain and £2,000,000 to our Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Only once.  I realise that it is almost superfluous to discuss this matter here at all because the motion will be carried.  No argument is put up in its favour and it is superfluous to put up an argument against it.  The whole country knows the position quite well and I am now taking the philosophic view that the only remedy is to let it work itself out and, when the farmers get a sufficient squelching, they will realise they have been wrongly led.  Perhaps they will, before it is too late, realise their mistake and rectify it.  The Government know the position better than the ordinary farmer, who is troubled about the weather and other matters, who does not, perhaps, read a daily or a weekly paper and who does not know the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;outs&rdquo; of this matter.  In these circumstances, our Government should be fairer to the farmer and when, after five years, they cannot see any hope of winning in this dispute, they ought to try to make an honourable settlement of some kind and not a dishonourable <Col N="1705" /> settlement such as this Coal-Cattle Pact, which is a complete surrender of the whole position, a loss to the country and a loss to the farmer.  It is driving the country directly to bankruptcy. One manifestation of the condition of the country is when a certain class of the community, who were able heretofore to provide for their families at home, have now to send them to be domestic servants in Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a formal measure of no great importance.  It is necessary it should be passed in order to confirm certain orders, none of which is of very great significance, made under the Imposition of Duties Acts.  The orders effected a number of minor changes in the tariff schedule of the country, all of which are being confirmed by this Bill.  I must say I did not anticipate anything more than a formal discussion on the measure.  Instead, we have had a field-day in connection with the economic war and the condition of the agricultural community.  Apparently there is a big flood of election oratory dammed up in the breasts of the back benchers of the Opposition, some of which is bound to spit out every time they shake themselves.  We have had a fair amount of it to-day and I think it was bad tactics on their part. Because not merely have they revealed that their election arguments are not very strong but they have brought prematurely into the House arguments that will be a bit fly-blown by the time the election takes place.  It is a bad thing to shoot off all your guns before battle.  These speeches would sound very well from a platform at the crossroads. They might even convince people who had never heard a speech before or who were particularly misinformed about conditions in the country, but it is merely wasting the time of the Dáil to produce them here, although, apparently, we are going to have them on the slightest provocation upon any Bill to which they can be regarded as even remotely relevant from this until the election takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an argument in favour of an early election, but unfortunately there is a considerable amount of business to be disposed of.  If we are going to have a general dress rehearsal of the <Col N="1706" /> election battle on every one of these Bills, then I feel that a statutory time limit is likely to be necessary before the required measures can be enacted and the election take place.  It will mean campaigning next January, and I appeal to Deputies not to force us into that because January, in weather such as we are experiencing just now, would be most unpleasant for electioneering.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan appealed to the Government to face realities, to come down out of the air and to get their feet on the ground.  The Deputy spoke in most moving tones.  The only mistake he made was that he addressed his appeal to the wrong side of the House.  It is to the other side of the House that the appeal should be made to get into grips with realities and to face facts: to come down out of the clouds and on to the earth.  We have been trying to get them to face up to facts for the last four years without success.  We have heard in the last couple of days a lot of talk about educating the Government and educating the people.  We had a reiteration of that talk to-day.  The Party opposite may have succeeded in teaching the Government something during the past five years.  It may even have succeeded in teaching the people something in that period, but one thing certain is that we have succeeded in teaching them nothing.  We have done our best.</P>
    <P>We have brought the facts before them with great patience and explained the facts to them.  We have shown, in every sphere of national activity, how a particular policy could produce beneficial results, but they will not see it.  They refuse to see it.  They are still purblind about national interests as they were in 1932.  We may not be very effective teachers, and despite all our efforts it is necessary, here at the end of our term of office, to confess that we have failed to teach them anything. I think it would be the merest waste of time to try again to get any sense of realities into them.</P>
    <P>What are the facts about the economic war?  All the speeches which we heard to-day from Deputy Dillon', down to Deputy Belton's, if they were <Col N="1707" /> condensed and the rhetoric left out, and flights of oratory abandoned, would mean this: that the economic war is not beneficial to the farmers of this country, it has done the country harm, it has done the farmers harm, and it is desirable that it should be ended, if possible.  That is the sum total of their speeches, and so far as that is what they intended to say, they were right.  The economic war was not started by Great Britain for the benefit of this country.  They intended to do as much harm as they could to the economic system here, to depress the country as deeply as they could, to lower the standard of living of our people, to undermine the prosperity of this nation, and, particularly, the prosperity of our farmers.  That is what they intended to do, and they had been assured by people in this country, whom they regarded as well-informed, and particularly by front-bench members of the Opposition Party, that if they started the economic war and imposed tariffs generally on our agricultural exports, they would get those results.</P>

      <P>Some of the speakers went back as far as the Flood and others as far as the Famine.  I am only going back as far as 1932.  That is how the economic war started, and it is quite a waste of time for Deputies to announce, as if they had just discovered it for the first time, that it is not doing us any good.  It is not doing us all the harm that it was intended to do.  This attack upon our economic organisation was intended to destroy us, to force us into a position in which we would have to accept dictation from Great Britain upon a vital matter affecting our interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they intended.  They did that because they had been assured of that result. The people who gave them that assurance were, of course, wrong in that matter just as they have since proved themselves to be wrong in most other matters.  We have survived the attack which was intended to destroy us.  We have reached a position in which we can contemplate a survival of our independence, a survival of our economic organisation and a gradual improvement and prosperity of our people irrespective of the outcome of the economic dispute.  The various measures which have been adopted in order to lessen the hardships involved in that attack upon us have had results.  These measures were drastic in their nature.  They had to be operated hurriedly and not always perfectly; nevertheless, they have succeeded in enabling us to weather the storm.  That being so, it is necessary to bring another fact before the Deputies opposite, a fact which they persistently ignore.  A determination of this economic dispute would have had less noticeable effects upon the prosperity of our farmers and the fortunes of this country than the Deputies opposite profess to believe. It is sheer nonsense for Deputy Dillon to say, as he did to-day, that if the economic war was ended this would be the most prosperous country in the world.  I am quite certain that the Deputy does not believe that.  If that is true, why was not this the most prosperous country in the world in 1931?</P>

      <P>During those years this country was disimproving and that is the central fact that the Deputies opposite choose to ignore.  There has been a fall in agricultural prices since 1932.  The value of agricultural output diminished, but that diminution in the value of agricultural output during that period of five years was less, and substantially less, than the fall in the value of agricultural output during the previous two years.  I tried yesterday to get into the minds of Deputies on the opposite benches the fact that something happened to this country in 1929 long before the economic war started, long before the land annuities dispute originated and long before this Government came into office which had an appalling effect upon the whole economic system here and upon the prosperity of our people.  During the three years 1929, 1930 and 1931, the year before the change of Government took place, there had been a steady and continuous decline in every sphere of economic activity: a decline in agricultural production and agricultural employment, a decline in industrial production and in industrial employment. That change took place in consequence of circumstances which had nothing whatever to do with the economic war or the special tariffs imposed on our exports or with the land annuities dispute or the election of a Fianna Fáil Government or anything else.  The events that took place in 1932 merely accentuated something which had begun long before that, but we succeeded in the ensuing two years in arresting that decline and in stopping the rot.  Since 1934 there has been a substantial increase in the volume and value of agricultural production, an increase in the volume and value of agricultural exports, a substantial increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture&mdash;an increase which is continuing during the present year&mdash;and, side by side with that improvement in the position of agriculture, there was a much more substantial, a much more spectacular <Col N="1710" /> increase in the output of industry and in employment in industry&mdash;an increase represented by the figure I gave here yesterday: £13,500,000 increase in the gross value of industrial production and £1,600,000 additional in wages paid to industry, and an increase in the average weekly number employed of 54,000 in 1936 as against 1931.</P>

      <P>We have no objection in principle, as was alleged here, to the negotiation of trade agreements with Great Britain.  We have, in fact, availed of any opportunity that offered for the negotiation of these agreements. These agreements were not always entirely satisfactory to us.  We had to take due cognisance of the economic conditions prevailing here.  If we were completely masters of our destiny, if economic conditions were better, and if there had not been this dependence on the British market for the sale of a large proportion of our <Col N="1711" /> agricultural exports, we could afford to take a different attitude; but we had to take into full account these economic circumstances to which I have referred and to frame a policy accordingly, and we have done it.  That is why this agreement was made.  It was made because we took into account these circumstances and, in these circumstances, tried to do the best thing possible for the people of this country, and I submit that we have done it.  It is not perfect.  The situation is not one of our choosing.  Certainly, it is not one we wished to see, but if Deputies opposite think that this Government, at any rate, is going to secure an improvement in that situation by surrendering upon principles which are vital to our people, then they are mistaken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, announced here this afternoon that his Party knew of a course which would settle the dispute and, at the same time, avoid payment of the moneys directly or indirectly, but he took good care not to give the slightest hint of what that course was.

      <P>Deputy Dillon made that assertion here, and I am quite <Col N="1712" /> certain we are going to hear it again.  In any event, whether other Deputies in that Party are as foolish as he was and whether they will be so foolish as to make that assertion in so many words, it will certainly be implied by many of them that there are some means by which, at the present time, it is possible to secure a settlement of the dispute without payment of these moneys, directly or indirectly, or without surrendering upon a question of vital principle.  There is no such course at present.  No one, of course, can tell what circumstances will arise in the future, but it is an entire illusion, and a dangerous illusion, to think that we can benefit the farmers of this country by accepting terms in settlement of this dispute which would involve the concession by us of principles to which, in our opinion, we must adhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If once we accept that position, our independence&mdash;economic, fiscal and political&mdash;will be meaningless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy admits he was wrong.  Then, Deputy Morrissey spoke about the price of coal.  It is not possible to forecast the tendency of prices or to be able to say what the price of coal is going to be in the future.  Prices of raw materials are rising steadily all over the world. Some raw materials, such as timber, have gone up by 100 per cent. in a short time, and other raw materials, such as copper, have gone up even more than that.  It is inevitable, in the circumstances now prevailing, that the tendency of coal prices will be upward, but when Deputy Morrissey talks about giving a monopoly to the British coal producers he is using a word that conveys a definite meaning which has no relation to the circumstances existing in connection with the coal trade between this country and Great Britain.  If there had not been a tariff imposed upon Continental coal, no Continental coal would have been imported here in circumstances in which all coal is brought into this country <Col N="1714" /> duty free.  It is inevitable that all our coal imports in such circumstances will come from Great Britain, not because the coal is produced more cheaply in Great Britain, but because it can be transported so much more cheaply to this country.  We frequently had arguments here in the past as to whether the duty was paid by our consumers or by the British exporters.  The increase in the price of coal which took place after the removal of the duty proves the contention that we then made, that the duty on coal previous to that was paid by the exporters, except for the short period during which the coal quota was in operation simultaneously with the duty.  During that period, of course, the duty was paid by our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the earlier years, the duty on British coal was partly offset by a reduction in the price to producers, and, secondly, by a reduction in the cost of transporting it here.  As soon as the duty went off, these reductions were eliminated and the price went up.  I do not think we lost by that, either.  The people of this country are certainly paying no more than they would have to pay if the quota order had never been made.  The coal quota order is necessary for the implementation of our agreement, and, in fact, the very removal of the duty would have produced the same result, that only British coal would have been purchased.  The net result was to put the coal trade of this country into precisely the same position as it was before 1932, when all our coal supplies came from Britain.  But in the interval something had happened in Great Britain.  In the interval what was tantamount to a central selling organisation had been created, and, in these circumstances, I agree our importers are less able to protect their interests than they were previously.  It may be necessary, if we cannot get voluntary action, to protect our interests in the matter of price and quality, to establish some counter-organisation on this side which will at least put this country as a purchasing country in the same position of strength as Great Britain is as a seller of coal at the present time.  I would prefer that <Col N="1715" /> that necessity should not arise, but it will undoubtedly arise if the discussions which are periodically taking place, concerning the guarantees to our coal importers in respect to price and quality, do not prove to yield beneficial results from our point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister departs from that subject, I should like to ask him a question.  May I take it from what the Minister has said, that there is nothing in the Coal-Cattle Pact which will prevent us, should there be an unreasonable increase in the price of coal in Britain from getting coal from alternative sources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An organisation has been set up, similar in its nature to the organisations that were set up between Britain and certain other countries which had contracted to take stated quantities of coal from Great Britain, to negotiate and regulate the price at which coal would be supplied, to supervise the quality of the coal and the availability of supplies. That organisation is in existence, and meetings have taken place between representatives of this country and representatives of the British coal producers.</P>
      <P>These meetings are for the purpose of negotiating and settling any question in dispute in these matters.  I merely indicate that, in the event of that organisation not being 100 per cent. effective in meeting what we regard as reasonable requests, we may have to supplement it on our side by a more effective method of controlling purchases.  If, in the last resort, we cannot get satisfaction, as in fact occurred last year in the case of cement, when after we made a quota order for the benefit of Great Britain in regard to cement, we found that we could not get supplies or could only get them at exorbitant prices, and that it was necessary to reopen the agreement, as we did, and secured a release from our obligations to purchase a certain quantity of cement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to get clear is this.  The Minister talks <Col N="1716" /> about other countries in connection with stated quantities.  It is not a question of stated quantities in our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes to the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Under this particular pact we have got to take all the coal we require from Britain. Whether the purchasing organisation here and the selling organisation on the other side come to an agreement or not as to quality and price, we cannot go outside Britain for supplies without definitely breaking the pact. I want to know are we being committed for 12 months to purchase coal from Great Britain, and from nowhere else, irrespective of price or quality? Supposing the two organisations, one buying and the other selling, fail to come to an agreement, are we empowered to go outside Britain to purchase coal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We found that the supplies were not available and that the prices, in our opinion, increased unduly.  That created a situation in which we were not prepared to carry out the obligation to purchase a stated quantity of cement from Britain; therefore, we went back to the British Government and said that we were going to purchase that cement elsewhere in these circumstances.  There was a question of whether the countervailing concession which the British Government had made would be withdrawn, but it was not withdrawn. The same thing may arise in connection with coal.</P>

      <P>Might I have the Minister's permission to put a question to him?  I want to be clear on the case he is making.  The Minister drew a parallel between the cement crux of last year and a possible coal crux which may arise this year, through the possibility of a British coal-ring inflating their prices excessively. He said it occurred in the case of cement and that he went back to <Col N="1718" /> the British Government and said that he could not take cement at that price. It strikes me that that is not anything like a reasonable parallel, because the main agreement, as far as I understand it, is one of coal against cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purchase by us of a specified quantity of cement was in consideration of the purchase by Great Britain of an increased quantity of bacon.  One was definitely set against the other, and when the cement end of it broke down there was a possibility that the increased quota in respect of bacon would be withdrawn also.  In fact it was not.  In fact in the circumstances existing the British cement producers had to meet an increased demand in Great Britain and they ceased to be interested in selling cement here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; In the Act which was passed some weeks ago concerning the Spanish Civil War, for the purpose of implementing the non-intervention agreement provision was made for the prohibition of the export of contraband, of war material, to Spain.  The International Committee for the application of that agreement, which consists of representatives of the Governments of all the parties to it, has deemed it expedient to establish a system of observation around the Spanish frontiers for the purpose of ascertaining whether that non-intervention agreement is being effectively observed.  The resolution which embodied a scheme of control was adopted at a meeting on Monday last and it was then decided to bring the scheme into operation as quickly as possible.  A board, to be known as the International Board for non-intervention in Spain, has been set up to administer the observation scheme.  It will have as its officers a number of administrators and observers who will report breaches of the international non-intervention agreement and furnish material which will enable the participating Governments to take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that observation and control on the sea frontiers require the imposition of certain obligations upon merchant shipping and it is for that reason that this Bill is necessary.  It is necessary to provide that any shipping proceeding to Spanish territory will, in accordance with the scheme of control, call at a particular place <i>en route</i> for the purpose of taking on board one of these international observers, who will remain on the ship during its stay in Spanish territory and be brought back by it to a port of disembarkation, one of the observation <Col N="1721" /> stations.  It is necessary to give, by law here, the members of that international staff powers of interrogating passengers and crews and examining cargoes and documents relating to them and also to provide for their accommodation and subsistence on board ship.  It is also necessary to provide in our law for the conferring upon the officers of the naval forces of the countries France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, which will be patrolling the Spanish coast, power to board our ships approaching the Spanish coast and to interview the officers and examine the documents. It is for that purpose this Bill has been framed.  It has been framed in a manner which gives fairly wide powers to act by regulation.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to bring the Bill into operation until the scheme of control is brought into operation simultaneously by all countries.  Legislation has already been introduced by some countries&mdash;all the countries that are parties to the agreement have undertaken to do so.  It is hoped to bring the scheme of control into operation at a fairly early date and it is desirable, therefore, that this Bill should pass before Easter.  The two main purposes are to provide for this regulation of merchant ships by the placing on them of this obligation to call at an observation port and take an observer on board and, secondly, to confer on the officers of patrolling naval forces the right to regulate Saorstát ships.  The Bill is consequential on the principal Act passed some weeks ago dealing with non-intervention in Spain and it is necessary, because our law does not make provision for the regulation of merchant shipping in this way in the ordinary course.</P>

      <P>It is quite agreed that this is a Bill to implement the machinery of non-intervention which was agreed to by all Parties in the House.  We all realise that legislation will not prevent anything except there is machinery to implement it and whatever machinery is considered necessary or desirable in the interests of the Governments most intimately associated with this particular problem <Col N="1722" /> it will, I presume, be given freely by every Parliament anxious for non-intervention.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing this Bill, might have given us possibly a little more information than he did give us.  First of all, I would like to be informed exactly to what extent, in terms of ships, this particular Bill affects us.  I do not know whether we have one ship subject to search under the terms of this Bill, or 51.  I do not know how many trading ships or other types of sea-going vessels are registered in the Saorstát and, therefore, come within the terms of this Bill.  I imagine that the number would not be very great.  Apparently, the outcome of the work of this committee provides for what I would imagine must be a considerable host of sea searchers. Presumably some arrangement is made with regard to meeting the expenditure or the cost of that particular host of sea searchers.  I take it every participating nation is committed to portion of the expense to a greater or lesser extent.  Is the contribution paid by any participant country in proportion to the number of their sea-going vessels, or is it in proportion to their total revenue as compared with the total annual revenue of other participating countries?  What I really want to get at is: on what basis is the contribution fixed which will be paid by any of the participating countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, in the course of the Minister's remarks he told us that the functions of these boarding inspectors would be to secure and to ensure that any vessel in the neighbourhood of Spain, or going towards Spain, would not carry any war material.  I may be peculiarly ignorant on the point, but perhaps seafaring people are as ignorant on these matters.  Personally, I do not know offhand what is regarded as war material in the eyes of this committee. Is there some particular definition? If there is, I should like to know the definition.  I read in the papers lately in association with Spain that there was a fairly serious difference of opinion in some American State as to what should be, or may be, legitimately regarded as war material.  I take it that some nations would even stretch the definition of war material <Col N="1723" /> so very far as to include, say, clothing for troops.  Unquestionably, certain countries would be entitled to regard the requisites required by any branch of an army as being war material.  Red Cross requisites are the requirements essentially demanded by the medical end of an army.  Even though such requirements and such supplies may be required by one or other of the combatant forces, I should like to know if Red Cross supplies would be held up or regarded as war material by the inspectors.  I am raising these particular points purely in pursuit of information, because every one of us will be asked a considerable number of questions following this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like information upon.  I see here that penalties are laid down, and quite properly so, because there is no good in prohibiting a thing without having penalties for breach of that particular law.  There are penalties laid down, either by way of fine or imprisonment or both, for breach of the regulations contained in this particular Bill.  The Bill refers to the fact that transgressors will be punishable by law and that the punishment will be up to a maximum of so much in terms of pounds, and so much in terms of imprisonment. Is the law referred to that of the home country of the transgressor? If a Saorstát vessel with a Saorstát captain or master is held up in Spanish waters by British agents, will they be brought back here and tried and sentenced in an Irish court?  That would mean that these inspectors will spend a considerable portion of their time travelling to and fro over the world in order to give evidence in various world courts.  I can imagine in any given week vessels from Russia and from America, perhaps vessels of our own, or vessels from, we will say, Japan being held up in Spanish waters, boarded by inspectors, and found to contain some little packet of war material.  If a law such as this is broken, it is the breach that matters and not the extent of the breach.  So that one packet of what would be regarded as war material, or one sailor's pocket with three or <Col N="1724" /> four loose bullets in it, would mean that that particular ship had transgressed that particular law.  Will it be necessary for the boarding inspector in such a case to go back to the country in which that ship was registered in order to give evidence in the courts there, or is there any particular machinery to save time and cut down expenses by taking the testimony of that man by some system of sworn declaration conveyed through the post and acceptable to the court?</P>

      <P>Following on what Deputy O'Higgins has said, I should like to ask one or two other questions. I had not the advantage of hearing what the Minister said when introducing the measure.  I have only to take what may have been his comments by deduction from what Deputy O'Higgins said.  All through his speech there has occurred this word &ldquo;searchers.&rdquo; Is there any right of search under this Bill whatsoever?  I should like an answer to that.</P>

      <P>All that is at stake is that there will be certain observers put on board vessels, and their duty will be to report to the Government of the country where the ship is registered that somebody belonging to that country, or flying the flag of that country, has broken what is the law of that country, and that is the beginning and the end of it.  I think that is the situation.  There is a further point. This will only apply to vessels flying the flags of the participating countries. Therefore, such a boat as the only vessel that has made an attempt to put <Col N="1725" /> into Spain, and which was stopped by the only real non-interventionist in the whole world, General Franco, stopped by gun-fire, can go through and will not be liable to observation.  I refer to a Mexican boat.  Mexico is not one of the participating countries.  They can sail along the coast of Spain, with this horde of nearly 800 observers, and they have not the right even to stop that boat or go on board.  That is the situation as I understand it.</P>
      <P>That is the situation we are aiding by making nationals of our criminals, if they in a country involved in this matter bring something that is considered to be contraband on board a boat.  I gather the Minister did not make it clear that there is no question of stopping goods from getting to Spain.  They can get there, even if they are in ships flying the flags of the countries in this agreement.  The only thing that will happen will be a criminal prosecution after the event in whatever is the country of the national who has run these contraband goods. I understood all along that that was the situation, and I think it is the real situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked for information as to cost.  Apparently the Minister did not give that.  The only estimate of cost the papers have carried is that if this were to continue for a year it would cost roughly £1,000,000. Eighty per cent. of that expenditure is to be borne by the five great Powers.  The remaining 20 per cent. is, apparently, to be divided out between the other 22 participating countries.  I do not know whether that is going to be on the basis of 1 per cent. on each of the others, but that would land us in an expenditure of about £9,000 or £10,000.  Presumably a Vote will have to be taken for that hereafter, when this matter can be raised again.  I think this should be said with regard to this Bill, that is the second stage of whatever are the practical methods thought likely to achieve non-intervention in reality.  It is coming along, of course, long after there has been any rhythm of intervention in Spain but, as far as similar Bills, and the Bill passed in December in the British House of Commons in <Col N="1726" /> regard to arms and munitions carried in ships, it was then stated in the House of Commons that the necessity for that Bill arose from the very ordinary reason that the British Government had not granted belligerent rights to either of the two Governments at war in Spain, and because of a warning by General Franco that he would stop by forcible methods any boats attempting to bring arms or munitions to the Caballero Government.</P>
    <P>The British Government was then faced with the possibility that British ships might be stopped, forcibly held and searched, and possibly sunk, by people to whom they had not accorded belligerent rights.  In order to prevent that the British Government decided that they would push on non-intervention in a practical manner by prohibiting imports of arms and munitions to Spain.  I suppose the practical result of this Bill is going to be small.  I do not think there are many boats, registered in this country, trading with Spain, except whatever boats the Limerick Steamship Company have, which carry our eggs there but unfortunately do not carry back any payments in return.  The possible effect of this measure will be on whatever boats the Limerick Steamship Company have trading occasionally with Spain.  There is no great possibility of friction here.  There was no great possibility at any time that there was going to be much trouble, because the Franco Government decided they would stop boats carrying munitions to Spain.  In so far as we are joining in this we are distinctly following up a measure that may have very good effects from the humanitarian point of view, founded on the British desire and inclination not to have war breaking out through the fact that people with whom they are not associated might bring munitions to Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked a few questions that I should like to answer.  There are about 200 ships registered in the Saorstat, and the great majority of them are small and could scarcely successfully undertake the journey to Spain, but some of them could, if necessary.  It is necessary to have control over all ships. <Col N="1727" /> The number of ships engaged in carrying cargo between Spain and the Saorstat is small, but it is necessary to ensure that no ships registered in the Saorstát will act contrary to this scheme of control, but will be subject to the regulation to call at the observation posts and take observers on board.  Deputy McGilligan is correct in his statement that those who go on board ships will be observers, will be allowed to inspect the cargo, to interview the crews and examine the papers, but if they discover any breach of the law of this country in respect of the transhipment of war material, they will report here, and the necessary legal steps will be taken by the Government of the Saorstát.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Provision is made in this scheme of control so that the evidence of subordinate staffs will be taken wherever possible on commission, in the method prescribed in the country concerned, in order to avoid the necessity of witnesses having to proceed to the country in which control takes place.  I did not refer to the expenditure on the scheme of control, because it does not directly arise, and a Supplementary Estimate will have to come before the Dáil to provide for our contribution under the scheme.  It will be at the maximum £8,000, as the estimate of the general cost has been reduced somewhat from the £1,000,000 referred to.  Each of the five big European Powers, France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia and Italy, are contributing 16 per cent. and the remainder will be spread over the participating countries on the basis of their contribution to the League of Nations. There is a regular basis of contributions to the League of Nations.  Our contribution will be .8 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>£8,000.  What constitutes war material for the purpose of the scheme has been agreed upon by the Non-Intervention Committee and was embodied in the Schedule of an <Col N="1728" /> Order made by the Executive Council a few weeks ago which, for the purpose of the Non-Intervention Act passed in February, declared certain goods to be war material.  The only articles included are obviously war material such as rifles, machine guns, grenades, armour-plating, tanks, aircraft, flame-throwers, mustard gas and powder for war purposes.  There is no reference to articles of clothing; certainly nothing that could be regarded as Red Cross supplies.  I think these were the principal points raised.  The Bill merely gives power to impose legal obligations on our nationals, in order to ensure that they will conform to the scheme of control devised.  So far as regular steamship companies are concerned all reputable companies that we could possibly ascertain have agreed to the requirement to call at the observation posts to take observers on board.  It is necessary to have law in case there would be individual cases of evasion.  In any case, it is necessary to have the law to give the right of search to the naval forces concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, but the whole question of non-intervention in Spain was raised yesterday, and many of those who participated in that discussion yesterday had already participated in the non-intervention debate which took place previously.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1731" /> Sir, as you know, I was prohibited from participating in the debate on that occasion, and I want now to express views on the matter&mdash; seeing that the issue has been raised&mdash; in order to make the position of the Labour Party clear.</P>
      <P>I wanted to say that, in my view, a non-intervention policy was the only practical policy which the Government could have adopted in respect to Spain; that any other policy for this country&mdash;a policy of participation &mdash;would have brought the same disastrous consequences as active intervention by other countries would have brought.  After all, intervention in Spain would mean adherence to a policy of making Spain the cockpit of Europe, but, of course, that would not be for the benefit of Spain, and we could never be sure that the ambit of the field of battle in Spain would not be widened.  If we were to make Spain the cockpit of Europe, and if every nation felt itself free to participate in Spain's civil war, then all kinds of possible international conflicts might arise.  Those international conflicts might have disastrous effects, not merely on the present position of European affairs, but disastrous consequences on the civilisation of Europe itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are in any way in touch with the conditions in Europe, those who endeavour to follow Europe through its troublous paths, must be aware that at the present time the tension on the Continent is extremely acute.  Even a country such as Switzerland, which has been traditionally peaceful, has found it necessary to ask its Parliament for substantial credits in order to protect its frontiers.  Wherever one goes throughout Europe the same feeling of tension is manifest on all sides. Active intervention by all countries in the Spanish conflict would inevitably heighten that tension, and it would require very little indeed to set Europe aflame to-day.  After all, an incident in Sarajevo in 1914 produced a world war which lasted four years.  The possibilities of a spark in Spain setting Europe on fire are much greater than the possibilities <Col N="1732" /> surrounding the spark which was kindled in Sarajevo.  In a choice between intervention in Spain in deciding the conflict there, or avoiding a war which would bring about a destruction of European civilisation, I think every sensible person will be on the side of any policy which limits the civil war to Spain and saves Europe from that disastrous catastrophe.</P>
    <P>We read in the Press recently a declaration by Russia that children over eight years of age were to be instructed in the methods of warfare. I myself saw children parading through Italy with wooden guns on their shoulders, performing military evolutions, all for the purpose of teaching them the latest tricks of war.  We saw that in Germany the youth of the country are being taught to take up arms in the coming struggle which they all regard as inevitable.  Amongst the big military nations of Europe, therefore, we find gigantic preparations for war, a perversion of the people's minds from peaceful to war purposes.  When that catastrophe takes place it will be impossible to foreshadow the consequences; but we ought not to increase the possibility of its taking place at an early date by pursuing in Spain a policy that would only tend to hasten a European conflict which would be disastrous to European and world civilisation.  It is for those reasons that we supported the policy of non-intervention, and believed that the policy of non-intervention was desirable.  I think that, on mature consideration of the matter, Deputy Belton and those who may share his views that non-intervention should not commend itself to us, ought to realise that no matter what their personal views may be as to the ultimate result of the Spanish conflict, the only safe policy for this and every other country to pursue in the interests of European and world peace is one of allowing this contest in Spain to be settled by Spaniards, to be settled free from intervention by other countries, because, as I said, intervention would prevent the war being localised in Spain and possibly might give the world in 1937 a repetition <Col N="1733" /> of the terrible inferno which the world witnessed from 1914 to 1918.</P>

      <P>That, in view of the promise made by the President to establish an Arbitration Board to deal with the grievances of the Civil Service, the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should forthwith enter into a conference with the Civil Service organisations to devise a scheme of arbitration acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>In order to enable the House properly to understand the merits of the issue involved in this motion, it may be necessary to remind it of the fact that, in 1932, both in writing and orally, the President promised to establish an arbitration board to deal with the grievances of the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>In 1932, the President went to the Town Hall, Rathmines, and there delivered himself of a speech in the constituency in which the Minister for Finance was a candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say more than that on this occasion, too.  The President knew that the Minister for Finance was a candidate in the County Dublin constituency and he went to the Town Hall, Rathmines, to deliver a speech on the subject of arbitration in a constituency where he knew, no doubt because of a careful reminder by the Minister for Finance, there were a large number of civil servants resident.  There the President said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe it is only right that there should be an arbitration board for the Civil Service to deal with matters between the Service and the Executive.  We should be prepared to agree that an arbitration board be set up and would assent to an inquiry into the basis on which the cost of living is calculated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A few days afterwards, the President issued the Fianna Fáil manifesto over his own signature in which he declared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are prepared to establish an arbitration board to deal with the grievances of the civil servants,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>so that there can be no question whatever that the promise to establish an arbitration board was made.  This motion asks, in view of that promise, that the Executive Council should enter into negotiations with the Service organisations for the purpose of devising an acceptable scheme of arbitration. But these are not the only instances of promises by the Government <Col N="1735" /> to introduce a scheme of arbitration for the Civil Service.  The joint committee of all the Civil Service organisations issued on 8th February, 1932, a <i>qúestionnaire</i> to Parliamentary candidates who were standing in the election in that year.  One of the questions in the <i>questionnaire</i> was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are you prepared, if elected, to press for the setting up of machinery which will provide for the settlement of matters in dispute between the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service by an impartial tribunal, subject to the over-riding authority of the Oireachtas?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Among the many people who sent replies in the affirmative was Deputy Cooney who was not satisfied with saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the <i>questionnaire</i>, but who felt he had some special mission over and above saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because he insisted on writing a letter in addition, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I intend to agitate in the future, as I have in the past, for an increase in the standard of wages paid to the lower grades in the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that before the debate concludes Deputy Cooney will come in and tell us what he has done during the past five years to fulfil that declaration of agitation which he promulgated on 10th February, 1932.  Deputy Cooney was in good company in this matter. Deputy Donnchadha O Briain said that he was also prepared to press for the establishment of that kind of arbitration tribunal; so was Deputy Eamonn Rice; so was Deputy Donnelly; so was Deputy Seán Brady; so was Deputy Frank Carty, and likewise Deputy Oscar Traynor, now Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputy Cormac Breathnach likewise believed in the desirability of that machinery; so did Deputy Briscoe, and Deputy Harris likewise was sympathetically disposed.  Deputy Seán MacEntee, now Minister for Finance, was also in favour of the establishment of an impartial tribunal to deal with the grievances of the Civil Service, subject to the over-riding authority of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance, like Deputy Cooney, was not satisfied to say &ldquo;Yes, he was prepared to press <Col N="1736" /> for the establishment of a tribunal of that kind&rdquo; because he went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Party has already indicated that it is prepared to investigate the grievances particularly in the lower ranks of the Civil Service and to provide, for the purpose of settling disputes, an impartial tribunal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reply by the Minister for Finance clearly indicates that he did not regard this <i>questionnaire</i> as one which might be received by a candidate at election time and answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in any perfunctory fashion.  There were two questions addressed to the Minister, and to both questions he was not satisfied merely with an affirmative answer, because he went on further to express his views, independent of the questions addressed to him, so that, in 1932, on 10th February of that year, the Minister for Finance announced that he was in favour of setting up machinery by which an impartial tribunal could be constituted to deal with the grievances between the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service, subject to the over-riding authority of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be good enough between now and the next occasion on which this debate takes place to give me the full text of my answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the full text of the Minister's answer in respect of this particular question. Does the Minister challenge the accuracy of the statement I have made? If he does, I will permit him to interrupt me and allow him to read the answer himself, so as to have it on the records of this House, side by side with what I have read.  That, at all events, was the promise made by the Minister for Finance in 1932.  His President promised arbitration.  The Minister for Finance himself promised arbitration and he was not satisfied with merely saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question as to whether he was in favour of arbitration.  He insisted on going further and setting down definitely the views of himself and his Party on the subject of arbitration.  It is clear from that that the promise of arbitration <Col N="1737" /> was not an isolated promise made by the President in the stress of an election at Rathmines, but the reply to the <i>questionnaire</i> clearly indicates that the Party as a whole promised arbitration to the service, not merely individually but collectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now asked the Minister for Finance to implement the promise which was then made by him and which was made by the President on behalf of the whole Party.  The Minister has offered to the Civil Service what he describes as a draft scheme of arbitration.  The Minister's scheme provides for a brand of arbitration which will not be recognised by anybody as arbitration in the sense in which the machinery is popularly and industrially known.  Under the Minister's scheme, he is to have a veto over the type of case which the service organisation decides to send to arbitration.  So that if an organisation were making a claim on the Minister for Finance for increased wages they could not have the matter even adjudicated upon by the tribunal which the Minister promised in 1932 to have implemented.  The Minister under his present draft scheme would be able to say to the organisation concerned that no matter what the merits of their case were, he was not prepared to allow the question to be sent to the arbitration tribunal.  That meant that the Minister would not allow any matter to go to arbitration unless he felt he had an overwhelmingly strong case such as would convince the tribunal that the staff claim could not be acceded to.  The preliminary veto was not all that the Minister wanted in his draft scheme. The scheme provided that the Minister would have the right to prevent any organisation which desired to bring a matter to arbitration from being represented before the Arbitration Board by a person of its own choice.  So that if the service organisation desired to present a claim to arbitration and if the organisation had a full-time official who was familiar with the circumstances of the case, and if the executive of that organisation and the members of that organisation felt that that full-time official was the best person to plead the case before the <Col N="1738" /> tribunal, the Minister took good care in his draft scheme that that person would not be allowed to appear before the arbitration tribunal to plead the case for his organisation.  Or if any complicated legal points arose in any matter, and the organisation desired to be represented before the Board by counsel, the Minister, under his draft scheme, would also presumably exclude the lawyer from the Board even though his assistance may be of considerable value in elucidating the points at issue. But the Minister's attempt to muzzle the staff organisation did not end there.  Not only was he to have a veto over the case which the organisation decided to bring before the tribunal; not only was the chairman to be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; not only were the full-time officials of the organisation excluded from pleading the case before the board or tribunal, but even if the Minister lost his case before the board he was even then not bound to accept the award and put it into operation.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Minister under his own scheme was to have the award of the board treated as a secret and confidential document which could not be published except with the permission of the Executive Council.  Nobody, but the tribunal, was to know what the award contained.  The Minister was to receive the award as a recommendation, and he was to be fully empowered under his own scheme of arbitration to refuse to be bound by the award even though the award might have been the unanimous decision of those who constituted the tribunal, including the Minister's own representative.  That is the kind of arbitration which the Minister has offered.  But in my opinion, and in the opinion of every member of the House, irrespective of how he may vote on this issue, there will be a clear realisation that a scheme of that kind does not embody the essential features of arbitration as generally understood; and I have no hesitation in saying that while the Minister may describe that scheme as a draft scheme of arbitration, it has none of the essential features commonly associated with arbitration.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying that, in my opinion, <Col N="1739" /> and I think in the opinion of the members of this House, that scheme of arbitration, if indeed it could be called arbitration at all, is not a fulfilment of the very solemn promise which the President made to the Civil Service in 1932.  It is not a fulfilment of the promise which the Minister for Finance and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party made in reply to the <i>questionnaire</i> which, on the 8th February, 1932, was sent to them by the Joint Committee of the Civil Service Association.</P>
    <P>I would like now for a few minutes to examine even in more detail the Government's scheme.  The Minister wants in this scheme to have a veto over every case that the staff organisation desire to submit to arbitration. It really means, in effect, that the Minister is going to have two preliminary vetoes, because his own draft scheme provides a permanent veto over certain matters which, he prescribes, can never be the subject of arbitration before this or any other tribunal.  In his draft scheme of arbitration the Minister says that he is permanently excluding from the consideration of the arbitration board such questions as discipline, conduct regulations, promotions, superannuations, the cost-of-living index figure as applied to basic wages and salaries, recruitment, the grading of work, the organisation of work and the organisation of staff.  All these matters are permanently excluded in the Minister's draft scheme and there can be no arbitration upon these in the draft scheme submitted by the Minister for Finance.  Then, as if that were not enough, the Minister's draft scheme contains this intimation: &ldquo;These must not be taken as exhaustive,&rdquo; so that having catalogued a list of matters which can never be the subject of arbitration, the Minister indicates that the list can be further extended by his intimation that &ldquo;these must not be taken as exhaustive,&rdquo; and that the list may be added to, in fact, any time in the future.</P>
    <P>Not content with having a veto over a category of important matters, a permanent veto which can never be evaded, the Minister wants also to have a veto over other matters which in the <Col N="1740" /> absence of their being catalogued in this way, are presumably matters which can be adjudicated upon by the arbitration tribunal.  So that we have two kind of vetoes.  We have a permanent category of cases which can never be brought before the arbitration tribunal because the Minister will not allow them to be brought there, and there is another catalogue of cases not definitely catalogued.  He takes power in his draft scheme to refuse to allow any of these cases to go to arbitration, if he so decides, so that you have two kinds of vetoes in the Minister's scheme&mdash;(1) a permanent veto over an important category of claims and (2) a veto which may be exercised over a large number of claims in such a way as to prevent even those claims from being brought to the arbitration board and adjudicated upon by that body. The House will readily recognise that that is a scheme of arbitration which has no parallel in this country and, indeed, no parallel in the history of arbitration as applied to the Civil Service in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister next wants to prohibit a full-time official and, I think, counsel from appearing before the arbitration tribunal.  The Civil Service organisations who would desire to present a claim to the arbitration board are organisations which are officially recognised not only by the Executive Council but by the various Departments in which they function.  They are actually in receipt of certificates from these Departments to the effect that they are fully recognised organisations. Although the Minister for Finance officially recognises the organisations, although his Department issued certificates to the organisations to the effect that they are officially recognised as entitled to represent matters on behalf of the members for whom they cater; yet, in this remarkable scheme of his the Minister says: &ldquo;I will not extend recognition to the full-time officers of these organisations in such a manner as to permit them to appear before the arbitration tribunal and plead cases on behalf of the organisations of which they are the recognised officials.&rdquo; In my opinion that is simply an attempt by the Minister completely and effectively to <Col N="1741" /> nullify the official recognition which the Executive Council and the Departments have extended to the Service organisations.  When presented with this issue at the Brennan Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service, four members of the commission&mdash;Mr. L.J. Duffy, Mr. Thomas Johnson, Mrs. Mary Kettle and, then, Senator L. Robinson &mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existing rule which prevents a staff association from sending as one of its representatives to the council&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>they were then referring to the so-called Civil Service Representative Council&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;its own chosen official unless that person is a civil servant, should be revoked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These four members of the Commission said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This rule is a survival from the days before organised negotiation and collective bargaining became the recognised practice in the industrial world.  It is indefensible once the principle of association amongst staffs and discussion with their representatives has been accepted. The staff organisation should be trusted to appoint whom they consider best able to present their case effectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those four members of the Commission, when they were dealing with the recognition which should be afforded to full-time officials of recognised organisations, declared themselves as of opinion that the rule prohibiting the full recognition of whole-time officers was a survival from the days before organised negotiation and collective bargaining became the recognised practice in the industrial world. They declared that that restriction was indefensible once the principle of association amongst the staffs and discussion with their representatives had been accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can look after the other 12.  These four members expressed that view in respect of this piece of tyranny which the Minister for Finance is now perpetuating. No justification whatever is to be found, either in this country or outside <Col N="1742" /> it, for the tyranny which the Minister is endeavouring to perpetuate under this draft scheme of arbitration. In Great Britain, full-time officials of Civil Service organisations are frankly recognised, and, apparently, their contact with the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not bring down the British Empire.  In the United States, the full-time officials of Civil Service organisations are also frankly recognised and there, apparently, it is not considered that any great damage is done, because of that, to the industrial, financial or economic stability of that vast country.  In Australia, full-time officials of Civil Service organisations are fully and frankly recognised.  In New Zealand and in South Africa, the same practice operates.  Even in the Six-Counties, the Government recognise a full-time official of a Civil Service organisation. When we survey that portion of the world which consists of Great Britain, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, we find that the only portion of that territory where full-time officials of Civil Service organisations are not recognised is that small piece in which the Minister for Finance, who promised arbitration in 1932, functions.  These other countries have not been shaken by the full and frank recognition of the right of Civil Service organisations to be represented by officials of their own choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of these countries, the standard of prosperity of the people is immensely better than it is here. Most of these countries have much more complicated problems to deal with than we have.  Yet, in each and every one of them, there is full and frank recognition of the right of Civil Service organisations to be represented by advocates of their own choice.  Here, under what is described as a republican Government, pursuing a radical policy, a Government which, we are sometimes told, is a poor man's Government, a definite and deliberate attempt is made by the Minister for Finance, with what measure of backing from the Executive Council I do not know, to nullify the right of Civil Service organisations <Col N="1743" /> to be represented by persons of their own choice.  This condition in the Minister's draft scheme of arbitration to prevent full-time officers from being selected to represent their members before the arbitration tribunal is nothing less than a calculated piece of anti-trade union bias, and discloses the real mentality of the Minister for Finance in the matter of trade union organisation and as regards the principle of organisation amongst Civil Service staffs.  The tyranny which he has sought to embody in this draft scheme of arbitration has no parallel in countries still subject to democratic government.  The only democratic country in the world that I know of where it is sought to perpetuate this piece of tyranny is the Irish Free State, under the present Executive Council and under the present Minister for Finance.  I do not know that that is anything of which the Fianna Fáil Party, claiming to be a republican Party, a radical Party and a poor man's Party, are entitled to boast.</P>
    <P>That does not end, of course, the limitations in the Minister's scheme. He appoints the chairman.  He has two vetoes over the cases to be dealt with.  He restricts the right of full-time officials to go before the arbitration board if the members of the organisation they represent so desire; but, on top of all these restrictions, he wants to impose a further restriction, namely, to have a final veto over any award that is made by the tribunal.  The staff, therefore, can go to play a game with the Minister for Finance.  They can win the game, but the Minister for Finance wants to have the right to chalk up the score. The staff can win the game, but the Minister for Finance keeps the score board and makes sure that he does not lose on the manipulation of that instrument.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's scheme of arbitration. This is the scheme of arbitration to implement the promise made by the President in Rathmines.  This is the scheme of arbitration which is to implement the promise of the <Col N="1744" /> Minister for Finance when he said on the 10th February, 1932:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yes, the Fianna Fáil Party has already indicated that it is prepared to investigate the grievances, particularly in the lower ranks, of the Civil Service, and to provide, for the purpose of settling disputes, an arbitration tribunal subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the scheme of arbitration which is now offered by the Minister for Finance in fulfilment of that very specific promise made by him on the 10th February, 1932, over his own signature.  The scheme which is being offered to the service organisations is a thoroughly and absolutely unsatisfactory scheme.  The service was promised in specific and definite language by the President and by the Minister for Finance and by a number of other members of the Fianna Fáil Party that an impartial tribunal would be established to settle differences, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas.  We are offered now a spurious, counterfeit scheme which the Minister nicknames arbitration in fulfilment of this definite and specific promise made by him and other members of his Party.  The service was promised arbitration in 1932.  Now it is offered a miserably anaemic advisory board with none of the functions usually associated with arbitration, and devoid of all the essential features commonly associated with the machinery of arbitration in every circumstance in which that machinery is invoked for the settlement of disputes.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder then that the service organisations have contemptuously rejected this miserable scheme which was offered to them by the Minister, a scheme which does not fulfil what the Minister promised to give and what the President promised to give in 1932: a miserable scheme which is not arbitration, which is even a very poor type of advisory board. Of the many organisations in the Civil Service only one puny Departmental organisation, with a membership to put it generously, of about 100 could be induced, in the first instance, to accept the Minister's scheme.  I doubt if, <Col N="1745" /> even now, when they see the weaknesses, the pitfalls and the muzzles with which this scheme bristles that any single organisation could be induced to give the Minister's scheme a trial.</P>
    <P>Bad as the scheme was, unacceptable as the scheme was, shadow though it was of the promises made by the President and by the Minister for Finance in 1932, the service organisations endeavoured to secure a conference with the Government in order that their views on arbitration and the Government's views on arbitration might be discussed, and an effort made to reconcile the differences and to bridge the gulf between the organisations on the one hand and the Executive Council on the other.  One would imagine that, with the headquarters of the Government in the City of Dublin, and with the headquarters of all the organisations being situated in the same city, there would not be any difficulty whatever in obtaining an interview with the Minister for Finance or some other members of the Government, or perhaps, with some officials of the Department of Finance in order to discuss these matters, but no! The Minister for Finance does not do things in that simple way.  That is too smooth and too simple for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister wanted as complicated and as cumbersome a method as could be devised in order to have this matter discussed. He wanted to have the views of the organisations on his own scheme.  That was prescribed by him as a necessary condition of any consideration by him as to whether he would subsequently arrange a conference.  The Minister was told by the service organisations that the Government's scheme of arbitration was utterly unacceptable to the service organisations, and he was asked to arrange for a discussion on a scheme which would embody certain essential features of arbitration which the service organisations desired to secure.</P>
    <P>The service organisations indicated that they would regard a scheme of arbitration which would be acceptable to them as of necessity including five essential features.  I shall read for the House those five essential features <Col N="1746" /> prescribed by the service organisations, so that the House may have an opportunity of passing judgment on whether the claim made by the organisations in this respect was in any way unreasonable or extravagant. Bearing in mind that they were freely promised by the Government that an arbitration board would be established, the staff organisations asked the Minister for Finance to convene a conference to discuss an arbitration scheme containing the following essential features:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The chairman of the board to be appointed by agreement between the Government and the staff organisations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Each party to be free to select its representative on the board and its advocates before the board.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Each party to have the right to bring before the board any claim within a previously agreed category without veto by the other party, the board alone having the power to decide whether a particular claim falls within the agreed category.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Government to give effect to the award of the board, subject to the overriding authority of Parliament.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  In the event of a dispute as to the meaning of an award, the board to determine its own findings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the five reasonable features which the service organisations desired should be embodied in an acceptable scheme of arbitration. One would have imagined that, having been promised by the Government that an arbitration tribunal would be established, that having been told by the President that he believed it was only right that such a tribunal should be established to decide the matters in dispute, there would have been little difficulty in securing a conference with the Government to discuss so eminently reasonable a claim as that put forward by the service organisations.  But it was not so easy to secure a conference with the Government.  The service organisations were treated to long, verbose letters from the Department <Col N="1747" /> of Finance telling them that the Department of Finance wanted their detailed views on the Government's draft scheme of organisation, although they had been told in a number of letters that the scheme was utterly and absolutely unacceptable because it was not a scheme of arbitration at all.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made by the Service organisations to try to stop the interminable correspondence which threatened to go on in the matter by pressing for a definite conference, but the Minister for Finance was like Pharaoh &mdash;the more efforts were made on the subject, the harder his heart became. The President was then asked to intervene in order to end the deadlock which had arisen between the Minister and the Service organisations and, instead of the President trying to deal with the matter along some new and reasonable line, we were treated to an exhibition of logic-chopping from the President, explaining why it was not possible to make the scheme any better. We were told by the President that the scheme submitted by the Minister for Finance goes as far as is compatible with the Constitution. Fancy the President, in 1937, being concerned with the compatibility of his promises with the enforced Constitution which he has denounced in this House on dozens and dozens of occasions.  For every other purpose, the Constitution has been periodically denounced by the President, but in respect of arbitration it was a very sacred and sacrosanct document which could not be touched by the President, and although he would mutilate it and carve it up for any other purpose&mdash; and is about to do so again shortly&mdash; he was not going to subject it to the most minor surgical operation in order to get over the difficulties which he alleged he saw in respect of giving effect to his promise to establish an arbitration board.</P>
    <P>We were told by the President in his letter that the scheme goes as far as is possible, having regard to the constitutional difficulties, but never once were we told in the correspondence what exactly the constitutional <Col N="1748" /> difficulties were.  There were obscure, and, at times, verbose reference to constitutional difficulties, but never once, in all the letters which were written by the President and by the Department of Finance was there any precise indication of the impediments which were found in the Constitution to prevent the President honouring his own freely expressed promise.  Not a single lawyer of eminence was produced in support of the claim made by the President that there were constitutional difficulties which prevented the introduction of a better and more acceptable scheme.  Not a single lawyer was produced by the Government to support their contention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it would be strange if the Minister's presumption were right on this matter, seeing that he is wrong so often on other matters. We had Deputy Costello, during a discussion on this matter in the Dáil some time ago, as an eminent lawyer, as a man who is very well known at the Irish Bar, and as an ex-Attorney-General, going on record as saying that he did not know of any constitutional difficulties which existed in the matter of implementing an acceptable scheme of arbitration.  That, at all events, is very definite testimony from an eminent Irish counsel that, so far as his knowledge of law goes, and so far as his knowledge of the Constitution goes&mdash;and he can claim to have a substantial knowledge of both&mdash;he knew of no impediment to the implementation <Col N="1749" /> within the Constitution of the promise made by the President to establish an arbitration board.  We were told, of course, that these constitutional difficulties were the reason why the President could not introduce a more acceptable scheme of arbitration. We were told, of course, in earlier letters from the President and from the Minister for Finance, that he wanted the views of the staff organisations on his own scheme, and that when he got those views he would then consider whether he would arrange a conference to discuss the matters at issue.  That was the pretence up to the 1st of January, 1937. That was the masquerade that was being worked off on the Service up to the 1st of January, 1937, but in a letter dated the 1st of January from the Department of the President, the Service organisations were told:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government has therefore decided not to introduce in Dáil Eireann the Bill which would give effect to the scheme unless the organisations indicate that they are prepared to accept the scheme, and in the event of enactment by the Dáil to co-operate in giving effect to the statute.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that, while for nearly two years the Executive Council carried on the pretence that it wanted the views of the staff organisations on its own scheme, this letter, signed by the Secretary of the President's Department let the cat out of the bag on the whole matter, because it clearly indicated that what the Government wanted the organisations to do was, not to give their views on the Government's scheme, but to swallow the scheme holus-bolus and to give a certificate as well that they would co-operate in giving effect to the statute which enshrined such a spurious scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the constitutional difficulties prevented a better scheme from being introduced &mdash; that the scheme was as far as the President could go, having regard to certain constitutional difficulties, which could be wiped out, by the way, in respect of every other matter when they interfered with the President, but which could not be removed at all once it came to giving effect <Col N="1750" /> to his Rathmines promise.  One would imagine, though, that an astute political mind like the President's would not have been slow to indicate the precise constitutional difficulties, if, in fact, any existed at all; but never once was the precise difficulty or difficulties indicated to the Service organisations, and, in my opinion, expressed as a layman but fortified by views which have been obtained from eminent counsel, there is no real difficulty whatever in implementing an acceptable scheme of arbitration within the framework of the present Constitution. If the Government believe there is, have they submitted this matter to the Attorney-General for his views on the matter?  Have they got any advice from any eminent counsel that there is any impediment whatever in the way of giving effect to an acceptable scheme of arbitration within the framework of the present Constitution? In my opinion there is no real constitutional difficulty whatever. The Executive Council pretend to see constitutional difficulties, because they now want to ride away from the very solemn promise which was made on their behalf in 1932.</P>
    <P>In any case, let us examine for a few moments in what way a constitutional difficulty would arise.  An acceptable arbitration board could be established and a case could be referred to that arbitration tribunal.  It could be heard by the tribunal.  An award could be made by the tribunal. The award could be issued by the tribunal and sent to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance could consider the award of the tribunal.  If he felt that the award was a preposterous award, such as went absolutely counter to the merits of the case and the weight of evidence which supported the case, there would be nothing to prevent the Minister for Finance saying: &ldquo;I am not going to be bound by an extravagant and preposterous award of that kind.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance in that situation had all the financial control that was necessary for him to have under the Constitution or the Standing Orders of the House.  Or, if the Minister for Finance received the award and considered it, he might feel, of course, <Col N="1751" /> that it was rather hard luck on him that he had lost the case before the tribunal.  He might consider that the tribunal should not have given so much to the staff organisations but that he was bound to accept it having regard to the fact that he appointed the chairman of the tribunal, that he had a representative on the tribunal and that those persons had come to the conclusion that the staff had made an excellent and an unanswerable case for the claim which they made.  In that event, the Minister for Finance must, of course, decide, whether he liked it or not, that he was morally bound to accept the award.</P>
    <P>If the award did not involve the expenditure of money, the Minister for Finance would, of course, issue a finance circular giving effect to the award that he had accepted.  If something more than the issue of the finance circular were necessary, if, for instance, the Minister felt that the circular had to be reinforced by a cash payment, the Minister would of his own volition come to the House with a Supplementary Estimate and ask the Dáil to pass that Supplementary Estimate in a perfectly free and uncontrolled manner.  In that case, the Minister had in his own control the absolute right to initiate the expenditure of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the Dáil did not pass it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Dáil did not pass it, the Minister for Finance was in no way responsible because the service organisations have accepted the position that every award of this tribunal is subject to the over-riding authority of the Dáil.  That scheme of arbitration would enable the Minister to have absolute control over the initiation of expenditure inasmuch as it would be on him the responsibility would devolve for initiating a Supplementary Estimate and passing it through this House.  If the Minister were being asked to pay an award, which from the standpoint of reason and merit appeared to be preposterous, the Minister also would have a remedy inasmuch as he controls a majority in this House, and he would not, therefore, <Col N="1752" /> be bound to give effect to any award which, as the custodian of the nation's interests, he felt was utterly extravagant, having regard to all the considerations which revolved around the matter.  The staff scheme provided for an acceptance of the position that the authority of the Dáil would be supreme, that every award made by the tribunal should be accepted, on the one hand, by the staff organisations and on the other hand, by the Minister for Finance, subject all the time to the over-riding authority of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks of constitutional difficulties.  The President also talks of constitutional difficulties.  The President does not see how a better scheme of arbitration could be reconciled with the Constitution, but it is rather strange that these constitutional difficulties have only arisen in connection with the Civil Service scheme of arbitration.  In 1932 the Fianna Fáil Party promised arbitration to the Civil Service.  In 1932 nothing was done by the Government to implement the promise of arbitration to the Civil Service; but in that very same year, and with the very same Constitution as exists to-day, we had the President standing up in those benches and saying that he was prepared to offer arbitration to the British Government on the question whether we are legally and morally liable to pay the land annuities and the other disputed moneys to the British Government.  He indicated further that if the award of that arbitration tribunal went against the Saorstát, the Government would be prepared to pay over the disputed moneys.  So that when it came to a question of arbitration with the British on a disputed sum of over £5,000,000 per annum, a sum which is 20 or 25 per cent. of our total tax revenue, there was no constitutional difficulty at all.  The President offered Mr. Thomas arbitration and told Mr. Thomas in advance that he would accept the verdict of an arbitration tribunal of that kind.  Where were the constitutional difficulties then?  We had the same Constitution then that we have now but no constitutional difficulties existed then. <Col N="1753" /> No constitutional difficulties existed when the President offered arbitration to Mr. Thomas from the platform of this House, but constitutional difficulties of a make-believe kind have been discovered by the Executive Council now, when they want to sidetrack their solemn promise to establish an arbitration board for the Civil Service.  I should like the Minister to tell us, and I would like him to get some of these legal people, who support his view that there are constitutional difficulties, to tell us under what section of the Constitution the President can promise the British arbitration, when a sum of £5,250,000 per annum is involved, when he cannot fulfil the promise of a scheme of arbitration which he made to the Civil Service in 1932.  The Civil Service were promised arbitration in 1932 and they cannot get it.  Mr. Thomas was not promised arbitration, but the President was tumbling over himself offering arbitration to the British in a dispute concerning a sum which plays such an important part in the industrial and economic life of the nation.</P>
    <P>But to get back to the promise; the staff have made a claim for an arbitration tribunal such as they were promised in 1932.  The President then promised an arbitration board definitely, and very deliberately.  There was no condition attached to that promise.  There were no restrictions attached to the promise.  There were no implications whatever that the promise of arbitration was in respect of any scheme of arbitration other than that generally known and generally understood.</P>
    <P>The staff have claimed that that promise of arbitration by the President involves the giving to them of a reasonable and an acceptable scheme, but the scheme submitted to the staff organisations is not an acceptable scheme and is in no sense in conformity with the promise made to them. The staff have asked for a scheme of arbitration which is in no sense and in no respect in conflict with the Constitution. The Government have been asked to convene a conference in order <Col N="1754" /> to discuss the matters at issue, in order to explore the possibilities of agreement, and in order that these alleged constitutional difficulties can be examined; but the Government are not prepared either to convene a conference or negotiate in any respect to try to devise an acceptable scheme of arbitration which could be utilised for the settlement of disputes between the Civil Service organisations and the Minister for Finance, a scheme of arbitration, in short, which would fulfil the very specific promise made by the President in 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister pretends to believe that it is impossible for him to devise an acceptable scheme of arbitration because it would involve the taking out of his hands the power which he believes should be reserved solely for exercise by him.  We had an effort by the Minister for Finance, during a discussion on the question of arbitration in this House on 26th March, 1936 (column 521, Parliamentary Debates) to appear in the role of a bogey-man in respect of the constitutional difficulties.  He was endeavouring then to pretend that the scheme of arbitration in the British Civil Service was of a kind which had all the limitations such as he was endeavouring to foist on the Service here, and in order to try to ground that absurd and erroneous contention by the Minister he quoted portion of a document issued by the British Financial Secretary and dated the 9th March, 1926.  That document was represented as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But behind all such questions there is an underlying principle which must never be lost sight of. It is that the Government of the day, to whatever political Party it may belong, is responsible to Parliament for the administration of the public service.  It cannot relieve itself of this responsibility, or share it with any other persons or organisation. When, therefore, the Government accepted the principle of arbitration for the settlement of disputes arising between the Executive and the servants of the State, in the earnest desire to promote the harmonious working of our institutions under <Col N="1755" /> fair conditions of service for all concerned, it could only do so within certain defined limits and it could not delegate to any other authority the duty of determining what those limits should be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the quotation then made by the Minister for Finance and it was quoted entirely out of its context.  Let us have the whole document that was issued by the Financial Secretary at the time.  Let the Minister for Finance quote here the speeches made by the Financial Secretary in the British House of Commons.  That document is a document which has been cooked by the Minister for Finance, deliberately torn out of its context, deliberately used to pretend that it means something which the Minister knows it does not mean.  The British Financial Secretary was then indicating, in explanation of his arbitration scheme, that it was necessary to exclude certain matters from the subject of arbitration.  He was indicating then that there were certain kinds of cases which could not be arbitrated upon and that he wanted to exclude those cases from consideration by an arbitration tribunal and that he was insisting upon a limitation in respect, of arbitration, such as the staff organisations here and in Great Britain had always been prepared to agree to, namely, the limitation that every award must be subject to the over-riding authority of Parliament.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted, he could have obtained from the British Treasury a copy of the circular which they issued to the staff organisations in Great Britain on the subject of the establishment of an arbitration court in Great Britain.  The circular is dated 14th March, 1925, and it opens with this declaration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to inform you that under the recommendations of the Committee appointed to consider the detailed arrangements necessary to give effect to the decision of the Government to accept the principle of arbitration for the Civil Service the necessary steps are now being <Col N="1756" /> taken to constitute an Arbitration Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The circular goes on to deal with the personnel of the court and to deal with the types of cases which will be excluded from consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They do exclude some cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they do exclude some, and there has been no indication to the Minister for Finance that it was not possible to get agreement with the staff organisations here on the exclusion of certain types of cases from consideration by the arbitration tribunal.  The staff organisations here have been prepared to consent to certain exclusions, but once that category of excluded cases is decided upon, there should be no veto over the other cases which could go to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy admits the principle of exclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has already indicated his view on that matter and the Minister ought to be able to comprehend it.  The circular goes on further, and this is the portion which flatly contradicts the manner in which the Minister for Finance endeavoured to use the portion of a previous circular when this matter was discussed in the Dáil in March last year.  Paragraph (4) sets out:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to this limitation, failing agreement by negotiation, arbitration by the court will be open to Government Departments on the one hand and to recognised associations of Civil Servants.... on the other hand, on application by either party, in regard to certain matters affecting conditions of service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was no veto there by the Chancellor of the Exchequer over a broad category of cases which he acknowledged could be brought to arbitration and made the subject of decision by an arbitration tribunal.  In the last paragraph of the circular it is declared:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the over-riding authority of Parliament the Government <Col N="1757" /> will give effect to the awards of the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, far from desiring to impose on Civil Service organisations across Channel the vexatious restriction which the Minister seeks to impose here, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that once you had a certain category of cases defined as cases which were non-arbitrable the staff organisations could bring to arbitration any cases which fell into any other category exclusive of the categories which were non-arbitrable.  Once they decided to bring a claim in that category there was no veto by the Chancellor of the Exchequer over the type of case they could bring; and once the case was brought to arbitration and the arbitration tribunal adjudicated upon it the Chancellor of the Exchequer bound himself in this circular to accept the award of the tribunal, subject to the overriding authority of Parliament.  The attempt, therefore, by the Minister for Finance to pretend that the British scheme of arbitration has limitations similar to those contained in his draft scheme is utterly contrary to the facts of the situation.  If the Minister did not know the position in Great Britain one could understand his disseminating a false impression at that time, but with advisers to guide him on these matters the attempt to give that impression to the House is unworthy of a Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This motion asks that the Executive Council should forthwith enter into a conference with the Civil Service organisation to devise a scheme of arbitration acceptable to both sides. Is there anything unreasonable, having regard to the Government's very definite promises on arbitration, that they should be requested by this House to enter into a conference with the service organisations to devise an acceptable scheme of arbitration?  At one time they used to be in favour of consultation between the Executive Council and the staff organisations. In 1930, when civil servants were agitating against the reduction in the cost-of-living bonus because they felt that the reduction was unjustified having regard to the prevailing high cost of living, an effort was made by <Col N="1758" /> the service organisations to induce an all-Party deputation to wait on the Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Finance to urge upon him that there should be no reduction in the cost-of-living bonus pending an inquiry into the method of calculating the cost-of-living index figure.  The present Minister for Finance was an enthusiastic supporter of that claim.  The service organisations interviewed the Fianna Fáil Party at that time and also Deputies of other Parties.  The Fianna Fáil Party informed the service organisations that they would require time to consider this matter and, on 14th August, 1930, the service organisations received this letter from the Fianna Fáil Party:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have to inform you that the Fianna Fáil Party committee has considered the request made by the deputation from the Cost-of-Living Bonus Joint Committee, which met the undersigned on the 6th instant, and has agreed to appoint Mr. Seán Lemass with another member of this Party to join the deputation to the Minister for Finance for the purpose of advocating: (1) that the constitution of the Civil Service Representative Council be revised, in consultation with Civil Service organisations, in a manner that will be acceptable to all parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other matters are dealt with in the course of the letter, one dealing with the question of an inquiry into the method of calculating the cost-of-living index figure, and another pledging the Fianna Fáil Party to support the frustration of any reduction in the cost-of-living bonus, particularly in relation to the lower salaries in the Civil Service.  But, in 1930, the Fianna Fáil Party, in this letter over the signatures of two such notabilities as Seán F. Lemass and Gerald Boland, declared that they believed the constitution of the Civil Service Representative Council should be revised &ldquo;in consultation with the Civil Service organisations, in a manner that will make it acceptable to all parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in 1930.  After five years of office as Minister for Finance nothing whatever has been done to revise this sterile Civil Service Representative Council, which is not recognised by any of the staff organisations, and exists now only as the boycotted plaything of the Minister for Finance.  The body in question is called the Civil Service Representative Council.  If ever there was an abuse and misuse of English, it is in the attempt to endow a body, which nobody recognises, as a representative council.  That organisation, even before it secured the paternity of the Minister for Finance, had long been recognised as an official muzzle by the staff organisations; and, in 1930, whatever the Minister for Finance may pretend to believe now, his Party then believed it was in need of revision, in consultation with the service organisations, and in such a manner as would make the council acceptable to all parties concerned.</P>
      <P>But the point I want to make in connection with this rather remarkable letter is that in 1930 the Fianna Fáil Party believed that the service organisations should be consulted in the revision of machinery in which they were vitally concerned.  There is a very definite declaration on behalf of the Party that the service organisations should be consulted in remoulding the Civil Service Representative Council in such a manner as to make it acceptable to the staff organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Executive Council is now being asked to consult with the service organisations, and to do on the question of arbitration what they promised the Civil Service to do in 1930.  The Executive Council is being asked to enter into a conference with the Civil Service organisations to devise a scheme of arbitration acceptable to both sides. Having regard to the promises of the Government, having regard to the contents of this letter, and to the fact that the Government Party got votes in 1932 and 1933 in exchange for their promises on arbitration, is there anything unreasonable in asking the Executive Council to enter into a conference with Irish civil servants on the question of arbitration, when it is remembered <Col N="1760" /> that they were so profuse in offering arbitration to Mr. Thomas, who was the mouthpiece of a country that imposed penal tariffs on our produce and engaged in an effort to impose a stranglehold on the political and economic destinies of the country? Apparently anyone can get arbitration from the Executive Council except those to whom arbitration was promised in 1932.</P>
    <P>This motion gives the Government an opportunity to redeem the promise which the President made on their behalf.  We are being constantly told by Government speakers that they had fulfilled all the promises made by their Party in 1932.  Here is a promise which very definitely was not fulfilled. The Minister for Finance and his Party got the votes of civil servants in 1932 and 1933 in return for that particular promise.  The promise was used in order to get votes.  The Executive Council is now being asked to enter into a conference with the Civil Service organisations so that an acceptable scheme of arbitration may be devised, which will implement the promise to give civil servants some satisfactory machinery under which their grievances can be adjudicated upon by an impartial authority, in which the Civil Service, the Government and the whole community can have absolute confidence.  The service organisations are not asking for anything unreasonable. They are asking for a scheme of arbitration which contains features usually associated with the administration of arbitration machinery. If the President and the Executive Council are prepared to enter into a conference on that basis, a satisfactory scheme can be devised within 24 hours, but the service organisations are not prepared to take from the Minister for Finance the scheme described by him as &ldquo;a draft scheme of arbitration,&rdquo; which bears none of the characteristics usually associated with arbitration.</P>
    <P>I submit this motion to the House in order that Deputies may pass judgment on the reasonableness or otherwise of the claim made by the service organisations, and so that the House may have an opportunity of advising the Government on this question.  I <Col N="1761" /> feel satisfied that if the House were free to vote on this issue there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the motion.  If the Minister for Finance feels that he has a strong and convincing case in favour of his own scheme, and against the attitude adopted by the service organisations, then he should not be afraid to leave the matter to a free vote of the House. He should be prepared to take off the Whips, and to allow the question to be decided by the rules of reason, by the rules of fair play, and by the rules of conduct which usually regulate the attitude of people who promised to support arbitration, and who, on an issue like this, might be willing to do so if only the Party Whips were taken off.  A number of members of the Government Party have given a solemn promise to the service organisations to vote for a scheme of arbitration such as these organisations have claimed. If Deputies were allowed to exercise their votes freely there is no doubt whatever that they would do so on behalf of the reasonable claims made by the service organisations.  Is the Minister for Finance prepared to allow even those Deputies to exercise their votes freely on this issue?  Is he prepared to allow them to exercise their own judgment, in view of the definite promises that have been made to the service organisations, or is he going to force them to tear up the promises they made and to vote not in accordance with their promises or their <Col N="1762" /> desires and not as reason dictates?</P>
    <P>That is the test as to whether the Minister is reasonable or not in this issue.  If the Minister wants to be reasonable the way to show the staff organisations that that is his attitude is to say if he is prepared to allow this question to be judged by the representatives of the people, and to take off the Party Whips.  If the Minister does that, I venture to predict that he will not get a dozen Deputies into the Division Lobby with him.  They will only be got into the same Lobby with him by coercion.  By threats of Party discipline they will be made even to break their promises to the service organisations, rather than be allowed to vote in accordance with the dictates of their conscience.  There is nothing unreasonable in the scheme of arbitration demanded by the service organisations, and accordingly I submit this motion to the House, in the confident hope that every Deputy who exercises free and independent judgment will vote for it, and will instruct the Executive Council to take the reasonable course marked out for them.</P>
