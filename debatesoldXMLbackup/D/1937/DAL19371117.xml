      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that remittances sent home to parents by emigrant children are being taken into account for the purposes of assessing the means of applicants for the old age pension, and in view of the fact that these sums are gifts and not regular income, whether he will direct that they are not to be taken into account when assessing means in old age pensions cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Remittances sent to parents for their own use by emigrant children are taken into account in assessing for old age pensions purposes the means of the parents.  Under the Old Age Pensions Acts in calculating the means of a person for such purposes, account must be taken of all income in cash which that person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.

      <P>Does the Minister realise that these remittances are purely gifts, and that if they are to be taken into account when assessing income for the purposes of the Old Age Pensions Act they will stop?  Is the Minister aware that British pensions were cut in order to bring them down to 6/- because his Department took the British pensions into consideration when the recipients were applying for old age pensions, and that if you take fortuitous income of that kind from outside into consideration the effect is to reduce the income from outside in order to allow the Government to take over their share of the burden?</P>

Every possible piece of information which is in my possession for the purpose of enabling a case on the facts to be stated, I am prepared to give.  The actual position, so far as the particular point which the Deputy raises is concerned is this, that on minor employment schemes where the scales of unemployment assistance do not exceed 8/6, the men get three days per week; from 9/- to 11/6 inclusive, four days per week; 12/- and 12/6 inclusive, five days per week.  For Roads (Rural) when the wage is 5/- per day:&mdash;where the unemployment assistance scale is not exceeding 10/-, three days per week; from 10/6 to 12/6, four days per week.  If there is any other information of any kind that anybody wants in relation to any particular scheme, in relation to any scale relating to any scheme, in relation to the circumstances surrounding every scheme, I am entirely at his disposal.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that large tracts of land situated near tidal rivers have been covered with water for a considerable time past owing to breaches in the embankments; that the tenants who are not in a financial position to carry out the necessary repair work are required by the Land Commission authorities to pay annuities in respect of the flooded lands from which no revenue is derivable; and if he will have inquiries made for the purpose of (1) introducing more economical and efficient methods of embankment maintenance; (2) repairing existing breaches, and (3) amending the law so that tenants of flooded lands will be freed from annuities in respect of that part of their holdings which is temporarily submerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in some cases flooding of land has occurred following damage to embankments through various causes&mdash;including, I regret to say, neglect and misuse by occupants of neighbouring holdings.  The existing Land Acts contain provisions for the maintenance of embankments by the parties responsible therefore and the Land Commission, when called upon to do so, has shown itself willing to give such assistance as it is authorised to provide by statute, where the tenant purchasers concerned are prepared to accept and carry out reasonable proposals for repair and preservation.  In some instances, I regret to say that <Col N="968" /> the tenant purchasers concerned have not met the Land Commission's offers of assistance in a reasonable spirit but have made exaggerated demands and adopted obstructive tactics, with the result that their lands remain flooded. I fear that some tenant purchasers fail to realise that, as owners in fee simple of their farms, they have acquired the interest which was formerly the landlord's, and that the possession of this interest involves responsibilities as well as advantages.</P>
      <P>It should be understood that where holdings have been vested in purchasers the Land Commission is not under obligation to maintain embankments. Such responsibility rests primarily on the adjacent tenant purchasers themselves, assisted by such trust funds as may have been created for the purpose consequent on the sale of estates to the tenants.</P>
      <P>I do not see any present necessity for the institution of such enquiries as the Deputy suggests.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Presidential Seal Bill," RHead="1937&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Presidential Seal Bill, 1937&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  It is a Bill of a more or less formal character.  Its purpose is to provide a seal for the President, and to arrange for the use of that seal, its authentication and its acceptance in evidence.  It is really a Committee Stage Bill, and, perhaps, the best thing I can do is to take the sections in their order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first section says that this Act shall come into operation immediately on the coming into operation of the <Col N="987" /> new Constitution.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 sets forth that the Minister for Finance shall provide a seal.  Sub-section (2) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The presidential seal shall be officially and judicially noticed, and every order, commission, warrant, or other instrument sealed with the presidential seal shall, if such seal purports to be authenticated in accordance with this Act, be received in evidence without further proof, and, in particular, it shall not be necessary to prove any signature affixed to such instrument for the purpose of such authentication or to prove the office or authority of the person whose signature such signature purports to be.</P>
    <P>The purpose there is that the presence of the seal on the document shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it is what it purports to be.  The presumption is to be that if a document, purporting to be a document sealed by the President or by the commissions which will act instead of the President on certain occasions, is presented, the presentation of the document will obviate the necessity of proof that it is what it purports to be.  If somebody should come forward and say that the document is, as a matter of fact, a fraud, I take it that this provision would not prevent the court from investigating that contention and that the court could, in fact, examine that question and see whether the document was what it purported to be.  This sub-section simply dispenses with the need of proof but it does not say that, if objection were raised, that objection could not be considered by the court. The next sub-section is of similar character.  A signed and sealed document is itself to be regarded as proof that all the things that had to be done have been done and that all the advice in accordance with the Constitution that had to be taken has been taken before the sealing of the instrument. It places the burden of proof on anybody who holds the contrary.</P>
    <P>In Section 3, you have three, more or less, similar sub-sections&mdash;one dealing <Col N="988" /> with the case where the President is himself in office, one dealing with the preliminary period when the commission in accordance with Article 57 functions and the other dealing with the case where another commission of a slightly different character would operate.  The theory all the time is that the seal is the seal of the office of President and not the seal of the individual who holds the office.  Therefore, when the individual is not in the office the commissions which will exercise the functions of the office will use the seal.  Deputies are aware that the intention is to have a secretary to the President who shall be a permanent official, similar to the head of a Department, and who will not change with a change in the person of the President.  In the case of the commissions, two signatures and that of the secretary are necessary to authenticate the seal.  In the case of the President, the President's signature alone is sufficient.  The seal can only be applied on the direction of the commission when the commission is functioning or on the direction of the President himself when he is acting. Section 4 is, more or less, similar to Section 2 and provides</P>
    <P>(1)<i>Prima facie</i> evidence of any order, commission, warrant or other instrument issued or made by the President or by a commission exercising the powers or performing the functions of the President may be given in all courts of justice and in all legal proceedings by the production of a copy of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> purporting to contain such instrument or by the production of a copy of such instrument purporting to be printed under the superintendence or authority of and to be published by the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>That is a provision similar to that which we have in the case of other documents of a like character.  Under sub-section 2 of Section 4, it is provided that the Documentary Evidence Act, 1925, which provides penalties for the misuse or misrepresentation of documents of this sort, will apply in like manner as it applies to the misuse of Ministerial and other documents at <Col N="989" /> present.  That is all the Bill contains and I ask the House to pass the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained by the President, the object of the Bill is to inform the House and the public of the implications which will follow upon the affixing of the seal rather than to provide the seal itself or regulate when it may be used.  We are at a loss for knowledge on a few matters in regard to this seal.  A seal was being operated for certain purposes in this country.  Perhaps the President does not think that that seal suits the present time.  We are rather peculiarly placed with regard to our internal and external affairs and we have chosen to make a line of demarcation between the two.  We should like to know if the seal which the President proposes to place at the disposal of the Uachtarán will be affixed to, say, treaties made between this country and other countries.  Will it be used in any way at all with regard to our external affairs, or will our external affairs be dealt with in that rather peculiar fashion laid down in the Dáil some time ago that, for the purposes of our external affairs, we would have the same king as other countries?  We should all like to know whether, if we are going to have a national seal in the hands of Uachtarán na hEireann, it is going to be put on these documents I refer to, or is it to be used simply in relation to our internal affairs.  So far as we have heard to-day, nothing has been mentioned except documents which relate to our internal affairs and the fixing of a seal to those is, of course, an absolute necessity.  It is quite probable, too, that the new seal is required because of the change of name, but I should like the President to inform us on these other points because we are very peculiarly placed in this matter and we should like to know exactly where we are with regard to our seal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some rather peculiar things in this connection on which, like Deputy <Col N="990" /> Brennan, I should like some information as to how our external affairs are going to be dealt with.  There does not seem to be here anything referred to except an order, commission, warrant, or other instrument.  It is really a question of dealing with these matters so that they should be recognised in court.  That seems to be the only thing this Bill contemplates.  It does not give us any help as to the occasions on which the official seal will be used.  I take it that when the President gives his consent to a statute to give it binding force, no seal will be required.  His mere signature, I take it, will be sufficient, but I should like to know what are the principal cases in which this seal is going to be used, and must be used.  The Bill leaves us very much in the dark.</P>
      <P>Again, it is rather curiously worded.</P>
      <P>The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Immediately after the commencement of this Act, the Minister for Finance shall provide an official seal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Suppose that official seal is lost.  There does not seem to be any power in the Minister for Finance to give another official seal.  I am sure the President remembers that rather interesting event in English history when King James II was leaving England.  He brought the great seal with him and dropped it in the Thames.  Chaos resulted because there was no great seal and nothing could be done.  No executive Act at all could be done owing to the absence of the physical thing, the great seal.  Here the President is given custody and control of the presidential seal.  Suppose he loses it, or it becomes worn out.  Is there power for him to get another one?  The Minister for Finance has to provide a seal and it is to remain for all time.  Further, I should like to know who is going to design the seal. Is that going to be left entirely to the Minister for Finance, or has it been designed already?  Will we have an opportunity of seeing what the seal is going to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that I should be asked to deal with the <Col N="991" /> Constitution on a measure of this sort.  The complaint seems to be that I did not go into the Constitution and speak about the functions of the President and what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What functions must be under seal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be determined, I take it, by statute later. If, for instance, there is a statute in which provision is made that a seal should be affixed, this statute will then apply.  For instance, there might be a provision in the Defence Forces Act that the commissions of officers would be sealed with the presidential seal.  What we are doing here is making general provision that if in any case there is to be a seal affixed, when it is affixed, these provisions will apply to the instrument.  We are providing a seal so that if there is any legislation which requires the affixing of a seal, the seal will be there.  In the Constitution I do not think a seal is mentioned in more than a few cases where the President's signature is required.  Therefore, if a seal is to become obligatory, in most cases it would become obligatory by legislation.  We are providing, as in the case of the Ministers and Secretaries Act where it was found useful to have a seal, that a seal should be provided and used in accordance with certain conditions. We are making provision that the special seal to be provided can be affixed to any Order, commission, warrant or other instrument.  I think the phrase &ldquo;other instrument&rdquo; is sufficiently wide to cover anything we may require in legislation.  We provide that this seal will be got and how it is to be used.  The danger that it may be lost is remote, but if we can provide it, in the first instance, by legislation such as this, I think we would be able to provide it by similar legislation, in any case of need.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should start with the assumption that we are going to lose these seals.  They will be in the custody of the President, and we ought to assume at the start that they will not be lost.  With regard to the other matters, they are really constitutional questions, and I do not think I should be asked at this stage to enter into the Constitution and explain what are the functions of the President and what are the provisions made in the Constitution with regard to our external affairs.  If the Deputy gets a copy of the Constitution and reads it, he will get all the information he has asked me for.  With regard to the design, that is being considered at present.  No definite decision has been taken in the matter, but, in all probability, the new seal will closely resemble the seal in use for the Executive Council at the present time.  In all probability, it will have a harp with perhaps the word &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; or something of that sort.</P>

      <P>We are now about to pass into law a measure for the election of a President.  As was pointed out at the various stages, we feel that it is open to a lot of abuse, and that the machinery provided does not appear to be in position to cope with the abuses that we are afraid will crop up.  The really weak points in the Bill are, I am afraid, still in it.  I do not think the Minister's inventive genius has helped him on this occasion, as there are some very big points not covered, particularly with regard to anything that might be done to prevent personation by people interested in this election.  I am afraid the Minister has failed to deal with that in the Bill. Although we are agreeing to the passing of this measure, we feel that it is a futile attempt to elect some person in a loose kind of way, and that the machinery provided will be nothing more than a kind of cover or sham. However, the Bill has been dealt with and we are agreeable to let it go through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The original Act which we seek to continue by this Bill was <Col N="996" /> passed as a result of what was known as the Erne decision of the Supreme Court.  I am sure every Deputy remembers what that decision was, that the Erne was declared to be a public fishery and that other rivers would be governed by the same decision. At that time it was considered that it might not be advisable, from the point of view of the fisheries, that a free right of public fishing should be allowed on the River Erne, as it was considered to be a very prolific river, and it was feared there would be a fair amount of damage done if indiscriminate fishing was allowed.  An Act was brought in in 1934 to regulate public fishing on the River Erne and other rivers concerned in the same decision. That Act was to continue for 12 months.  It was brought in hastily, and there was admittedly very little time for the consideration of the problem.  At the end of the 12 months it was renewed for two years.  I hoped at that time that what was referred to as the major Inland Fisheries Bill might be brought in.  That is manifestly impossible now, and even if the major Bill were ready it could not possibly pass through all stages before December 31st.  Therefore, the renewal of this Bill is necessary.  The major Fisheries Bill is advanced, and, as a matter of fact, is now with the Parliamentary draftsman.  I hope it will emerge in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we are asking for an extension of two years.  The question of the estuarine fisheries will, of course, be dealt with in the major Bill in a comprehensive way.  When it comes before the House, Deputies will have the opportunity of giving their views as to the best way of dealing with those fisheries.  In the meantime, I am asking the Dáil to extend the present arrangement: that is, to give me authority, which I got under the 1934 Act and extended under the 1935 Act, to issue special licences for fishing in the River Erne and in the other rivers affected, and to charge special licences for the fishing there.  I am, however, asking the Dáil to agree to an amendment of that principle in this Bill.  The amendment is to the effect that fishermen be allowed to pay their licence fees by instalments.  The <Col N="997" /> licence fees are fairly high in the River Erne.  A fisherman owning a boat, with, say, three companions, finds it difficult at the beginning of the season to put down the full licence fee.  I am asking the Dáil to agree that I should be enabled to take the licence fee in instalments, divided into not more than four instalments.  If that is agreed to, a man will be asked to put down only 25 per cent. of the licence fee before the fishing commences.  He may be expected, in the ordinary way, to have some receipts to meet the other instalments as they become due. That is all that is provided for in this Bill as it stands at the moment.  I am, therefore, asking the Dáil to continue the present arrangement until the major Inland Fisheries Bill is introduced, which I hope will be in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill does not make any substantial alteration in the existing state of affairs.  The only alteration seems to be the payment of the licence fee by instalments. There is just one thing that I would like to bring to the Minister's notice. I have heard many reports that the fishery in the Erne was gone down very much; that, since it has ceased to be private property under a well-known decision, the fishery has deteriorated, and is deteriorating, very much.  I would like to know from the Minister if, from the information at his disposal, <Col N="998" /> that is a fact, because, of course, the salmon fishery is a very great asset to this State.  It is one of the most valuable things we have and it would be a serious loss to the State if it were allowed to deteriorate, and if other rivers were held to come under the Erne decision.</P>
      <P>If my memory is not at fault, I think it is correct to say that the Supreme Court have not yet decided the Moy fishery case.  As the Minister knows, a good deal of the evidence given in the Erne fishery case turned on a question of Irish history: as to when Magna Charta was promulgated in Ulster.  Now, it appears that the Moy fishery case, if decided in a certain way, may have the effect of cutting down very much the Erne fishery decision, because fresh historical knowledge has been brought to the notice of the Supreme Court in the Moy case which was not available in the Erne case.  I agree with the Minister that it would be better not to deal in a permanent measure with the fisheries in tidal waters until the law has been clarified more&mdash;until it is made more plain the rivers that will come under the Erne decision and private ownership be swept out.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take considerable care, now that private ownership has gone, that a river is not over-fished, and that permanent injury is not done to it.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said about the decline in the salmon fishing in the River Erne is, I think, true.  I do not think, however, that it has declined any more in the Erne than in other rivers.  There has been a decline this year as compared with last year.  That happens some years, but next year may be a very good year.  I do not think that the decline has been such as to justify anybody in saying that things have disimproved as a result of public ownership of the River Erne.  I agree with the Deputy that we should be very careful.  That was why we brought in legislation in 1934 to try and preserve the salmon fishing in the River Erne so far as we possibly could.  The Erne decision, I think, does not govern any river outside the County Donegal. <Col N="999" /> It does govern some small rivers in that county.  The Deputy referred to the fact that the Moy case is still before the courts.  I do not think, however, that that is any reason why we should delay the introduction of the major legislation until the courts have given a decision in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the 1925 Fisheries Act, there was a provision which enabled boards of conservators to levy a rate on the fisheries within their areas.  The local authority was, of course, in turn deprived of the proceeds of that rate.  There was a further provision in the Act which said that where local authorities, in order to recover what was lost to them, if they had to levy more than a penny rate over their areas, then the Fisheries Vote should carry the difference between what the loss was and what the penny rate would bring in. That, of course, was put into the 1935 Act so as to assure the local authorities that there would be at least some limit <Col N="1000" /> to the losses they might sustain under that Act.  Now, that particular provision has cost the State in or about £3,000 a year.  That is the return to the local authorities of the amount in excess of what the penny rate would bring in.</P>
      <P>That provision was continued two years ago also.  First of all, it was a ten-year provision, from 1925 to 1935, and two years ago, when the question of its extension came up for discussion, I asked the Dáil to wait until we would have this major Fisheries Bill drafted.  Now, however, I am informed by the legal people that it is not appropriate to the major Act but to a separate Act, and accordingly I am bringing in this provision again and asking the Dáil for authority to continue it for 12 years more.  That period of 12 years is chosen so as to give time for the major Act to become operative, and also to give time to enable us to see what would be the experience of the working of that Act, and to see if we would be justified, at the end of that period, in continuing this provision. Undoubtedly, it has had a very good effect up to the moment.  I think everybody, on all sides of the House, who take an interest in fisheries, will admit that since 1925 the protection of fisheries has been very much improved. That was possible because the conservators were getting an assured income from this source, to which I have referred, and I think it would be a great pity to deprive them of that source of income at this stage, or, indeed, for a long time to come, and that we should in fact say to them that we will continue this system for another 12 years, thereby giving them security to carry on whatever measures are being taken for the protection of fisheries so that there should be no slackening in that effort.  Therefore, I am asking the Dáil to continue the provision referred to for 12 years more, and the Dáil can then reconsider it.</P>

      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the second of a series of measures for the regulation of conditions of employment which the Government intimated its intention of introducing and having enacted.  As Deputies will remember, the first measure dealt with the conditions of employment of industrial workers. This Bill is intended to enact somewhat similar provisions for the benefit of persons employed in retail distribution, either as assistants in shops or in wholesale houses.  At the present time, the hours of trading in shops and the hours of conditions of employment in shops are regulated to some slight extent under two Acts&mdash;the Shops Act of 1912 and the Act of 1913.  When we were devising legislation for the amendment and the extension of those enactments, we contemplated producing one Bill to cover both the matters dealt with in the Bill now before the House and the better regulation of hours of trading. For legal reasons, however, into which it is not necessary to enter now, it was decided subsequently to divide the measure into two parts and to introduce two separate Bills&mdash;one, the Bill now before the House, and the other the Shop Hours Bill, permission to introduce which has been given to the Dáil but which has not yet been <Col N="1002" /> circulated.  I had hoped to have the two Bills before the Dáil at the same time, but some delay has occurred in the completion of the second measure and it will not be available before next week.  It is, however, desirable that the intention to produce that second Bill should be borne in mind, both in relation to the measure we are now discussing and to the position under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Shops Act of 1912 provided, firstly, for a weekly half-holiday for each shop assistant, and the closing of every shop at 1 p.m. on one day in every week. Under the existing law, there is no statutory regulation of the hours of work of adults, but the Act of 1912 restricted the employment of persons, under 18 years of age, to not more than 74 hours in every week, including meal-times.  That Act also provided for certain intervals for meals, and it empowered local authorities to make what are called closing orders&mdash;that is, orders fixing the hours at which certain classes of shops must close in the evening, provided that at least two-thirds of the occupiers of shops affected by the order gave their consent to it.  The Act, of course, provided that the closing hour must not be earlier than 7 p.m. except on the weekly half-holiday.  Shops carrying on the business of the retail sale of intoxicating liquor were not, and are not, required to close for a weekly half-holiday, but assistants employed in such shops must be granted, under the existing law, a half-holiday every week, and, furthermore, they are secured 14 consecutive days' annual holidays, and it is provided that they must not be employed, except at permitted overtime, for more than 72 hours in the week, exclusive of meal times.  The amount of permitted overtime is 90 hours in each year.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is very generally realised that the application of existing legislation to the Shops Act of 1912 is very limited.  In rural districts, for example, the only two provisions which stand are those which prohibit the working of young persons for more than 74 hours in the week and that which provides for seating <Col N="1003" /> accommodation for female assistants. In towns and rural areas closing orders may be made, and there is a weekly half-holiday only in cases in which orders have been made to have the premises closed at an early named hour.  The Shops Act, 1913, to which I also referred in its relation to this country, contains provisions regarding the hours of employment of persons employed in premises other than licensed premises in which is carried on the business of the sale of refreshments. The adoption of the provisions of that Act is optional.  Its main provisions are a maximum week of 65 hours, exclusive of meal times, 32 whole holidays on a week day in every year, 26 whole holidays on Sunday in every year, the Sunday holidays to be so distributed that at least one out of every three consecutive Sundays shall be a whole holiday.  It is the intention to repeal both these Acts.</P>
    <P>The present Bill deals with the restriction of the employment of juveniles, the restriction of working hours, meal times, holidays, regulation of wages, and arrangements for the health and comfort of members of staffs of shops.  The other Bill on the Order Paper, which will come before the House at an early date, will deal with the question of closing orders and hours of trading.  It is, I think, necessary at this stage to state to the House what precisely we are trying to do by legislation of this kind.  This Bill, when it becomes an Act, like the first Conditions of Employment Act, will have general application.  It is not intended to convey my opinion, or the opinion of the Government, that in any particular class of business the hours of work and the other conditions of employment should be as expressed in the Bill.  Some shop assistants at the present time may enjoy better working conditions than those for which the Bill provides, and other shop assistants may come to enjoy better conditions in the future.  What we are endeavouring to do by this legislation is to give workers employed in these shops a statutory right to minimum conditions; in other words, to fix a certain standard <Col N="1004" /> below which conditions in any shop cannot fall.</P>
    <P>Deputies may feel, and may be inclined to urge, that in some occupations, or for some classes of workers, conditions better than the minimum conditions provided in the Bill should operate.  They are entitled to that view.  But, in legislation of this kind, it is necessary to deal with circumstances in all trades and in all areas, and, because of its general application, provide merely for those improved conditions which can be made immediately operative.  If shop assistants by negotiation with their employers, or by general agreement otherwise, can secure better conditions than the minimum conditions which the Bill fixes, they are, of course, at liberty to get them and enjoy them.  The existing minimum conditions provided by law are those which I have stated and, in the light of modern conditions, everybody will, I think, agree that they are completely inadequate.  That is why we have to endeavour to raise them. Deputies who have studied the Bill will have noticed that we are proposing to raise them very considerably indeed.</P>
    <P>The Bill in the first place extends the definition of retail trade to include the business of a dyer and cleaner, the business of lending, for reward, of books and periodicals, and the business of pawnbroker.  I am sure everybody will agree that there is no good reason why persons employed in such establishments should not enjoy the same conditions as persons employed in ordinary shops.  What is, perhaps, of more importance, the provisions of the Bill are also being extended to wholesale establishments.  The main provisions of the Bill are, firstly, the restriction of the employment of juveniles.  It is proposed that no person under the age of 14 may be employed, and that the proprietor of a shop employing a person under the age of 18 years must satisfy himself as to his or her age.  It is also proposed to take power to limit or prohibit the employment of juveniles in shops.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill deals with working hours and meal times.  It is proposed to limit the normal employment <Col N="1005" /> of adult shop assistants to 48 hours per week.  It is necessary to provide for some elasticity and, consequently, there are provisions for working permitted overtime embodied in the Bill.  These provisions will require, I think, careful consideration from the House when we have the Bill before us in Committee.  It may be acknowledged at once that it is somewhat difficult to provide completely satisfactory provisions for dealing with this question of overtime.  It is desirable, undoubtedly, that permission to work overtime should be given.  The Bill provides for certain maximum limits of overtime and also that persons employed by way of overtime in excess of normal working hours must be paid at the overtime rate.  It is, however, necessary to ensure that, when making arrangements to provide for the working of overtime and for the elasticity which is necessary in relation to the conduct of most business concerns in the matter of hours of working, we do not merely ensure that longer hours are normally worked, even at a higher rate of wages.  The purpose of the measure is to effect a general reduction in hours of working in shops to a normal 48 hours in every week.  The provisions dealing with overtime can perhaps be more adequately discussed in Committee, but I will welcome the assistance of Deputies in improving them if, in fact, they do permit of improvement.  I trust, however, that in coming to consider the matter Deputies will bear in mind all the considerations which are involved.</P>
    <P>Special provisions are made in the Bill as regards juveniles.  It is proposed that a juvenile must have a rest of at least 11 consecutive hours between two working days and that, subject to certain necessary exceptions, this interval shall include the hours from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  There are some necessary exceptions, for which special arrangements are contemplated. These exceptions are in connection with the collection and delivery of milk, bread and newspapers, and also in connection with the catering trade and employment in theatres.  It is proposed further that <Col N="1006" /> the hours of employment in shops may not be divided into more than two spells, and that the period between any such spells shall, subject to the provisions relating to the interval for meals, be not more than four hours in duration.  Intervals for meals are provided so as to ensure that no person shall be engaged for more than six hours without at least an interval of 20 minutes and that there shall be at least three hours between each meal interval.  Certain necessary exemptions are provided, as will be seen from the Second Schedule to the Act, and in all cases there must be an interval of an hour for the principal meal.  We have provided in the Bill the same sections as appeared in the first Conditions of Employment Act to ensure that where hours of work are reduced, as a result of the enactment and coming into operation of this measure, wages shall not be reduced in consequence.  I shall say a further word in that matter when dealing with the section of the Bill relating to the regulation of wages.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with holidays. For the purpose of holidays shops are deemed to be divided into two classes, the first class including what we may term ordinary shops, and the second class what are described in the Bill as special-trade shops which include refreshment houses, licensed premises and shops which trade on Sunday.  In ordinary shops, shop assistants throughout the country will be entitled to a half-day in every week. So also will assistants in the shops trading on Sundays, but not assistants in refreshment houses or licensed houses.  Assistants in ordinary shops will be entitled to leave with pay on six named bank holidays or to days in lieu of bank holidays, but none of the three classes in the group which are described as special-trade shops will be so entitled.  As an off-set to this, assistants who do not receive a half day will become entitled to two days leave on week-days in every month, or to 26 days in every year of continuous employment.</P>
    <P>On the question of annual holidays, the ordinary shop assistants will be entitled to six consecutive week-days <Col N="1007" /> with pay while those in special-trade shops will be entitled to 14 days, to make up for the absence of leave on bank holidays.  The 14 days will, of course, include two Sundays.  The time of the annual leave is, as in the first Act, at the discretion of the proprietor, but at least 14 days' notice of the time of leave must be given either in writing to each shop assistant or by the display of a notice in a prominent position in the shop.  In some cases it may be necessary for the ordinary shop-keeper to open his premises on Sunday, and in such cases, in common with the proprietor of the special-trade shop, he must compensate his shop assistants by giving them a full day's holiday on the following week with pay, if they work for more than four hours on the Sunday, and a half-day if they work for less than four hours.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that the Bill makes provision similar to that in the first Conditions of Employment Act, designed to ensure that where assistants' hours of work are reduced by the enactment of this measure, his earnings shall not be reduced in consequence. It is necessary to recognise that the enforcement of that condition will in some cases occasion difficulty. It is, I think, generally agreed that in many classes of shops and in parts of the country, the wages and the conditions of employment of shop assistants are very unsatisfactory.  It is, I think, necessary to do more than merely to provide that assistants will have a statutory right to ensure that their earnings are not reduced with their hours, because it is well to recognise that many assistants may be deterred for one reason or another from exercising their legal rights in such matters. Furthermore, there is in any event, I think, need to provide some machinery for the examination of wages paid in shops where complaints are made, and for the fixation and enforcement of minimum rates of wages.  It is, therefore, proposed to establish a shop wages board, a board which will consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.  The chairman will be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He will also appoint <Col N="1008" /> the two other members.  One of these must be a person who, in his opinion, is representative of the proprietors of shops, and the other person representative of the members of staffs of shops. The provisions for the appointment of that board are set out in the Bill, and Deputies can see there what is proposed.  The procedure which is contemplated is this: When the Minister for Industry and Commerce receives a complaint that wages are unduly low, and where he is satisfied, on the face of it, that such complaint is well-founded, he will refer the case to the board, and request them to fix minimum rates of wages for any particular class, or members of staffs of shops situated in a particular area. The board will, after investigation, make rules fixing the minimum rates of wages, and the Minister may either confirm or modify these rules.  Applications for the amendment or the revocation of rules fixed by the board will be referred to the board for further consideration. It is intended that any person can bring the machinery into operation.  It is, perhaps, to be assumed that in the ordinary case complaints as to unduly low wages will come from the persons aggrieved, but it is not intended to confine the making of complaints to such persons.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill deals with the arrangements for the health and comfort of members of the staffs of shops.  It is proposed to make it mandatory on the proprietors of shops to provide suitable and sufficient means of ventilation and to maintain reasonable temperatures. Provision is also made for the maintenance of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences, and for the provision of suitable and sufficient lighting.  Suitable washing facilities must also be made available for the use of employees, and, where meals are taken in the shop, suitable facilities for the taking of those meals must be provided.  The provision for the supplying of seats for female employees, which is contained in the existing law, is being retained by this Bill, with certain improvements.  This part of the Act, which deals with the arrangements for the safety and health <Col N="1009" /> and comfort of workers will be enforced by the local sanitary authorities, and it is proposed to give them certain powers of exemption which I think it is necessary that they should have.</P>
    <P>I have given this brief review of the main provisions of the Bill for the purpose of indicating its scope.  I do not think there is much likelihood of disagreement in the Dáil as to the principle involved in the measure.  The Bill is designed to secure, as I have said, better conditions of working in shops, and to give to shop assistants a legal right to those better conditions. The Bill, as I have pointed out, makes a big advance upon existing legislation, and particularly I would draw attention to the fact that apart from the new provisions regarding holidays, and bank holidays, the Bill will apply in its entirely throughout the whole State to all shop assistants.  We can perhaps discuss the different provisions of the Bill more suitably in Committee, but these particular aspects of it I would regard as essential and, in fact, constituting the principle of the Bill; first, that there should be general application to all shop assistants; secondly, that, apart from the provisions dealing with health and comfort, the Bill should be enforced by the central authority, and not&mdash;as in the case of existing legislation&mdash;by local authorities; and thirdly, that there should be the general fixation of maximum working hours, and the general provision of a statutory right to holidays with pay.</P>
    <P>Those are the main provisions of the Bill, and, subject to the maintenance of those parts of it, it is a measure in the improvement of which I will be glad to have the active co-operation of every Deputy in the Dáil.  Experience has taught us that in the framing of measures of this kind it is particularly difficult to provide for all possible contingencies, and to avoid leaving loopholes which can be availed of by unscrupulous employers in order to avoid their obligations under it.  It is usually only when a measure of this nature has been in operation for some time that one begins to perceive clearly whatever defects there may have been in it.  We have had the experience, of course, of <Col N="1010" /> the operation of the first Conditions of Employment Act, and, in so far as that experience was of value to us in preparing this measure, it has been availed of.  That Act will require amendments in many matters of detail, as experience has shown, and I have no doubt that, no matter how carefully we persue this measure, time will reveal the necessity for amendments here too, but it is obviously desirable that we should try to avoid that probability as much as possible, and, therefore, I shall be very glad to have the assistance of all Deputies and Parties in examining the detailed provisions of this Bill in order to ensure that, as far as human wit and ingenuity will allow, defects will be eliminated at this stage.  Subject to the outstanding features of the measure, to which I have referred, there is no part of it in respect of which I am not prepared to bow to the better judgement of members of the Dáil in matters which they think would constitute an improvement of the measure. I, therefore, move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>The Minister towards the close of his speech, told us that this Bill was a big advance upon existing legislation, but I do not think that the comparing of this piece of legislation with existing legislation is of very much use, because, after all, the ordinary relations between man and the State are very little regulated by legislation.  What, I would have expected the Minister to do was not to deal with existing legislation but rather more to deal with existing social conditions.  I had rather expected, too, that the Minister would show us how this Bill will deal with the abuses that may exist, and what are the abuses that do in fact exist. I am sure that in certain portions of this country you will find that in certain shops the assistants are badly treated and overworked.  I am quite certain that that is the case, but before the Minister introduced this Bill into the House I should have liked the Minister to let us know, after he had made careful inquiry, what are the abuses which ought to be dealt with and ought to be curbed by legislation, and what is their extent.  We would then be in a better position to conclude <Col N="1011" /> as to whether this Bill will, in fact, deal with existing abuses, and whether it will on the whole make any advance in the social conditions of the workers, or the great majority of them.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for anybody to deal with a problem until one knows the extent of that problem.  It is very difficult to consider a piece of legislation unless one knows what precisely are the evils, and the extent of the evils, with which one is coping.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the classic definition of wisdom, which is &ldquo;apportioning means to ends.&rdquo;  When we come to a piece of legislation of this kind, we would like very much to know the end which the Minister has in view, what are the difficulties, the evils, which he is endeavouring to improve, before we can judge very correctly whether the means he has taken in this Bill are satisfactory means.  So far as I can judge from the Bill, it makes very little difference as far as properly regulated shops at the present moment are concerned, and so far as the great majority of shops in the country are concerned, I think it makes no difference at all.</P>
      <P>The question of overtime and the 48-hours week might at first sight appear to be a very considerable alteration in existing conditions, but I do not think, on mature consideration, it does appear to be very much of an alteration.  The ordinary shop, and certainly the country shop, does its main business on certain days in the week.  The market day in the country town is, naturally, the day upon which the largest amount of business is done. without any extra hours even on market days, I think the employer will be able, without any change of his existing habits, to carry on without any overtime at all.  On the market day he may want his employees to work a 12-hours day.  Of course he can do that without any trouble, because he can work on his ordinary week-days eight hours a day, give the four hours compulsory weekly half-holiday, and apply the remaining four hours to the market day, and, if he likes, under this Bill it will be possible for him to have a 12-hours day on the main day or market day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> It appears to me that there is one danger that this Bill has got.  There are certain periods, as everybody knows, in which shop assistants are not required to the same number as they are required at other periods. There are very lean periods in the year.  In a country shop July and August are months in which there is very little in the way of sales going on.  It is much the same in the cities. I am informed that in the cities the habit in the majority of shops is that they dismiss employees during the lean periods of the year and take them on during the rush periods.  In the country shop the same people are kept on during the rush period and during the lean period.  In certain shops, under this Bill, there may be a tendency to put employees on half-time during the summer months, or possibly to dismiss some hands during the months in which there is very little work to be done, and then chance taking in temporary hands around Christmas-time and other really rush periods.</P>
    <P>It does seem that this Bill presses very much harder in its overtime provisions upon the good employer than upon the bad employer.  There are some employers paying a very small rate of wages.  The quarter increase on the overtime rates as far as the bad employer is concerned will be less than the increase which the good employer will have to pay.  If one man is paying&mdash;I am just taking a rough figure&mdash;at the rate of 2/- an hour, and another man is giving 1/- an hour, the extra quarter will be higher on the man who is paying 2/- than it will be upon the man who is paying only 1/-.  In the case of the man paying 2/- an hour he would have to pay 2/6 for the overtime, while the other man would have to pay only 1/3.</P>
    <P>There is one particular feature about this Bill, and that is that it is adding enormously to the number of inspectors who are going around this country. It is a most unpleasant thing to have every single item inspected, to have inspectors coming in at this and that minute.  If this Bill is going to be fully operated and efficiently operated, there will need to be an enormous number of inspectors.  I admit that <Col N="1013" /> the big shops will require comparatively little, if any, inspection, but the small shops, the country shops and the scattered shops, will require an enormous amount of inspecting.  There might be some machinery devised by which the Bill could be operated without having the tremendous amount of inspection which is visualised here and also the great number of forms which the Bill indicates the shopkeeper will have to fill up.  For instance, he may have to fill up a form for the time every workman works.  He has to serve notice in writing on the workman as to the holidays he is going to get and the specific days he will be allowed.  Certain notices have to be posted up in the shop.  He may have to have a notice varying every week. It seems that the machinery of the Bill is very complicated, and that machinery may become a very great nuisance to the shopkeepers, especially the country shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that I could not quite understand, and I would like the Minister to make it a little clearer for me.  If we take Section 30, sub-section (1), paragraphs (a) and (b), we see there two provisions setting out the holidays to be given to members of staffs of refreshment houses and licensed premises in lieu of weekly half-holidays.  Each member of the staff must receive not less than two whole holidays on week-days in each month, nor less than 26 whole holidays on week-days during the year.  Are those meant to be cumulative?  Must he get two whole holidays on week-days in each month&mdash;24 holidays&mdash;and 26 whole holidays in the year, meaning 50 in all?</P>

      <P>A great deal of this Bill is a matter that should be dealt with section by section.  We are now on the principle of the Bill.  We are on the general principle of protecting people who are rather defenceless in certain instances, people who are at the mercy of bad employers, and so far as that aspect of the Bill is concerned, we, on this side of the House, are completely in accord with the principle that conditions that are unfair or unjust, or conditions that make human life practically unliveable in this country should be alleviated and abolished by law.  We are, therefore, completely in agreement with any legislation which prevents any human being unduly or improperly exploiting another.  Any Bill like this will have our support.  Any Bill that prevents people from taking advantage of a position in which one is placed to make the life of another human being not merely unliveable but almost unbearable will have our support.  In questions where legislation of this kind is required I am entirely of the view that it is the duty of the State to provide such legislation.  My only objection to this particular Bill is that it seems to me that the system of inspection will lead to unnecessary trouble.  I believe that the Bill is altogether too <Col N="1015" /> cumbersome for dealing with the problem with which it proposes to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is an effort to grapple with the problem which because of years of neglect has tended to become a very serious one in the lives of those who have chosen the shopkeeping industry for their livelihood. The position is well known to Deputies here who have taken the trouble to inquire into the system which prevails in many places whereby many people are unscrupulously exploiting their shop assistants.  There are cases in which shop assistants are compelled to work 70 to 80 hours a week.  They get no holidays and receive a rate of wages that is utterly incapable of supporting them in anything like reasonable comfort.  I have before me a letter which was sent to me by a priest some time ago.  That letter was sent by a shopkeeper in Dublin to a girl in the country who answered an advertisement in one of the daily newspapers.  That girl was seeking employment in a grocery and dairy establishment in the city.  The letter from the prospective employer informed the prospective employee what she would be required to do, should she be considered suitable for the position.  The prospective employer then went on to state: &ldquo;The hours are from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; you get a weekly half-holiday, and you are free every second Sunday from 11 a.m. You are not allowed to be out after 6 p.m.&rdquo;  That was pretty clear seeing that she would not be off until 7 p.m. Then the letter went on to say that the wages started at 10/- a month indoor. That is, fourpence for a 12-hour day. Then the letter added: &ldquo;Should you decide to take up the position please send any references you may have and references from the parish priest.&rdquo; References from the parish priest and other references for a position at 10/- a month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>From a well-known publication&mdash;the <i>Labour News.</i>  It is because of a situation of that kind and of the fact that the position revealed <Col N="1016" /> there of exploiting the assistants is typical of the general exploitation that takes place that we are supporting this Bill.  It is because of the exploitation of workers, and particularly of female workers, in small shops that I specially welcome the introduction of this Bill as an effort to meet a serious problem in the shops life of the country.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, very honourable exceptions to the condition of affairs described in that letter.  Many big shopkeepers have agreements with their workers through the trade unions.  They observe these conditions of working and they pay decent wages. To these employers this Bill will not make any change.  In fact, many of the larger shops observe conditions better than the maximum conditions set out in this Bill.  I am sure that the decent employer in the industry will be only too glad to see ensured that the smaller shopkeepers, those who exist largely by the payment of a low rate of wages and the employment of their staff during long hours, will be compelled to conform to the minimum standard of wages and conditions which may help to alleviate the hardships from which these employees suffer and to raise the conditions to the level that should be maintained to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My complaint about the Bill is that it does not go sufficiently far.  I do not know why the Minister excludes from the Bill commercial employees. In respect of international conditions these have always been linked with shop workers.  I think it would have been a simple matter for the Minister to have extended the scope of the Bill so as to have made it applicable, not only to shop workers but to employees in commercial offices.  The Minister makes the exclusion of these&mdash;the exception to which I have alluded&mdash;even more difficult to understand.  He purports to regulate conditions in respect of the shop assistant.  Curiously enough, what he terms &ldquo;the shop assistant&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill. He also excludes messengers and porters employed in the shop.  Why it is necessary to exclude messengers and porters, while including within the <Col N="1017" /> scope of the Bill other employees, is not very clear to me.  The Minister has narrowed the scope of the Bill considerably. He ought to have included workers in commercial offices.  I say that because when the International Labour Office at Geneva set out to regularise conditions they have always linked these two classes together&mdash; shops and commercial offices.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill which is very welcome.  That is, the provision that the Act will be enforced by the central authority.  Everybody who noted the manner in which previous shop legislation had been enforced by the local authorities will welcome the departure indicated in this Bill.  In many other shop Acts the intention of the Legislature was rendered utterly abortive by the inclusion of a provision by which it was to be enforced by the local authorities.  That was particularly the case with the Act of 1912.  Local authorities should have ensured that these Acts were administered properly, but in many cases the provisions of the Act were defeated by the employers in cases where the local authorities were not possessed of the requisite zeal to ensure the enforcement of these very necessary legislative measures.</P>
    <P>Therefore I welcome the change to enforcement by the central authority from enforcement by the local authority. The enforcement of shops legislation by the local authority has proved a thorough farce, and I hope that administration by the central authority will correct many of the abuses which have inevitably grown up by the failure of the local authorities adequately to use their powers in respect of the legislation which they were required to enforce.  I notice that the administration of that portion of the Act which deals with health and hygiene is to be left to the local authority.  I suggest to the Minister that if the local authority, because it is the sanitary authority, is to be entrusted with the enforcement of that section of the Act, power should be taken to require the local authority to report periodically to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1018" /> as to what it has done to ensure compliance with the law.  If the local authority is permitted to enforce the provisions of the Bill in respect of health and hygiene without any supervision by the central authority, I am afraid the enforcement will be of the haphazard type and that no effective steps will be taken in many cases to ensure that the conditions prescribed in that portion of the Bill will be effectively administered.  The Minister should make sure that there is an obligation on the local authority to indicate to him annually what it has done to enforce that part of the Act. There should be some speedy way of dealing with a local authority which fails to carry out its duties, and power should be contained in the Bill to compel the local authority to discharge the functions imposed upon it under the relevant portion of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of the hours of shop workers is dealt with in this Bill, but I am sorry to say that one cannot get a proper understanding of what is aimed at without a knowledge of the provisions of the Shop Hours Trading Bill, which has not yet been circulated. Deputies, in discussing the provisions of this Bill, particularly with regard to the hours of work, are under a very serious handicap, because they do not know how long it will be possible for shops to remain open.  Consequently they do not know how long it will be possible for workers to be employed under this Bill.  For instance, it is provided that, while the normal maximum working week is to be 48 hours, it will be possible to employ a worker for 11 hours per day provided the maximum of 48 hours in the week is not exceeded, so that you may have a situation in which a worker will be employed for less than the normal working day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, for perhaps the normal working day on Thursday, and for 11 hours on Friday and Saturday.  The Minister will, I think, agree that, if that situation were to arise, it would be very undesirable, and that the State should direct its powers to curbing that abuse.  Any worker employed for 11 hours a day is virtually denied <Col N="1019" /> all social intercourse on that day.  If a situation were to arise under this Bill whereby a worker would be employed for 11 hours on two days a week, shop workers would have a very serious grievance.  It should not be possible for any employer, while complying with the provisions of this Bill, to require his employees to work 11 hours on two days a week.  It may be that no shop will be permitted to open for 11 hours.  It may be that the maximum hours of trading will be 10, so that an abuse of the kind I have mentioned could not possibly arise.  We do not, however, know how long a shop will be permitted to open, and we do not know whether it will be possible for a worker to be employed 11 hours on two days a week.  I think that the Minister might have given us some idea of what he intends to do in respect of shop hours for trading purposes.  If a situation of the kind I have mentioned can develop under the Bill, I think the House should deal with the matter before the Bill is passed.  Under the Conditions of Employment Act, the maximum number of hours a worker can be employed on any one day is nine.  In this Bill the maximum is 11 hours&mdash;a substantial increase on the number provided in the Conditions of Employment Act. Why the change of policy?  Obviously a very serious abuse could arise under the Act if it operates in the manner I have described.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill in respect of overtime, but it differs very substantially from similar provisions in the Conditions of Employment Act. For instance, it is possible for the employer to work a person up to a maximum of 60 hours per week&mdash;48 hours normally and 12 hours overtime. The employer is not required to secure permission from the Minister or from any departmental inspector to do that, nor does he require even the concurrence of the employee.  The employer may decide that he is going to work overtime, and, if he does so he can employ a worker up to 60 hours a week.</P>
    <P>That is a most unsatisfactory position and I do not think that employers who are shopkeepers ought to be permitted that freedom in respect of overtime. <Col N="1020" /> After all, the management and administration of a shop is not a class of employment in which overtime arises without being foreseen.  A shop may be busy on a fair or market day or when there is a big football match or some other outstanding event, but that is the only occasion on which it is normally likely that overtime would be necessary.  These events can be foreseen and a shopkeeper ought to be limited in resort to overtime.  Some rigid restrictions should be imposed. The restrictions should be, at least, as rigid as those under the Conditions of Employment Act.  Instead of making the conditions more rigid in the case of shopkeeper-employers, where the necessity for overtime is not as great as in industry generally, the Minister proceeds to loosen the position and to provide facilities for resort to overtime which are not available to ordinary industrialists, even though the industrialist might be able to show a stronger case for laxity in respect of overtime.  I do not know why the employer in the shop-keeping industry should be allowed greater facilities in this respect than the industrial employer, and I hope the Minister will close that door to a possible abuse under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another section deals with the possibility of resort by employers to split hours of trading.  It is provided that where an employer resorts to split hours, the employee must be allowed a minimum of four hours between the end of one spell of employment and the commencement of another.  I do not know what object the Minister seeks to achieve by putting in that minimum. If it were a maximum, one might understand it, but as a minimum, the only effect of the provision is to spread out the working day of the employee to inordinate lengths.  For instance, under this split-hours system of trading which will be legalised under the Bill, it is possible for an employer to open his shop at eight o'clock in the morning and employ a worker until eleven.  He can then close for a minimum of four hours and reopen at, say, four o'clock in the evening and work him until 12 o'clock at night.  When he has done that, he has only worked the employee 11 hours.  It is permissible <Col N="1021" /> for him to work employees for a maximum of 11 hours per day and, by an ingenious scheme of spreading out 11 hours among a number of employees, to carry on trading between 8 a.m. and midnight, with the exception of a gap period during the day.  It may be that under the other Bill the Minister does not intend to permit shops to open over that span, but until we see the Bill we do not know what the provisions are, or what the Minister's intentions are and we must try to construe this Bill in relation to the possible abuses which may arise under it.  It is a most undesirable provision in this Bill that split hours of trading, with a four hours minimum, should be permitted because it is calculated to encourage employers so to arrange their trading hours that some of them will be open when their rivals are closed, and by pirating in the industry to get a clientele which would not be available to them if they were carrying on fairly in relation to their competitors.  However, that is a matter, like many of the other matters, which can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Bill that in the case of employees of special trade shops, they may get 14 days' annual holidays, which includes Sundays, the difference between the six and the 14 days being in respect of bank holidays to which they are not normally entitled under this Bill; but in respect of the other shops carrying on a general business and not in this special trade group, the ordinary provisions in respect of holidays is six days per annum.  On this question, it might be desirable to advert for a few moments to the adequacy of six days' holidays for workers generally.  I know that six days' holidays with pay is provided for in the Conditions of Employment Act, but when that Act was being discussed here I urged that a higher minimum than six days should be provided.  I understood that the Minister was rather reluctant to provide that higher minimum at that time, but that he was sympathetically disposed towards considering the question at a later stage. I think six days' holidays is abnormally low for a worker in regular employment.  Where a worker is engaged in regular employment, 52 <Col N="1022" /> weeks in the year, a period of six days' holidays is entirely inadequate, if the object of holidays is to provide a worker with recreation, with some opportunity of recuperating and repairing ragged nerves so that he may look forward to being able to withstand the physical ravages of another year's employment.  I think the Minister, in respect of this Bill and in respect of the control of the Conditions of Employment Act, might well so amend the legislation as to make it possible for workers to obtain not less than a fortnight's holiday with pay each year.  What he is being asked to do in that connection is not unknown in many European countries, and the Minister, I think, ought to give some indication of the mind of the Government in respect of paid holidays to workers.  Six days' holidays with pay is altogether inadequate and, at a time when the value of holidays is being recognised more extensively than formerly and that value is more apparent than formerly, I think the Minister ought to provide a minimum of a fortnight's holiday with pay.  The Conditions of Employment Act should be amended to conform to this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a section in this Bill dealing with public holidays and it is rather striking&mdash;whether it is by accident or design, I cannot say&mdash;that there is nothing in it which makes it unlawful for an employer to permit an employee to work for him on a public holiday.  I cannot understand why that omission has been made, but it seems to me that if it is desirable that an employee should obtain leave from employment on a public holiday, it is equally desirable to ensure that it shall be unlawful for an employer to permit an employee to work for him on such a day.  I have searched the Bill to find any such provision, but I can find no provision which makes it unlawful for an employer to permit a person to work for him on a public holiday.</P>
    <P>There is another section which deals with weekly half-holidays, and here again there is a rather strange innovation as to when a half-holiday begins. It is provided that in the case of special trade shops, the weekly half-holiday begins at 3 o'clock in the day, or on the termination of the fifth hour <Col N="1023" /> of employment.  Take the case of ordinary workers who attend for work at 9 o'clock in the morning.  They are usually allowed a weekly half-holiday at one o'clock, but in the case of some of the shops in the special trade category the weekly half-holiday does not begin until 3 o'clock, or at the end of the fifth hour of employment.  That seems to me to be calculated to deprive the worker of a substantial benefit. The weekly half-holiday which begins at 3 o'clock in the day is not a weekly half-holiday as popularly understood in employment.  I think, therefore, the Minister ought not to put in that special provision which will have the effect of depriving workers of half-holidays commencing earlier than at the alternative times suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For instance, some of the shops affected by this provision would be licensed premises, say, in the City of Dublin, where the premises close at 2.30 and where the worker at present may get a half-holiday commencing at 2.30.  Under the Bill, he could not get a half-holiday until 3 o'clock, or until he had rendered five hours' service in the shop.  I think the proposal in the Bill in that connection worsens considerably the present position, particularly as the tendency to delay the grant of the half-holiday reduces the value of the privilege to those who are entitled to it.  These points, however, and many others to which I have adverted, are points which could be considered on Committee Stage.  I am glad to hear the Minister assure the House that he would welcome co-operation in improving the provisions of the Bill.  I think there are many provisions which can be substantially improved, and I think the Bill can be made a much better charter for shop workers than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>I hope, when amendments with that object in view are moved, that the Minister will show on the Committee Stage the same desire for understanding and co-operation that he expressed on the Second Stage.  However, I suggest that this is a Bill which requires very careful consideration in a number of respects, and that he ought to allow adequate time between now <Col N="1024" /> and the Committee Stage, so that it can be thoroughly studied and its provisions and ramifications fully appreciated, when Deputies would have the opportunity of submitting amendments calculated to improve it.  Apart from some blemishes which are obvious, I think the Bill goes a substantial distance to remedy a situation which has tended to become more and more acute.  I feel satisfied that in many respects it will bring substantially nearer, for unorganised shop workers, relatively tolerable conditions, which they have never enjoyed since they had the misfortune to enter the shop-keeping business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the remarks of the Minister, and most of all I welcome his statement that he desires to have a certain amount of flexibility, as when dealing with such diversified businesses and interests it is very difficult to bring them within the provisions of a Bill of this kind.  Deputy Norton seems to think that some people will start by working 11 hours one day and 8 hours another day.  If there are people like that, I suppose the sooner they are driven out into the open the better.  Possibly this Bill will bring to light some strange cases of trading.  Beyond doubt, everybody would welcome a standard of conditions which would be applicable to the industry, because traders now faced with unfair competition, in the way of keeping open late, find that the only way to meet that competition is to keep open late or to let the other fellow get away with the swag, just as if he had committed a burglary.  From that point of view I think we can all appreciate the remarks of the Minister. Some points in the Bill require explanation, but they can be better brought up on the Committee Stage. At the same time, some points that are obscure cannot be raised too soon, so that if they cannot be cleared up on the Committee Stage they will be cleared up at a subsequent stage.  Is it clear that those conducting Sunday trading in shops, refreshment houses, and licensed houses need not allow public holidays or days in lieu there of? I think the Minister answered that question, the answer being that they need not allow them, as the increased <Col N="1025" /> provision of 14 days compensates for that.  In Section 11 I notice that the Minister is going to lay orders before Dáil Eireann.  Does that mean that there is not going to be a Seanad? In connection with Section 46, what are the deductions an employer would be deemed to have made?  That is made clear in connection with insurance, unemployment and pensions, but then there is a reference to the Truck Acts. There are other deductions, and I am wondering if they are to be made illegal; for instance, where an employee might have entered into some arrangement for benefit?  I should like to have that position defined. Another question arises where a day may be any number of hours up to 11. Presumably different hours may be worked different days to suit a particular trade.  Where a whole holiday is given, how many hours must be deducted from 48 to arrive at the number of hours that may be worked during the rest of the week?  Is it a case like the one under the Conditions of Employment Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that a question has not been raised regarding relatives. Everybody has relatives and, whether employed in shops or any place else, I cannot see why they should be exempt from the provisions of this Bill.  Somebody asked: &ldquo;When is a human being not a human being?&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;When he is a relative.&rdquo;  I do not know if it is the desire that relatives should be allowed to work hours that are considered to be injurious to other employees.  That brings up another question, that a proprietor of a shop might have a relative living in in his house who, while he was having a meal, merely attended the shop and did some trivial work there.  That case would have to be provided for.  I am not clear as to what is meant by &ldquo;a member of the staff&rdquo; and by &ldquo;shop work.&rdquo;  What is the difference?  Is &ldquo;shop work&rdquo; mentioned merely to bring in ancillary work?  In that respect it appears to exclude messengers and people engaged on deliveries.  Is the object there to bring them under transport?  If so, that is fairly logical.  I am not very clear as <Col N="1026" /> to what is meant by &ldquo;a retail shop,&rdquo; but I suppose we can go into that in Committee.  I take it that messengers and van men are not members of the staff.  However, the Minister can deal with the question when replying.  On Section 18 (5) what is the meaning of the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this section&rdquo;?  Evidently they qualify the Minister's power of amendment of the hours, as the sub-section is the only one giving the Minister power to vary the hours.  That should be made clear. There is another question which, I suppose, is of more interest to hotels than to any other section.  Do hotels wholly and entirely come within the provisions of this Bill?  Hotel proprietors contend that the hours and holidays suitable for shops working a five and a half day week are not suitable for hotels which are compelled by law to be open for 24 hours on 365 days of the year.  For instance, does the chamber maid who takes up a morning cup of tea to a resident in a hotel come under the Bill? The hotel proprietors say that, at certain times of the year, the provisions of this Bill would require such an enormous addition to their staffs that they could not obtain them nor house them if obtained.  Section 29 deals with refreshment houses and licensed houses. Since the half-day allowed in ordinary shops is not deducted from the 48-hour week, are the whole of the holidays under Section 30 to be deducted from the 48-hour week in which they are given, or are they outside the 48-hour week?</P>
    <P>On the question of annual leave, the implication of sub-section (2) of Section 33 may be far-reaching.  Does this mean that a small confectioner's shop which on two or three days of the year, say on public holidays, puts a few tables in the garden and serves cakes and lemonade, comes under the regulations for refreshment houses for the purpose of annual leave?  These are a few points that I would like the Minister to deal with.  If he can answer them, well and good; and if not, he can bear them in mind.  I suppose that we will give the Bill more detailed examination on the Committee Stage. <Col N="1027" /> I would like to join with Deputy Norton in saying that there should be as long an interval as possible between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage to enable people to examine the Bill carefully.  There is a certain class of individual who does not seem to wake up to the fact that there is a Bill before the House until it has got its Second Reading, and that it is intended that the Bill should go through and become law.  He then realises that he had better examine it, and see if all the provisions in it are clear as they apply to him.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, enunciated three principles which he says are maintained in it.  With those principles I am in entire agreement.  I suggest to the Minister that at least one of them is not contained in the Bill, and that is the one of general application, for, as Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, the provision in paragraph (a), sub-section (2) of Section 4, to my mind definitely makes the Bill not of general application, because it rules out a shop manned by relatives entirely from certain portions of the Bill, at any rate. The Minister may argue that it would be difficult to enforce the measure in a shop which is staffed entirely by relatives. I suggest that it would be much more difficult to establish the fact that various members of the staff are, or are not relatives, than it would be to make them conform to all the provisions of the Bill.  The same thing, of course, is repeated in sub-section (4) of Section 7, and in sub-section (3) of Section 9, but in that case the regulations govern the proprietor, and not the members of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the definitions, the Minister mentioned that the business of a dyer and cleaner had been included in retail trade or business. But he must surely be aware that probably 90 per cent. of the cleaning and 100 per cent. of the dyeing done in this country is done in factory buildings, and yet under the terms of this Bill, as I read it, these buildings become <Col N="1028" /> shops, although under the definition of &ldquo;Members of staff&rdquo; the members of the staff are not members of the staff at all except one or two kept for the purpose of dealing with customers who come to the factory.  I take it that the Minister's object was to include the different receiving offices or shops dotted throughout the country to receive work for dyers and cleaners.  If that is so, I suggest that some words should be inserted in the definitions which would not include the actual factory where the work was being carried out.  I do not think that the Minister meant for a moment that it should.  Deputy Norton spoke of the four-hour interval and referred to it as a minimum.  The Minister in his introductory remarks referred to it as a maximum.  I suggest that a minimum of four hours would be more beneficial to the worker than to be sent away for one hour which could be of no use to him.  The worker could make some use of the four-hour interval.</P>

      <P>Many of the points raised in the discussion on this Bill were what may be described as Committee Stage points.  At any rate, they related to matters which I think can be more effectively discussed in Committee than in this stage.  There are some of them, however, that I would like to refer to now, for the reason that what I have to say may facilitate Deputies in their examination of the Bill, and perhaps enable them to make up their minds as to the type of amendment that they would like to submit on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that it would be more valuable to compare the provisions of the Bill with existing conditions than with the provisions of the existing law.  That is undoubtedly true, but I think it would be impossible for any person to give, in any reasonable time, a review of existing conditions, because they vary widely as between one class of shop and another, and as between one area and another.  I do not think it would be possible to attempt it at all.  Generally <Col N="1029" /> speaking, it can be said that the larger shops in the towns where any considerable number of employees are engaged have observed conditions at least as favourable as those in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was pointed out by, I think, Deputy Norton, some of these employers have adopted conditions of work better than those provided for in the Bill.  There are classes of shop assistants employed in the larger stores who get a fortnight's holidays and who may, perhaps, even work shorter hours than those specified in the Bill.  Undoubtedly, however, there are other shop assistants who have not holidays, who never got holidays, and who work very long hours indeed.  We are not trying to bring every shop assistant up to the conditions of those who are now enjoying the very best conditions.  What we are trying to do is to bring all shop assistants up to what we regard as a reasonable level. I think I can say, from my own experience and my examination of the problem, as well as the examination of those in my Department, that, as a result of this Bill, working conditions will be improved in the great majority of shops, whether in respect of hours of work, the holiday provision or otherwise. In fact, there was a certain confusion displayed in some of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's observations, because, although he stated that he thought that conditions in a great majority of shops would not be affected by the Bill at all, nevertheless he went on later to discuss the possibility of employers adopting tactics, as a result of the enactments of this Bill, which would be detrimental to the interests of the shop assistants&mdash;such as putting them on halftime during the seasons affected by this Bill, and so on.  I do not think that that danger is very great.  There is one essential difference between the conditions under which assistants in shops work and those in which industrial employees work, and that is that the personal ability of the shop assistant is a very frequent source of greater income to his employer.  It must be remembered that an industrial worker, operating a machine, cannot work faster than the machine <Col N="1030" /> can work, and that, generally, the difference between the most and the least efficient worker operating a machine is not very great; but the difference between a good shop assistant and a bad shop assistant is very great, and, consequently employers, very frequently, are prepared to pay more to such good assistants or, at least, to offer better conditions of employment. Therefore, because that personal element enters into the relations between employer and employee in shops, conditions are, on the whole, considerably different to those which obtain in industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I believe there is need for this legislation.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked what abuses were we aiming to amend.  The abuses we were aiming to amend were: unduly long hours, lower wages, or the absence of holidays.  Now, to the knowledge of all Deputies, I am sure, these abuses are prevalent in some classes of shops, although they do not exist at all in other classes of shops.  The purpose of this Bill is to remove such abuses wherever they exist.  If it could be said that in the majority of shops such abuses did not exist, then the Bill would not be necessary; but it is because the abuses actually do exist and because, in respect of some trades at any rate, they are fairly extensive, legislation of this kind is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, however, also contemplated the possibility of a large number of inspectors being required to administer the provisions of this Bill.  That was the objection I understood him to make, and it would be an objection if they were likely to be required.  I understood him to speak of the number of inspectors that would be required for the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill by the central authority, but it is not contemplated that they should be enforced by the central authority alone.  Under the Bill it is provided that any offence under any section of the Act&mdash;other than the part of the Act dealing with arrangements for health and comfort of members of staffs of shops mainly&mdash;may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister as prosecutor. <Col N="1031" /> That section was put in for the purpose of giving the Minister power to prosecute, and therefore giving the Minister power to comply with the conditions of the Bill.  I have been advised, however, that there is some danger that that section would be held to be restrictive and that it might confine the power of prosecution to the Minister, in fact.  That is not intended.  It is intended that the safe guard shall be there that the Minister, as well as anybody else, should have that power.  It is necessary, of course, that the Minister should have that power at his disposal in order to enable him to carry out the requirements of the Act and to enforce its provisions, but I do not think that machinery need be of a very elaborate nature.  Of course, there are shop inspectors employed mainly, I think, in a part-time capacity by local authorities at the present time, and probably shop inspectors in a whole-time capacity will be required in the future; but I do not think there is any contemplation, as has been suggested, of the employment of a very large number of inspectors to make the lives of traders intolerable under the conditions that will obtain under this Bill.  After all, in the majority of cases that will arise under this Bill, the default will be due either to failure to give holidays, or to failure to pay whatever minimum rates of wages may be prescribed, and possibly, although it is not likely, to the failure to limit work to the prescribed hours.  I say that it is not likely, because we have got to keep in mind the fact that there will be another Bill, associated with this Bill, which will prescribe the maximum number of shop trading hours; and, although I admit that it can happen, I think it is not likely that traders will keep their people employed during protracted hours.  The occasion, undoubtedly, can arise in certain cases where it may be necessary to work longer hours, but it is not the regular practice.  In any event, however, the person aggrieved in such a way by an employer will be in a position to enforce his rights himself, or through his trade union (if he is a member of <Col N="1032" /> a trade union), through an ordinary member of the public, a member of the Gárda Síochána, or through the Minister or his Department, by asking to have his grievance inquired into.  Deputy Norton asked why commercial establishments were not included.  It is rather difficult to know what type of establishments were meant by that query.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that what he had in mind was the case of offices and banks and insurance companies, but I would hesitate to extend the scope of this Bill to cover such offices.  It may be that it is necessary to cover such offices, but I do not think the need is as pressing in such cases as in the case of shop assistants.  In any event, I, personally, have not examined that position in sufficient detail to enable me to say that no difficulty would arise as a result of the general application of the provisions of this Bill to such per sons.  When I introduced the first Bill, I explained that we contemplated covering, in due course, every class of worker that, in our opinion, required protection by Bills of this nature.  I mentioned that we were starting with industrial workers, going, secondly, to shop workers, and then to transport workers; and I included under the category of transport workers such persons as are mentioned here, such as persons employed in collections and deliveries.  The hours of employment of such workers, obviously, must be different from the hours of those who work in establishments of the kind already referred to.  It is necessary that there should be a code of legislation in that regard and we will get that code of legislation completed at some time, although the drafting difficulties are somewhat greater than I anticipated they would be and progress is slower than I had hoped for.  However, I have intimated that, because of that difficulty in perfecting comprehensive codes to cover the various classes, I was proposing to take a short cut in relation to these provisions, and that provision is the holiday provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it may take some time before we have devised the full scheme <Col N="1033" /> of legislation contemplated to cover transport workers and those who work in mines and similar occupations, there is no reason why those persons should be deprived of the benefit of the holiday provision in the interval, and consequently I am having prepared, and hope to have introduced before the next holiday season, a short measure which will confer the benefit of the annual-holidays-with-pay provisions of this Bill to those workers who are not covered under this Bill or the existing Act.  If it becomes necessary to go further than that in order to deal with abuses that may arise amongst persons employed in offices, then further legislation will be required.  But I think, before we turn our hands to that particular task, that the circumstances of those engaged in transport and in mining have prior claim; at any rate, I think that, in relation to them, the need for such legislation is probably more urgent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the possibility that local authorities would not completely carry out their duty under Part 6 of the Bill, and suggested that there should be some arrangement under which those authorities would report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their activities under that part of the Bill.  As Deputies are aware, it is not possible to divide the work of government into water-tight compartments.  There is always a certain amount of overlapping between one department and another, and, in relation to that part of the Bill, the overlapping is obvious.  Local authorities are controlled by the Department of Local Government.  Furthermore, matters relating to public health are under the control of the Department of Public Health, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health ordinarily deals with these matters.  If local authorities neglect any of their statutory duties, it is the Minister for Local Government who has to deal with them, and if reporting is required, the reporting would be to the Minister for Local Government.  But I do not think that Deputy Norton's fears are well-founded, because these local authorities have functions in relation to public health which will involve the <Col N="1034" /> inspection of these premises, in any event, and it is a simple matter for them to extend the scope of their inspectors' instructions to cover matters dealt with in that part of the Bill.  The general supervision which the Department of Local Government exercises over the conduct of local authorities will, I think, be sufficient to ensure that the work will be well done, and, if not, the complaints of the persons who are aggrieved thereby can be made known to the Department of Local Government or to the members of the appropriate local authority, to ensure that any neglect is made good.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that &ldquo;shop assistant&rdquo; is not defined, and some other Deputy, I think, referred to the same matter.  There is a definition in the section of a member of the staff of a shop and that definition is fairly comprehensive, although it is necessary to point out that it relates to work done within the shop; but subject to that limitation, it covers persons &ldquo;employed wholly or mainly in connection with the serving of customers or the receipt of orders, or the despatch of goods or the unpacking or packing of goods&rdquo;&mdash;and this, I think, covers Deputy Benson's point&mdash;&ldquo;and is not industrial work within the meaning of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.&rdquo;  I think the Deputy referred to the case of dyers and cleaners who do industrial work in factories.  If that work is industrial, it comes under the earlier Act, not this.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to ensure that we do not extend this into too wide a field.  It is necessary to have a dividing line somewhere.  We want the Bill to deal with persons employed in shops.  You can get away from the shop into the accountant's office or some other branch of activity carried on by the same firm.  It is necessary to have some limitation, and I am prepared to discuss the limitation in Committee. We do not want to get too far, at any rate further than is necessary, in order to prevent the possibility of abuse.  As to the definition of shop work, those Deputies who were here during the passing of the Bill will remember that when the 1936 Conditions of Employment Bill was before us we spent by far the best part of the three or four months we were in Committee on the Bill discussing the definition section, and I think that even after two or three attempts we still had amendments to make in it. This definition section is fortunately not as formidable as the corresponding section in that Bill.  Nevertheless, it is a part of the Bill that will repay detailed attention, because Deputies know by experience that, very largely, the effectiveness and scope that a measure of this kind has depend upon the accuracy of the various definitions used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton, appropriately enough, said the consideration of this Bill must be influenced by the knowledge that there is another Bill dealing <Col N="1036" /> with hours of trading, but he was not quite right in saying that it was necessary to have the other Bill before us in order to judge of the effectiveness of any of the provisions here.  The other Bill will deal with the closing orders.  It will not, in itself, fix the hours that shops may remain open for trade.  At present closing orders may be made by local authorities if they get the consent of two-thirds of the traders affected and subject to certain limitations.  We are taking that power from the local authorities and giving it to the Government, and the making of the necessary provisions to enable the orders to be made either of general or local application.  But the Bill itself will not fix hours, and, therefore, its publication would not increase the knowledge of Deputies as to what is intended.  But they do know that such a Bill is there and that the orders, although they may vary from district to district and from trade to trade, will nevertheless ensure, in relation to each district and trade, uniform hours.</P>
    <P>I think those Deputies who have been speaking about the exclusion of relatives from the scope of the Bill have probably in mind the possibility of shops manned by relatives of the proprietor remaining open for business when other shops must close, rather than any question arising under this Bill.  That other Bill will deal with that and ensure uniform hours of closing, whatever the hours may be. This Bill deals with rates of wages, holidays and hours of work, and we exclude from it certain defined relatives if, and only if, these relatives are maintained by the proprietor and dwell in his house.  If we had not got that exclusion, we would have to provide where a husband was running a shop and was assisted therein by his wife, that his wife should get a week's annual leave with pay.  That, as a policy, might be quite ideal, but I do not fancy the prospect of the Department of Industry and Commerce enforcing it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the question of overtime, and I did also in my opening remarks, because this is a part of the Bill which may cause most difficulty in practice.  I may be wrong in that, but I have the feeling that the provisions in relation to overtime will require careful consideration. The Deputy is wrong in saying that there is a difference in the method of approach in this Bill as compared with the Conditions of Employment Act.  The only difference is this: In the Conditions of Employment Act we had two classes of overtime, permitted overtime, that is, overtime which the proprietor of a factory could work without seeking any special permit.  That is the same type of overtime that is contemplated here.  I think it would be completely impracticable to require the proprietor of a shop to seek a permit to work within reasonable limits.  There are some 40,000 shops in the country and the operation of a provision of that kind would be impossible.  We have, however, fixed certain maximum limits and we say that within these limits overtime may be worked, subject, of course, to the payment of overtime rates.  We had a similar provision in the other Act, but we also provided for the granting of a special licence to work overtime in excess of the permitted limits in certain trades or on certain occasions or to meet extraordinary and exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred to the annual holiday provision and urged that it was insufficient.  That is a matter upon which I do not want to express a personal opinion at the moment.  I think it is sufficient for us at present to provide a statutory right to six consecutive days' annual leave.  I know that certain shop assistants, particularly those in the larger shops, get, in the normal course, a longer annual holiday.  I have no doubt that they will <Col N="1038" /> continue to get that, and I should like to see the period longer, but in relation to a large class of persons who have never had this right before, and for whose benefit we are enacting this measure, I think we are going far enough if we fix the statutory minimum period which must be given at six consecutive days.  I would not be disposed to agree to an extension of that period, because an extension of it might lead to an extension of the period granted under the Conditions of Employment Act last year and, while it might be urged that a longer statutory annual holiday for shop workers would not cause any grave economic disturbance, a longer paid holiday for industrial workers might have a reaction on costs at the present time that would be undesirable.  At the same time it is well known to Deputies that many industrial workers do get a longer holiday than that provided for in the Bill.  The tendency has been for employers to agree with their workers to extend the holiday period.  It has been done quite recently in relation to a number of occupations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell shot a number of questions at me, but I am not going to answer all of them.  Deputy Dockrell's questions usually require mature consideration before one can reply to them. There were just one or two points to which I should like to refer.  I have referred to some of them already, such as the question he asked concerning the definition of assistants, and the reason for the exclusion of relatives.  Orders under this Bill can be annulled by a resolution of the Dáil.  The Deputy asked why that section should not provide for the possible recreation of the Seanad.  I have no doubt that, if it is considered desirable, there will be some general measure which will have the effect of restoring the power of the Seanad in relation to this and other Bills, just as there was a general measure excluding the Seanad after the Seanad was abolished.  Whether it will be desirable or not, is a moot point. I do not want to get into a constitutional point now, but I have always had the feeling personally that the power of annulling Orders which the <Col N="1039" /> Seanad had was a very wide power indeed.  It was rarely exercised but, in fact, it was a more drastic power in relation to matters of prime importance than the power which the Seanad had in relation to Bills, because when the Seanad rejected a Bill, the Bill was merely delayed, but when they annulled an Order, the Order was annulled for all time, and there was no power left with the Dáil to retrieve the situation. This question of whether the Seanad should have power to annul an Order is one which the Constitutionalists will, I am sure, in due course discuss, but in any case, whether or not we shall have such legislation consequent on the re-creation of the Seanad, I think this Bill must remain in its present form.</P>
    <P>So far as hotels are concerned, the Bill refers only to the catering end of the business, that is to the serving of refreshments or the sale of intoxicating liquors.  It does not cover any class of hotel employees other than those who are engaged in these particular activities. There again I can see a difficulty.  We may have to consider that matter further, to ascertain whether any ambiguity is going to arise between the status of two hotel employees, as to whether one is mainly employed upon one type of work or mainly on another.  It may be desirable to deal with that if an examination of the section should prove it to be necessary. I do not wish to deal with a number of other points that were raised.  The Bill is primarily one which can best be discussed in detail, section by section, particularly when there is no opposition expressed to any general principle in it.  There has been no opposition to it.  I am prepared to give whatever time the Dáil considers reasonable between this and the Committee Stage, but I am anxious if possible to get the Bill enacted this session.  It is not essential that it should be passed this session, but I should like to get it passed, because it will be a considerable time after the Bill has been passed by the Dáil before it can be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that it will become law upon a date appointed by Order and that different dates may be <Col N="1040" /> appointed for different parts of the Bill; but judging by our experience under the earlier Act, it will take some time before all the necessary regulations and consequential steps are taken after the Bill has been enacted, and before it can be brought into full effect.  In fact, under the 1936 Act, the time was so long that we finally took the bull by the horns and made an Order, deciding to acquiesce in certain breaches of the enactment for a period until we could cover the circumstances of the different industries by Orders of one kind or another, so as to ensure that the holiday provision would operate last year.  I do not want to see that situation arising under this Bill.  It is obviously undesirable, and therefore I should like to get the Bill passed as early as possible, so that we can bring it into operation at some reasonable date next year which will give us ample time to make the necessary provisions for its enforcement, and so on.  If Deputies will agree that next Wednesday week for the Committee Stage would give them ample time to prepare amendments, I am prepared to agree to that; but there is just a possibility that it might be advisable &mdash;if we could get the parliamentary time&mdash;to have the Committee Stage next week, because it is only when we discuss it in Committee that the amendments which will become necessary will be obvious.  Then, of course, some further period will be necessary before those amendments can be prepared and produced for Report.  If, however, there is a general desire that a fortnight should elapse before the Committee Stage, I am prepared to agree to that.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil deplores the lowering <Col N="1041" /> of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished. &mdash;(Deputies McGilligan and Morrissey.)</P>

      <P>When speaking to this motion a week ago, I gave certain figures.  On last Monday I was questioned about those figures by an individual who may perhaps have also approached people on the Government Benches, and in order to anticipate any discussion I have armed myself with the balance sheets for the years 1935-6 and 1936-7.  Those balance sheets disclose that in the year 1936-7 the net profit was £14,415 14s. 7d., and that for the year 1935-6 the net profit was £15,043 10s. 3d.  Those are slightly less than the figures I mentioned last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I mentioned last week were £16,000 and £17,000, while the actual figures are £14,000 and £15,000.  It has to be remembered that this profit was made out of the bacon end of our business only.  The business had to suffer a loss in other directions.  It had to suffer the loss of the cost of the strike in 1936, and it had to suffer the loss of our first year's canning.  The whole thing was a dead loss.  The figure I mentioned a week ago would, therefore, be a very conservative figure indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in attacking this motion, based his attack under four different heads.  I think we might disregard all the other speeches that were made against this motion.  With all due respect to the Deputies, their speeches struck me as counting for nothing.  The only case made was made by the Minister, and, as I have said, he concentrated his attack under four different heads: first, the increased number of motor cars in the country; secondly, the amount of beer and spirits consumed; thirdly, the <Col N="1042" /> bank clearances; and fourthly, the savings in the Post Office Savings Bank.  Now, the Minister knows Dublin better than I do, and has better means of ascertaining the names of the owners of motor cars, but anybody coming into Dublin as I do, and seeing the number of motor cars parked on the streets, would come to the conclusion that the City of Dublin and its environs are responsible for 70 or 80 per cent. of the increase in the number of motor cars.  You will have inspectors' cars; no inspector is worth two pins if he is not able to arm himself with a motor car, and, God knows, this Government has given us an army of inspectors.  They have also given us an army of directors of a sort in all the new factories they have established.  Every director has to arm himself with a car.  The managers have to arm themselves with cars.</P>
    <P>I think this largely explains the increase in the number of motor cars. There is also the same thing in the country towns and, if there is a suggestion by anybody here that motor cars have increased in numbers in the rural districts among the farming community, then let me examine the position. If a farmer or any man living in the country wants to go anywhere now, if he has any business in a town or at a fair, it is difficult to go except he has a motor car, because the road is impassable for his horse.  If he has not a motor car and if the distance is not too great, he has to use his bicycle or walk.  If any farmer owns a motor car, it is because it is an absolute necessity. There are less motor cars, from the luxury point of view, among the farmers than there used to be.  Scarcely any farmer has a motor car from a luxury point of view.  Any cars there are in the country are there by reason of absolute necessity, because the roads are impossible for horses.  Nobody would think of bringing out a horse to do a journey on the roads.  In an odd rural district, possibly on a by-road, a farmer might be able to use his horse to reach a town or a market.  In most instances, if he has not a bicycle, he has to walk.</P>
    <P>As regards the amount of beer and spirits consumed in the country, I was <Col N="1043" /> amazed at the statement that has been made.  I am not going to question the Minister's figures, but from the point of view of the man who lives in the country like I do, the consumption of beer and spirits is remarkable for its absence, and I can only come to the conclusion that it is only in the cities, in Dublin in particular, that these luxuries are indulged in.  Of course, that may be due to the higher wages that are being paid in industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is Smithwick's consumed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the country. Smithwick's ale has a market all over the country, but it is not largely consumed in the rural districts.  I have not seen a man drinking beer or spirits in the country for the last five or six years.  Perhaps it is because I am not a frequenter of the bars.  I never drank in my life, and perhaps that is the reason I know so little about it, but I had information that there is infinitely less drink consumed.  It is almost reduced to disappearing point so far as the drink consumption by the farming community and the farm labourers is concerned.  What could they consume it on?  All their resources have been taken away from them and they cannot get anything, unless it is on tick.</P>
      <P>If there is a grumble with regard to the cost of living&mdash;and there is a very serious, a universal, grumble&mdash;it cannot under any circumstances be half as acute among the workers in the towns and cities, who have got something in the way of an advance in their conditions. They have got a big advance with regard to wages, according to their own claim.  Two or three times within the last 12 months ex-Senators Kennedy and Foran have claimed that wages have been advanced in the City of Dublin by £24,000 a week.  If that is so, it proves that the industrial workers have got something to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the country worker, the farmer, to meet the increased cost of living?  Let us take bacon as an example.  There are infinitely less pigs in the country to-day than there were two years ago.  As I pointed out last week, where we used to kill 1,500 to <Col N="1044" /> 1,700 a week, we now kill only 700 or 800.  I made a mistake when I said that other factories were in like circumstances. I understand that that is not so.  We have a shortage of 100,000 pigs.  What is the cause of it?  The farmer, the agricultural worker, is hit at both ends, as a producer and as a consumer.  I am not going to deal with the other burden he has to bear, the burden of the economic war.  That will more properly come up on another motion that is on the Order Paper.  I will exclude that matter altogether, that is, if one is able to exclude that all-important aspect from one's mind, and I will deal with the farmer as a consumer and as a producer, the two things proper to this motion.</P>
    <P>The farmer has gone out of pig production and he has gone out of fowl production.  Every country dweller, every farmer's wife, used to have a certain number of hens and other fowl. How many have they to-day?  The Minister for Agriculture was asked a supplementary question this afternoon. Did he answer it?  He was too wise to do that.  The fact is that there are no young fowl in the country.  There are much less hens in the country; there are less pigs and less of everything that is dependent on the admixture scheme. There are two things responsible for that; either the admixture scheme is not suitable, is not giving a proper return, or it is too dear.  Either nothing can thrive on it, can thrive sufficiently, or it is too dear, or both, and I think the answer is both.</P>
    <P>The position of the farmer and the agricultural worker is infinitely worsened&mdash;that is, from the point of view of the producer.  On top of that, they have to bear the cost of the economic war.  As a consumer the farmer is asked to pay more for the necessaries of life.  Is there any question about his position or that he has to pay more for the cost of living?  Is there any question that his position as a producer is worsened?  While there is a justifiable grumble among the people in the towns, the industrial workers, what is the position of the unfortunate man who has to carry the chief burdens of this country on his back?  The industrial worker is not so badly hit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I have here three circulars sent out to different traders inside the last fortnight. One circular says:&mdash;&ldquo;In view of the continued advance of the cost of production, labour and materials, we are again compelled to advance the price of our spare parts.  Kindly note, therefore, that there is an advance of 20 per cent. instead of the 10 per cent. of which we advised you a fortnight ago.&rdquo; Then they give the prices list.  Here is a circular to another tradesman:&mdash;&ldquo;We beg to advise that, due to the increased cost of production, we have been compelled to advance the price of all edged tools by 10 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The third circular refers to scythes and hay knives and it says: <Col N="1046" />&ldquo;We are reluctantly compelled to inform you that, owing to the increase in the cost of raw materials and labour rates, we have no option but to advance the price of scythe blades and hay knives.&rdquo;  The position is that the demand is made.  The people come together.  The two industries involved come together.  They agree and without any trouble the cost of the article is increased.  That is a very happy state of affairs for them.  It is something we have all envied and something that we are envying and regretting that we cannot participate in. You demand, we agree and we pass on the additional cost to the poor devil in the country who is not able to defend himself.  That is the position. But I tell the House that this vicious circle must stop because the people of this country, as a whole, cannot put up with it.  I want the Dáil and the people outside to realise that half of this community are not going to act as cart horses for the other half.  They are not going to carry this heavy load for the benefit of the other half of the community.  One citizen of this State has as much right under the Constitution as another.  Hungry men will not live in this country, and they would be damn fools if they did.</P>

      <P>The system that permits or enforces that cannot continue.  The people of this country should be left to work out their own salvation in their own way instead of being penalised by a power that we cannot fight.  We cannot fight that power except by a slow fight at the polls.  As I have already said, this is a vicious circle and it must stop.  Many people in this country to-day have made up or they are beginning to make up their minds that any 'ism that will put all the people of this country fairly pulling their load would be preferable to the present system.  Any 'ism that does that, whether it be Fascism or Christian Communism or anything else, is preferable to what we have to put up with. Anything by way of redress that will ensure that the people of this country will all be compelled to pull their load, <Col N="1047" /> and to pull evenly, will be acceptable by all the people.</P>
      <P>We had enough of the privileged classes in this country.  Twenty or 30 years ago we got rid of some of that privileged class, and we got rid of the rest of them 15 years ago.  We are not going to set up a new privileged class. We have no room for that class.  We have no room for the new class of inspectors, directors and the rest of them.  This morning a man handed me a quotation for 36-inch ranges manufactured in the Free State.  The price is £4 15s. 0d.  The same class of range, but a more suitable range and one that is more in demand by the people and which they buy in preference to this range at £4 15s. 0d., is a Glasgow range.  The price is £4 5s. 6d.  That is 9/6 cheaper than the home range. That £4 5s. 6d. range has to bear a tariff of 40 per cent.  In other words, the Glasgow range would be only 51/- without the tariff.  On the one hand you have a home-manufactured range costing £4 15s. Od., and on the other side there is a range costing £2 11s. 0d. and the Glasgow range is a better range.  It is no wonder that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been attending dinners and banquets. It is no wonder he and others are able to dine and wine and enjoy banquets when this sort of thing is going on.  It is the people who have to buy these ranges who are paying for the banquets and the wining and the dining.</P>

    <P>If a farmer wants a load of any material to do anything about his house, he is forced to go to the railway company and find out when he can get their lorry.  Else he can go without it. What he is generally doing is going without.  If the farmer wanted a load of gravel, sand or lime, he has to go to the railway company for their lorry and employ them.  If he employs a local lorry, and if that lorry has not the proper plate, the farmer is prosecuted. There was such a prosecution in Callan in Kilkenny last Friday. That was the prosecution of a man for bringing a lorry-load of chips.  In any event the case was dismissed.  I will not go into the matter of the evidence that was produced in order to effect <Col N="1048" /> that dismissal.  There is the position. The whole country has been handed over to Deputy Davin and his friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of living has been so much increased by the operation of these things that they affect the people very seriously.  I admit that this particular thing is not in these Acts.  What I refer to is that the railway lorry has to arrive with the driver and two loaders.  By the time the farmer has his lorry-load of material home he will have spent a load of gold, or at all events a load of copper, on it. The result is that the farmer is going without these things.  The grant of £40 to farmers whose valuation is under £25 for building is not being availed of.  All the farmer would get for that £40 would be 40 loads of sand.  The farmer has either to pay this money or to go without these things, because he cannot bring his horse on to the roads at all.  The roads are made impossible for horse traffic.  That is the position in which we are now.</P>
      <P>During this debate we heard a great wail about our attacking the programme of the Government on the one hand and on the other hand adopting it.  Of course we have to adopt the programme of the Government.  If the Government commit the people of this country to a certain type of economy, the people for the time being are helpless.  We have heard a good deal about the wheat scheme.  That is like other schemes introduced by the Government, and people have to carry it out, but I tell the House that it only requires 12 months more for the whole wheat scheme to die a natural death. Last year the area under wheat was reduced by 30,000 acres, and all indications point to the certainty that there will be a still further reduction next year.</P>

      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the land that has been growing wheat is only producing <Col N="1049" /> two, three or four barrels per acre now.  In addition, the growing of wheat has left a legacy in weeds that will do the farmer, and more than be enough for him, during the rest of his natural life.  If Deputy Davin were only to go down to Kilismesta or Durrow in his own constituency he would only have to open his eyes and see what the position is.  He could there see the state to which the country has been reduced by the wheat scheme.  The only further liability this State will have with regard to wheat-growing in the future is the provision of a decent funeral for wheat-growing, for that wheat scheme is going to die a natural death.  While every died a natural death.  While every other form of agriculture has been penalised by this Government, wheat has been subsidised.</P>
      <P>Every other form of agriculture has been penalised by the economic war. If wheat growing could be a success at all it should be a success under these conditions.  If the penalty were taken off the other forms of agriculture, if the cattle embargo of £4 5s. per head, or, as it used to be, £6 per head, were taken off, will any Deputy tell me what chance would wheat growing have? Wheat growing has no chance unless it is subsidised.  If the penalties imposed on other industries were removed, will any Deputy tell me how long would wheat growing as an economic proposition last in this country?  Take away the bounty on wheat production and how long would it last?  It is already dying, under the most favourable conditions, and it will be dead in 12 months more.  Whenever the economic war is settled, good-bye wheat.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Minister tells us that he has exact figures, and he says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I propose to give the exact figure representing the weekly average amount deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank, less withdrawals, plus the amount paid for savings certificates, less payments....  There is no evidence of a reduction in the standard of living there.  Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. <Col N="1050" /> There is evidence that our people are saving more.  That increase in savings was recorded in each month of this year up to June.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked at this stage &ldquo;What about the bank overdrafts?&rdquo; The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In July there was no increase recorded, but that was to be expected, having regard to the prolonged building strike which necessitated some depositors realising on their savings in order to maintain themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the whole increase in deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank is attributable to the City of Dublin and a few towns.  The Minister is in a better position than I am to give details.  He can tell us in what part of the country these savings were effected&mdash;whether they were effected in Kilkenny, Cork, Leitrim, Kerry, or in Dublin.  Again, his argument proves conclusively that while one section of the community&mdash;the people engaged in industry&mdash;have favoured treatment, the other section is infinitely worse off. Only one section of the community can attempt to meet this increased cost of living.  The other section cannot do so.  I need not go further than the Minister's words to show that.  I should like to have the knowledge which he has at his disposal.  It would prove our case.</P>
    <P>From people all over the country there are complaints of the pests which are overrunning the country.  There is a plague of rabbits, foxes, rats and winged pests.  Still, the price of cartridges has been increasing steadily for the last three or four years.  There is another increase going on now on the only cartridge which, in my opinion&mdash;and I am fairly experienced&mdash; will shoot anything.  When using the home manufactured cartridge which we were getting six months ago, you would think that your gun had tuberculosis. It was getting a tubercular cough and depositing the wads and charge at the mouth of the gun.  It would not kill anything, and everybody was handing back these cartridges and demanding Remingtons. There was an advertisement in the Kilkenny and Waterford papers recently announcing &ldquo;The last of the <Col N="1051" /> Remingtons&rdquo;.  This home-produced cartridge may be somewhat improved now.  The Government should give the country a good, cheap cartridge to deal with these pests.  Why would not the country be over-run with rabbits, rats and other pests when we have cartridges of that kind?  If it costs 2d. to kill a rat or a rabbit, is anybody going to fire at it?  These pests got a footing during the civil war.  They were thinned down considerably because of the fur prices.  To-day they are worse than ever.  There are complaints from every county.  The only way to deal with the situation would be for the Government to supply cheap cartridges to the people and try to reduce their cost of living.</P>
    <P>As regards motor cars, I saw one of these new aristocrats, in addition to the aristocracy established here a few years ago, in the country last Friday. He called on the local horticultural instructor and offered 3/6 per cwt. for apples.  That is a great encouragement to farmers to grow apples, which would be about 4d. per lb. in Dublin. He said he would give more if they were properly sprayed.  Judging by all the Bills we have going through this House&mdash;judging even by the Bills we had before us to-day&mdash;I am afraid that legislators, perhaps in both Parties, think only in terms of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>They think only of the conditions of employment in the cities and they are only interested at times of election in the country.  &ldquo;Out of sight, out of mind.&rdquo; Even Deputies from the country seem to take the situation very easily.  They do not care two pins about the conditions of the farmers and farm labourers so long as certain favoured treatment is meted out to this superior order of humanity which resides in the cities.  Is it any wonder that all our young men and young women want to get out of the country? What has been done to try to keep them at home and make their lot attractive? Is it any wonder that they have gone to England and that they have gone into the cities at home?  Nobody seems to have any regard for the country. Some of the speeches I have heard here from country Deputies would lead <Col N="1052" /> me to believe that they have either no power of observation or that they are criminal fools.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the cost of living in every direction has gone up.  I remember the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposing a tariff on phosphates in 1932.  He would listen to nobody's advice, and he forced the tariff through.  At that time people were using hundreds of tons of phosphates as grass manure.  How many hundreds of tons of phosphates were used during the last few years? Where people were selling large quantities of phosphates some years ago, they are not selling a ton to-day.  In regard to beet and wheat, there may be some used; but whoever thought of that tariff on phosphates did not know anything about his job or did not care. At all events, the Minister did the worst turn that could be done to agriculture, and, in my opinion, he did a very bad turn to the manufacturers of phosphates.  I can conceive nothing worse than that tariff.</P>
    <P>A Deputy speaks of the improvement in the quality of boots.  I see no increase in the quality, and I wear Irish boots.  The uppers and quarters may be good enough, but the sole leather is utterly inferior.  The good old sole leather which we used to have and which we used to need is not there now.  To say that the percentage in England has gone up as high as the percentage here is not giving any idea of the actual figures.  There was room for an increase in the English price of boots because of the low level at which they stood.  There is a big gap indeed between the two prices.  I have not been over in England for two or three years, so I am not able to give exact figures as I was a few years ago, but I remember the gap then, and it is not a fair comparison to talk of the rise there and the rise here.  Deputy Kelly, or some other Deputy, described conditions in England as unhealthy.  He suggested that that was not an indication of prosperity, and that the prosperity that was there was founded on armaments expenditure.  Whatever the foundation, prosperity was brought to England, and that prosperity has been reflected here, and were it not for that we should all be in the workhouse <Col N="1053" /> to-day.  The 1933, 1934 and 1935 position has been saved and revolutionised because of that prosperity, whether it is right or wrong.  It has prolonged our agony and saved us from the work house.  We will not get there for another year or two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise, as a newcomer to oppose this motion.  I attribute my presence in this House to the very important fact that there is a very considerable increase in the standard of living in this country to-day, a standard which has been steadily improving from 1932 to 1937.  I claim the honour of having replaced in this House one who stood for a policy which the people of this country on the last three occasions have rejected. When Deputy Dillon was speaking on this motion he availed of the opportunity to throw what I would describe as a financial smoke screen around the position as it presents itself to us.  I leave Deputy Dillon's smoke screen to be dealt with by those in financial responsibility to the Government; but in passing I wonder if the late Government had collected its share of the indemnities which Britain claimed from Germany for the loss of the 35,000 brave Irishmen who died fighting her battles on the fields of France, Flanders, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and all the other theatres of war, what would be the position?  We are told that if we had that money it would very considerably assist the standard of living here to-day.  It is on record that Britain's claim against Germany for the loss of those 35,000 Irishmen was based on the figure of £800 per head. We hear a great deal about the emigration that is taking place from this country in our day and of the exodus of the young men and women from this miserable land of ours; but I would remind the House&mdash;and these are recorded facts, recorded not by the Fianna Fáil Government but recorded facts of the late Government&mdash;that we lost no less than 250,000 of the cream of Ireland's young manhood and young womanhood from 1922 to 1932, and, if my mathematical calculations be correct&mdash;based on a calculation of £800 per head&mdash;those 250,000 young men and women who had to flee from this land <Col N="1054" /> during those years, when this land was, as we were so often told, flowing with milk and honey, represented £200,000,000 worth of rich red Irish blood and strong white Irish bone. But what does that matter?  They are the common Irish.</P>
      <P>We hear lamentations from all sides of the Opposition about the dreadful losses which this country is suffering through the economic war, and we are told that our standard of living is gradually declining.  I contend that the standard of living in this country has not been equalled in its history. Deputy Dillon laments the dreadful amount of money required by this Government to conduct the affairs of this country.  This Government could very easily run the affairs of this country at a figure similar to that at which the late Government ran them, if it were to condemn our Irish people to continue to live in the dreadful hovels of misery and disease from which the late Government did nothing to relieve them.</P>

      <P>We could also save millions if we were to deny the widows and the orphans the pensions they were justly entitled to as children of this country, because I contend that the land of Ireland is to the people of Ireland what the earth is to the whole human race.  It is the heritage and the patrimony given to them by its Creator as a free gift whereby they could, by the application of their continuous toil and labour, produce the necessaries of life so as to enable them to live in decency and comfort.  We are asked about the £35,000,000.  That was a one-sided game, we are told. I think that Deputies attending this House should have the common intelligence, at least, to understand that it takes two to make a quarrel.  During the discussion on this motion Deputy Brennan also took grave exception to the fact that this Government has taken steps to ensure that, so far as possible, all the farming implements required in the farming life of this country shall be produced here.  We <Col N="1055" /> had an intimation to the effect that even the material produced here is not what it should be, and is not comparable to what is imported.  I should like to ask this question: How did the people of Ireland till the land with Irish implements when this country maintained almost 8,000,000 of people in the 32 counties?  These tools were made at blacksmiths' forges, where they turned out not only forks and shovels, but ploughs and harrows, and no fault was found with them in those far-off days.</P>

      <P>Of course, any cudgel is good enough with which to try to belittle the efforts of Fianna Fáil, in trying to establish here a policy of self-sufficiency.  Is not that the objective, where it is possible to achieve it, not only in this country but practically all over the world to-day? During the debate we had a wail of woe from Deputy McGovern.  His wail of woe regarding the cost of living seemed to be that his friends around Cavan are not able to secure a sufficiency of second-hand clothing. Personally, I say &ldquo;wails of woe to them,&rdquo; because I trust it will be many years before there is a sufficiency of these second-hand clothing bargains&mdash; that spread disease as well as other things throughout the country.  Some time ago Deputy Dillon applauded the fact that we could have emigration and could send our exiles throughout the world.  In the olden days the cry was, &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught with the Irish.&rdquo;  The modern cry throughout the world is for a population that can be kept at an economic level.  Very extensive use has been made of the Statistical Abstract, a copy of which has been presented to every Deputy.  I ask Deputies on the opposite benches to give a little consideration to page 6, to see if they could not learn a lesson in Irish history from it.  I draw the attention of Deputy Gorey, who has just left the House, to the position of Kilkenny. In 1851 Kilkenny had a population of 19,975 souls.  What was the population in 1936?  It was 10,222, so that <Col N="1056" /> 9,753 people were driven from that city during a period of 50 years.  I direct the attention of Deputies for Kilkenny to the position of the town of Callan. In 1851 the population there was 4,650 and in 1936, 1,508.  Did Fianna Fáil or its policy drive the people from Kilkenny or from Callan?  Was it that policy drove the people from Drogheda, Ballinasloe, or from Thurles which in 1851 had a population of 8,800, and to-day has 5,000?</P>

I want to draw the attention of Deputies from Meath to some statistics which are not included in the Statistical Abstract issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I wish to remind Deputy Giles, who was interrupting some time ago, that it is lamentable that we have in the Parliament of the Irish nation a native of Royal Meath who does not know the history of this country.  That is a regrettable thing to have to say, but it is none the less true.  In 1841 the human population of County Meath was 183,828, and the cattle population 83,471.  How did the Irish people manage to survive when there was twice the population here, and less than half the present number of cattle?</P>

      <P>To get back to the point that I was dealing with when the interruptions took place, I submit that the analogy which I am drawing here has a very grave bearing on the question that we are discussing.  I would remind Deputies that in the year 1831 the population of all Ireland was 7,767,401, and that in that year we exported to England 211,189 barrels of wheat, 805,670 barrels of oats, 176,561 cwts. of flour and barley.  In 1930, and this is the ticklish point to which I would direct the attention of the Opposition, the population of this country was roughly 4,000,000.  It had gone down by almost half, and, while that is so, what do we find?  That we imported wheat, barley, oats, maize, flour and oat products to the value of £9,114,288.  These figures are not figures compiled by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They are the figures of the late Government.  In addition, we imported here something like £1,500,000 worth of Chinese bacon and punk stuff from Yokahama, not to speak of the salt bacon which Deputy Dillon is anxious to get on the market here again in order that he can make his 100 per cent. profit on it instead of handling Irish bacon.</P>

      <P>We could then have a reduced cost of living.  We could have Russian bacon at 3½d. a lb.  Admit tedly, we could not sell our own bacon for that to-day, but we would have a better opportunity of getting the 100 per cent. profit on the imported bacon. As one interested in the trade, I am heartily glad that the foreign stuff is shut out, and I hope that we will never see the day when it will be readmitted to this country.  It certainly gave us a reduced cost of living, but undoubtedly it also gave disease to the children of this country who happened to be fed on it for some years past.  From 1922 to 1932 we lost that dreadful amount through emigration. <Col N="1060" /> I am one of those who hold that the solution of this problem is to settle the people of this country on the land of Ireland, which is their rightful inheritance. As a Catholic Irishman I make no apology to the House for quoting from the legislation of Pope Clement VII in 1523.  His Holiness decreed:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Long ago our predecessor, Sixtus IV, of happy memory, remarked that for many years before his time the whole region around the City of Rome often afforded but scanty harvest of grain, to the serious loss and suffering of the people dwelling therein.  He took into account that, allowing for the natural qualities of the climate and weather, this scarcity was due most of all to the lack of tillage of the land.  The fields were by preference kept untilled for their owners, to serve as grazing ranches for brute beasts, on account of what was perhaps a greater return from the land while in that condition. This was done rather than till the soil or permit it to be tilled for the nourishment and support of human beings.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>From the <i>Catholic Bulletin</i> for November, 1933.  The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Hence Sixtus IV had decreed and ordained that for all time henceforth anyone whosoever wished to plough and till in the region around our City...should be at liberty to break up, plough and till at the proper and usual seasons a third part which he shall himself think fit to select of every single holding or tenure...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Clement VII acted on the same lines as his predecessor by his decree of March, 1523:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The third part of all land in the hands of leaseholders, the third part of every estate, the third of all the demesnes situated in Roman territory, in the patrimony of St. Peter, and <Col N="1061" /> on the coastal territory of the Campagna and twenty miles around it, whether belonging to Churches or to monasteries or to hospitals or to the Apostolic Chamber or to barons, nobles, Roman citizens, persons of all conditions and of all dignities, even eminent Cardinals...must without any hindrance or obstacle be every year worked, sown and kept in condition for the harvesting of corn,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>when it was a question of providing food for the people.  Further, we have the legislation of Pope Pius VI in 1783. In January, 1783, His Holiness required &ldquo;that farm buildings be opened to the landless tillers free of charge, and went even further in exempting the tiller from all payment of rent to the ranch-lord.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we are told that it is an unholy thing in this country if the Government takes steps to divide land. Of course, we do not have open opposition to this sort of thing.  We have what is known as the subterfuge, the wirepulling, and the red-tape, that was so strongly in evidence at one period, of a native Government in this country. We have evidence of that.  We have evidence of it in abundance, if we wish to show it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, Sir, I am also a newcomer to this House and I am not as familiar with the rules of procedure as I hope to be after I have been here for some time, and therefore I shall endeavour, in the few minutes of the time of the House which I intend to take up, to keep a little more to the point than the last Deputy has done.  Perhaps the only relevant remark he made &mdash;or perhaps the only relevant portion of his speech&mdash;was when he quoted from the figures of the population of this country around about the year 1850 or so, and then compared the figures of that period with the figures of the population to-day.  Perhaps he was relevant, and I think that he was in this respect at least: because he must have introduced into the minds of all here that word that stands out as a nightmare to all of us in this country, namely, the word &ldquo;famine.&rdquo; In that respect I think he was relevant, because it is on the subject of famine in this country that this motion is being debated here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another remark which I should like to make is, that this motion has been received by the Minister, who has already spoken, and by the members of his Party who supported him, in <Col N="1063" /> a way which, I think, does great discredit to men who come here to represent the people of this country.  Leave this House and go down to any part of the country, and do not we all know and realise as sensible men that the only thing that matters and the only thing that is spoken about in this country at the present time is the cost of living?  I say that we owe it as a duty to our constituents&mdash;to the people who sent us here&mdash;to treat such a motion with the respect it is entitled to get.  After this debate had been very eloquently opened by the proposer and seconder of the motion a few weeks ago, I sat here and listened to the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in reply.  May I say, without offence to this House or to anybody in this House, that I have watched the Minister for Industry and Commerce operating there on the Government Benches from time to time, and may I pay tribute to him as being, undoubtedly, a hard-working man&mdash;a man who comes into this House full of figures and facts&mdash;but I say that the question of the standard of living in this country is not going to be decided on the end of a slide-rule or on figures made with logarithms.  I was informed by one of the Deputies sitting in this House that anything to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred could be established by some book published in his Department.  The other day I received a copy of the book to which the last Deputy referred, namely, the Statistical Abstract.  That is a book issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I spent&mdash;I will not say an enjoyable evening&mdash;but an enlightening evening reading that book from cover to cover, and as a result of my reading of that book, I would invite Deputies to peruse it and see what is contained in it.  It covers a period, roughly speaking, of the last four or five years, and no matter what you look at, whether it be fisheries or any other department of our trade, it will be seen that there has been a steady decline in the years between 1932 and 1936.  I looked through that <Col N="1064" /> book in an effort to find some figure that would give me a glimmer of a hope to show that this country is not going down the banks, and I could not find anything to justify that hope. Every single figure was reduced during that period.  Now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was going to refer to certain figures the other day, said that they were incontrovertible. He did not refer to a great number of other figures in that book, and he did not tell us that he was going to pass them by&mdash;as he was entitled to pass them.  He got up and quoted the first sentence of the motion, to the effect that the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community, and then he stopped there, and asked us not to pass the motion; but he should have continued reading to the end of the sentence.  What he said, first of all, was that we on this side of the House, or on any side of the House, who are going to support this motion, would have to show that the standard of living of the people in this country, in fact, had been lowered; and he went on to prove that, instead of being lowered, the standard of living, in fact, had been raised.  In support of his argument he instanced, first of all, that there was more drink sold in this country to-day than was sold some years ago.</P>
    <P>Does anyone think for one moment that, because the consumption of alcohol has increased in this country the standard of living has been increased?  I think it is hardly necessary for me to dwell on that.  However, the Minister referred to another matter, to which Deputy Gorey has referred, and that is the sale of motor cars.  Does the Minister realise that, in the last few years, there has been put on the market here a new and cheap type of motor car, and does he also realise the great spread of the hire purchase system?  That is what is responsible for the increase in the use of motor cars&mdash; motor cars not yet paid for, but which are being paid for in monthly instalments. I hope I am not offending anybody here in saying that, because I admit that I am the owner of a motor car myself for which I pay by monthly <Col N="1065" /> instalments.  My point is that these two cases were given of the increase in the consumption of drink and the use of motor cars, and that the Minister went on to show by that that the standard of living had increased.  It has been said that you can prove anything by figures.  I see that the Deputy opposite nods his head, and I am sure he does that because he hopes that he will prove the same thing to me later on.  However, I suggest to the Minister and to other members on the Fianna Fáil Benches and to Deputy Hugo Flinn that they should go down to their constituencies with all this mass of figures&mdash;all of which can be verified in documents produced&mdash;that they should go down as ordinary Deputies representing their constituencies, and go up the lanes of this country and to the places where the farmers and agricultural labourers live&mdash;far away from the main road&mdash;to the places where the bulk of the population of this country lives, and where they work and toil&mdash;and put it to them whether or not the standard of living has risen.  I suggest that they go there with these figures and say to them: &ldquo;The standard of living has risen; look how much drink is sold in Dublin and how many clerks and inspectors have motor cars.&rdquo; That is where the real pulse of this country is to be felt, and that is the place where the people do not base their decisions on figures, but on the real facts that count.  Furthermore, I suggest that the whole Fianna Fáil Party should get themselves on to the deck of the Liverpool, the Glasgow, or the Rosslare boat and tell the unfortunate boys and girls, sons of decent people in this country, people who want to work, and who are leaving for England&mdash;the arch-enemy, as our friend opposite has told us&mdash;&ldquo;Do not go away; not only will we give you a good job, but we will put you back in your homes with an increased standard of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the real test of what this motion means.  We are not going to be blinded by figures produced in this House.  This motion means that the standard of living has been lowered by <Col N="1066" /> the actions and activities of the Government in their policy during the past few years.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and many Deputies are so obsessed with the idea of proving that the standard of living had not been reduced that they entirely neglected to deal with the latter part of the motion as to the cause.  They might, at least, for the purpose of debate have admitted that the standard of living had in some sense decreased.  I must say that there was one, if I may say so, glorious exception in this debate to the attitude adopted towards this matter by the members of the Government, and that was the speech, which I listened to with real pleasure, of Deputy O'Reilly on the last day on which this debate took place.  The Deputy very candidly admitted, not perhaps that the standard of living had in fact decreased, but that the cost of living had gone up. In so far as there was any real contribution to this debate and any real desire on the part of any member of the Government Party to produce something that would, at all events, send a message of hope to the people at the present time, I think that did very fairly come from the lips of Deputy O'Reilly.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies who spoke were led away by figures.  There was Deputy Moore, who addressed us on the subject of the plight of Canada.  He quoted from a very well-known geographical writer and he got into difficulties over the question of the failure of the crop, I think it was in the State of Manitoba, in Canada.  He was naturally in very great difficulties because that same gentleman who wrote that article is a very well-known authority, and he also wrote an article in a paper known as the <i>National Geographical Magazine.</i> I regret to say that I was unable to find that magazine, but I will put anyone who likes on the track of it afterwards. The tenour of the remarks of this gentleman, who was quoted at length by Deputy Moore, in this article in the <i>Geographical Magazine</i> was that the failure of the crops in the Middle West of North America was due to the fact that, year after year crops had been taken out of the soil <Col N="1067" /> without the necessary manure to go back into it in order to create a state of affairs when crops may be taken off the soil at different periods, letting it rest from time to time, and getting the benefit of the application of manure.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government at the present time is to take away from this country all the benefits which it should have, by disregarding the real prominence and importance of that industry in the economic life of the country.  I do not blame the Government a bit for having introduced this policy.  I do not blame them as a Government or as a Party for having introduced it, because the history of their association with this House is such that when, having been in opposition, they came to form a Government, they realised that they owed a duty to this country and to the people who live in this country to govern the country.  They realised in their hearts, with all the importance of government thrown on their shoulders, and all the responsibility that that entails, that the only sensible and sane thing to do was to follow the policy that until then had been carried on by the Government which they displaced.  The suggestion I make, and I think it is true, is that they said to themselves: &ldquo;If we carry on this same policy what will the people of the country say&mdash;`There is no difference; we were wrong'.&rdquo;  Then they sat down and said: &ldquo;What are we going to do?  We will have to invent something different, something, at all events, that has proved useful and good so far as this country is concerned,&rdquo; and they invented the new economic policy which we have all heard of and which is known as the new industrial policy.  When members opposite say that this debate was got up for the sole purpose of having a tilt at Irish industry, they should look at the members on these benches here, the great majority of whom are in some way or another engaged in the greatest industry that this country ever had, that this country has to-day, and that this country will ever have, namely, the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The last Deputy spoke with force and vehemence on the subject of land for the people, etc.  What does land <Col N="1068" /> for the people mean except the cultivation of the land and the continuation of this great industry of agriculture? If Deputies go to any encyclopædia, whether English or foreign, and look up there some description of the Irish Free State&mdash;I do not care whether it was issued in 1870, 1890, 1915 or 1923&mdash; they will always see, &ldquo;Industry&mdash;agriculture&rdquo; under the heading of this country.  They will see that also under the heading of other countries in an English encyclopædia, but if they go to a foreign encyclopaedia they will see exactly the same thing in reference to this country.  It is no good trying to disguise the fact that this country can suffer perhaps for five years or six years under this industrial plan, but sooner or later&mdash;and I think the later has arrived now&mdash;the Government policy will have been proved to be wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that any Deputy has supported any policy, or that the Government has put forward any policy for the purpose of deliberately injuring the livelihood of the people or the future economic wealth of the country.  But I do suggest that, as amateurs, they were wrong, and I suggest to them now, in 1937, that they should acknowledge that they were wrong and, like honest men and patriotic citizens, come forward now, even at the last hour, and admit the error of their ways.  The writing is on the wall in many different counties in this country.  It is only necessary to read the daily Press to see that a revolt is taking place amongst the members of the farming community.  That revolt is not brought about by the activities of any political Party or any group of politicians.  It has occurred in such widely different counties as Wicklow, Limerick, Tipperary and Clare.  It is not a revolt that was brought about by any political activity on anybody's part.  It is a revolt that has occurred of itself, like a volcano bubbling up, as a result of the crushing burdens imposed on the people of this country and as a result of the lowering of the standard of living.  I said that I was not going to take up much of the time of the House, and I do not intend to do so.  May I impress upon Deputies that I come into this House with an <Col N="1069" /> open mind on all subjects, believing that everyone has come here to do the best he can to represent his constituents and to achieve what this country desires and what Deputies know this country needs.  I know that it is difficult for a Party such as the Fianna Fáil Party to realise, as they must when they open their papers, that they no longer enjoy the confidence of the people of this country.  I know it is difficult, but there is a greater and a wiser thing, if I may say so, that they might do, and that is to accept the motion and meet it in the spirit in which it has been offered.</P>

      <P>I have listened for the last few weeks to a debate which I had been previously listening to for many months.  I have listened to speeches delivered upon this motion which, word for word, have been delivered on half a dozen other motions in this House.  I have listened to speeches every one of which will be re-delivered on half a dozen motions which still are on the Order Paper.  Private members' motions apparently have sunk to the level in which they are so framed, and so spoken to, that any person, without special preparation of any kind, without even a knowledge of the wording of the motion before the House, can come in here and deliver a speech. Everybody here practically has read the motion to the House and has complained bitterly that no one else has touched on the motion.  At any rate, that charge cannot be levelled with any fairness against the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If there has been one speech which attempted to be relevant, which attempted to come up to the issue, which attempted to induce and help members of the House to come to the issue, it has been the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have the report of the speech here before me, and frankly I do not know of any better speech or any better or more relevant way to speak upon this subject, than the actual lines laid down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like some Deputy who follows to get out of this area of generality <Col N="1070" /> and tell us where the Minister for Industry and Commerce failed to attempt to be relevant.  Now, I am only taking that as an example, because I am not going to suggest for one single moment that everybody who followed on this side has been equally relevant. It would have been impossible for them to be so and to pay any respect whatever to the speeches which had previously been delivered.  It is one of the reasonable courtesies of debate that, in following a speaker, one shall pay some attention to what he said, shall attempt to meet his arguments, shall attempt to follow somewhat in his footsteps; and I, frankly, have failed&mdash;and I have sat here and listened with a considerable amount of interest and some attention&mdash;to see any Deputy on the other side even making an attempt to accept the invitation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out to the House that this motion consisted of three parts&mdash;(1) a declaration that the standard of living had been lowered; (2) that it had been lowered by the imposition of Government taxes, levies and duties; and (3) a demand that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.  These were the three relevant portions of the motion, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked anyone to prove that the standard of living had been lowered.</P>

      <P>I most certainly am not going to read the Deputy's speech.  I heard the whole of the Deputies' <Col N="1071" /> speeches, and they made no attempt whatever to prove anything of the kind.  What they all said was: &ldquo;Everybody knows; Everybody says,&rdquo; but no one came down to the point of showing that the standard of living was in fact reduced.  The standard of living is not, in fact, reduced, and no member of this House has yet been able to contest the actual facts, statements and figures, and the references to these facts, given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I was very hopeful that the Deputy who spoke a few moments ago was going to attempt to put his feet in the footprints of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and show that the Minister was wrong.  He started out on drink and then went on to motor cars.  Then he dropped the question like a hot potato.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have had the experience of attempting to check up on statistics. Some years ago I was anxious to get, if possible, a moving picture of the progress of the effects of the economic war and other changes on local conditions in this country.  I was anxious, if it was possible, to trace through, say, the Western counties and the Eastern counties, through the counties of the mountainy men, through the meads and grazing districts, through the milk-producing and other counties, to see if I could get year by year the effect of a certain movement.  For that reason I got together a series of statistics of various kinds which in our opinion would indicate a change in the economic condition.  I do not need at the moment to go into those particular facts.  Some day I hope to be able to give that picture to the House.  It included, for instance, the monthly turnovers of the banks in each of the counties.  It included a whole lot of statistics of one kind or another that were intended to show the effect, and eventually we got from them some sort of a picture.  But what I am getting at for the moment is this, that we went back afterwards to see if we could find one statistic in the whole of the indices which were used that would closely approximate to the average result given by all the indices. In other words, was there any common <Col N="1072" /> statistic which could be regarded as an indication?</P>
    <P>Now, to my amazement and somewhat to my discontent, I found that the indication which was ridiculed by Deputy Esmonde, the indication of the increase or the relativity of decrease in the consumption of alcohol, was, on the whole, the most representative index.  Now, taking the last few years, as the House knows, that was a period in which there has been no large variation, no very significant or strong variation upward, in the consumption of drink.  On the whole, over a period of ten years or fifteen years, the record of this country in the reduced consumption of drink is amazingly satisfactory to everyone except those who have to collect revenue from it for the purpose of running the country, but I give it to you now purely and simply as the result of a student's examination of the facts, that, other things being equal, the increase or decrease in the consumption of alcohol in the form in which it is commonly used&mdash;I am not now speaking of high-priced wines or anything of that kind&mdash;is, in fact, a very fair and accurate index to the variations in conditions in different periods and in different areas.  It is not, in my opinion, right&mdash;no student would regard it as right&mdash;to treat as ridiculous the variation in the consumption of alcohol in the popular form as an indication of variation in the condition of prosperity.</P>
    <P>In the same way, you can take the consumption of such a thing as tobacco.  There are individual people to whom tobacco is a necessity.  There are people to whose family the consumption of tobacco is of very great interest.  I know one case in which a man, for Lenten purposes, gave up the consumption of tobacco, and his whole family went into petition in the interests of the comfort of their homes that he should abandon that particular form of abstinence.  While there are certain cases in which it is a necessity, in the vast majority of cases it is a luxury.  The consumption of tobacco, widely spread as it is over all the community, is an indication that there is some reserve in the possession of common people for the <Col N="1073" /> purpose of enjoyment.  I could go through, in the same way, the number of indications given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not propose to do so.  It is not my business.  It is the business of someone in the Opposition to follow him step by step, and show, one by one, that the indications which he gave to rebut the statement that the standard of living has fallen do not carry that significance.  No member of the Opposition&mdash;in view of the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has, in that precise and detailed manner, faced up to the first issue which was raised&mdash;is entitled to say that the Government have ignored or have disregarded the essence of this discussion, or have failed to meet the issues which were raised.</P>
    <P>The second issue is that whatever falling off there has been, real or imaginary, in the standard of living, has been caused by taxes, levies, duties and impositions on foodstuffs and other necessities of life imposed by this Government.  It has been said that the Minister for Industry and Commerce denied that the cost of living had risen.  He did not deny anything of the kind.  If Deputies will look at column 231 of the Official Debates of 6th October, they will find that statements of that kind are nonsense.  &ldquo;There is a tide in the affairs of men,&rdquo; and there is a tide in the affairs of the prices of commodities. That tide reached a peak in 1929.  It fell again, and it has been rising now for about a year.  It has been rising very steeply in this year. It has, apparently, in the last few months, again reached a peak and begun to fall.  Now, in so far as there is that universal and international tendency to variation in prices, no Government can be attacked&mdash;can properly and reasonably be attacked&mdash; because that trend in world prices is evidenced in the actual prices internal to that country.  I think everyone will concede that proposition without hesitation.  At least, no reasonable man could deny it.  The only question which does arise&mdash;and here is a matter on which you can begin to get at a Government&mdash;is that, if it can be <Col N="1074" /> shown in any country that the prices of the necessities and essentials of life have in that country risen more than they have risen in the international market, then the onus of proof may be put upon the Government to show, first, that they are not directly responsible for that variation; and secondly, that there is no countervailing advantage which would meet that difference.</P>
    <P>Now, that is one way in which the Opposition could tackle the proposition. I am deliberately inviting the Opposition to tackle the proposition in that way.  If they can do that, then they are putting the onus of proof upon this Government.  But, unless and until they do, unless and until they come down to hard, clean, provable facts of that kind, all sorts of vague statements will carry them nowhere.  All sorts of vague statements, eloquent or vehement as the last Deputy who spoke of said, all sorts of statements that everybody knows, will carry them nowhere.  It is like the man who gets up and says, &ldquo;I am not going to make a political speech.&rdquo;  We all know what kind of a speech he will make.  Or it is like the man who says, &ldquo;I am not going to detain you long.&rdquo;  We all know how long he is going to detain us. Or it may be the man who starts off reading the subject-matter of the discussion.  We all know how far away from the subject-matter of the discussion he is going to keep.</P>

      <P>I would have to sing them, I am afraid.  Coming back now to one of the actual speeches which were delivered here, I will take the speech of Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon started off with that nice courtesy, that meticulous courtesy, which distinguishes him in matters of this kind, by speaking of the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a brazen-faced performance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I defy any Deputy to quote any speech of mine in which there was strong language of any kind. A lot of people have tried to do so and they came back and said: &ldquo;You meant a lot more than you said.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Righto.  A brazen-faced performance&mdash;that is the description by Deputy Dillon of the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who meticulously followed this resolution.  Fraudulent misrepresentation&mdash;that was the nice, courteous, meticulously courteous, expression by Deputy Dillon in relation to a speech in which the Minister not merely gave facts, out gave the references and authorities of those facts and asked that anyone should check up against fraudulent misrepresentation.  Those who listened to him were the Minister's gulls.  I believe the man who did not like strong language has left that Party.  But then the Deputy proceeded and, with that delightful humour, expressed <Col N="1076" /> again with the meticulous courtesy which makes his contributions to this debate so valuable to those who want to learn what to avoid in speech, he went on to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had started a glorious factory in Naas which, while it lasted, smelled beautifully.</P>
      <P>That is really an example of the sense of responsibility and the sense of courtesy and dignity of debate that Deputy Dillon thought should introduce a motion of this kind, which deplores the lowering of the standard of living, which charges the Government with responsibility for it, and then goes on to demand that every tariff, levy, duty and like imposition on foodstuffs and other necessities of life in this country shall forthwith be abolished. What of the brazen-faced performance of those who have refused to tell us one single one of all the levies, taxes, impositions and the like on foodstuffs which they want taken off?  We had an example here the other night from Deputy Martin Corry, who attempted to deal with a few of them.  He mentioned a couple of tariffed industries which exist, in virtue of levies, taxes and impositions, in the constituencies of Deputies opposite. But none of those taxes, levies or impositions was to be removed.  As far as I can gather the position, it is that everybody wants every levy, tax and like imposition which is put upon anything, the putting on of which does not benefit himself or his own constituents, to be abolished.  But no one has yet come down except Deputy Brennan, who hesitated for a moment on the fact that £8,000 had been raised upon shovels and other instruments of agriculture.  Does Deputy Esmonde want the tax taken off shovels and agricultural implements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any particular proposal the removal of which any Deputy on the other side of the House is prepared to advocate which some other Deputy on his own benches will not get up and say must not be taken off on any account whatsoever?  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce is entitled to take the dictionary meaning of this term, that every tax, every <Col N="1077" /> imposition and every tariff is to be removed.  And he is entitled to demand that those who formulated that resolution shall define its terms and shall give us a list of the industries which are now tariffed which are to disappear, or the particular commodities which to-day are buttressed, and the particular impositions of one kind or another that have to go.  It is not fair of those who accused the Minister for Industry and Commerce of ignoring this motion that they themselves shall ignore it to the extent of failing to put it in a form in which it can be reasonably debated.</P>
    <P>For instance, if we had a list setting out that the tax should come off tobacco, should come off silk stockings, should come off boots, should come off flour or should come off imports of bolts and nails, then the House would be in a position, with a statistical abstract before them and such other figures as the Minister may have, with returns of unemployment, returns of home assistance, the geographical distribution of the industries which are concerned, with a knowledge of the number of people employed and the wages paid to them, to come down to brass tacks and say: &ldquo;Yes, that particular tariff is not producing the results which the House and the country hoped for, and it should go,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This particular tax, this particular imposition, is producing results such as we hoped for, and it is to be retained.&rdquo; But when we get the universal motion that every single one of them should go, what are we to do? It seems to me that the first thing we would have to do would be to find other means of raising the particular revenue which they produce.  I personally agree that in a period of what one might call high tariff taxation there should be a review of all the taxes which have been imposed and the results of them traced. I remember when the previous Government was introducing what they called experimental tariffs.  It took them, I think, three and a half years to decide that there would be a tariff on rosary beads.  That industry employed, I think, about ten people.  It took them another couple of years to decide <Col N="1078" /> whether or not there would be a tariff on woollens, and that just synchronised with a Budget which required the money.  There were various other small tariffs of that kind, for instance, the tariff on boots.  The one thing in which I did agree with the previous Government in relation to those tariffs was the idea of treating them as experimental. I mean by that quite apart from the question of whether a high or low tariff policy was good, there was something definitely to be said for regarding the tariff before it was imposed as something to be carefully studied, and after it was imposed as something to be carefully watched.  After these tariffs had been in operation for a bit I made inquiries.  I went to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was a somewhat moribund, cobwebbed, fly-covered Department at that time.  It was the Department in which some very good men struggled with an atmosphere which would have been sufficient to break the hearts of any group of men. I asked them for the results over a period of years of those experimental tariffs.  I asked what they had found out of those tariffs, and how they had traced the effect upon the community, and whether the cost of those particular goods had risen over and above what would be normally allowable, due to the variation of the cycle of trade and the price of raw material.  I went there in an atmosphere of faith and hope.</P>

      <P>No; there was one person who made an attempt to help them. That person was myself when I brought them commodities and got them to analyse those commodities.  All those commodities were torn down to their ultimate primal components in order that the cost of them could be traced.  Now, if that proved above the capacity of the Department of Industry and Commerce when they were dealing with only two or three tariffs for four or five years, surely it is a much more difficult task where there are, as has been said in this debate, hundreds of these tariffs.  But the mere fact that there are hundreds of these tariffs will not, in my opinion, relieve the Government of this country of the responsibility some time, and at some early date, of attempting to investigate, in relation to a considerable number of them, what exactly has been the effect of the tariffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; there are no cobwebs in that Department now.  That is the most active and vital Department of the State now.  There is no question that the staff in the Department of Industry and Commerce are working to-day and that they have something to work at.  I am putting this to the House as reasonably-minded men, as a jury sitting on the actual economic and social conditions engendered and produced by a series of industries which are to-day employing somewhere about 60,000 men&mdash;at any rate, 60,000 people.  What knowledge have Deputies opposite which enables them to pass a sentence of death now and by this motion on all those industries? What knowledge have Deputies <Col N="1080" /> opposite of the bootmaking industry, the flour industry, the silk industry, the ready-made clothing industry, the woollen industry, the nuts and bolts industry, and all these other industries which enables them to say now that in a single individual one of the industries there should be a withdrawal of the protection under which they have grown up, that they should be condemned to death, and that the people who are employed in them shall be put out?  I am putting that question in relation to any single one industry.  Is there any man in this House who knows a particular industry and knows from his own knowledge of that industry that it is an industry that should be destroyed?  Can any Deputy say that the extra people now employed in that particular industry should, for the benefit of the State, be put out of employment?  Will any Deputy opposite say of any particular industry that it should for the benefit of the State be destroyed?  No.  That would be coming down to the particular. It is far easier to say in this motion that all duties, levies and other impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life should forthwith be abolished.  It is far easier to say that all these things should go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is not a single Deputy here who is prepared to say that the flour industry should be abolished or that the boot trade should be abolished; that the nut and bolt industry should be abolished; that the manufacture of motor cars, motor tyres and lubricating oil should be abolished&mdash;not a man is prepared to say that any one of these industries should be abolished, but the whole body&mdash;every single one of them&mdash;are prepared to say that they should all be abolished.  We shall go a bit further.  If they are not prepared to condemn any one of these industries to death, which one of them will they reprieve except one in their own constituency? Am I wrong in saying that that means the removal of all the taxes and all the levies and all the impositions and all the protections of all the industries engaged in food production or the production of other necessaries of life?  If I am wrong, in what particular am I wrong?  Name me one industry you intend to leave here, any <Col N="1081" /> one of you, outside an industry in your own constituency.  And we are ignoring the motion!  It does seem rather difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since the nuts and bolts have come in and since they are not necessaries of life, we shall go back to Deputy Esmonde for a moment. Deputy Esmonde made the remarkable statement that people could not live on slide rules and logarithms.  The real meaning he had behind that was that all statistics that did not suit him were lies.  In other words, it was no use for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to attempt to prove that the standard of living had not fallen, <Col N="1083" /> because if the Minister for Industry and Commerce used figures to prove that, then the proof was no good.  You cannot prove things by slide rules or logarithms.  In other words, you cannot prove by statistics, you cannot prove by observed and attested facts. The only way that you can prove anything is by somebody coming along and saying: &ldquo;Everybody knows.&rdquo;  If that be so, what sort of impudence did Deputy Brennan show in actually taking a book of statistics and quoting from it?  So far as I know, the Minister for Industry and Commerce did nothing but quote statistics and give the reference to them.  According to Deputy Esmonde, he must not do anything of the kind.  Are we, or are we not, to use statistics?  Are we, or are we not, to use facts; or are we simply to deal with the wild imaginings of people?  Are we going to rule statistics and calculations out of our discussion?</P>
      <P>Now, we shall take Deputy Brennan. Deputy Brennan speaks of &ldquo;the Minister's bluff.&rdquo; Is it bluff that in the 23 industries 31,000 more men are employed? Is it bluff for the Minister to state that 60,000 or 70,000 of a total are employed in these industries?  Is it bluff that the capacity of this State to maintain a population is increased by the fact that 31,000 additional persons are statistically proved and shown to be engaged in these industries?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his remarks said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not contest, and no one would be so foolish as to contest, that the cost of living has increased since 1934.  It has definitely. In 1932-33 the cost of living fell.  The fall was stopped in 1934, and since then there has been quite a substantial rise.  The motion, however, contends that the rise in the cost <Col N="1085" /> of living is due to Government action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to ask somebody to show the connection, and, again, nobody does.  General statements are so much easier to make and so much more difficult to be tied down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, at one point in his speech, trembled for a moment on a sense of responsibility.  He was evidently thinking of a speech delivered in the British House of Commons early in the Abyssinian crisis, when the British Foreign Minister said that the position was so delicate that a word might precipitate a disaster, and, imagining himself for a moment in the position of a person of importance, a person whose saying or unsaying might possibly start an avalanche, he said that the word might precipitate trouble and for that reason, he hesitated to say anything which would disturb the financial position.  He immediately went on to say: &ldquo;The Minister, next year, will try to borrow money and he will not get sixpence.&rdquo; Now, there is the sense of responsibility of the man who tells you that a word may precipitate trouble.  Then he goes on to say that the country is in a deep depression and, further on, he says: &ldquo;Five years later, we will have a broken and destroyed land.&rdquo; That is the man with a sense of responsibility who does not want to say or do anything which would disturb the position.  I think it was Deputy McGovern who told us that there was not a single industry in this country that could support itself.</P>

      <P>I am quoting.  He said they were all leaning up against one another and that when one collapsed, they would all fall, and there again, you have the position where you must not do or say anything which will precipitate trouble.  Deputy Dillon gets back on the subject and says: &ldquo;There are signs of incipient bankruptcy.&rdquo; That you have signs of incipient bankruptcy in 1937 is an amazing improvement, an unbelievable improvement, <Col N="1086" /> on the conditions which, we were told, did in fact exist in 1932.  In 1932, it was not incipient bankruptcy.  It was not a question of five years after 1937 having a bankrupt and destroyed people; it was not that in 1937 no industry could support itself; that they were all leaning up against one another waiting to fall.  What was the condition according to Fine Gael in 1932?  We were bankrupt already.</P>

      <P>Evidently the Deputy has not been using a slide rule or logarithms; he has been using his imagination on his statistics.  What I want to point out to the House is: Tell me the worst story your diseased imaginations could contrive of the conditions, hopes and prospects of this country and I will tell you that you are five years late compared with your colleagues who told us that those conditions had already existed five years ago.  Five years ago, Fine Gael was telling our opponent in the economic war that he had already completely won; that we were on our knees; that we were crying out.  They were saying: &ldquo;Keep up the pressure and they will break,&rdquo; and when they did not break, &ldquo;put on more pressure and they will break.&rdquo; The pressure went on and on and on, and the country did not break, and eventually we reached a condition in which the British Minister for Agriculture in the House of Commons said that he had failed <Col N="1087" /> completely, even for the interest of his own agricultural policy, in the efforts he had made.  Let us quote Mr. Baldwin.  Mr. Baldwin said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have put on all the taxes we possibly could put upon beef and we have not been able to raise the price in the market.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What really happened was that the economic war started at a moment of acute agricultural depression, and, in spite of the piling up of British taxes, of the addition that would normally have been made to the cost of the commodities imported, and of the tariffs imposed, the price of beef fell and fell and could not be kept up until the British had, in addition to their tariffs, to put on&mdash;not for the purpose of the economic war and not for the purpose of recovery of any pretended debt, but purely and simply for the purposes of their own agriculture&mdash;quotas to buttress the failure of their efforts.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Dillon, who is not one to precipitate anything, went on to slither down the slope. Here is one of a series of extracts from Deputy Dillon:</P>
      <P>Every country is booming in an unparalleled way, riding high, wide and handsome on a magnificent wave of prosperity, except this country.</P>
      <P>Is that true?  He went on to state that for 20 years he was prepared to guarantee peace in Europe.  Is there anyone who will guarantee it for ten days? Deputy Brennan went on to say: &ldquo;Let us work simply and solely on a peace policy.&rdquo;  The Deputy was dealing with the question whether or not any of these agricultural impositions should be put on flour.  He went on to ask: &ldquo;Why do we want wheat?  Why do we want flour?&rdquo;  Because of the fear of war.  Deputy Brennan with that sense of responsibility which distinguishes the Rotary Club opposite, said that we must bank on a peace policy for 20 years.  Is there any other senior statesman in Europe who is prepared in relation to any portion of the policy to his country to bank upon a peace policy for 20 years?  We have the advice of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan that this country has to ignore everything, and that in spite of the fact that a Deputy on the opposite benches to-day was asking the Minister for Defence to take precautions against gas attacks.  Deputy Dillon has a very high respect for his country.  He told us that 90 per cent. of the active, dignified, hard-working fellows had already gone out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not inventing that statement. These were his words.  That is the sense of responsibility of the man who would not precipitate anything, who thinks, because this country has not fallen for flapdoodle, that 90 per cent. of the good men have gone away. Is Fine Gael defending that statement? Is it defending the statement that for 20 years we will have peace in Europe, and that no precautions of any kind are to be taken?  Is that Party defending anything else in the motion?  They are not prepared to <Col N="1089" /> name a single industry which they are prepared to have destroyed by the withdrawal of tariffs.  They are not prepared to defend any portion of the motion.</P>
    <P>Do they defend the statement of Deputy Dillon, that we have reached this level, that 90 per cent. of the active, dignified, hard-working fellows have gone?  Nobody defends that.  We will move to another statement of this statesman.  The Deputy stated that they got a lot of political kudos out of this.  Political kudos is capable of gradual accumulation, and a reserve of political kudos can be tested at odd times statistically.  Where is the evidence that Fine Gael is collecting political kudos?  I do not think that Deputy Dillon knows what the people of the country are thinking of his Party.  His Party ought, by this time, to know what the country thinks of their leader, Deputy Dillon.  I know that the biggest kudos they will get will be when he follows three or four of their previous leaders that we have seen go into the discard.  Then Deputy Dillon came to the economic war. Here again we have one of these amazingly, almost unbelievably valuable contributions, one of these things for which the Dáil will live in history. I think one of its chief grounds for the possibility of immortality will be as a footnote to the life and speeches of Deputy Dillon.  On column 738 he opened the Humber safe.  He pronounces the magic words &ldquo;Open Sesame,&rdquo; or gives the &ldquo;high sign.&rdquo; I think it is &ldquo;Abracadabra,&rdquo; one of Kipling's books that states the secret hid underneath the pyramid was that some contractor did Cheops out to save millions.  Deputy Dillon possesses a secret.  There is a very beautiful poem which I might be allowed to recite for the House, as it rather typifies my attitude of mind towards this great secret.</P>
    <P>&ldquo; As if within the sylvan centre of the land</P>
    <P>There lay a nameless lake no sail had ever fanned;</P>
    <P>As if within that lake a wooded islet grew;</P>
    <P>As if within that isle a stream in silence flowed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> As if within a glen that stream, kept ever green,</P>
    <P>A flower breathed forth;</P>
    <P>As if within that flower a drop of dew reposed&mdash;</P>
    <P>So many times removed, so secret, and so safe,</P>
    <P>So lone and all improved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the secret of how to end the economic war with advantage to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that this is a difficult problem, but Deputy Dillon comes along and says that this can be done in one night&mdash;not, mind you, in three days.  Deputy Cosgrave would have taken three days to do it.  This is what Deputy Dillon says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a formula which can save faces on all sides and, overnight, restore the earning capacity of our people, and thus eliminate the rise in the cost of living and all the other evils that are complained of in this motion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is something.  This is the formula:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Minister and his colleagues will go to the British Government to-morrow, to the only market where we can raise money to bring down that cost of living, and say to the British Government, `We do not ask you to accept the truth of our contention in this dispute, nor must you ask us to accept the truth of your contention in this dispute.' &rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  I can imagine your amazement.  It is from the speech made on the motion by Deputy Dillon.  I also am flabbergasted.  But there is the formula which, according to Deputy Dillon, &ldquo;can save faces on all sides and overnight restore the earning capacity of our people, and thus eliminate the rise in the cost of living and all the other evils that are complained of in this motion.&rdquo;  His formula is: &ldquo;We do not ask you to accept the truth of our contention in this dispute, nor must you ask us to accept the truth of your contention in this dispute, nor must you ask us to accept the truth of your contention in this dispute.&rdquo;  That is the formula which is going to reduce the cost of living and remove &ldquo;all the evils complained of in this motion.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Therefore, leaving both cases intact, neither side abandoning the attitude that they have taken up, let us acknowledge that there is money between us and that this has got to be settled sooner or later by the sensible method of compromise. On that basis a settlement can be arrived at, and hundreds of thousands of people in this country can be relieved from the unbearable burdens they are at present suffering.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want the House to analyse that sacred and holy formula, that &ldquo;open sesame,&rdquo; that blessed word Mesopotamia&mdash;that anything you like&mdash;that Abracadabra, that magic of Deputy Dillon's, which is going to remove all difficulty.  &ldquo;We do not ask you to accept the truth of our contention in this dispute, nor must you ask us to accept the truth of your contention in this dispute.&rdquo; Does any reasonable person believe that there is anything in that statement which would have any effect whatever?  What is the meaning of it?  Does it mean that we are to say that there really never was anything in dispute between us?  Are we to say that there is no purpose, meaning or reality in the fight which both sides have made, and, if we are not going to say that, what is going to happen after Deputy <Col N="1092" /> Dillon has got rid of his formula? The dispute will come up for consideration, and you will be in exactly the same position that you were in before Deputy Dillon invented his formula. We have had this before.  We had it from ex-Deputy MacDermot&mdash;the same old story that if only we would use some magic words of this character all would be well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the secret underneath this?  On what terms are you prepared to negotiate a settlement? Let us have some formula from you. Remember, if we are to treat the Opposition as responsible people&mdash;and if we could conceive the possibility that, by any chance, they should be put in the position of being negotiators they would have to be treated as responsible people&mdash;then what they had previously said would have to be taken into account.  Their great leader, General O'Duffy, said that no Government in this country would ever pay the annuities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>General O'Duffy cannot be right even on that.  He said that no Government in this country would ever pay the annuities.  If Deputy Dillon goes over with his formula what happens?  He says in effect: we do not ask you to accept the truth of our contention in this dispute, namely, that we do not owe you the money; but we will not pay you the money, and on that basis you can settle it overnight.  Does anybody believe that?  Is it not very extraordinary that we cannot get any answer from the Deputies opposite but irrelevant interruptions?  We can get no answer to specific questions.  I ask them now: what single tax which is to-day imposed are you prepared to <Col N="1093" /> remove?  What single imposition are you prepared to have removed, what single industry are you prepared to destroy?  What particular industry is increasing the cost of living?  Will they say how the Government is responsible, and in what proportion and degree, for the rise in the cost of living?  There is not a single answer to these questions. When I go back to the heaven-sent leader, Deputy Dillon, he says that he has got a magic formula.  I ask the House to give me any meaning that will attach to it.  Again, I get nothing but inarticulate interruptions from the Deputies opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We still get back to this, that we are in the position that there is only one man in the House who knows the secret as to how all this can be attained without any loss, damage or hurt to any man in the country, and he will not tell us.  He simply says that we are to go to the British Government and say that there never has been any dispute between us&mdash;that &ldquo;when you say that we owe you the money we are not going to pay any attention to that; when we say that we do not owe you the money, you are not going to pay any attention to that; when you say that we are going to exact and collect the money to the last penny, we are not going to pay any attention to that; when we say that no Government in this country will ever pay the annuities again, they are not going to pay any attention.&rdquo;  And that is going to settle the economic war!  That is the statement up to the present.  In other words, these Deputies have not got a solution and do not dare to admit that they have not got it, except a solution overnight. What is the solution?  I will give way to any Deputy who can tell me what is the solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Deputy Kelly has helped me very much now, because he gave an interval&mdash;not that I object to the interruptions.  I hope Deputies will not be astonished if I say that Deputy Brennan then started to discuss the tragedy of executive versus legislative imposition of tariffs.  Deputy Brennan discussed that for a considerable period of time, and during the time that he was going on to emphasise that difference I was hoping that, at some time before he finished his speech, he would use that illuminating speech in some such way as would make a coherent whole and that he would use some phrase that would drag the speech within the ambit of a conclusion.  Having complained bitterly of the executive imposition of tariffs, he got off that&mdash; apparently agreeing with it.  I thought, at first, that he was going to take that line again&mdash;all the time hoping and praying that something like a consecutive idea would come from what he was saying in connection with this motion.  I hoped to hear what the policy of the Fine Gael Party would be, and whether it would be to remove the tariffs which had been imposed by administrative rather than by executive action.  However, as every tax imposed by administrative action has been covered by executive action, there does not seem to be very much difference.  At any rate, the Deputy evidently found that he could not do very much with regard to that. He then went on to criticise the policy of self-sufficiency, and he pointed out that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that we must have exports as well.  Of course, in his speech, he misrepresented the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That, however, is merely an unconscious habit, I am sure.  I do not think it is even <Col N="1096" /> deliberate on the other side, in one sense.  It has become a custom or a habit, and is almost unconscious.  I mean that it has become part of the warp and woof of the political life of their demeanour here&mdash;part of the custom and colour of their speaking habit and of the texture of their minds and souls.  I want to acquit them of the deliberate action of having anything whatever arising from an intelligent conception of the fact that they are misrepresenting the facts.  I am merely pointing out that it has become a habit with them to do it.  Deputy Brennan went on to say, in the course of his speech, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that there must be exports in order to raise the standard of living.  The Minister said nothing of the kind.  He made a perfectly simple, bald and incontrovertible statement: that an increase in exports could raise the standard of living.</P>

      <P>The suggestion is that this country is suffering because the total of its international trade has been reduced.

      <P>You have the ordinary case of imports and exports, and we are now gradually getting back to a portion of Deputy Dillon's speech&mdash; which lasted for some columns&mdash;in which we analysed the causes, and so on, of the adverse trade balance.  The <Col N="1097" /> exports of a country, apparently, are what everybody wants to keep up, and you speak of an adverse balance of trade when your imports are greater than your exports.  Why that is so, I have never been able to understand. At no time, either as a member of the Government or when I was in opposition, have I accepted that doctrine of the adverse trade balance.  The exports of a country are the payments they make.  They are their expenses. The imports of a country are its income, and a country that has permanently a favourable trade balance, as the saying is, would be a country which, undoubtedly, would be bankrupt, because it would mean that it was every year sending out more goods than it received payment for. The export and import of goods are not in themselves in any way an absolute indication.  It depends altogether on the nature of the goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will return to the export and the import trade.  Say, for instance, a country imported £100,000,000 worth of goods which are saturated with labour; £100,000,000 worth of goods, every pound of which goods had contributed the maximum possible amount to the maintenance of the lives of working people in <Col N="1098" /> another country; and that country were to export in return £100,000,000 worth of purely raw materials practically untouched by labour.  How are you going to balance those two accounts?  It is quite obvious that in adding these two things together, or in making any calculation from them, you are adding together things of an entirely different nature.  Therefore, the first and primal proposition which I think everybody in the House will accept is that, unless and until you analyse the nature, the labour content, and the other qualities of imported and exported goods, no calculation can be made on the basis of imports and exports.</P>
      <P>Take another case.  Say, for instance, you have 100,000 people in a country creating an export of, say, £10,000,000 worth of goods to another country, and obtaining from that country £10,000,000 worth of goods created by the labour of 100,000 people of the other country; I want you to add those two things together.  Those are things of the same nature, but of opposite sign.  In both cases the imports of one country are maintaining a population in another country.  Say, for instance, that you destroy that whole £20,000,000 worth of international trade in a night.  I want to ask yourself if that necessarily means that, by one penny piece, either country has lost.  Let us take, for instance, that we were exporting £10,000,000 worth of labour-saturated material to another country to maintain there 100,000 people, who might have been maintained in our country making the £10,000,000 worth of stuff that we imported. Assume for a moment that I have destroyed that import and that export; that instead of maintaining 100,000 people in a foreign country, to send me £10,000,000 worth of imports, I maintain those 100,000 people in my country to manufacture those materials in my country, I will have destroyed £20,000,000 worth of international trade, but I will have added 100,000 livelihoods to the possession of my own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those facts taken together will make wild generalisations on the subject of trade balances feel very awkward. Let me take another case.  Say you <Col N="1099" /> take the case of a country which had no exports whatever and yet had continuously a large import.  In practice, that country might be very wealthy. That occurs in small communities at present all over the world.  I do not think it does, in fact, occur in any country in the world as a whole.  There is no country in the world whose life is so specialised that it is possible for that sort of thing to occur.  But it will be within the recollection of this House that, hundreds of years ago, there were in the University of Armagh alone at least twice as many students as there are in all the Universities in Ireland at present.  There was a time when we were, to a very large extent, in so far as our cultural life was concerned, teachers as well as apostles.  You might, for a moment, imagine that that position would be exaggerated and that we became the teachers of the world; that all the fundamental and beautiful economics that I have heard from the opposite benches had attracted the attention of the statesmen of the world; that all the knowledge of agriculture which I have heard preached on the other side, had that appreciation in the world which it had in the minds of those who uttered it from the other benches; that an appreciation of all the knowledge in relation to industry, culture and everything else, which they are so satisfied they possess, had spread to all corners of the world, so that the seas would be black with argosies carrying tribute to this country to pay for the education of the children of all the world.  Under those conditions there need be no return cargoes for these argosies; there need be no export from this country; there need be no material production of any kind within the borders of this country. There could be an adverse trade balance of 100 per cent. lasting for 100 centuries, and the country would be running with milk and honey subscribed to it in the form of visible imports in return for the invisible exports of learning, knowledge and intelligence.</P>
    <P>Take the universities of Oxford and Cambridge; take particular sections of Dublin, like Trinity College and the National University; take any school <Col N="1100" /> or college in the country and that is exactly what is going on there&mdash;a continuous visible import, and nothing but an invisible export.  That being so, we find ourselves on even more uncertain ground, on ground on which certainly no one but people with a reckless mind like that of Deputy Dillon would venture in the spirit in which he entered on it.  If you want to know whether a country has improved or disimproved, you have got to take into account, not merely the whole of its visible imports and exports, not merely the whole of its invisible imports and exports, but you have got to take into account, and intimately analyse, the labour and other social value content of every single item of its imports and exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Proof of the recklessness of the statements which were made on this matter, and how far Deputies are prepared to go, is represented by the attempt of Deputy Dillon to come down to figures.  He said that in a period of five years, I think it was, the totality of our adverse trade balance was £76,000,000.  That £76,000,000 of an adverse trade balance must have come from somewhere.  He starts in to show that it has come out of the sterling holdings in the banks. Under the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, in three or four years the sterling holdings dropped by nearly £11,000,000, of which even Deputy Dillon knows £8,000,000 was what was called &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; or money that had come in here either for temporary refuge or to escape the economic blizzards that swept other countries. What is clear is that unless Deputy Dillon knew from outside sources that there was £8,000,000 of &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; in that £11,000,000, these figures would be completely misleading and would entirely misrepresent the policy and the accomplishments of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  We do happen to know that under this régime these holdings have dropped about £4,500,000 and the &ldquo;unfavourable&rdquo; trade balance is £76,000,000.  Where is the other £72,000,000, even assuming that this £4,500,000 is a correct figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you come to analyse the <Col N="1101" /> factories that have been built, the import of machinery, when you come to take into account the amount of money which has been withdrawn from outside securities no longer held by the banks and put into Irish industries, when you analyse the expenses which have been created in building up Irish industries of one kind or another, nobody but a person who had the most exact opportunities of laborious and painstaking examination over a long period, would be able to analyse the exact significance of any such figures.  But what is quite obvious is that anyone who says that an adverse trade balance of £76,000,000 in five years, represents anything approaching a loss of that amount, is simply talking through his hat.  In England, during 15 of its most prosperous years, its adverse trade balance &mdash;I think the figures were given by Deputy Dowdall&mdash;was £5,000,000,000. There again unless Deputies are prepared to come down to something more than a general statement that the adverse trade balance has increased or decreased, you are not in a position to make any deduction from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon went on to tell us some sad story about the Treasury balance.  To-day he found himself asking an inaccurate supplementary question when it was made quite clear to him that the Treasury balance, instead of decreasing, as he believed and as he hoped, had increased.  It is a pity that a great Party, which has behind it a record of 11 years of government, should now be reduced to the carrion crow position of looking for something dead to live on&mdash;looking for a bad harvest, looking for a bad trade return, looking for an increase in the unemployment register, looking for a fall in the Treasury balance, looking forward to the failure of the Minister for Finance who, according to them, will go to borrow money next year and will not get sixpence.  Surely something better than that can be expected from them&mdash;Jeremiads like &ldquo;industries leaning on one another and waiting to fall&rdquo;; &ldquo;incipient bankruptcy&rdquo;; &ldquo;a country broken in spirit and in finance.&rdquo;  Surely they can find <Col N="1102" /> some ground upon which to build the possibilities and the hopes of the future of their Party other than the destruction and the weakness of their own country.  My difficulty is that which we have had here on this debate &mdash;and as far as I know, we are going to have it again&mdash;Deputies getting up and making speeches in the air, making speeches which deliberately avoid the essence, the purpose and the principle of the motion.</P>
    <P>These debates could be enormously useful.  I am not going to pretend for one moment that all the wisdom, all the knowledge, all the patriotism, all the love of country, or all the specialised knowledge in relation to the industries and activities of this country, are on this bench, that bench, or any particular bench.  Members of this House should, upon this motion, have been able to take any particular industry or industries and tell us in relation to them those things which they believe are being supported by tariffs and impositions which should not be so supported.  No one in his senses is going to suggest that every one of the hundreds of industries and activities which a high tariff policy has brought into being, and has maintained, is equally valuable.  No one is going to pretend that abuses of one kind or another cannot have crept in, in particular instances.  It is, therefore, possible that there may be industries, the cost of maintenance of which by the State in the form of tariffs is altogether greater than the benefit which the State receives in the way of extra employment.  Those are things which should be within the particular knowledge and competence of individual members opposite.  If so, they can, by their valuable services, bring a lot nearer the day when there would be strict examination and investigation into these matters.  They could provide the machinery; they could provide the atmosphere; they could provide the public opinion that would render abuses&mdash;which, in my opinion, to some extent are inseparable from every large change of policy&mdash;nonexistent. If there are particular industries which are causing an undue increase in the cost of living; if there <Col N="1103" /> are industries which are, on net balance, reducing the capacity of the State to maintain them&mdash;and such a thing is perfectly conceivable&mdash;one single instance brought to the issue of proof by a man who knew what he was talking about in this House would do far more to clarify the system, to sanatise it, to make it strong and clean than a thousand general debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against this arrangement whereby the House is convened for a single day, and then, after Deputies have been put to the trouble of coming here and the State to the expense of bringing them here for the purpose of discussing Parliamentary business, the House calmly proceeds to adjourn for a week or a fortnight, as the case may be. We have been asked now by the Vice-President to consent to an arrangement by which the House, having met to-day at 3 o'clock, will adjourn to-night at 10.30 and meet a week hence.</P>
      <P>If that were an isolated instance one could understand that the exigencies of Parliamentary business probably necessitated it, but this apparently has been a studied arrangement for a long time past.  In order that the House may have an opportunity of judging where it is drifting, I have calculated the amount of Parliamentary time which has been occupied since the general election of July last.  The House met on 21st July for one day&mdash;in fact not even for a complete day&mdash;and then adjourned for 11 weeks until 6th October.  It met on 6th and 7th October and adjourned for a fortnight. It met on 20th October for one day, and adjourned for a week.  It met again on 27th October for one day, and adjourned for a fortnight.  It met on 10th November for one day, and adjourned for a week.  It met on 17th November, and now proposes to adjourn for another week.  When you calculate the total amount of Parliamentary time, you find that the Dáil has met on seven days out of 17 weeks, and apparently the Government cannot order their business in any better way than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were nothing to discuss one might understand an adjournment of that kind, but there are 11 motions on the Paper, all dealing with matters which are as important as many of the measures which have been introduced by the Government, and I submit, Sir, that, when the Government brings Deputies to the city for the purpose of discussing legislation, the House should be required to sit on its normal sitting days while there is business either of <Col N="1106" /> a public or a private character to be transacted.  Hundreds of thousands of citizens are affected by the private Members' motions which are on the Order Paper, and yet we are not to be allowed to have an opportunity to debate those motions even though there is another day and a-half available for Parliamentary discussion this week, as there was a day and a half available for Parliamentary discussion in other weeks.  Then again there is the matter of questions submitted by Members. We have had experience of questions held up here for three weeks, because the Dáil was not sitting and time was not available for answering those questions, so that while we have an abundance of Parliamentary time available on the one hand, we cannot get time to discuss Parliamentary business on the other hand.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Vice-President that that state of affairs is no credit to the Government.  It ought to be possible, with so many motions on the Agenda, for the Dáil to sit for the remainder of this week&mdash;and the remainder of every other week in which public business takes only one day&mdash;for the consideration of private Members' motions which are on the Order Paper.  The continuance of Parliamentary business on to-morrow and Friday would occasion no expense to the State.  No case whatever can be made for this wasteful procedure whereby the State brings Deputies together for the purpose of transacting business on only one day, when, in fact, three days are available for the purpose of transacting that business.  I submit that the present procedure is a burlesque on Parliamentary institutions.  I think the present arrangement is gross extravagance in the expenditure of public money, and I think some steps ought to be taken to arrange the business of the House in a much better and much more satisfactory manner than has been possible so far.</P>

If, five years ago, it was suggested to the present Vice-President that this House should sit for only seven days in 17 weeks, as Deputy Norton has pointed out, he would have pulled down the roof on us.  On one occasion he gave a very fine exhibition of what he could do when it was suggested that the House should adjourn for a fortnight.  There is, as Deputy Norton has pointed out, a considerable number of motions on this Order Paper.  I want to suggest to the House that it is because those motions are there that the Government does not want Parliament to sit.  The Government are afraid, frankly, of an exposure in this House of their policy and the effects of their policy.  The Government are a minority Government, and they are afraid of being tested on vital motions here in a division. Statements and pronouncements which should be made by Ministers in this House to the representatives of the people are made in halls under police guard in this city.</P>

      <P>We were threatened, and the country is threatened, by the Minister with a general election, and the Government are afraid so to arrange their business as to enable it to be discussed in the House by the people elected three months ago to discuss these matters.  Frankly, the position is that the Government are afraid of this Dáil; they are afraid to have decisions taken; they are afraid to have the position tested.  I take it that it is not going to be suggested, <Col N="1108" /> even by the Vice-President, that in the last three months the Government had not a sufficient opportunity so to arrange their business as to keep the House in session up to the Christmas adjournment.  Will the Vice-President now say that the Government have been unable so to arrange that business as to keep the House going? Will he say if there is any good reason why this Parliament should not meet to discuss and take decisions upon the various motions on the Order Paper?  It is the old trick of the present Government not to give time for discussion and decision upon motions put down in the names of private members.</P>
      <P>When the last Dáil was dissolved there were motions on the paper for nearly two years.  Private members, under the Standing Orders and by practice and procedure, are supposed to be given an opportunity to have motions brought before the House discussed and a decision taken upon them.  They are now being denied that right and the Government use various means to deprive private members of that time.  Sometimes, if it does not suit the convenience of the Government to have a division on a particular motion on a certain night, we are treated to long-distance speakers like Deputy Flinn, who is put up to talk nonsense for an hour and three-quarters.  On other occasions we have a different procedure, or perhaps we have both&mdash;Deputy Flinn and the one-day sitting at the same time.  I think Deputy Norton's protest is very necessary, and I think the Vice-President will find it difficult to satisfy the House and the country that the Government are taking parliamentary business seriously.</P>

      <P>I want to express the country Deputy's point of view on this matter.  We have been summoned here for one day each week.  To-day the Government business occupied only three hours.  Why can we not be summoned for three days in the one week and then be let home for a fortnight, and not be coming here once a week for a three-hour job?  It is all very well for Deputies living in and around Dublin, but most Deputies have to <Col N="1109" /> travel 80, 100 or 150 miles from the country districts and it is a farce to have to travel that distance to consider business that occupies only two or three hours and then go back again.  Deputy Norton has made reference to the extravagance of summoning the Dáil for only one day in the week.  I support that statement.  It is extravagance, gross extravagance, and it looks as if the Government were trying to throw dust in the eyes of the Dáil and of the people of the country. From the point of view of economy, there is no justification for being summoned for a three hour job.  Why can we not be given business to consider here on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday&mdash;there is enough business on the Order Paper in that respect&mdash;and then let us go home for two or three weeks?  We have something to attend to at home instead of fooling about Dublin and listening to a man like Deputy Flinn, the funny man of the Party.  We do not want to listen to the stage Irishman at all.  There is not a man in this country but objects to the stage Irishman.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Deputy Norton.  There was a time in this House when this Party occupied the Government Benches and the Deputies who are now on the Government Benches used to protest strongly, even against the adjournment for Christmas. That was the time when there were supposed to be 60,000 unemployed. To-day the number of unemployed is infinitely greater, and thousands are leaving this country every year and <Col N="1110" /> the people on the Government Benches are doing very little to help them.  We were accused at one time of being dictators.  What is this but dictatorship? To make things worse, these people are setting out to increase their own allowances and put a further burden on the people.</P>

      <P>It is not correct for Deputy Gorey to say that the Dáil has been summoned for one day.  The Dáil was not summoned for one day; the Dáil was summoned to do parliamentary business, such business as was put on the Order Paper.  To-day, to my mind, at any rate, there was a considerable amount of public business on the Order Paper that the Government asked the Dáil to deal with.  I would not have been a bit surprised if to-day's business went over well into to-morrow.  What applies to the business on the Order Paper for to-day applied, I think, with equal truth to the business put before the Dáil last Wednesday.  But the business was got through expeditiously, to my mind unusually so.  I would have thought a great deal more time would have been taken by the House to debate some of the important issues before the House to-day and last Wednesday.  It is not the Government's fault that the House dealt as expeditiously as it did with the important Government business that was down for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was important and it was put through expeditiously. There was just a little over an hour <Col N="1111" /> taken in the House to discuss a matter of that kind.  That is not the Government's fault.  The Government had a very considerable amount of business before the general election and the House was kept very fully occupied. Then there were constitutional measures that have had to be put through the various Government Departments and made law.  They had to be prepared before they were brought to the House.  These items alone are of the first importance and many of them have been before the House and have been dealt with expeditiously.  There is no fault to be laid at the Government's door.  I am not making any complaint on that score, not at all, but the House has dealt with these matters expeditiously, and it is all to the credit of the House. Deputy Morrissey has suggested that the Government is afraid of being tested.  I think that statement bears its own contradiction on its face.  On every measure that has been brought before the House here the Government is being tested.  That is the case in every Bill of every kind that is brought in here.  On every Bill it is open to the House here to challenge a division. Every time the Dáil meets a division can be challenged and the policy of the Government can be challenged. That is being done and can be done on every motion before the House. Consequently I fail to see any foundation for the statement that the Government is afraid of being tested.  The position is quite the contrary.  The Deputy referred to the remarks made by Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, last night.  I do not see what the Deputy has to object to in that.  He said that the Government is afraid of being tested.</P>

      <P>There has been no closure whatsoever on Government business.  The Dáil has been free to take any time it pleases in discussing business.  A considerable amount of business has been put before the House on the various occasions on which this House has met since the general election. It is to the credit of the Dáil and to everybody that that business has been got through expeditiously.  I fail to see that there is any merit in calling the Dáil together when there is no business for the Dáil.  Why should the Dáil continue sitting here when there is no business before it? It is without precedent that the Dáil should be called to sit upon days when there is no Government business.</P>

      <P>That raises the question of private Deputy's time. Now the fact is that last week and this week the private Deputies have got their full amount of time, the amount of time they would get in any ordinary week with the Dáil sitting three days. They have got as much time on those two days on which the Dáil sat this week and last week as they would have got had the Dáil met three days each week.  They got practically the full amount of time that would be given in a full week.  It is without precedent for the Dáil to meet on a day when there is no Government business.</P>

Private Deputies have not been given half that amount of time during the period.</P>

      <P>The quantities of dried beet pulp exported in the 1934-35 and 1935-36 seasons were 8,297 tons and 8,474 tons, respectively.  I am not aware of the estimated production for the current season, nor of the arrangements for its disposal between the home and export market.  I understand, however, that hitherto it was not found possible to have the whole of the output of beet pulp absorbed on the home market, and it became necessary to make advance contracts abroad for the sale of the approximate quantities estimated to be surplus to requirements. This year the demands by merchants at home have proved to be in excess of the amounts estimated, necessitating a reduction in the filling of home orders in order to enable contracts made abroad to be filled.</P>

From a scrutiny of the list of commodities as utilised for the monthly trade statistics, items have been selected which, according to their description, appear to be principally &ldquo;raw materials.&rdquo; The following are the approximate aggregate monthly or monthly average values of such imports for the periods indicated:&mdash;</P>

Fourteen proposals for minor employment schemes in the electoral divisions of Castletown and Dysart have been submitted in the past three years, and inspections have been made in every case with the exception of a proposal received on 16th October, 1937, which has not yet been dealt with.  An allocation of £95 has been made from the Vote for Employment Schemes, 1937-38, for the electoral division of Castletown. It was necessary to group the electoral division of Dysart with the two adjoining electoral divisions, Greenpark and Churchtown, for the purpose of finding a sufficient number of unemployment assistance recipients to form a gang, and an allocation of £100 has been made from the Vote for Employment Schemes, 1937-38, for this joint area.</P>

      <P>No complaints have been received in my Department of the nature indicated in the Deputy's question. Inspectors appointed under the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Acts, 1924 to 1930 have, as in previous years, carried out examinations of consignments of eggs in course of transit or at premises where eggs were sold or stored for sale.  Where any package so examined was found seriously to contravene the provisions of the Acts or the regulations made thereunder, the package was forfeited and disposed of <Col N="979" /> as required by Section 4 of the Act of 1924.  Although the number of consignments examined during the present year was not greater than in previous years and the standard of examination remained the same as formerly, the percentage of forfeitures was higher than for several years past, indicating the need for greater care in the marketing of eggs on the part of all concerned in the trade.</P>

      <P>The reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:&mdash; (a) 579 packages containing 1,794 great hundreds of eggs were forfeited under Section 4 of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1934, during the period from the 1st January, 1937, to the 31st October, 1937; (b) packages of eggs found on examination to warrant forfeiture are forwarded to the Central Egg Hut, North Wall, and are kept there for at least two days to enable the owners to inspect them if they so wish.  After the lapse of the time specified in the notice sent to the owners, all defective eggs are removed from the package and destroyed, the remaining eggs being repacked and graded with a view to their sale at the best price obtainable.  The amounts realised for such eggs are credited to the account of the Department of Agriculture; (c) the prices obtained for eggs sold as stated vary according to the time of the year and the grade of the eggs.  The total amount received for the 1,429 great hundreds of eggs sold during the present year was, approximately, £500, representing an average price of about 7/- per great hundred (120 eggs).</P>
