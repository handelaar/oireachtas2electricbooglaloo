      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been called to statements made to the effect that in the town of Nenagh on Saturday, May 8th, two families, one a man, his wife and seven children, the other a man, his wife and five children, found themselves at 9 p.m. destitute; that they were refused assistance by the relieving officer, but were given tickets for the county home 25 miles away; if he has made any investigations in the matter; were the facts in accordance with the statements; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of such a thing and to ensure that such cases are not left unprovided for.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the statements referred to by the Deputy.  I called for a report on the matter and I find  the statements do not accurately represent the facts, and that the persons applying for assistance were not genuine cases of destitution.  The facts are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The incident took place at Nenagh on the 1st May, not on the 8th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The Superintendent Assistance Officer was approached by a number of able-bodied men who were at the time employed by the county council on a temporary employment scheme. The men demanded home assistance on the plea of destitution.  In view of the fact that the men were working at the time and considering that they were given provisional <Col N="1646" /> assistance during the previous week while awaiting payment from the county council, the Superintendent Assistance Officer could not regard them as destitute persons and consequently he refused assistance, explaining to them that they should approach the county council who was employing them.</P>
    <P>3.  After consultation amongst themselves, in the course of which one of the men remarked &ldquo;we will torment him anyway,&rdquo; the men demanded tickets for admission to the county home.  This, the Superintendent Assistance Officer also refused for the same reason.  Later in the day the wives of two of the men approached the local assistance officer and asked for tickets for admission to the county home. The assistance officer did not consider the applicants destitute, but he issued the tickets applied for as he considered he should do so when the applicants themselves alleged destitution.  Neither of the women asked to be conveyed to the county home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the report he has read out is not an accurate report? Is he further aware that these men were employed by the county council and had received up to that time, May 1, no payment whatever and were destitute?  They were from 12.30 that day until 8.30 or 9 p.m. seeking assistance from the assistance officer and it was refused, but finally, not at their request, he wrote out tickets for the county home in order to get rid of them.  I have the tickets here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will find when he has sifted the matter, if he does sift it, after an impartial inquiry that my statement is strictly in accordance with facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible that the Parliamentary Secretary has not investigated the facts?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say how it happened that men who were destitute, and who got provisional relief from the assistance <Col N="1647" /> officer one week, and in the meantime received no payment of any kind, can be regarded as not being destitute the following week, and therefore do not get provisional relief from the assistance officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason that payments by the county council are fortnightly payments.  The home assistance the applicants got was in respect of the first week of their employment, when no payment was made by the county council.  The incident referred to in the question occurred on the night that they had been paid for the fortnight's employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not deny that the men had received no payment of any kind, and that there was no prospect of getting payment of any kind the second week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so at all. They had received no payment at the end of the first week, and got provisional home assistance.  At the end of the second week, when home assistance had been refused, they had received payment for the fortnight's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is untrue.  The answer of the Parliamentary Secretary is so unsatisfactory that I give notice that I will raise this matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received a memorial from the parish priest and other important residents of Courceys (Ballinspittal) drawing attention to the serious havoc caused by erosion on the foreshore at the White Strand (Old Head) and referring to orders made after an inquiry held in 1933 into the matter; and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to give effect to the wishes of the signatories to the memorial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the memorial referred to.  So far as erosion at the White Strand, Old Head of Kinsale, is <Col N="1648" /> due to the removal of beach material, there is in existence a prohibitory order, dated 8th April, 1933, the enforcement of which is a matter for the local authority.  So far as erosion is due to natural causes, I would refer the Deputy to the answer given to a question put by Deputy Corish on the 5th May, 1937, in which I indicated that I had no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the number of acres of land in Saorstát Eireann planted with trees during the year 1936, and how many thereof are situate in the County of Mayo, and also the amount of money spent during the said year in wages in connection with afforestation (a) in the whole of Saorstát Eireann and (b) in the County Mayo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter of difficulty to state the actual planting done in a calendar year, as the planting season overlaps such a year.  Returns are therefore given for planting year 1935-36 (ending in May, 1936).  In that year the total area planted in An Saorstát was 6,919 acres, and in County Mayo was 66¾ acres.  The amount paid in wages to forestry workers in An Saorstát was £68,549, and in County Mayo was £772. These figures include foremen's wages. The figures given refer, of course, to State afforestation only.  The forestry division has no definite information as to the extent of private planting which may have been done in these years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start off by saying that I recognise the difficulty of any satisfactory formulation of a law of this kind dealing with the expression of public opinion and with the Press?  I am but too familiar with the difficulty, especially of discussing it from the point of view of abstract principles.  I can lay down a number of abstract principles &mdash; liberty, on the one hand, and the necessity of curbing liberty, so as to prevent it getting into licence, on the other hand.  But, I suggest that we get nowhere if we keep to a mere enunciation of abstract principles of that kind.  Bearing in mind what the concrete consequences are likely to be of the passing of an Article of this kind, the question is of supreme importance.  It is quite clear, or should be quite clear, to anybody who even pretends to have a reverence for democratic institutions, especially Parliamentary institutions, that it becomes nothing more than a farce if there is undue interference or, perhaps, any interference with full political criticism.  As this Article is drafted, it leaves the road wide open&mdash;even if the Article is amended on the lines indicated by the President, it still leaves the door open &mdash;to grave abuses and interference with the liberty of the Press.  I am speaking now of the legitimate and just liberty of the Press, without the free exercise of which&mdash;so that the Press can exercise it without being in constant fear of being suppressed or held up &mdash; there is danger to democracy itself. It may be said that there is also a danger on the other side of too great licence.  That is so.  But, looking at the thing from a purely practical point of view, as I am now doing, it is a balance of evils.  It seems to me that, taking modern developments into account we have the gravest grounds for fear as to what may follow, not merely for democracy, but for public morality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> The giving of great power into the hands of the Executive of the State in this manner has led in too many countries to very grave consequences. In some countries in Europe and in some places that I know fairly well the Press has been muzzled; and on the plea of properly educating the public and promoting a proper sense of duty to the State, a proper reverence for State institutions and a proper regard for morality, the freedom of the Press has been taken away.  One of the most thorough instances that came within my notice is based precisely on the pleas that I see mentioned here in this Article 40.  I know a country in Europe where there are any number of newspapers. I suppose the number would run into thousands.  Yet a traveller in that country can buy one newspaper after another; the name will be different but the news and the point of view is always the same&mdash;it is really one newspaper.  Under these conditions democracy cannot exist.  But there is something even more serious than the destruction of democracy.  Such control is being used to drive into the citizens a new system of morality.  Therefore if we look at it not merely from the point of view of politics and public order and property but from the point of view of ordinary morality, from the values we consider dear we find that in modern times there is a tendency on the part of Governments so to limit the expression of opinions as to force not merely their political but their moral views on the people.  And all that is being done on the plea of the furtherance of public morality.</P>
    <P>I might refer to an authority to which I think the President ought pay some respect in connection with the difficulty of using a phrase in a legal document like &ldquo;public morality.&rdquo; This is the opinion to which I wish to refer &mdash;&ldquo;The question of public morality is so wide and you can get so many interpretations of its meaning that it could be abused.&rdquo;  The President must know that.  That is the opinion of one who was then a fairly obscure Deputy of this House, Eamon de Valera, speaking not from the exalted position from which he now views the truth but from the <Col N="1653" /> humbler benches here.  In giving that opinion he expressed his objection to that particular phrase being used in legislation on the grounds of its vagueness and on the grounds that it could be interpreted in so many different ways and would be so interpreted by the Government to suit themselves.  On that particular occasion, on the Censorship Bill, he was very scathing about passing such legislation. The words &ldquo;public morality&rdquo; he pointed out, were too vague.  They would leave the door open to too many abuses even in that context, though the context of the Bill would have helped to limit it to sex.  Still he was anxious about the possibility of its being abused even though the context would have limited it to sex.  Now in these surroundings in Article 40 it can mean anything; it can mean giving into the hands of the Government power to suppress liberty of speech and the expression of opinion in this country.</P>
    <P>It is quite true the President has expressed his willingness to accept the amendment on the Order Paper.  If any one will examine the Article as it will be in its proposed amended form he will see that we are not brought much further because though criticism of the Government may be allowed to pass, very easily proceedings may be taken against newspapers not for criticising the Government but for undermining the authority of the State.  It requires no great effort of the imagination to see this happening.  That is especially so where you have a man in power who regards his word as being sacrosanct, and himself as being alone in the possession of truth.  Certainly in some cases you have egomaniacs and you have megalomaniacs in power who think they are the sole repositories of truth and that the power they arrogate to themselves is used and will always be used for the advantage of the people.  A similar thing may happen here; it is not beyond the bounds of possibility and even though we do not get that development in all its fullness we did get an example last night of the attitude that would be taken up by the present Government, a Government that thinks it is perfectly <Col N="1654" /> entitled to take the powers that it has in view, powers which it would not have allowed to any other Government. That is a situation, which if it is adopted towards freedom of opinion, can easily kill freedom of opinion.  And whereas people may profess a full desire not to prevent legitimate criticism of the Government, there are many Governments and heads of Governments now so constituted that they regard any criticism of their own views as criticism of fundamental truth, criticism of something that cannot be questioned.  That is undoubtedly a serious danger.  I can well foresee a situation in which newspapers giving their own views and their own criticisms or reporting the views of speakers might come under the force of that law, because forsooth they were misrepresenting the established authorities in the State and because they were misrepresenting men in high positions.  That kind of thing can so easily be translated into undermining the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>That is what we are dealing with now.  It could be represented that they were undermining the authority of the State not by force of arms but undermining it by the written word. If that view be taken, there is hardly a newspaper in Ireland that could not be open to that charge of misrepresenting the high authorities in this State and so helping to undermine State institutions.  There is hardly a newspaper in Ireland that could interpret what some of our Statesmen mean.  The provision in this Section 6 is a terrific power to give into the hands of any Government or into the hands of any Dáil under the control of a Government.  I say that because in certain circumstances I am rather inclined to put it that the Dáil is under the control of a Government rather than that the Government is under the control of the Dáil.  I do not know why we do not leave things as they were as far as that is concerned or why if we did touch on the matter we did not feel it necessary to go further so as to define exactly what we want.</P>
    <P>I see the Government undertaking the task of educating the public or <Col N="1655" /> being told to do so.  Again that is the claim made by certain States on the Continent &mdash; that it is their business to educate public opinion.  They have done it and done it thoroughly.  But they have done it at the expense of freedom, at the expense of democracy and, as I hold very strongly, at the expense of morality.  There may be certain danger in the licence enjoyed by the Press, but I argue earnestly that what we are doing now is a bigger danger.  It is a bigger danger to give wide control and general powers into the hands of a Government that can introduce any law it likes into the Dáil and get it passed. We thus take away constitutional safeguards &mdash; and are wrong in doing so. Before attempting to take away these constitutional safeguards, there should, as far as possible, be exactness of definition and there should be a limitation of the powers claimed under an Article of this kind.  There should be no sparing of trouble in striving to do that.  Let the Government bring in all it wants to bring in, but do not give them general, vague and immense powers of this kind that in the circumstances, are bound inevitably to lead to abuse.  I am sorry that exactly the same type of instruments are referred to here as are used by Continental States in that process of public education to which I have referred, namely, the radio, the Press and the cinema.</P>
    <P>One of the things that appals me when I look at certain countries in Europe is the power that certain States have got, not only over the bodies of men, but over the souls and the minds of men as a result of what modern inventions, in the shape of increased transport, greater Press facilities, the wireless and the cinema have placed in the hands of Governments. I should say that 30 years ago, to say nothing of a couple of hundred years ago, these things would be unthought of, unthinkable.  To-day we have a complete despotism, a complete autocracy over the minds as well as the bodies of men.  That is a tremendous evil, and it is so appalling that, though I recognise some at least of the motives that may furnish the <Col N="1656" /> excuse for putting in this particular paragraph, I think the dangers are so great at the present moment that it ought to be withdrawn and something much more carefully drafted and much more definitely limited be put in its place&mdash;if it is thought necessary to put in something.</P>
    <P>I must take this as a legal enactment, meant to have force.  It is sometimes difficult to take a lot in this Constitution seriously, but I take it for granted that the provisions are meant to have a definite, binding, limited force on the one hand, and to act as pointers on the other hand. When I consider the conditions to which interference with expression of opinion has brought certain countries in Europe, I cannot but regard with considerable dismay the force that this particular Article may have.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of abstract principles. I know, possibly as well as most people in this House, the extreme difficulty of dealing with this particular problem, and especially if a person tries to discuss it from the point of view of sound, abstract principles. I know the extreme difficulty of doing it and, therefore, I want to attack the question from the point of view of the concrete evils that may follow from this particular Article.  There is a great deal to be said for the view expressed by Deputy de Valera in 1928, when he objected to a phrase, a particular term, on the ground that its vagueness might lead to abuse.  You are asking in this particular case for such abuse.  I ask the House at least to pause before we pass an Article of this nature.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that it is very difficult to discuss this Article in the abstract; that we ought, in considering its merits or demerits, to relate it to the concrete facts of our everyday existence, as we know them.  The attitude which the Opposition have taken up in criticism of this Article assumes that the proposals which it contains and the measures which it proposes to take in order to safeguard public order, morality and the authority of the <Col N="1657" /> State, are entirely new and novel. One would think that this was the first time the Dáil had considered the advisability of endeavouring to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press and the cinema, should not be used to undermine public order or morality.</P>
      <P>It has been put to us from the Opposition Benches that it is an objectionable thing, from the aspect of the liberty of the citizen, that the Legislature should take steps to that end. So objectionable, in fact, have the Opposition found it, that they have put down an amendment, to the terms of which I shall more specifically refer in a moment or two, to delete the whole Article without any qualification whatever.  Is the cinema an instrument by which citizens express freely their convictions and opinions? The first question that arises to my mind is that one.  Is the cinema an organ of public opinion in the sense in which that phrase is popularly understood?  I think that, as a matter of fact, very few citizens express their convictions and opinions through the cinematograph.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if they do, what has been the attitude of our predecessors in regard to this so-called organ of public opinion?  Before we came into the Dáil at all, when they were unchallenged masters of the situation here, what was the attitude of those people who object to muzzling even the cinema, the film producers, the Hollywood magnates, in their expression of convictions and opinions? When we propose in this Constitution to ensure that, so far as we can, a measure to limit the sometimes detrimental effect of these film productions upon public morality will not be declared to be unconstitutional; when we, in order to ensure that no constitutional questions will arise, definitely give the State power in the Constitution to take what steps to that desirable end it may see fit, with the support and acquiescence and assent of the <Col N="1658" /> majority of the representatives of public opinion in this country, the Opposition come along and hold up their hands in horror and declare it is an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject.  The Opposition which did that is the Opposition which passed the Censorship Act, under which no film may be exhibited in this State until it has first been viewed by an officer of the Government of the day and has been certified by him as being fit for public exhibition.</P>
      <P>Again, in regard to the radio, how many citizens can use the radio as an instrument for expressing freely their convictions and opinions?  I should say that the citizens in general, irrespective of political Party, have had freer access to the radio since this Government came into power than they had in the time of our predecessors, because it is only since we came in that representatives of the different Parties were able to avail of the radio to express their particular point of view.</P>

      <P>The Opposition now criticise us because we think an instrument such as the radio, which is an instrument of very great potency and which is capable of being abused, should be controlled in such a way as to safeguard public order, morality and the authority of the State.  The Opposition are horrified because we take only this precaution: That we so draft the Constitution that, if, at any time, the majority of the people's representatives, that is, the majority of the people, feel that steps should be taken &mdash; let me emphasise again &mdash; to safeguard public order, morality and the authority of the State, no constitutional crisis can arise if a measure to secure that admittedly desirable end should be brought in.</P>
      <P>Again, we come to the question of the Press and, once again, the Article is drafted, as I said, to ensure that no constitutional crisis would be created if, once more, it were to become necessary in the interests of public order, morality and the authority of the State to prevent &mdash; and Deputy O'Sullivan admitted that there was a danger &mdash; the danger of liberty degenerating into licence.  I am glad Deputy Mulcahy is in the House because we cannot, admittedly, discuss this very difficult matter in the abstract.  We have to relate it to certain concrete instances and cases.  I have here a quotation from a newspaper which appeared on Saturday, December 20th, 1919.  It is headed: &ldquo;A Deplorable Outrage&rdquo; and it goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Not since May, 1882, has any occurrence so sensational as the attempted assassination yesterday of the Lord Lieutenant in broad daylight taken place in Dublin.  That <Col N="1660" /> that dreadful plan of assassination was carefully and methodically contrived is evident from the procedure adopted by the would-be assassins. The fire of the attacking party was returned by the military escort and one of the assailants was shot dead. Deliberate murder of any person is wrong, criminal and absolutely reprehensible and reflects discredit on the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be left to the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It proceeds:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If with malice aforethought an attempt is made to take the life of one occupying the high position of Viceroy, the crime may have regrettable consequences here in Ireland and effects outside prejudicial to our reputation.  As one of the attacking party was killed and as the authorities are probably in possession of clues, which may lead to further developments, we shall not enlarge further upon the topic beyond saying that it is fortunate that the awful transaction was not attended with more tragic results.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quotation is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial published on Saturday, December 20th, 1919.  There is a statement published in the Press of this country which raises this issue in concrete form.  Some of us may say that, notwithstanding the dastardly terms, in my view, of that editorial, notwithstanding the fact that those who were engaged in that operation were dubbed would-be assassins and, by implication, described as murderers, there may be a substantial section in this Dáil who would say that the freedom of the Press is above every other consideration and that a newspaper like the <i>Irish Independent</i>, claiming to be an organ of public opinion, should be at liberty to publish a statement like that, if it so desired.  That, I say, might quite reasonably and quite understandably be the view of a substantial section of the population, but, Sir, was it the view of, say, Deputy Mulcahy? Was it the view of those who are associated with him now on the Opposition Benches, and who were associated then <Col N="1661" /> with us and other members of the Republican Government in 1919? Deputy Mulcahy was Chief of Staff. Did he consider that the <i>Irish Independent</i> should be at liberty to publish an article like that which, in his view, undermined the authority of the State?</P>
    <P>Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan has told us that we cannot discuss these matters in the abstract, and I agree with him.  I am bringing Deputy Mulcahy and those associated with him &mdash;Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald, who was in charge of the propaganda department; Deputy Cosgrave, who was then Minister for Local Government and Public Health; Deputy Fionan Lynch; Deputy Gearoid O'Sullivan, who was then on the Army Council &mdash; down now to a concrete instance.  Did they, on December 20th, 1919, think that, notwithstanding that the <i>Irish Independent</i> published an editorial which in their view would undermine the authority of the State, that organ of public opinion, that newspaper, should be permitted to publish articles in such terms as those which I have retailed to the House?  I am asking Deputy Mulcahy to answer that question for me.  Possibly it is not necessary for the Deputy to express himself vocally on the matter, because we all know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has done so already, precisely.  He expressed himself very actively indeed, for on the very day that article appeared, men armed with the mandate and authority of the Irish Republic went into the printing offices of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and, since they could not enforce a ban in any other way, with sledgehammers smashed up the printing presses.  That shows there is no use in talking about this thing in abstract terms.</P>
      <P>Again, may I refer the House to another article which was once published in this country.  I ask Deputies who want to come to a decision on this issue to think over it, not in terms of abstract principles but in terms of concrete facts.  Listen to this article which appeared on May 10th, 1916, and is headed &ldquo;A Clemency Plea&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that it would be quite impossible to envisage the purpose which this Article is intended to serve if we talked about things in the abstract. We want to arrive at some agreement amongst ourselves as to what is the rightful liberty which organs of public opinion are entitled to enjoy and as to when that liberty degenerates into licence.  I have put one instance before the House where, if the borderline was not crossed, the <i>Independent</i> was guilty of grave editorial licence.  I proposed to quote another article from the same newspaper which professed to voice public opinion.  As all of us know and as our history since 1916 quite clearly indicates, public opinion was not as it was then represented to be by the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  You, Sir, have <Col N="1665" /> ruled that I am not entitled to do that. I must accept your ruling.  But these things are not forgotten.  Those who talk about the liberty of the Press know that these things are on record and that a newspaper controlled by one wealthy syndicate, by one wealthy family, had the audacity at that time to demand the execution of the men who signed the Proclamation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I again point out that we are discussing the liberty of the Press and that we have a Minister dealing with an Article in the Constitution referring to that matter.  Even though it be painful, anything that reflects the minds of Ministers to-day is of great value to this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is possibly much more useful and advantageous than the reflection of the minds of Ministers of to-day is the reflection of the minds of Ministers of yesterday. There was a manifestation of that Ministerial point of view on the 20th December, 1919, and there has been a much more recent one in Article 2A of the Constitution.  The then Government took power under that Article to prohibit the publication of any letterpress whatsoever, if they saw fit to do so.  That is the point to which I was leading up.  I had endeavoured to show that, so far as the concrete facts are concerned, our predecessors established a censorship of the cinema. They established a monopoly of the radio, and they also established a censorship of literature.  One would think, listening to Deputy O'Sullivan that the permission which is given in this Article to deal with certain abuses of the rights of the citizen is something that is strange and novel, while, in fact, as I have said, we have a censorship of the cinema, a monopoly of the radio and a censorship of literature, <Col N="1666" /> all established by the people who come along here and say that their gorge rises at this Article and that they are so outraged by it that they put down an amendment to delete it almost lock, stock and barrel from the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Now, there ought to be some principle even in the Opposition.  They themselves have not been slow to apply a censorship here because they found that such a censorship was necessary in order to prevent public order and public morality from being undermined. But now, simply in order to endeavour by a few catch-cries to mislead unthinking, impractical people who have never been entrusted with the responsibility of government; who never sought the responsibility of government and are not likely to seek it, who have never been in the position of having to answer to the people for the preservation of public order and morality &mdash; they come along here and take up a doctrinaire attitude in regard to these three institutions, the Press, the cinema and the radio.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not wish to go into this in too great detail, but all of us know that the whole character of the Press has changed within the last generation or two.  I heard, I think, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan quoting from a pamphlet written about the year 1640 or so.  He did not tell us, and it would have been very interesting to hear so strong a Catholic as Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan tell us, the history of that pamphlet: tell us how it came to be written, and say whether he approved of the circumstances and opinions which it was designed to uphold and propagate.  It would be much more to the point if the Opposition spoke what was in their hearts and did not try to use this present position to create unwarranted and unjustifiable prejudice against the terms of this Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go a little further.  We heard a great deal to-day from Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan about the way in which he was appalled by the use which was being made in other countries of certain governmental powers.  We all know what he had in mind: the powers which were being exercised in certain <Col N="1667" /> dictatorial totalitarian States, but the Deputy, who is so appalled at what is being done inside these States, is one of a Party which has been clamouring that we should associate ourselves with those States in certain activities. These States are devils inside their own House, apparently, and they are soldiers of the Almighty outside, according to Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary that the public should consider the terms of this Article.  Part of Section 6 of Article 40 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>And then:</P>
    <P>The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>One would think, having listened to the pietistic speech of Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, that at least the House would be in agreement in regard to the last paragraph of this sub-section, which provides that &ldquo;the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.&rdquo;  One would think that there would not be any room for a difference of opinion between the Opposition and the Government in regard to that, but there is, Sir. Deputy Dillon, who a few weeks ago was talking about the anti-God campaign in Russia and other places, and some of the other latter-day saints of the Opposition, have sat down and have considered this Article in the Constitution, and they have instructed two of their most eminent front benchers, Deputy John A. Costello and Deputy Patrick McGilligan, to put down an amendment which proposes not merely to delete this reservation <Col N="1668" /> in regard to the radio, the Press and the cinema, but to go much further and propose to delete from the Constitution altogether the provision that &ldquo;the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law&rdquo; That, Sir, is one of the provisions of the amendment which we are debating. They have apparently strong convictions in regard to this matter, because, while they propose to delete the provision which makes the publication or utterance of blasphemous or indecent matter an offence, at the same time they propose to retain in the Consituation this provision, that:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality:</P>
    <P>(i) The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>Yes, Sir, that is precisely what the Opposition in theory want: they want everybody to be at liberty to talk, at least they do that to-day on the 3rd June, 1937.  Every citizen must have the right to express freely his convictions and opinions, and they want to delete from the Constitution the provision that if he publishes or utters blasphemous or indecent matter it will be an offence punishable in accordance with law.  In their endeavour to create unwarranted and unfounded prejudice against this Article in the Constitution, that is the length to which the Opposition is prepared to go.</P>
    <P>Of course, as we all know, just a few weeks ago we had the Opposition organ and a number of the Opposition speakers here telling us that, if persons expressed certain economic theories&mdash;theories which, as everybody knows, I, personally, think are ill-founded, impracticable and, above everything else, inconsistent with liberty of conscience and liberty of the soul&mdash;the Opposition, which to-day is prepared to allow a person liberty to publish or utter blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter, <Col N="1669" /> wanted to have these people silenced and wanted to have them driven from our platforms and our streets and, in fact, from our shores.  According to the Opposition, a few weeks ago, these people were to be exiled and outlawed if, by any chance, they talked Communism.  But apparently the Opposition does not think now, if we are to judge by the terms of the amendment they have put down to-day, that the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence that should be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan said, in effect, that it was all very well, but that he agreed that there was grave danger in formulating the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  He admitted quite frankly that it was a balance of evils as to whether you should inscribe that right in the Constitution or whether you should refuse to write it into the Constitution; or whether, if you inscribed it in the Constitution, you ought not to hedge it around with all possible safeguards and reservations.  He said that, from his point of view, it was a balance of evils; and he particularly said, with regard to the attitude he was taking up, that he had been coerced into taking it from the point of view as to what might happen to public morality.  He said, in effect, that if you are bringing in reservations, you should bring in all you want to bring in.  One might think that he was expressing the official Opposition attitude with regard to this Article in suggesting the bringing in of all the safeguards which would prevent these liberties from being abused, and which would prevent these liberties from degenerating into mere licence.</P>
    <P>But that is not the attitude of the Opposition.  Instead of trying to bring in these safeguards, which Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan admitted were necessary, they propose to remove them &mdash;to remove them all, and to remove even the one which, as I have said, ought to be accepted by all sides of the House, and that is the safeguard that would make the publication or <Col N="1670" /> utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law. I think, Sir, that the attitude the Opposition have taken up against this and other Articles in the Draft Constitution is not based upon principle, but is simply an attempt to use this discussion to make what propaganda they can, to distort and to misrepresent the true content of the Articles of this Constitution, and to deceive the general public as to their true intent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike intensely this section of this Article, as it is phrased, Sir; but I dislike it more so after listening to the irrelevant and, in many respects, irresponsible speech which has been made in support of it by the Minister for Finance.  The President yesterday told us that it was necessary, having set down a laudable principle, to ensure that it was conditioned by such reservations as would ensure that the desirable principle would be exercised in a rightful and proper manner.  In my opinion, however, while the President is purporting to confer rights on citizens under this Article, the President, in fact, is limiting rights which citizens actually have to-day in matters which are dealt with by this particular Article.  I do not think there would be any great public objection, or any great legislative objection, to a declaration of the principle that the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of rights, subject to public order and public morality, so long as we are clear as to the scope of what public order and public morality really mean; but the President is not satisfied with these two widespread reservations.  He goes on in the Article to declare that &ldquo;the education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, my amendment to this section is not as sweeping as the amendment which has been submitted by Deputies <Col N="1671" /> Costello and McGilligan.  My reason for submitting an amendment less in scope than that submitted by those Deputies is that I am not so very much concerned with the exercise of a certain censorship over radio, and am not very much concerned with the exercise of a certain censorship over Anglicised or &ldquo;Los-Anglicised&rdquo; films that come in here; but I am very genuinely concerned with proposals contained in this Constitution to give a Government power to exercise the most rigid kind of censorship over the organs of public opinion.  The terms of this particular Article make it clear, to me at all events, that the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;the authority of the State,&rdquo; is for the purpose of enabling a Government to exercise the most ruthless type of censorship over any organ of public opinion that holds views with which the Government may disagree.  We may have our own particular views of the policies pursued by particular organs of the Press.  We may dislike the tone of their leading articles and the general trend of the political policy as manifested in those leading articles.  We may dislike, and disagree intensely with, the viewpoints of their special correspondents and the viewpoints of their political correspondents. We may dislike, generally, the line taken by particular newspapers. But when we have said all that, it seems to me to be highly dangerous for the Legislature to give to a Government power to exercise a ruthless and unrestricted censorship over the views expressed by these newspapers.</P>
    <P>Newspapers fulfil a very important and a very useful function in the life of the modern nation.  It is true that many of them wield an enormous power.  It is true that the gigantic newspaper syndicate manufactures public opinion, and often manufactures public opinion in a way desired by the financial interests that control the newspaper syndicate; but I do not think it is a remedy for whatever evil may be contained in that fact to give an Executive Council power to exercise a ruthless censorship over these newspapers because, in practice, we may find that that censorship will be exercised in such a way as to give liberty <Col N="1672" /> and licence and freedom for the wildest and most violent forms of expression to newspapers which support the Government point of view, while throttling and muzzling every expression of opinion by a newspaper opposed to the Government's point of view.</P>
    <P>My objection to this particular Article, in the main, is because of the phrase &ldquo;the authority of the State&rdquo;. It seems to me that the structure of the Article, with that phrase in it, has a ring which is familiar to people in many of the totalitarian States in Europe &mdash;&ldquo;the authority of the State,&rdquo;&ldquo;an attempt to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo;.  An attempt to undermine the authority of the State may be, in many respects, an effort which ought to be checked by an Executive Council, but the grave danger always has been that, armed with the power of the kind inserted in this Article, an Executive Council may use that power to suppress newspapers which are not favourable to the Government point of view.</P>
    <P>We have seen, in relatively recent years, the suppression of Parliamentary institutions, the suppression of Parliamentary Oppositions, the suppression of movements which stood for freedom of thought, for freedom of conscience, for freedom of religious expression in many countries in Europe and in all these countries where Parliamentary Government has been suppressed, where democracy has been stifled, where democratic institutions have been ruthlessly exterminated, there is provision to-day for utilising the power of the Government to prevent the undermining of the authority of the State.  Undermining the authority of the State in many cases in Europe means undermining the support of the Party in power.  My fear about this Article is that, armed with a provision such as is contained within it, the Executive Council may utilise that provision in such a way as to ensure that it can wield it against such organs of public opinion as dislike the Government's policy and are a menace to the Government's continuance in office. There is, in my opinion, a real Nazi ring about this particular section of <Col N="1673" /> the Article.  It is the kind of ring we are familiar with in Germany and Italy. It is the kind of power and authority that European dictators have been clamouring for in recent years, and it is the kind of power that has been used ruthlessly to suppress the democracies of Europe.  I am opposed to it, because I do not want to see it used in this country in the same unscrupulous manner as it has been used in other countries.</P>
    <P>Nothing that the President or the Minister for Finance has said has in any way lessened my misgivings in connection with the Article.  The President said last night that he was prepared to accept an amendment from Deputy MacDermot.  I think the acceptance of that amendment does not remove the evil which is contained within this Article, because even if the phrase suggested by Deputy MacDermot is inserted we are still up against the phrase &ldquo;authority of the State&rdquo;. Even if the Article were amended in the manner desired by Deputy MacDermot, it would still be possible for the Legislature to pass by a single vote a law giving to the Executive of the day power to control every organ of public opinion.  The law which would be passed might give the Executive power to proscribe the continuance in existence of any newspaper which, in the opinion of the Government of the day, was propagating a policy calculated to undermine the authority of the State.  Deputy MacDermot may feel that if the Article were amended on the lines suggested by him, there would be some safeguard in this particularly anaemic phrase of his, but once the Government were in a position to declare that such criticism of the State was undermining the authority of the State, the Press would have very little safeguard in the harmless phrase Deputy MacDermot suggested.</P>
    <P>This is the year 1937.  We have managed to carry on so far from 1922 without arming the Executive with a constitutional provision of this kind. We have managed so far to carry on our national and communal life without finding it necessary to incite the Executive Council to seek powers which they are automatically invited to seek in this particular section.  It <Col N="1674" /> does not seem to me that any case whatever has been made by the President or the Minister for Finance for giving any Government the power to utilise a right of censorship over organs of the Press merely because, in the opinion of the Government, they are undermining the authority of the State.  I dislike the phrasing of this Article intensely.  I think that while purporting to confer liberty on citizens and upon organs of public opinion it is, in fact, contracting the liberty and the freedom of expression which they have to-day.  No case whatever has been made for putting this provision into this Constitution.  No case whatever has been made by the President or by the Minister for Finance for the conferring of authority on the Executive Council to exercise powers such as are contained in this Article.  If the Article is passed in this form the President will have powers, in respect to newspapers, comparable to those possessed by any dictator in Europe. He will have got powers that all the dictators of Europe have been able to get over newspapers in their countries. We may reach a time when we may see a Government, a supposedly democratic Government, with the aid of a single vote in this House, use these powers to ensure that no organ of public opinion will be allowed to express its views unless it is prepared to open its columns day by day to pour admiration on the President of whatever Government may be functioning and on the deeds and misdeeds of the Party in power.  I said that I disliked this Article intensely.  I think the President would be well advised, if he still desires the maintenance here of a truly democratic Government, to amend the Article so as not to make it possible for any Government in the future, while paying lip service to the authority of the State, to use the powers conferred by this Constitution for the purpose of throttling organs of public opinion within the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one difference of outlook between Deputy Norton and myself.  That is, that he attaches much more value to a written Constitution than I do.  After all, Great Britain enjoys, at any rate, as large a measure of liberty of the Press as any <Col N="1675" /> country in the world and yet there is no body of constitutional precepts, such as we are providing here, to secure that position.  Freedom of the Press is secured in Great Britain and in other countries like Great Britain by the fact that the spirit of the people is against passing a law to muzzle the Press, and if the spirit of the people in Ireland should some day degenerate to such an extent that we wanted to muzzle the Press, that we did not wish to have free speech in this country or free expression of opinion, we would do that in spite of this Constitution or a dozen Constitutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three-quarters of the argument which has proceeded, not only on this particular section, but on many sections of the Constitution, has been on the basis that we have got somehow or other to make it impossible for crimes to be committed against the people by a future Legislature.  We simply cannot do it.  I am content so long as the Constitution does not contain principles which are false and mischievous.  A month, six weeks, or two months ago, the Deputy might possibly have noticed that I was heavily involved in a controversy about freedom of speech and freedom of the Press.  I was abused like a pickpocket by a large number of excited citizens in the columns of the <i>Irish Independent,</i>  the <i>Irish Catholic</i> and, I think, elsewhere, because of what was alleged to be my pagan and heretical outlook, in saying that people should be allowed to express their opinions, no matter how much we differ from them, so long as they were not being guilty of sedition or of blasphemy. Now, I hold strongly to that point of view.  As a matter of fact, the reason that I made those speeches which excited a certain number of citizens so much was because I knew this Constitution was coming, and I was terrified lest pressure from some of the people connected with the Christian Front &mdash; who were passing resolutions demanding the suppression of Communism not only in public but in private, passing resolutions calling on the Government to make it a crime for a man to express Communistic <Col N="1676" /> opinions in his own home&mdash;might lead to the incorporation in the new Constitution of provisions fatal to liberty. I must say that when the Constitution appeared and I read it, that was the very first thing I looked to see, and I breathed a sigh of relief, because I came to the conclusion that the President or whoever had drafted the Constitution had shown himself a good Liberal.</P>
    <P>I said last night that I did not like that particular sentence beginning &ldquo;the education of public opinion&rdquo; and ending &ldquo;the authority of the State.&rdquo; I do not think anything would be lost if it were dropped It appears to me that the words that come before it and the words that come after it provide sufficiently for the defence of public order and morality, because we have all those things specifically mentioned. We have sedition specifically mentioned, and I do not see that this sentence which we are discussing adds anything to the security of the position. On the other hand, provided that words are put in making it plain that the right of the Press to criticise the Government of the day is acknowledged, I think the sentence is harmless. I do not happen to care for it; I would not have drafted it myself; but it does seem to me to be harmless, and I think we are wasting far too much time in discussing something which is really innocuous.  Of course, the champion waster of time on this particular subject to-day has been the Minister for Finance, who came in here and made what was quite obviously a speech intended for no other purpose than electioneering.</P>

I never heard a more injudicious and stupid speech than he made in trying to revive all these controversies about 1916 and 1919.  It is quite obvious that things were done and views were held in those days of disturbed conditions of society that <Col N="1677" /> are in no sense a guide as to what the law or procedure should be in a settled State, such as we now fortunately have.  If he did wish to make an electioneering point, I think he could have picked on something better.  I seem to recollect that there was a prosecution of the <i>Irish Press</i> under the late Government.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan I did come to the conclusion that prosecution of a newspaper for anything would be practically an act of blasphemy.  Now the truth of the matter is that there are some limits even to the freedom of the Press, and nobody in this House feels more intensely than I do on this subject of the freedom of the Press.  But look at what has happened in France. In France there was practically no law of libel &mdash; no effective law of libel &mdash; and the Press could print anything they chose to print.  That was carried to such a point that a Minister of the French Government was recently hounded to death by the virulent attacks of political opponents in unscrupulous newspapers.  Aside from <Col N="1678" /> that incident, the most appallingly violent feelings were being stirred up day after day in newspapers on both sides, on the Communist side and on the extreme Right, by unscrupulous and shameless attacks on individuals. As a consequence of one such incitement, you had an attempt on the person of Monsieur Blum.  Deputy Norton may remember that he was attacked, beaten and wounded as a result of newspaper incitement.</P>
      <P>While authoritarianism may be, and is, a danger to the liberty of the Press, there is another danger to the liberty of the Press and that is licence.  In some countries where the liberty of the Press has been destroyed, it has been destroyed because it degenerated into licence. That is the danger that democratic countries and democratic Parliaments have to bear in mind, and that we ought to bear in mind.  For that reason I am quite in agreement with the President that, when you make the general statement that the Press is free, then it is legitimate to add certain qualifications.  So far, I am with him, and I think that not to be with him in that is to be blind to the facts of human experience and political experience.  He has removed the greater part of my objection to this particular sentence by agreeing to put in words to secure that the Press shall be free to criticise the Government of the day.</P>

There is nothing in this to <Col N="1679" /> prevent a newspaper publishing an article to say that the King is an unworthy person, or that the President is an unworthy person, or that the Government is an unworthy Government.  The real security &mdash; and this is the point that I want to insist on &mdash; for liberty and democracy is that the people of the country should have a love of liberty and democracy.  It is not a paper Constitution that is going to save us from tyranny or from anarchy.  It is our own instincts, our own experience, our own political education, that will save us from those things.  If a time ever came when a law was introduced here that would give the Government undue powers to interfere with the liberty of the newspapers, I think Deputy Norton knows that he would find me at his side fighting it with all my might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to clarify the intendment and scope of the amendment in the name of Deputy McGilligan and myself.  It is perfectly obvious to me, listening to the last part of the speech of the Minister for Finance &mdash; and it was only the last part of his speech I heard&mdash;that he was speaking it in entire ignorance of the meaning of the right of free speech, and the limitations that have been placed for over 100 years on that constitutional right of free speech. Deputy MacDermot says that he does not like the sentence tacked on to the declaration of the right of free speech, but that he regards it as harmless.  If it is harmless it should not be there. It is an elementary principle of construction of statutes that the Legislature does not unnecessarily put a clause or a phrase into its Acts, and the courts accordingly endeavour to give effect to the meaning of every line and every word in the Act of Parliament. Deputy MacDermot is apparently not familiar with that elementary principle of construction, and when these words appear in the Constitution, when enacted as our fundamental law, if they do so appear and come to be construed in court, the courts will endeavour to see what the Legislature meant and to give some <Col N="1680" /> meaning to the clause as put in. Therefore, I think it right to warn Deputies who may read Deputy MacDermot's speech, and who may possibly be impressed by his statement that the sentence is harmless, that his statement is entirely incorrect and that they ought not to give any credence to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance worked himself into a frenzy against the Opposition, and stated that two leading members of the Opposition, as he called them, were instructed by our Party to put down this amendment deleting from the Article the provision that the publication or utterance of blasphemous, of seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law. He made great play upon that.  He demonstrated his own ignorance by making such play and by talking such nonsense.  The case I rest my amendment upon is this, that the words &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo; embody and enshrine clearly, specifically and comprehensibly all the limitations which up to this have been placed by law and practice on the right of free speech.  Anything else added to these expressions must be or may be a danger.  At least, there is a danger of their being construed as further limitations on the right of free speech.  I think Deputy Norton gave a very clear exposition of the position, with which I am in entire agreement, with one exception, that his amendment, if accepted, would make the thing rather worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of free speech was very succinctly stated in three or four lines by a very eminent Scottish lawyer in the year 1913.  Lord Duneden said: &ldquo;The right of free speech is to promulgate your opinions by speech as long as you do not utter words treasonable or libellous or make yourself obnoxious to the statutes dealing with blasphemy and obscenity.&rdquo;  The phrase at the end of this clause is entirely unnecessary. The right of free speech necessarily involves that it is subject to the limitation that it may not be used for treasonable purposes, for seditious purposes, for libellous purposes, for blasphemous purposes or purposes of obscenity.  That is the <Col N="1681" /> limitation that has been attached and that is recognised as being attached to the right of free speech for centuries.</P>
    <P>When you speak of free speech and the right of free speech you speak of a right subject to these limitations.  When you speak of the liberty of the Press you speak of the liberty of the Press to express their opinions subject to these qualifications, that there are not to be utterances in the Press which are treasonable, seditious, libellous, blasphemous or obscene.  Those limitations, or rather these so-called limitations, if they are limitations of the right of free speech, are rather a protection for the continued existence of the proper right of free speech.  These limitations on the right of free speech are embodied in the comprehensive phrase, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo;.  The last phrase about obscenity and blasphemy is also embodied in the words &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;, and the purpose of my amendment is merely to demonstrate or to make clear that we ought not to put in anything else except the expression that appeared in the original Constitution.  In the Draft before us the clause begins: &ldquo;The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;  The first right guaranteed is the right of citizens to express freely their opinions.  If the expression of the right remained at that point then, in my opinion, everything would be covered and the limitations which exist and which continue to exist will be preserved.  If anything is added, either the words subsequently put in are unnecessary &mdash; in which case they may be harmful, because one may give them an interpretation that is not intended&mdash;or else they may amount to an indication that further limitations are intended on the right of free speech and on the liberty of the Press &mdash; which is the same thing as the right of free speech.</P>
    <P>There is a legal maxim, <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i>  If you express one thing you exclude everything else.  Some things are expressed in this qualification added to the declaration of right that may exclude everything else.  It is a remarkable thing that in these exclusions or <Col N="1682" /> further qualifications attached there is no provision expressly providing against the publication of libellous matter.  It is the law at the moment that the publication of libellous matter is a recognised qualification on the right &mdash; if qualification be the proper phrase to use.  Libellous matter is one of the things not allowed in connection with the right of free speech.  In this Draft we find that when the right is being declared in express terms it  &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;...</P>

      <P>I am pointing out to the President &mdash; he may make small points on it if he likes &mdash; that the word &ldquo;libellous&rdquo; has been used as one of the qualifications of free speech and really as a protection of free speech, and that the omission of it, therefore, is significant.  I leave it at that.  The Minister for Finance spoke about Communism and the attitude of this Party towards Communistic utterances.  I gather that Deputy MacDermot is satisfied with this Article, because it permits the utterance and publication of Communistic doctrine.  I would have thought it did not, provided always, and provided only, that the qualifications <Col N="1683" /> on the right expressed in the second paragraph are omitted.  I think the dissemination of Communistic doctrines would be against public order and morality.  But, if you go on to state subsequently, as you do in this proviso, that the right &ldquo;shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State,&rdquo; it may well be that this Article would be construed as permitting Communists liberty of utterance, provided they do not undermine the authority of the State.  Communists will, of course, disseminate their doctrines in such a fashion as not merely to aver that they intend not to undermine the authority of the State, but to make a perfect State.  Consequently, they will easily get out of this Article.</P>
      <P>The objection to Deputy Norton's amendment is that it omits the Press and may bring into operation the maxim I have referred to &mdash; that if you refer to certain things and exclude other things, if you only refer to the radio and the cinema, you may carry on to your heart's content with a phonograph.  I want it to be perfectly clear that the purpose of the amendment is not to provide that blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter shall not be punishable.  I insist, and underline the fact that, in my view&mdash; and I think there is no question about it &mdash; the phrase &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo; covers that particular matter; and some time or another somebody will say, &ldquo;Why was it put in a second time?&rdquo; and a deduction may be drawn of a most astonishing character.  That was the purpose of the amendment &mdash; that in the phrase, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality,&rdquo; everything that is desirable to be done and ought to be done is permitted.  Anything that is put in expressly on top of that phrase weakens the phrase.  It is unnecessary, and if unnecessary, it ought not to be there.  If it is in any way capable of being construed in such a way as to cut down the phrase, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality,&rdquo; then equally it ought not to be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point to which I wish to <Col N="1684" /> direct attention is the fact that, when speaking about the education of public opinion and that the radio and Press shall not be used to undermine public order, the phrase is used that these rights &ldquo;shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;  We have in the qualifying opening phrase that the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality, and tagged on to public order or morality you have &ldquo;or the authority of the State.&rdquo;  Is there a distinction between expressing opinions which are contrary to public order or morality and those which are liable to undermine the authority of the State?  In my view, there is not, unless it is set down here in black and white, in which event it may be construed as necessarily meaning something that it did not mean in connection with what everybody knows to be the accepted definition and the limitations of the right of free and public speech.  That right of public speech is recognised as being subject to the limitations to which I have referred &mdash; treason, sedition&mdash;which is a very wide term&mdash; libel, obscenity, blasphemy.  All these limitations are completely and comprehensively covered in the phrase &ldquo;subject to public order or morality.&rdquo; If an attempt is made to put down, or define, or in any way interfere with the phrase, then I want, at all events, to have my view put on record, that it is a danger to the free exercise of the rights which this Constitution alleges it is guaranteeing.</P>

      <P>I just intervened to ask the President if he will tell us what reference to the matter under discussion here to-day that part of the Minister for Finance's speech had which dealt with certain so-called censorships of the Press.  Normally the attitude that we can adopt to the Minister for Finance and that part of his speech would be the attitude expressed in the saying: &ldquo;Is leitheid an buaileach satailt ann,&rdquo; and we would have no desire further to discuss the matter.  But the systematic way in which the matter was introduced, and the importance of the matter under <Col N="1685" /> discussion, renders it imperative that we should have from the President some explanation as to what the relation to the discussion was.  Unfortunately, while the matter was being dealt with by the Minister for Finance at length, the raising of a question of order brought the House into a difficulty. We got a long statement of facts from the Minister for Finance which, it was suggested, bore on the discussion here, but we were not able to get from the Minister what the relationship was.  The Minister for Finance simply emphasised that on one particular occasion there was a violent censorship of a Dublin newspaper because of a particular editorial utterance. He indicated that there was another occasion upon which, if we are to place any superficial interpretation on his remarks, violent censorship ought to have been applied.</P>

I feel that there is no such necessity.  I would suggest, however, that we should hear from the President why the Minister for Finance introduced the subject.  The Minister for Finance said how necessary it was to face realities in this matter. The Minister for Finance within the last couple of years sat in a Dublin cinema house when he saw the cinema wrecked because pictures of the wedding of a royal princess were shown on the screen.  The President and his Ministers are aware that the police made no intervention at that particular time; they were prevented from following up the circumstances of the case at that time, and no State action was taken in the way of subsequent intervention on that matter.</P>

      <P>I do not want the President to dictate as to how the Chair is to act.  I want to find out from the President what the Minister for Finance means, not alone by clause (n), but by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m).  I want to know what the Minister means by clause (n): &ldquo;proprietors, directors, editors, sub-editors and leader writers of the hostile Press in Ireland in cases where these are known to be hostile&rdquo;?  These are the people who come under the heading of: &ldquo;The following will be shot at sight.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance went back to 1916; he went back to 1919 and he told us of facts at that particular time without indicating their bearings on this section and the matter has been left as it is.  Use has been made of the discussion here to make an attack, for purely political purposes, on a Dublin organ.  Surely the President is not going to allow himself to lie under that particular charge.  The intervention of the Minister for Finance in this debate to-day was to the effect that censorship of the Press is warranted by such acts as caused violent interference with the Press at that particular time.  The Minister for Finance tells us that the attitude of ex-Ministers on this matter is important to us in this debate.  I would put a question to the President, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who alleged at that time in October, 1922, that they were Ministers and that they authorised the Chief-of-Staff of that time to deal with defence matters.  I <Col N="1688" /> would ask them what relation there can be on the discussion we are having here on the censorship of the Press, to what happened in 1916?  I am recalling that in November, 1922, an order was issued that the people that I mentioned would be shot at sight.  Either the President is concerned or not concerned with dealing systematically and properly with the safeguarding of the rights and liberties of the people of this country.  The Press in this country has a very important part to play in safeguarding the rights and liberties of the people and in safeguarding the authority of the State in the interests of the people.  The only interpretation that can be put on the intervention by the Minister for Finance to-day is that there is going to be a very vicious outlook on his own part, on the part of his colleagues and on the part of the President to any Press organs that may stand in their particular way.  We do know that Government advertisements have been withheld from Irish newspapers because they criticised the wheat policy of the Government.</P>

He is bringing the discussion down to realities.  We would like to keep this discussion on the plane on which Deputy O'Sullivan kept it, but we cannot ignore the intervention of the Minister for Finance in so gratuitous a way and the President cannot ask us here, on a discussion on the rights and liberties of the Press to-day, to ignore completely the way in which the Press is actually being treated in this matter.

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two things that were raised by Deputy Costello and I would like to refer to them.  I think the result of the discussion has been this, at any rate&mdash;that this talk about dictatorship and dictatorial powers being taken here is again blown to the wind.  The only thing we have to fear now is lest some words we are adding here to the existing position might weaken it.  That is a very different position from the position that was taken up by Deputy Rowlette last night, and it is very different from the position apparently taken up by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of us knows that liberty can be abused and that it is essential for every State to take measures against the abuse of the liberties which we understand when we speak of liberty of speech and liberty of the Press.  All that is done in this particular Article is to lay down on the State what it will be ultimately for the Legislature to see to&mdash;the education of public opinion being a matter of grave import to the common good, that organs of public opinion such as the radio, the Press and the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty <Col N="1690" /> of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  My challenge to everybody, whether in this House or outside it, is this: Is it right that the State should see, in so far as it can, that the liberty which is indicated and acknowledged in the first part of this section shall not be used in such a manner as to undermine public order, morality or the authority of the State?  Do they want it done? If not, surely we ought to indicate in the Constitution that there are limitations to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, from the depths of his legal knowledge, experience and practice, is able to tell us what Lord Dunedin has given as the present position, in a simple sentence.  How many people in this country know that?  The lawyers probably do, but the average citizen is entitled to know what rights are being given to him and what limitations there are to these rights, and he should not have to go through volumes of legal reports to get it.  What we are trying to do in this Constitution is to put in language which everybody can understand, to put down clearly these principles and indicate, so far as we can, for the education of the public, what the limitations are.  I do not think Deputy Costello would seriously contend that this phrase here was going to limit, in any sense, the position.  Is it not clearly an additional statement?  We say that the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of certain rights, subject to public order and morality, and then we enumerate those rights.  The first right is that every citizen will be able to express freely his convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>Clearly, where there is a question of the expression of opinions, one naturally considers the very important matter of the education of public opinion.  If we are going to have democracy at all we must follow certain lines.  I agree with the Deputy&mdash; I think that it was Deputy Costello&mdash; who said that it is for the protection of democracy that you have these limitations, and if you are going to permit a single organ to use its power to undermine public order or public morality or the authority of the State, <Col N="1691" /> then all this work we are doing here is in vain.  We are trying to embody in this a charter of real democracy, and all we are arranging for is to see that democracy will be in a position to protect itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton talks about restrictions on profit-making enterprises. There are profit making enterprises called the Press.  We have in large centres, in large countries particularly, people with immense wealth who can make still more wealth through the Press and can use the wealth and their power of making wealth, if they want to, in a manner that is detrimental to the public good.  Must the State be in a position in which it will be helpless in such a case?  I think nobody will say that it should be, and consequently we do certain things here; we indicate, for instance, the limitations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan reminded me of some views that I held in 1929 about the vagueness of the term &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo;  I do not think we had Deputy Costello then to enlighten us and to tell us that we had a very neat definition of public order and morality.  It is because I understand that it has already received a fairly definite definition that I am satisfied with it now.  I may say that there is still a little bit of lingering doubt as to what is completely covered by it.  But if I am assured that it is definite in a legal sense, I suppose I shall have to be satisfied, but if I could define it more definitely, I would.  However, with regard to this Article, like many of the other Articles that have been attacked, there is nothing in this but a safeguard for the community to see that the institutions which the people will be establishing by this Constitution will be able to function in their interests.</P>

When you find it repeated in this proviso relating to &ldquo;public order or morality or the authority of the State,&rdquo; then it appears to me to be open to the suggestion that <Col N="1692" /> if you use your right of free speech to undermine the authority of the State, then you are not doing anything which is contrary to public order.

I am one of those who stands up from that point of view for rules of evidence and other things of that sort as being safeguards and as the result of long experience, and let nobody get it into his head that I despise those things. I do not, but I say that when there is an attempt to use a general rule or a canon of interpretation wildly, instead of being a help it may be a hindrance.  I <Col N="1693" /> think that would be the case if I were inclined to interpret this in the way the Deputy suggests.  I think I would be misusing it, putting common sense aside and using some sort of rule as my guide instead.</P>
      <P>There is this in regard to this whole matter, and I think we will all agree on it: we have undoubtedly a danger, because there is hardly a single right that one has that cannot be misused. We could pass here the most oppressive laws; we could pass here the most unjust laws; and Legislatures that come after us will be able to do that, no matter what Constitution you enact, so there is no use in thinking that where you have rights you have not dangers.  Am I to be prevented, for example, from going down to the Pillar in a motor car because people could go down there and kill half a dozen people on the way?  I think it would be absurd to think that.  So here, when we are making provision for something that has to be met, there is not the slightest doubt that anybody can stand up and imagine cases in which that provision could be abused.  Undoubtedely you can, and there could be an abuse of the power to see that the expression of public opinion was right.  If we were able to get some objective method of determining what was true and what was false, then we could all agree that what was false should not be permitted to be promulgated or propagated. The trouble comes in when the question of what is true and what is false has to be determined, and, being human beings and not infallible, we will disagree as to what is true and what is false.</P>

      <P>We have courts; we have a sense of justice in ourselves; and we have the fact that, as I think it was Deputy MacDermot very rightly pointed out, the ultimate safeguard of liberty is the right sense of the people.  There is not a doubt whatever about it and do not think that, when any Constitution is passed, the people can for one moment give up the vigilance they ought to exercise, <Col N="1694" /> both in the selection of their representatives and in the watchfulness with which they look after their subsequent actions.  That is essential. Wherever there is power, there is power to abuse and to go wrong. We cannot prevent that here.  We have no objective method in regard to what is right and what is wrong, and we may disagree, but we shall have to set up for ourselves some method.  The Legislature, for instance, if it is desired at some stage to implement this particular instruction, will have to decide what are the methods by which it will best ensure that these organs of public opinion will not be used for these wrong purposes.  When that time comes, we may have a great deal of difficulty in deciding whether, in fact, the methods by which we try to ensure that might not bring about greater evils than the very evils they try to stop.  That will be a practical question to be considered when the time comes.</P>
      <P>All we are doing here is saying that the formation of public opinion, particularly in a democratic country, is most important for the common good, when the people on the information at their disposal decide questions of tremendous importance to the life of the community.  Consequently, we point out that that is a fact and lay an obligation on the State to see that, as far as possible, public opinion will not be&mdash;I cannot say &ldquo;misled,&rdquo; because that would be getting us into the old difficulty&mdash;in very definite directions, misled, namely, in the direction of inciting to upset public order, morality, or the authority generally of the State as representing the community.</P>

      <P>I do not want to spoil my excellent record of not having intervened in the Bunreacht debate at all, and if the President is prepared to meet Deputy Costello I propose to preserve that record.  Otherwise I shall take this opportunity of making some observations on the speech of the Minister for Finance here to-day.  I am induced to depart from my determination to ignore the debate on this wholly irrelevant matter, as I see it, because I felt from the very beginning that what really matters is that we should get good government in this country and, if we do not get that, paper Constitutions are not going to do much to help us.  To-day, I was struck by the misfortune that befell the President of the Executive Council.  He has been very lucky in his public life but recently disaster seems to be piling upon him.  The traditional de Valera weather has forsaken him and we are getting ordinary Irish weather in this country; the electoral tide in the country is turning against him; and the last, but by no means the least disaster, he allowed the Minister for Finance to open for the Government on the subject of the freedom of the Press to-day.  That was the crowning disaster of the series of misfortunes that has smitten him recently.  When you see the child of good fortune for the first time in a long time encountering adversity, much as you may disapprove of his activities, you cannot help feeling sorry for him.  I felt sorry for the President as he writhed in his seat while the Minister for Finance was talking&mdash;the wary old war-horse listening to the silly man letting him in for it, letting the cats leap out of the bag in all directions and trying to follow every cat with his eye without pretending that he saw it.  I sympathised with the President because, of course, the statements made by the Minister for Finance, which the President was scrupulous to avoid adopting, were reckless and extremely dangerous. The Minister for Finance argued that provision should be made in this Constitution for censorship of the Press, and he said that he condemned the doctrinaire attitude adopted by the Opposition in regard to freedom of the <Col N="1697" /> Press.  I do not believe that the President adopts that.  I believe that was mere folly on the part of the Minister for Finance.  But it is well for this House to remember that, if Constitutions have any worth at all, their purpose is not to restrain reasonable men, because they do not require restraint. Their purpose is to act as a check on reckless men who might precipitate great evils if there was not a fundamental law there to present an obstacle when they were tempted to imprudence.  Anybody listening to the Minister for Finance to-day would realise that, under the exterior of a simple, inoffensive little man there are immense potentialities of danger because, when he loses his head, he is liable to say anything.</P>

Having convinced himself of that necessary preliminary, he sets his plans deliberately and advances towards his objective.  You know where he is going.  The other little man does not know where he is going or where he wants to get.</P>

      <P>I am warning this House that, when it realises there are in the Executive Council persons so recklessly irresponsible as the Minister for Finance, it should be rarely anxious lest it allows any words to remain in this Article which would give the appearance of a warrant of authority <Col N="1698" /> to people who would seek to do things none of us imagines any responsible man in this country would wish to do. There are men who might want to do irresponsible things and it is to them we have got to look when drafting this document.</P>
      <P>Let me first deal with the minor matters that are raised.  The Minister spoke of the cinema and said surely nobody would argue that that is an organ of public opinion.  It is not 12 months since the President of the Executive Council and his colleagues deliberately sought to use the cinema as an instrument of public controversy. I saw a cinematograph film in this city in which the President was portrayed presiding over the Executive Council and he made a speech to us off the screen.  By implication, he gave us the impression that he had founded Guinness' brewery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say so explicitly and the film is quite capable of the interpretation that he never intended to convey it but the nasty, irresponsible cinema operator did produce a film which, to the resident of Kansas, would suggest that, if President de Valera did not found Guinness' brewery, at least he helped it on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having created that desirable impression on the minds of men, we were presented with a picture of the National University and Trinity College.  Having accepted responsibility for founding a brewery, he was then prepared to oust Queen Elizabeth and don her robe as the foundress of Trinity College.  That production was grotesque and laughable, as we look back upon it.  We killed it with ridicule and not with censorship.  Nobody urged that that grotesque production should not be shown in every hamlet in Ireland.  We said: &ldquo;For goodness sake, bring that film down the country and the people will see through its grotesque misrepresentation.&rdquo;  If its exhibition had been prohibited, we would have had shebeen cinemas in every parish in Ireland, and people would conceive it to be a patriotic duty <Col N="1699" /> to show that film and to go to jail for six months for the crime of showing it. The President was perfectly ready to put a quick one over on the people. Those who wished to expose the misrepresentation did not say one word against it.  They realised that the people would see the misrepresentation for themselves.  The film was not shown outside the city.  The President, like the wary, old warhorse that he is, called off his dogs and put them back into the kennel.  He saw that that dog would not fight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has that in his pocket.  I merely borrow it from the library when I require it.  That is a good case in point as regards the cinema.  Remember, we are in the early stage of development in respect of the cinema and anybody who is familiar with the particular type of film known as &ldquo;The March of Time&rdquo; realises that, in the future, the cinema may become a very powerful instrument of public expression.  What we have got to ask ourselves is whether we should not regard that in the same way as we regard the Press.  We should not, of course, close our eyes to the perils. There are perils in freedom of speech, in freedom of the Press and in freedom of the cinema.  What we have got to ask ourselves, however, is if, in trying to mitigate these perils, we shall not create far worse ones.  I have not heard anyone here suggest that we can serve the interests of this country or the interest of democracy by placing a limit on the organs of public expression beyond the ordinary limits recognised in this and every other democratic State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to the radio, and he said the radio could scarcely be regarded as an organ of public opinion.  No more powerful organ of public opinion exists, if you mean by an organ of public opinion a means of addressing the people. I have no hesitation in saying that the President of the United States at the present time largely owes his electoral victory to his ability to use the radio for the purpose of reaching <Col N="1700" /> the people.  In the future, that instrument may be still further used.  We do not know.  The Press and all it means we know fairly well.  Let us not close our eyes to this fact: the Press has in it many potential evils. The freedom of the Press can be greatly abused, just as freedom of speech can be greatly abused; but in order to correct the comparatively occasional abuses that arise, our duty is to be circumspect and to avoid creating far greater evils by limiting that freedom.</P>
    <P>There can be very little doubt, in the mind of any rational person, that freedom of the Press and freedom of speech are closely interwoven.  Destroy freedom of speech and you destroy all the essentials of liberty in any community.  That may not be apparent at first glance, but it is perfectly certain that if you proceed to limit the freedom of the Press beyond preventing it, as has already been accepted generally on all sides of the House, from advocating the overthrow of the State by force, or publishing material which is blasphemous or generally indecent, you have got to face the fact that the next step is to limit freedom of speech.  Limit that, and you immediately arrive at the stage obtaining in certain European countries at the present time, in which no three people can sit down by their own fireside and discuss anything lest one of the three will hurry off and inform the authorities, and bring the arm of the law into your very fireside to restrict your right to speak your mind even in your own home.</P>
    <P>As I understand the suggestion of Deputy Costello, if this Section 6 of Article 40 is amended to provide some explicit words in addition to &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; designed to prohibit advocacy of the overthrow of the State by force, we have in the three terms an adequate interpretation of the people's will, and the extent to which freedom of public expression should be limited.  There is this all-important point&mdash;I do not think some members of the House fully understand it, and the trouble is that lawyers understand it so well, particularly lawyers of long <Col N="1701" /> experience, that they forget how little a layman understands it&mdash;that if you make in a statute a positive statement and thereafter put in an excepting clause, very often when the interpretation of the whole instrument comes to be made far greater attention is riveted on the excepted clause than is given to the explicit statement contained in the Article.  The extent to which the uninitiated layman can fall into that trap was admirably illustrated by the extremely foolish observations of the Minister for Finance, who dwelt at great length on the fact that Deputy Costello's amendment proposes to remove the words &ldquo;the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law&rdquo;.  He seemed to think that because the amendment was designed to remove these words that the Opposition position was that there should be no prohibition of such an offence.  He entirely neglected the fact that the proper interpretation of the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; would adequately cover all that, and that if you sought to qualify the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; by this passage to which I have referred it might easily come thereafter to be understood that the only offences against public morality were those which could be brought within the four walls of this concluding paragraph.</P>
    <P>I think another illusion has crept in here to-day because everybody is agreed very emphatically on the difficulty of accepting broad general principles in regard to limiting the freedom of the Press or of any other organ of public opinion.  I agree that to arrive at broad general principles does present a difficulty, but I am not at all sure that broad terms are not the best instrument for conveying the Legislature's, or the people's meaning, leaving it to the courts of law, which will know the general trend of law both constitutional and legislative in this country, to apply the general terms to the particular case.  No matter how carefully an Article of the Constitution is drafted it cannot be designed so as to particularise every conceivable contingency that may arise.  If you do employ such general words as &ldquo;subject to public <Col N="1702" /> order and morality&rdquo; or the words suggested by Deputy Costello, the judges of this State in applying them will very properly and generally presume that the legislation is constitutional, and only where the legislation patently infringes the liberty of the individual, or the liberty of the Press, will the courts intervene to declare unconstitutional the particular statute under which the proceedings were taken.  Did I hear the President say something?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to give the President a short reply, but whether there is objection or not, I intend to speak my mind on this matter.  In the matter of the freedom of the Press, the personal liberty of all of us is very intimately concerned, and I think it is desirable that any Deputy, whether he professes to be a constitutional expert, and is so or not, or whether he is only a simple layman with some solicitude for the essential liberty of himself and his own neighbours, has the right to protest very emphatically against a proposal which may be founded in incompetence or in folly, and which is calculated, in my opinion, gravely to jeopardise our essential rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with alarm to the Minister for Finance to-day, and I saw more clearly than I have seen heretofore the immense dangers of allowing a document of this character to indulge in pious phrases when one realises that what appears to be no more than a pious phrase in a draft document, may be used hereafter for an oppressive purpose.  It seems to me perfectly clear that, if the mind of the Minister for Finance were the mind of this Government, a very extensive censorship of the Press would be the order of the day, and that if any newspaper in this <Col N="1703" /> State ventured to voice the views of the minority of the people, then, in the judgment of the Minister for Finance, it should be ruthlessly suppressed and crushed.  That is not my conception of freedom of the Press or of individual liberty.  As I understand those things, I have a right, in this democratic State, or any newspaper has a right, in this democratic State, to criticise or protest against anything the Government does. I have a right to make that protest even if I am in a minority of one, and so long as I abstain from suggesting that my grievances should be remedied by the overthrow of the State by force, there should be no limit to my freedom to argue with my fellow citizens that my philosophy is a better one than that to which they at present subscribe.</P>
    <P>Public decency, naturally, has to be considered, and provision can be made for that; but the wider we leave open freedom of speech and freedom of expression to everybody in this State, the greater safety we have for the people as a whole.  The longer I live, the more I am convinced that the most effective way to destroy falsehood is to drag it into the open and place it before the people.  Attempts to crush falsehood by suppression fail in 99 cases out of 100, and in the long run, when you finally dispose of it by patient argument, the period of suppression gives the falsehood an altogether false strength which it never would have had if it had been boldly encountered in the first stage of its existence and challenged.</P>
    <P>I therefore ask the President to reconsider this Article, and to reconsider it with a view to allaying the fears of people, even of those who do not profess to be constitutional experts, in regard to their own individual liberty or the liberty of the Press.  I feel profoundly that the liberty of each one of us is inextricably interwoven with the liberty of the Press as a whole.  Individual members of the Press may abuse their privileges, just as individuals amongst us may do the same; but if freedom and independence are to mean anything in this country, we ought to cherish the freedom both of the Press and of our individual <Col N="1704" /> selves above everything else that national freedom has brought us after the long period of oppression which we experienced in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President is going to conclude, Sir, I should like to be permitted to say a few words.  I only want a minute or two.  I have listened this afternoon to the discussion on this amendment with regard to cinemas, the Press, and radio, and I think it will be agreed by those of us on this side of the House that the President exhibited a very kindly courtesy indeed to the representations made by the different Deputies that I heard speaking from this side of the House. If a Constitution is to represent the dignity of a nation, which it should, I could wish that the Minister for Finance, when speaking, had been able to realise that his contribution to-day made a very poor comparison indeed with other contributions on this amendment, and particularly in comparison to the contribution of the President himself.  I do not wish to take the advantage in this House of comparing the President with one of his Ministers, but I say that there is not the slightest chance whatever of the Constitution ever being discussed in the way in which I believe it ought to be discussed and in the way in which the President himself suggested that it ought to be discussed, so long as we have the Minister for Finance trying to rake up the passions of the past in the way he did to-day.  That brings about a lowering of the standard of debate which will never contribute to a proper Constitution being established here.  In a matter of this kind, an important matter such as the Constitution, even though the process of debate is slow and weary and the thing has to be taken Article by Article and amendment by amendment, we should reflect on and remember the fact that this is for the Irish nation: that this is to represent, as it were, the living people outside the shores of this country.  Therefore, whether as layman or lawyer, or as a humble back-bencher, we ought to try to give it our best consideration, and at the same time we ought to try to recreate a tradition of debate in <Col N="1705" /> this House.  I hold that that can never be done so long as a Minister for Finance can make the reflections that he has made this afternoon and so long as he digs up the passions of the past and tries to rekindle the fires that we all want to clamp down for ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point, Sir, that I wanted to be clear upon, and that I wanted to impress upon the President.  In connection with this matter of ensuring that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press and the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State, I want to know who is to decide on the matter?  Is it to be the President or the Executive Council, or is it to be&mdash;in my view the proper people to decide a question of that character&mdash;the judges of the High Court, or some such authority established by law?  I do not want to pretend for a moment that the Executive Council, or the President's Office itself, is not established by law, but one can easily conceive what might happen in the case of a Government which might feel that a certain organ of the Press contained, from time to time, articles which, in their view&mdash; whether leading articles or specially contributed articles&mdash;were being used to undermine public order or morality <Col N="1706" /> or the authority of the State.  One can easily conceive a Government attempting to suppress liberty in that case.  I do not suggest that the present Executive Council would attempt it, or that the present President of the Executive Council would attempt it&mdash;I have that much confidence in the President and in his Executive Council&mdash;but what is to prevent some future President or some future Executive Council attempting to do that?  I regard Article 40 as one of the most important Articles in the Constitution, preserving, as it does, not alone the liberty of the Press, but the liberty of the citizen, which has been referred to so frequently. I do not want to emphasise it further than that, but, having regard to the past history of this country, I do not want to go back. The Minister for Finance to-day did go back a good deal, and he spoke about the liberty of the Press, but I reminded him that he and the members of the present Executive Council, who were then outside this House, took jolly good care that there was no liberty of the Press when they smashed up organs of opinion in the country. Now, I do not wish to go back on that, but I say that that might easily occur again, and what I want the President to do is to make certain that it is secured in this Article 40 that the liberty of the Press and the liberty of the citizen will not be violated.  I have indicated some of the ways in which the liberty of the Press can be violated and has been violated.  For that reason, I want that Article made so water-tight and so fool-proof that the liberty of the Press and the liberty of the individual will be safeguarded for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the President is making a serious attempt in this Constitution&mdash;although I feel that very few people in the country are taking any interest at all in it&mdash;to secure a proper Constitution for the nation, and he has registered a number of pious opinions which are expressed in the various Articles in this proposed Draft Constitution.  Undoubtedly, they are but headlines in many cases, if you like; but in my view they want to be tightened up in some cases and <Col N="1707" /> I think the President should make it clear to the House, and to the people outside the House, who are to be the judges as to whether Press articles&mdash;whether leading articles or specially contributed articles&mdash;are such as shall not tend to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  I want to have that more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress, Sir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under Section 42 of the Dairy Produce Act, no creamery was permitted to accept cream from a producer unless it was delivered as white milk.  At the time, an exception was made in the case of Macamores Creamery, County Wexford, where it had been the custom for some years to collect cream from the farmers and to have the cream churned at the central station.  It was thought at that time that three years would be sufficient to enable the creamery to fall into line with other creameries, but since that time it has been necessary to continue the exception granted in the original Act.  Amending Acts to do so were passed in 1927, 1930 and again in 1933.  I have now to come before the Dáil again to get an indefinite extension for this creamery, because it does not look as if the creamery will be able to settle down to the ordinary routine of other creameries and to collect milk, within any definite period.  That is all that is involved in this Bill, and I do not think there can be any objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing of the circumstances of this particular creamery, but I take it that if this departure was deemed to be desirable on previous occasions, there can be no <Col N="1708" /> serious objection to a renewal of it.  I do not know whether what I am about to say is strictly relevant, and I await your ruling upon it, but this is an amendment of the Principal Act and it is designed generally to make provisions in connection with the production of butter.  We are all aware that a very strange situation recently arose in this country in which we were importing butter and paying 1/5 per lb for it.  At the same time we were actually exporting butter to Belgium, Germany and Great Britain at about 8d., 9d. or 10d. per lb.  Perhaps, the Minister would wish to take this opportunity to reassure us that this general scheme of creamery reorganisation is not being pursued with the intention of continuing a system whereunder we should seek markets on the Continent of Europe, in Germany and Belgium, to sell butter about 5d. per lb. less than our own people are asked to pay for it, and more particularly that we should not seek markets in Europe to sell our butter at 10d. per lb. and pay 1/5 per lb. for butter which we bring here from the antipodes.  I would ask the Minister on this occasion to say whether, in his judgment, from the experience that he has now gleaned from working the new machinery under which the creamery industry is being carried on at the present time, some scheme cannot be evolved whereunder, if butter is sold at 10d. per lb., our own people can have the advantage of the cheap butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that, whatever price we get for butter, we have got to keep the creamery industry in existence because it is an integral part of the mixed type of farming which every rational person wants to maintain in this country, and if you allow it to be destroyed by fortuitous world events, it might easily bring down with it a number of other branches of agriculture which could be made wealth-producing industries in this country.  But I cannot see how, if it is necessary to sell butter to the Germans at 10d. per lb., at the same time it is impossible to sell that butter to our own people at 10d.  I would much sooner subsidise butter and give it to our own people for 10d. than subsidise it and give it to the Germans at 10d.  I see, of course, that the Minister <Col N="1709" /> finds difficulty in getting the money requisite to subsidise even the exports of the present time.  I think the way he has got that money so far is to knock it out of the Irish consumer by putting it on to the selling price of butter here, but from the social point of view, and the point of view of the industry itself, surely that is a bad thing to do.  It would be much better if we could immensely increase the consumption of butter in Ireland by selling butter cheaply at the world price and give a direct subsidy to the creameries, if necessary, to keep them going, because in that way we might reasonably hope to expand very considerably the output of the creameries. I think that if we were to expand the output of the creameries the expense of producing butter would fall proportionately and the gap, which has to be bridged, would decrease proportionately.</P>
    <P>The more butter we produce, the less subsidy it will be necessary to pay on each individual pound in order to ensure an economic return for the creamery.  I am not asking the Minister to say now that he has any scheme whereby that end would be achieved but I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether, on broad general principles, he agrees with me that the policy pursued so far of giving the Germans and the Belgians cheap butter while our people have to pay a high price for butter was as good a plan as a plan whereunder a direct subsidy would be given to the creameries and the consumption of butter would be encouraged and extended amongst our own people, particularly that part of them who are living in large urban centres such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the suggestion which Deputy Dillon has made and I would ask him to state, with a view to our fully understanding his proposal, whether he intends that butter should be sold here, if the world price is an uneconomic price, at an uneconomic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow what the Deputy means by an uneconomic price.  I have always held that if a foreign country adopts what I <Col N="1710" /> have described as an inverted tariff, that is to say, if a foreign country to suit its own internal economy subsidises exports, it is a perfectly legitimate thing to put on a tariff equal to the exporting country's subsidy, otherwise you leave yourself a prey to any country which wishes to interfere with your economic life and to upset it by giving export bounties.  But if circumstances are such that you have a surplus product, that you have resolved on exporting some of it, and that world conditions are such that, in regard to that exportable surplus, you have to take a low price, I would much sooner that that surplus should be consumed by our own people at the low price, than to charge our own people a high price for butter in order to give it to the foreigner at a low price.</P>

      <P>It is not true to say that we are selling butter to Germany at 10d. per pound. We are getting what Deputy Dillon would regard as the world price, and that is whatever best Australian butter might be quoted at in London.  That is much above 10d. at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the price of Australian butter in London at the moment when it reaches the consumer. <Col N="1711" /> I have quotations here from the grocers.  During the last few weeks it was sold for 1/3 a pound over the counter, which is the very same price that we are charging our consumers here.  I do not see that there is very much in Deputy Dillon's argument, because we all appear to be on the world price that he talked about. Germany is paying the world price for our butter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether it is 108/- or 112/-; it is probably about 110/-.  In London about ten days ago New Zealand butter was 1/4 to 1/3, Australian butter was 1/3, and Danish butter was 1/6; so that if we regard our butter as at least as good as Danish butter, if it is not better&mdash;some of us think it is better&mdash;our consumers are getting very much better value, and getting it at the world price.  Our consumers are getting very much better value when you take it that the English consumer in London is paying 1/6 for Danish butter, 1/4 for New Zealand butter, and 1/3 for Australian butter, while we are selling the best butter in the world for 1/3; so that I think there is not very much in those arguments which the Deputy has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the import of butter, as I explained before, that was entirely due to unforeseen circumstances. I cannot say definitely, but it was supposed to be due both to the very bad hay during last winter on account of the bad harvest, and to the very cold weather during the winter that our production was down.  Our production was down about 20 per cent. during the early months of this year, and consequently we had to import butter.  That was the only time we had to import it for four or five <Col N="1712" /> years, and I hope it will not occur again.</P>

They have, of course, to meet expenses and tariff going into Great Britain.  Against that we pay subsidies.  We pay, in addition to that, a subsidy to bring that up to what we consider a fair price, which for this month would be 117/-, so that <Col N="1713" /> the subsidy goes not only to pay the tariff into great Britain but also to pay the difference between the world price and what we consider an economic price.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> I intended to associate this amendment with another amendment on the Order Paper, No. 32, but No. 32 has been determined by the Ceann Comhairle as likely to impose a charge and, I understand, some difficulty would arise as to whether it was in order or not.  I have apprehended in connection with this legislation that we are drifting straight towards the elimination of the minor curer, and subsequently, under another section of the Bill, to extensive amalgamation between the major curers, with the ultimate result that two or three large bacon firms will control the entire bacon producing business in this country.  To prevent monopoly is an extremely difficult thing.  If you want to preserve the capitalistic system, founded on individual enterprise, you must leave firms the utmost liberty to run their own business in their own way, to make the best profits, and to allow competition to control their activities.  If, in the enjoyment of these facilities, firms deliberately begin to seek monopoly, the State very quickly finds that it either has to make so many regulations to control the potential monopoly, that the regulations amount in fact to nationalisation, or else stand up and watch the monopoly developing.</P>
    <P>I detest monopoly so much that I would prefer socialisation of the industry rather than allow monopoly to remain in the hands of individuals. I detest socialisation, because I think socialism is an incompetent and futile way of running any business, and is calculated to depress any enterprise into the slough of inefficiency and second best.  If there is going to be monopoly, in my opinion, the State is bound to step in and say: &ldquo;We do not want monopoly.  We begged you not to form a monopoly, but now that you have done it, that monopoly will be operated for the people and by the people in the best way they can.  It will not be used for the purpose of plundering the producer and the consumer for the profit of the monopoly owner.&rdquo;  We will then have to get along as best we can with the comparatively inefficient instrument <Col N="1716" /> of socialisation as a unit to carry on the bacon industry.</P>
    <P>I proposed in amendment No. 32, which has been ruled out of order, to fix the curers of this country with notice that if they succeed, despite the express will of the people, in effecting a monopoly, the State will step in and say: &ldquo;Without regard to the intrinsic value of the property of the monopoly, we are going to acquire it for the comparatively nominal sum of £100,000.&rdquo;  That amendment is out of order, but, nevertheless, it served this useful purpose, that it does fix any person in this State, who thinks he may with impunity establish a monopoly, whether the people want monopoly or not, with full and fair notice, that if he continues in that course, and attempts hereafter to exploit the producer and the consumer, the State will deal with him, not as an enterprising business man, but as a public enemy, who has sought, as a result of his own cupidity, to render unworkable the system of private enterprise in the State.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that tariffs beget monopoly.  If there were no tariffs a monopolist would derive very little benefit from his monopoly, because when he did effect a monopoly here, foreign produce would come in to rob him of the profits of the monopoly if he tried to exploit consumers by forcing up prices.  If you have a high tariff wall the perils of monopoly become greater, because when the monopoly begins to force up prices foreign competition cannot get in as the tariff wall that has to be crossed is high enough to keep out any foreign stuff.  Therefore, with a view, in the first place, to placing every obstacle that he can put in the way of potential monopolies, I ask the Minister to notify all the minor curers, who are about to become small curers under this Bill, that they will be guaranteed the minimum production quota, even when under the general scheme their quota would fall below the minimum figure which he determines.</P>
    <P>The facts are extremely complicated, and it is very difficult to explain them to the House.  The Principal Act provides that we should first fill the quota <Col N="1717" /> we got on the British market, that we should subtract from the visible supplies of pigs the amount of bacon pigs and bacon we exported under the British quota, and that the remaining pigs would constitute home production. Having ascertained the home production quota, that had to be sub-divided amongst the various manufacturers producing bacon.  Those manufacturers fall into two categories, those who exported part of their production, and sold part at home, and the manufacturers who enjoyed trade on the home market.  Small men, producing only small quantities of bacon, naturally did not go on the foreign market, because they had very little bacon to offer for sale, and it would not pay them to hire agents in foreign markets to dispose of whatever little quantity of bacon they had left after supplying local demands.  Having ascertained the British quota, and the home production quota, our Government very properly went to the British Government and asked them to increase the British quota, and there was an increase of 5 per cent.  Subsequently they asked for and got an increase to 7½ per cent.  Is that correct?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>That meant that we had to send 15 per cent. more bacon and pigs there.  It was an excellent thing in a market that was so contemptible and that was gone for ever.  Fortunately the Minister for Agriculture did not swallow that particular bit of &ldquo;codology,&rdquo; and very properly and very prudently he got from the British an increase in their quota.  That meant, if the total number of pigs in Saorstát Eireann approximated to the same figure, our exports of 15 per cent. more pigs to Great Britain reduced our total home production quota by that number of pigs, always assuming that the pig population remains at a level figure.  When you reduce the home production quota by that number of pigs, that reduction had to be spread <i>pari passu</i> over all bacon curers.  The man who was purchasing a large number of pigs could afford to lose that 15 per cent. <Col N="1718" /> and still have enough pigs passing through his factory to leave it economic, but the man only purchasing say, 100 pigs a week, when you took his proportion off his production quota, might drop down to having only 80 pigs.  To operate his plant on the basis of only 80 pigs per week made what was an economic unit, an uneconomic unit. It is partially to meet the case of a man in that position that this amendment is put down.</P>
      <P>Remember that the big curers control the board.  The big curers control the production quotas and the export quotas, virtually, because they can press on the Minister to get a larger export quota if it is necessary.  The big curers can so rig the situation that they would cut the minor curer down to so low a figure of production that the minor curer, or the small curer, as he will be after the passage of this Bill, would find that his plant had been made wholly uneconomic.  That is one method by which the major curer can strike at the minor curer.  In addition to having that method at his disposal, he also will be able to use that threat against the small or the minor curer. If he was seeking to swallow him up, he can always hold over his head the threat: &ldquo;If you do not take my price, if you do not sell out to me, if you do not check in your licence to the Bacon Marketing Board, the day may soon come when your share of the home production quota will fall so low that you will have to close your little factory, because you will not be able to get enough pigs to keep it open.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to do is to say to all these small curers: We will give you 100 pigs per week, because we think that is about the lowest figure that will keep a good little factory going that can afford to give good employment, that can afford to put in proper equipment and keep the business in proper trim.  If the exigencies for any quota period call for a reduction in your production quota, say, to 80 pigs, you will get 100 pigs. If you are a man who was in the habit of doing 150 pigs, and the exigencies of the situation calls for a reduction of your quota to 130 pigs, you will get only 130 pigs.  But if the exigencies <Col N="1719" /> of the situation should ever operate to reduce you below 100, then you will get <i>ex gratia</i> an allocation of so many pigs as will bring your production quota up to 100.  Therefore you can go ahead now in the certainty that in every production week you will get 100 pigs at least, and if the pig population rises and the market for bacon develops you will increase <i>pari passu</i> with the other licensed curers in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that in the course of the last few days, so far as certain smaller curers are concerned, the Minister has met them in this regard. I ask him now to extend the guarantee that he has given these small curers to the rest of the minor curers who graduate into the class of small curers under this Bill.  If such a guarantee is given, then I think that a great deal of the anxiety which was felt when this Bill was first introduced will be allayed, because not only will these small curers enjoy an assurance of adequate weekly supplies, but they will also know from the Minister's guarantee to them that they will enjoy his protection hereafter in the event of any attempt being made to swallow them up by the larger curers, and I do not think they can be under any doubt as to where this Party stands if, at any time, we should be made responsible for their future welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Mr. Dillon in his plea for special protection for the minor curers and the small licensees.  Deputy Dillon has not, however, been quite fair in his description of the problem.  When he represents the minor curer as being absolutely at the mercy of the larger curer, he is overlooking the fact that the objection of even one member of the Bacon Marketing Board puts the whole situation in the hands of the Chairman of the Board, who is entirely independent of any interest, big or small.  Under the original Bill it is provided that, if there is not absolute unanimity on the Bacon Marketing Board, then the Chairman of the Board comes to his own decision.  I do not know why Deputy Dillon thinks that provision so contemptible that he leaves it out of his description.  He <Col N="1720" /> makes it appear that on the Bacon Marketing Board the small curer is absolutely at the mercy of the big man.</P>
      <P>There is obviously going to be a rather serious situation for certain minor curers as soon as they come under the Bacon Marketing Board. Several of them have increased their plant and, rather blindly in a way, have provided equipment for much more extensive manufacture than should have seemed likely to come their way.  If he had studied the provisions of the principal Act, it should have been plain, of course, to any minor curer that when he became a licensee he would be subject to quotas and that his quota would have to be a very limited one&mdash;would have to be the very minimum if injustice were not to be done to those who were licensees from the start.</P>
      <P>But, whether from indifference, or because certain minor curers did not foresee the full consequences, or from some other cause, several of them have, with an enterprise that would ordinarily be very laudable and very commendable, equipped themselves for the production of a much greater quantity of bacon than they were likely to get if the Minister were not prepared to deal with them on some such lines as Deputy Dillon suggested.  At the moment, undoubtedly there is a good deal of anxiety amongst them on that question, and whether the problem would be best met in the manner in which Deputy Dillon suggests, I would not like to venture an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, I appeal to the Minister to make some concession, because these men are of very great use to their localities from every point of view&mdash; from the point of view of employment, from the point of view of their service to the farmers of their district; and also from the point of view of maintaining independent, decentralised industries.  I am sure everyone would regret if, by any chance, even one of them were to be eliminated from the business.  I hope the Minister will see his way to make some concession on the basis of a minimum supply of pigs.  What the quantity should be is, of course, a matter for himself and those with whom he is negotiating; but, <Col N="1721" /> at all events, some such concession should be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Dillon's plea to the Minister. I am not aware of the agreement which has been made with the minor curers, but I am interested in connection with the employment of a number of men in Hacketstown, County Carlow, where a minor curer has developed a big trade and is killing over 250 pigs at the present time and giving employment to over 25 men.  I understand the minor curers have no representation on the Bacon Marketing Board and, therefore, are at the mercy of the other curers.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that, whatever arrangement is come to, this minor factory in Hacketstown will receive a quota for not less than are being killed there at the present time, because there is practically no other employment given in that particular area.  This curer gives a much higher price for pigs than some of the other curers, such as Messrs. Denny, who have a fixed price.  This man pays a higher price to the farmers in the area for their pigs and has sunk a large amount of capital in the development of the factory.</P>
      <P>It would be a great loss to the labourers employed in a rural district if any Act were passed interfering with these minor curers.  I appeal to the Minister to make arrangements so that these little industries will not be in any way interfered with.  I know of one minor curer who kills up to 250 pigs a week and the Minister knows him too.  I trust that any arrangements made will not worsen his position.  That man is operating in a scattered area and any reduction in his business would mean a loss in employment to the working people in that area as well as a loss to the surrounding farmers.  I hope that this man, and curers who are in the same position as he is, will be given security under this Bill when it passes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the acceptance of the principle of this amendment on the Minister.  The case has been pretty well presented by Deputy Dillon and there seems to be unanimity amongst all Parties in the House on the question <Col N="1722" /> of protection for the small curer. When this Bill was before the House recently much was said on the importance of preserving the minor curer in the different areas where he operates. These afford a convenient and a very satisfactory market to the local pig producers.  Another advantage is that local traders are supplied with bacon for sale over the counter at reasonably low prices and there is a custom by which offals are sold at very reasonable prices too.  In my county there are two licensed curers.  Their present quota is about 80 pigs a week but until very recently they were killing 100 pigs.  I am aware they are down now to slightly half that figure and they are threatened with a still further reduction if some concession is not given to them under this Bill. With regard to the minor curers, there is one in my constituency.  From what the Minister has stated in reply to Deputy Dillon, there is a likelihood that the small curers will, on the Report Stage of this Bill, have their positions safeguarded.  I assume as a corollary to that, that the minor curers will continue to operate without any restrictions.  They will have 12 months in which to qualify for a licence and when they are duly licensed, they will have the same protection as the existing licensed curers will have when this Bill passes through the House.  For these reasons I am supporting the case made by Deputies Dillon, Moore and Everett on behalf of the small curers.</P>

I would not stand for anything that would in any way prejudice the position of the small curers or that would in any way affect their interests.  I would not like in any Bill to see any section that would make for interference with their livelihood.  These small curers give a good deal of employment and they afford the local farmers a convenient market.  It is clear from what has been said by Deputies on all sides of the House that the country is in favour of helping these curers in every possible way.  I am sure all Deputies here are against anything that would interfere with their business.</P>

      <P>I want to preface my remarks on this amendment by repeating that there was no reason why any minor curer should have felt any anxiety as to the result of the operations of this Bill.  This Bill does not alter their position in any respect except to provide them with compensation if they wish to go out of business and only if they wish to go out.  I would like to say this&mdash;I agree with what Deputies have said about the small curer fulfilling a useful function in many ways.  It will not make so much difference to the farmers whether the small curers are there or not, but it will always make a great difference to the consumers who live in the vicinity.  In the first place they are able to purchase offals at a reduced rate.  I have just one word to say with regard to the export quota.  Deputy Dillon has spoken on this matter.  I would not like that we would ask for a smaller quota.  The quota we asked for was on the assumption that we would have an increase of 5 per cent. or 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were probably wrong in our assumption.  It is easier to make this thing clear by dealing first with the small licensed curers.  When I went into the case I asked for the figures of 1934.  That was before the Pigs and Bacon Bill was being discussed in any way.  I got from the Revenue Commissioners the information I asked for, and I found that amongst five small curers there were a great many months throughout the year, in the case of each one of the five, whose names were indicated, when their actual production was under 200 cwts. per month.  That may be due to various causes.  Some of the small curers who came to me gave me cases why that was so, and the reasons they gave me were very convincing.  I think it would be unfair to stick to the strict letter of the law, as it were, and say to them: &ldquo;When you had free competition, no restriction whatsoever, you did not, in fact, do more than 200 cwts. per month, and why ask for a guarantee now?&rdquo; They gave <Col N="1724" /> very good reasons why it was not done at the time.  The reasons were convincing, and therefore we should try to do something on the lines suggested. It would appear at first sight to be fair on these figures if we were to put into this Bill that no small curer should be asked to go below 200 cwts. per month.  In that way we would have brought them up in these five cases to as good a position as they themselves held in 1934 when there was free competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we dealing now with the small curer and the minor curer as two separate cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the five smallest licenced curers.  It will be easy to deal with the minor curers afterwards.  I said we would have done them justice if we put into this Bill that we would guarantee them at least 200 pigs per month.  I am accepting the argument put up by Deputy Dillon, as everybody appears to accept it, that it is much harder on a small man to go down 30 per cent. on his production than it would be in the case of the big man.  They cannot lay off part of their staff the same as the big man could. In the case of the small man he would have to lay them all off or none.  That is largely true, and, therefore, it is a great hardship on these small men.  On the other hand, what would appear to be just on paper is often not the case when you hear all the circumstances stated.  I did meet some of the small curers and had talks with them and, as a result, I would be inclined to ask the Dáil to agree to an amendment on the Report Stage that would compel the Bacon Board to allocate at least 300 cwts. of bacon to each curer, whatever the circumstances might be.  That would mean, in fact, that during the months of scarcity they would be guaranteed 300 cwts.  During the good months, the months of plenty, they would get more.  Their output would not be 3,600 cwts. per year, but it would probably come somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 cwts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then 3,600 would be the minimum guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If we put such an <Col N="1725" /> amendment into this Bill the minor curers, when they become qualified on the 1st of April, 1938, would automatically come under the same ruling. If we put that amendment in, then under the Principal Act the minor curer who becomes a licensee must get the same allocation as the smallest licensee.  Each minor curer, therefore, automatically comes under the same rule.  If we put the amendment in, each licensed curer would get at least 300 cwts. per month.  Perhaps he would get a little more.  For the present year I think they would all have at least a little more than the 300 cwts. during the autumn and the minor curers would come in for the same allocation as the rest.</P>
      <P>Let me now come to the minor curers. We have 18 of them.  I do not know if they will all qualify and become licensed curers.  It is quite possible some of them will say that they have not the necessary capital to equip factories and become licensed curers, and they may decide to go out.  Suppose they were all to come in, I will give you an idea of what would happen.  In 1934, before there was any restriction, these 18 minor curers produced 11,800 cwts. of bacon between them.  In 1936, when they were unrestricted in the buying of pigs and when the licensed curers were restricted, the figure went to 33,800.  They trebled the business between 1934 and 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And you know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons why.  If we apply the rule of 300 cwts., and if they all come in, that will go to at least double.  They did three times as much business last year as when there was no restriction, and if we apply the minimum rule to them all we would automatically give them double what they had in 1936. I think that is pretty generous treatment and I do not think they could have any complaint to make against us if we were to provide that for them.  I think the small licensed curers would be at least happier than they were with the knowledge that we would guarantee them 300 cwts. per month.  I do not say they are satisfied; it is very hard to satisfy <Col N="1726" /> everyone; but they are very much happier than they were, and they would be, I think, justly treated  we agreed to that amendment.  C tainly, the minor curers will have  complaint when they get six ti as much in 1938 as they had in  when they could do as much as they liked.  I suggest that if the Deputy will withdraw his amendment, I could undertake to introduce an amendment on Report to guarantee a minimum of 300 cwts. per month to all licensed curers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, that every minor curer who opts to become a licensed small curer will be guaranteed a minimum allocation of 300 cwts. a month?  I am prepared to accept that undertaking.  It might be well to consider whether the form of my amendment is not better.  My amendment allows the Minister to fix the minimum from time to time by Order and lay the Order on the Table of the House.  If you incorporate the minimum in the Bill you might want to change it some other time and that would mean an amending Bill, whereas if you take power to fix it by Order, to fix the minimum at a certain figure, it amounts to the same thing and it provides an easier procedure to meet the changes of commerce. However, that is a minor point.  As regards the Minister's undertaking, I consider he has now done substantial justice to the minor curers and, so far as I am concerned, I accept it as a reasonable guarantee to the minor curer of security and permanence in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am saying to the Minister that he would be wise to take my plan.  If he fixes the minimum by Act of Parliament it cannot be changed except by an amending Bill.  The Minister might want to raise the minimum hereafter, and if he wants to raise it by just a few pigs he will have <Col N="1727" /> to bring in an amending Bill to do so, whereas if he adopts my amendment the procedure will mean merely the laying of an Order on the Table of the House.  If Deputy Davin wants to tie up the Minister, then let him support the Minister's method of fixing the minimum.  The method the Minister proposes is much more rigid than the way I propose.  If you want to tie up the Minister, support the Minister's method of doing it.  I see that difficulties might arise but, as I say, I am quite content with my method with the Minister's public undertaking.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 122 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 123, as on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>In Section 6, sub-section 1º (ii), page 86, to delete from and including the words &ldquo;Laws, however may be enacted to prevent or control meetings&rdquo;, down to and including the words &ldquo;House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the form in which the amendment was originally sent in.  It appears on the amendment paper in the form in which it is, through mistake.  In this amendment, an attempt is being made to effect what was also aimed at in the last amendment&mdash;to have the principle definitely and clearly enunciated and to take away the limitations which are imposed on the principle after it has been stated.  I have argued before that even the turn of phrase that has been adopted and the emphasis laid on the exception would make me move, if there were no other reasons, to have some change made in the presentation of the exceptions, if there are to be any exceptions.  As the Article stands, you have certain matters guaranteed.  The guarantee is all the time under and subject to public order and morality but, in addition to that, laws may be enacted to prevent or control meetings which are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public.  I understand that the law, as decided by cases, at present enables any meeting which tends towards a breach of the peace to be controlled, because the right is subject to public order.  I do not know what this new phrase about being a &ldquo;nuisance to the general public&rdquo; means.  If there is to be any expression of a principle guaranteeing the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, we should not encroach on that right by the enactment of such a vague phrase as might be interpreted in a very peculiar way, indeed. You may prevent&mdash;you may also control&mdash;meetings if they are calculated to be a nuisance to the general public. There is no necessity to enlarge on the dangers which must immediately start to the mind by getting that phrase put into the context.  The Government sets out solemnly to give a right to peaceable assembly and assembly without arms.</P>
      <P>They seek to have that right controlled by and subject to public order and morality and to weaken it still further by providing that laws may be enacted to prevent meetings if they are calculated to be a nuisance to the general public.  If that phrase is to be put in, it would be better to leave this constitutional right in the air. The emphasis laid on the exceptions takes away any value there may be in the statement of the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Draft goes on further to say: &ldquo;Laws may be enacted for the regulation and control of open air meetings so as to ensure that they will not interfere unduly with public convenience and for the prohibition or regulation of meetings in the vicinity <Col N="1731" /> of the place of meeting of either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  We have had certain experience both of public meetings spontaneously gathered and public meetings engineered for special purposes. Can it be said that in such experience, in the 15 years the State has been running, of meetings called in the vicinity of the meeting-place of either House of the Oireachtas there is anything which makes it imperative that the Constitution should contain a phrase enabling laws to be passed for this purpose?  Again, if it is not possible, under the general restriction of public order and morality, to pass laws to regulate public meetings in the way of ensuring that they will not interfere unduly with public convenience, there should be some explicit statement of how far it is intended this exception should be pushed.  I call attention again in that context to the generality of the language&mdash;&ldquo;laws may be enacted for the regulation and control&rdquo;. If it is possible to pass a law for control, the control may be exercised to such a point as to result in prohibition.  Is it thought to be compatible with the general statement about assembling peaceably for the expression of opinion that laws could be so enacted as to prevent meetings on the ground that they interfered with public convenience?  I think the statement of all these exceptions, when they are analysed, goes to show very definitely that the statement of the principle is only put in because it is not considered politic at this time to limit the right of public meeting, as the President would like to have it done. The statement of principle, flanked by these exceptions, is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to repeat what I said in connection with this clause on a previous amendment, namely, that the purpose here is not to allow these exceptions to lie in some law reports, but to indicate clearly to citizens who read the Constitution that the right of public assembly peaceably and without arms is guaranteed to them.  The right of public assembly is a natural right, but here there is an indication to show that laws may be enacted to safeguard the State from the improper use of that <Col N="1732" /> right, and I think it is all to the good that that should be stated explicitly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the President uncivilly interrupted me this evening, I was labouring this very point.  Here we have the frills and the furbelows which the President has seen fit, in the silence of his own room, to drape around a constitutional right which is becoming so gravely menaced.  How do you assert your constitutional right?  As I see it, the way in which we would assert it in regard to this particular Article is that, if we were prosecuted under an Act of Parliament which had been enacted for doing a certain thing which we held we were entitled to do under the general principle of &ldquo;the right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms,&rdquo; we would plead that, even if we had committed an offence against the Act of Parliament cited against us, it had no validity inasmuch as it purported to take away from us the right of the citizen to assemble peaceably without arms guaranteed under Article 40 that we are now discussing. The reply of the State to that would be: &ldquo;We admit that right was guaranteed, but we direct the attention of the Court to the following reservations, and the State would argue that these reservations were not put in for the purpose of telling Tom Smith of Ballydehob what the meaning of the Constitution was, but that they were enshrined in the fundamental law for the direction of the courts: to ensure that no citizen would plead the bare words of the Constitution for the purpose of misleading the &ldquo;courts.&rdquo; Surely I am right in saying that all that is in the Constitution is there for the direction of the courts when the courts come to stand between the citizen and the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is idle for the President to get up and say these words are not in the Constitution for the purpose of finding their way into the law reports: that they are being put into the Constitution in order to inform the plain people of the meaning of the document that we are considering.  You cannot put words into the body of a Constitution to explain to the plain people the technical meaning of the Articles of a Constitution, and you ought not to try to do it.  If you desire, and you should <Col N="1733" /> desire, to inform the people most exhaustively of all the implications of the Constitution, the way to do that is to go out to the country and make speeches about each separate Article, if you think the people are interested in it, or else send out to the people pamphlets explaining each Article to them.  But every word that is incorporated in this Constitution will get its significance when it is tested in a court of law by a citizen who is defending himself from some unjustifiable tyranny which is attempted against him either by the State or by his neighbour.</P>
    <P>What I urge on the President is this: that you cannot apply to this document the ordinary rules of colloquial interpretation because those are not the rules of interpretation that will be applied to it when this Constitution matters to an individual citizen of the State.  Is there any danger in this day and age to give the citizens of this country the right to assemble peaceably and without arms without qualification? I do not see any danger whatever arising.  If citizens assemble peaceably, and I do not see how they could assemble peaceably if they were to assemble contrary to &ldquo;public order and public morality&rdquo;, but even if they managed to do that, the opening words of Section 6 govern the whole paragraph, so that it is quite open to the State to say: &ldquo;While we admit that the citizen's exterior conduct was peaceable, and while we admit that he bore no arms, the reason we prosecute and the reason we enact this law is because we propose to prove that his purpose in assembling was contrary to &lsquo;public order and morality,&rsquo; and in so far as that is true we legislate against him, and it is in so far as that is true that we now prosecute him.&rdquo;  But if you so qualify it, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, you virtually take away from him the right to assemble peaceably and without arms.</P>
    <P>Remember, if you put nothing in the Constitution at all, there is no law in this country to prevent people meeting solemnly together.  There is no law in Great Britain giving people the absolute right to do it, but there is an unwritten convention that the historic <Col N="1734" /> liberties of the British people include the right to assemble and protest provided they do not seek to overthrow the State by violence.  In this country, in the absence of a direct negation of that, that right obtains.  I do not argue against the State setting out the right if you are going to have a written Constitution, but what I do submit is, that if you deem it expedient to set out the right in so many words, set it out without reservations other than the reservation contained in the first paragraph relating to &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;.  If you set it out with these reservations, then, far from enlarging the fundamental rights of the citizen, you are going, in practice, when this Constitution comes to be impleaded in the courts of law, and the courts of law are the only place where this Constitution can be of any use to anybody, instead of guaranteeing rights by the terms of this Constitution you are going gravely to limit them.  I do not believe that is the intention of the President.  But this throws a flood of light on his attitude to this whole Constitution. The qualifying words which are complained of are not intended, he says, to moulder in the law reports but to inform the ordinary citizen of the meaning of the general statement.  If that is the purpose of those words, then they ought not to appear in the body of this document.  It is no place for them.  This document must be interpreted for the citizen in the courts of law.  If you want to explain it to the individual citizen go and do so on the hustings or by means of pamphlets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that when construing the rights set out for the ordinary citizen in this Section of Article 40, we must constantly have advertence to the fact that the overriding restriction on all the liberties which are supposed to be guaranteed is that they are subject to &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo;  It seems to me, therefore, as I said on a previous amendment, that it is quite unnecessary for the President to carry right through this section a catalogue of restrictions which, far from enhancing the rights which it purports to convey, in fact seriously restricts the value of those rights, and actually raises the <Col N="1735" /> question whether we are not, in fact, cutting down rights as they exist at the present time.</P>
      <P>We have had a long discussion as to the widespread character of the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; in Section 6 (1).  Many speakers have emphasised the fact that these two provisions are reasonably restrictive without imposing any other restrictions such as are set out in Section 1 of the Article.  Apparently, however, not satisfied with setting out very definite and widespread restrictions in the first part of Section 6, the President goes on even to intensify these restrictions in the section we are now discussing.  He sets out a declaration to the effect that one of the rights guaranteed to citizens is the right to assemble peaceably and without arms.  That is a right which, as far as citizens are concerned, always has been interpreted as a natural right: something which they had a right to exercise inherently and something which the Legislature up to the present has never deemed it desirable to interfere with.  Here in this country where we are so prone to wreck the meetings of our political opponents, and where organised violence is allowed relatively free rein to carry out that kind of wrecking policy at public meetings, one would imagine that such a phrase as would follow the guarantee of the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms would be one which would indicate that laws would be passed to ensure this.  Instead, however, what we are doing is: we are setting out a declaration giving the citizens the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, and then we are going to have at the same time, if we so desire, laws to prevent or control meetings which are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to direct particular attention to the provision &ldquo;to prevent&rdquo; in this sub-section.  It says that laws may be passed to prevent meetings&mdash;not meetings which are a breach of the peace or which are a danger or a nuisance to the general public, but meetings which are calculated to cause a breach of the peace, <Col N="1736" /> which are calculated to be a danger, or which are calculated to be a public nuisance.  That seems to me to presuppose the enactment of legislation giving to the Government and to the State a widespread power of proscription over meetings which citizens may desire to hold.</P>
    <P>Mind you, it is not necessary that anybody should be satisfied that a breach of the peace or a danger or a public nuisance may occur.  All that is necessary is that somebody should be satisfied that a meeting is calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger and a public nuisance, and, of course, it is quite easy for any Minister to state, in the language of an official proclamation, that he believes that the holding of a meeting of a particular kind is calculated to lead to a breach of the peace or to be a nuisance or a danger.  Unfortunately, most of our large political meetings&mdash;particularly at election times&mdash;are calculated to be a nuisance.  Most of them are calculated to be a danger.  Not an inconsiderable number of them are calculated to lead to a breach of the peace; and if an Executive Council is going to draw up a law adhering rigidly to the phraseology used in this section, then we might reach a stage&mdash;because we must have advertence to these three factors&mdash; where it would be almost impossible to hold any meetings, because almost any meeting in the height of an election is calculated to give rise to one or other of the difficulties set out in this particular section.</P>
    <P>Whether intended or not, I think that this is a very definite attempt to restrict the right of the citizens to hold public meetings.  One might understand a provision that laws may be enacted to control meetings, thereby ensuring that the State would use such forces as are at its command to prevent, for instance, a meeting developing into a riot; but where the State takes power to prevent a meeting from being held, it seems to me to be an unwarranted invasion of the rights which citizens at present have.  I suggest to the President that the manner in which this particular <Col N="1737" /> section is phrased is, in his own language, calculated to give the Executive Government of the day a power which they ought not to get; that it ought to be sufficient if there is power to control meetings&mdash;not to control them in the interests of the people who want to break them up, but to control them in the interests of citizens who want to assemble peaceably and to express their views. Instead of that there is power to prevent a meeting, which means that if, for example, a number of law-abiding people propose to hold a meeting in the City of Dublin and it appears to the Executive Council that somebody is going there to break up the meeting and that their intentions may lead to a breach of the peace, or that they may be a nuisance to pedestrians or motor-car users in the vicinity of the meeting, then there is power to prevent the holding of the meeting, and in fact there is what amounts to a concession to those who want to obstruct the holding of the meeting.  I suggest that the President should look at this section again with a view to seeing that it does not give power to prevent meetings on the flimsy grounds set out here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I see nothing to object to in this.  It seems to me that occasions do arise when it is the duty of the Government to prevent meetings. I am rather particularly surprised that Deputy Norton should appear to challenge that principle, because there have been occasions when Labour Parties have been particularly active to support that principle. I wonder, for example, if, at the time Sir Oswald Mosley was trying to hold Fascist meetings in the Jewish quarters in Whitechapel, Deputy Norton would take the view that such meetings should not be prevented.</P>

      <P>The real objection to this example is, not that it is English, but that it is apposite.  That is the real objection to it.  It is an illustration of the sort of danger that can be created by giving an unlimited right to hold public meetings.  Once again Deputy Norton has argued as if the main protection against tyranny of every kind lay in the terms of a written Constitution.  It does not.  If the time came that a Government was using its powers illegitimately, those of us who do not think such provisions as these dangerous would be as strong in our criticism of the Government as Deputy Norton himself could possibly be.  As I see it, the main point of these qualifications here is that if you left the sentence, &ldquo;The right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms,&rdquo; by itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit that the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; goes a very long way to satisfy one's fears.  On the other hand, however, it seems to me that the objections to these sub-sections are making a mountain out of a mole-hill.  Like so many other things in the Constitution, these are some platitudinous general principles that are intended to be a <Col N="1739" /> sort of statement of the national philosophy. A great many of them seem to do no particular good and to do no particular harm, but certainly some observations that Deputy Norton made seem to me to have a definitely dangerous tendency.  We are deceiving ourselves if we suppose that the right to assemble, even with the qualifications &ldquo;peaceably and without arms&rdquo; is a right that is quite absolute and that the State may not interfere with that right in order to prevent a breach of the peace.</P>

      <P>For any reasons. If I misunderstood the Deputy I am sorry.  I just want to make the point that Labour members in England, and for that matter recently the extreme Labour people in Paris, have made a special point of prohibiting meetings of extremist bodies in districts that are violently hostile to the opinions held by these extremist bodies on the ground that they might cause a breach of the peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have an Article here which pretends to give certain rights and to guarantee certain rights to the individual, namely, the right of free assembly without arms, subject, and only subject, to public order and morality.  The Article starts off to guarantee those rights, but before we have read through a quarter <Col N="1740" /> of a page we find that none of these rights is left to the individual.  If the President is so very nervous about the conduct of the ordinary citizens in the State, why go in for this sham and humbug?  Why not remove the whole lot, not guarantee anything, and leave the people to meet subject to the notion of what is safe or unsafe of the police officer controlling the district, because in fact that is what you are doing?  You are guaranteeing that the people will be allowed to meet without arms provided that no agent of the Government is the least bit uneasy as to the consequences.  If there is any uneasiness or any doubt with regard to the consequences of that meeting, then the authority is there to prevent the meeting.  Can the President or Deputy MacDermot give us any example nearer than Paris where it is necessary so to restrict the ordinary, commonly understood rights of a people who claim to be free and who detest tyranny?  There is no meeting that was ever held, or that ever will be held, where any responsible person is going to give a certificate in advance that there will not be a breach of the peace. Breaches of the peace come, not from those holding the meeting, and not from those organising the meeting, but from other elements.  The victims of this clause are going to be the people who organise meetings.  It will be sufficient for any &ldquo;tough&rdquo; or rowdy to stick up a notice round the parish that if such-and-such a meeting is held the following Sunday, it will be broken up; and then the constitutional rights declared in the earlier part of the Article are to go by the board, and the organisers of that meeting will find that they have no constitutional rights.</P>

      <P>There may be other opinions on the matter.  I am merely giving my view that the opening sentence of the section &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo; would override the right.  I believe that would be sufficient to prevent the holding of a Communist meeting at the gates of Maynooth.  However, it shows the weakness of the defence of this Article when we have to get such an extreme example as that to justify it, no matter from where the defence comes.  What hits me in the eye in this Article is that the Article is taking from the people any rights which they consider they have at the present moment and what you are leaving to the people, if this Article goes through in its present form, is the right of citizens to assemble occasionally, without arms, provided nobody considers that there is any element of risk, danger or any possibility of the meeting becoming a nuisance to the public.  With the exception of meetings held in the middle of one of the great stretches in the Phoenix Park, can anybody think of any public meeting anywhere that is not to a greater or lesser extent a public nuisance, not only to the participants but to the person going the street or the road?  Every public meeting held in a public place, certainly held in a street, on a road or at a cross-roads, can rightly be regarded as a nuisance to the public and while we are guaranteeing the right of the public to assemble peaceably and without arms, if this section goes through as it stands, we are taking from the people any rights whatsoever they may have at the moment to assemble peaceably and without arms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy MacDermot is again going to assert that I am becoming personal with regard to him, but there is another reason which is at the root of all the weakness which Deputy MacDermot displays in debates on these matters, and I am going to state that reason again.  The President talked about people who were enmeshed in civilisation. For good or for evil, I believe that Deputy Norton and myself are enmeshed in the civilisation of this country for the rest of our lives. Deputy MacDermot is not.  If I were talking about the laws which I thought should be passed for Alberta I should take an aloof attitude on that.  I would not have the fears about what was going to happen in Alberta that a citizen of Alberta would have.  When you find yourself rooted here, when you know that you are going to live under the laws made here, and that you cannot flee from them, you will get a far bigger respect for the written Constitution <Col N="1743" /> when it is in the making than you would have if you knew that by your own free will you could clear away from the mess when the mess occurred. That is my explanation to myself, sincerely made, of the aloof, detached and calm way in which Deputy MacDermot can view all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me just explain one danger.  I want to get this phrase cut out.  If I do, what is left?  That the Constitution gives us the right to assemble. How?  Peaceably and without arms. If any law is passed to restrict that right, it will be subject to my or somebody else being able to take it to the courts to get the view of an independent judiciary as to whether it is contrary to public order and morality. There is the situation I would like to have left as the real situation, and Deputy Norton&mdash;with some hesitation perhaps about the words &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;&mdash;would agree to that.  Instead, we are offered this. We have the right given to us to assemble.  Then there is, first of all, the restriction that it must be peaceably and without arms.  There is the further restriction that it must be subject to public order and morality, and the court will decide on that.  Then we open the door wide open with this phrase.  A law may be passed; remember that when a law is passed it is not subject to the limitation that it must be a carrying out of the term &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;  It is something inside that.  It is something narrower than that.  A law may be passed to do the variety of things that are here.  A law may be passed, say, that the Minister for Justice, from reports made to him by the responsible officer of the Guards for the district, may determine beforehand that a particular meeting is calculated to be a nuisance to the general public, and that law cannot be contested as being unconstitutional. If we had the right to contest the prohibition of that meeting which occurred under that law, on the grounds that it narrowed the constitutional right which was only limited by the term &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo;, then we would be all right. But once we give to the Dáil under the Constitution the right to pass laws <Col N="1744" /> to prevent meetings calculated to cause a breach of the peace, to control meetings calculated to cause a breach of the peace, to prevent meetings calculated to be a danger or nuisance to the general public, and to control meetings calculated to be a danger or a nuisance to the general public, I wonder does anybody believe that much of the right remains?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot says there may be occasions upon which it would be the proper thing to have a law to stop a meeting which is going to be a nuisance, and a desperate nuisance. Let us take it that it is something which cannot be caught by any of the other phrases; let us put it at the worst possible limit of nuisance. Weigh the two things in the balance. Should you whittle away the constitutional right to assemble peaceably because you can conceive of an occasion on which a meeting might be a nuisance, and so bad a nuisance that somebody ought to have the right to stop it?  Is it well to cater for that type of occasion&mdash;which will be seldom, I think&mdash;to the extent of whittling away your constitutional right, or is it better to have the nuisance now and again and to keep the right?  Surely there can be no doubt as to where the vote will be cast if that is the test?</P>
    <P>We are not done with the Article at that point.  First there is the principle in regard to the right of assembly.  Then there is the restriction that it must be peaceably and without arms.  Secondly, it is subject to public order and morality.  Thirdly, it is subject to a law passed to prevent a meeting calculated to cause a breach of the peace, or to control a meeting calculated to cause a breach of the peace.  It is subject to a law passed to prevent a meeting calculated to be a danger to the public, or to control a meeting calculated to be a danger to the public.  It is subject to a law passed giving somebody power to prevent or control a meeting calculated to be a nuisance.  It is subject to a law which may be enacted so to regulate or control an open-air meeting as to ensure that it will not interfere unduly with public convenience, and, finally, there is <Col N="1745" /> going to be a right to prohibit or regulate any meeting in the vicinity of either House of the Oireachtas. There you have not merely taken away the skin and the hair, the fur and the feathers of the right; you have broken the back of it.  You have completely taken away whatever there was of a right when you have gone through this list of things.  Is it right to whittle away your constitutional right for the sake of the odd occasion there might be in which power to pass laws of this kind might be a defence?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot put the extreme example of the Communist meeting held outside Maynooth.  Deputy O'Higgins gave us his point of view that it would be permissible to prohibit that on the grounds of public order and morality.  I do not know whether it would or not.  But it would be neither Deputy O'Higgins, nor myself, nor the Government who would decide that.  The Government of the day might decide to prohibit such a meeting, and if the Article of the Constitution were left as it is my hope it should be left, it would be for the court to determine whether that meeting was caught by the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>It may be in the last resort the judiciary, if the Ministry passed a law giving them power to prohibit a meeting because it is a nuisance, and through some flaw in the Act it did not do that correctly.  But supposing they had passed an Act which cannot be challenged on any technical grounds, and they give their Minister power to prohibit a meeting which in his opinion is calculated to create a nuisance, you cannot challenge that on the grounds of unconstitutionality.  What we are offered here is a constitutional right. Here is your right; here are the limitations. We are going to give the Government power to control or prevent meetings on the various grounds set out, and those laws when passed cannot be challenged as unconstitutional. That is the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already gone over the question of liberty, and the abuse of liberty, in connection with the other section, and what I said then applies here.  One speaker said that I wanted this simply for the education of the average citizen, and that I was forgetting that it had to be interpreted by the courts.  Of course, I am not forgetting that, but I think it is very much better to state, as far as is possible, explicitly what limitations and what powers are being left to the Legislature of the future.  Deputy McGilligan would like to tie us up, and to tie up the Government of the day.  If it was obvious to an Executive, which had the responsibility of maintaining peace and order, that certain meetings were going to provoke public disorder, they could not stop them.  That would be a ridiculous position to allow, or to consider as a possibility for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the primary duties of a Government is to see that order is preserved. Some years ago when Deputy McGilligan wanted to do it, he and his colleagues could not think of anything less crude than Article 2A, leaving the Executive absolute power. You cannot put Article 2A into the Constitution any time you want to do so.  You must look to the future.  If what happened in other countries might happen here the powers the <Col N="1747" /> Executives were given in other countries to maintain order should, if necessary, be at the disposal at least of the Legislature.  The power to prevent such meetings will have to be determined by law.  Whatever body is given the right of decision in law will have to be satisfied that a breach of the peace is, in fact, likely to occur.</P>
    <P>We have to choose between two dangers, the danger of abuse by the Executive or the danger of public order being completely destroyed. The safer thing is that Parliament which is elected by the votes of the people, who have control of those who represent them, should be given the responsibility in the name of the people.  One of their duties will be to maintain order, and to do whatever is necessary for the maintenance of order.  It ought to be possible for the Legislature of the day to take these measures.  There is no use in giving the right, or in indicating that citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms or saying that that right is guaranteed, subject to being properly exercised, when, forsooth, those who have to make up their minds are likely to be tyrannical or likely to abuse their powers.  All you can do is to try to secure that those elected to representative positions will not abuse their powers.  You have no other way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these provisions are necessary here.  What are they? To prevent meetings which might cause a breach of the peace.  Someone stated that instead of stopping meetings the Executive should look after those likely to interfere with meetings.  That might be the wrong line for an Executive to take.  The forces at its disposal might not be sufficient.  It might be better in the general interest that the meetings should not take place, rather than have, for example, a violent collision in the streets of the city, which was beyond the power of the forces of the Executive to control.  That could happen.  In the first instance, if a meeting that was being held was legitimate they could protect it to the <Col N="1748" /> utmost limit of their power.  It is only in a case where it was beyond their power to do that and where the forces at their command were not sufficient, or generally where the public interest demanded that the meeting should not be held, that this law should permit them to take action.  As to the control of meetings, it is obvious that the police ought to a certain extent be able to deal with them.  If a meeting was held across the tramlines at a busy hour in the middle of the day, it might be the duty of the police officer to insist on the meeting being held in a place nearby, where it would not be a nuisance to the public.  Then we have these words, &ldquo;breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the regulation and control of open-air meetings so as to ensure that they will not interfere unduly with public convenience.&rdquo; Does anybody deny that it is not advisable to deal with these matters?  You must remember that in these cases you have responsible people, who can be called to account for their actions, and who will be open to public criticism, while, on the other hand, you have people outside who might be quite irresponsible.</P>

If it is to be guarded by the phrase &ldquo;public order&rdquo;, a law which would prevent a meeting being held at a busy time of the day athwart the tram lines would be held by the courts as being ruled by the phrase &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  The President does not want that.  Of course, the hopeless part of this&mdash;it is against my own argument&mdash; is that that law would only be tested after the event, because the meeting would be over.  But you can stop a recurrence.  If you leave the constitutional right and simply say it is subject to &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;, you will have an independent point of view expressed as to whether or not the prohibition of a certain meeting is ruled by that phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;.  The President does not want the courts to be butting into this matter, or to have any interference from the courts.</P>

      <P>Possibly I did.  I do not say that everything in the old Constitution was right, but it was open to amendment in the easiest possible way, and this is not going to be.  As long as there was a constitutional right guarded by the phrase &ldquo;order and morality&rdquo;, anything in the way of a law in a constitutional amendment that came then underneath the Constitution could be tested by the constitutional phrase, and in the way in which the Constitution had to be tested&mdash;by an independent judiciary.  I put that as the test.  The division between us is that, on the one hand, you have the phrase that, by decided cases, has been brought to the point that would even meet what Deputy Norton urged as an objection to this Article, because there have been cases in which it was decided that the law of the day was allowed to prohibit meetings because an unruly body was likely to cause a breach of the peace&mdash;not people holding the meeting. I do not know whether that case will be followed, but it is there.  The great thing about having the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;, is that you do not have an Executive interested <Col N="1752" /> in getting a meeting stopped.  The sole judges of whether there is likely to be a breach of the peace or a nuisance to the public will be an outside body.  Undoubtedly, at the very end, the test is, what is the mentality you want to operate upon the exercise of this right?  Is it the judiciary or the Government of the day?  The President's last phrase was that he did not think that Government should deny itself the power.</P>

Do we think it right to deny to a Government powers with regard to the prohibition of meetings, and therefore to take away this constitutional right of peaceable assembly&mdash;deny powers that will not be caught by the phrase &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo;?  It is a good test.  There are a lot of decisions upon it.  We will have an independent Irish point of view operating on the words.  Finally, will the President tell me if there is a single Constitution in the world which has a phrase in it like this giving power to enact laws under the Constitution as to what is calculated to be a nuisance to the general public? I doubt if there is such a phrase anywhere.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand, from the reasons given by the President for the maintenance of restrictions in the various Articles in the Constitution, why he troubled to write such a long Constitution at all.  The philosophy of the President on this Article, as we saw on the question of the special courts yesterday evening, and on every other question which has been raised, is that you must trust the Executive.  The people must make sure that they do not elect anybody who may do any harm to them.  If that is the mentality of the President, then I say this Constitution could have been written on a postcard.  Then there need be only one single Article and only one declaration, and that would be that: &ldquo;The people render all obedience and loyalty to the Executive Council, and the Executive Council <Col N="1754" /> will look after their various needs and regulate and provide for public conduct.&rdquo;  That is essentially the view point of the President.  He told us yesterday that he disliked intensely a particular piece of legislation imposed over five years ago.  He did not know how other people would use it, but he had a deep, abiding faith in himself and he consequently knew that he would not abuse the powers given him or that he would not cut himself with the tools.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand the President's abiding faith in himself.  I can understand that he feels he is a just man and can always be trusted to do the right and correct thing.  But I object to the President's mentality in that respect.  I am not prepared to give to anyone, human nature being the frail commodity it is, the power to exercise rights on behalf of every citizen in the community.  It is because I am not prepared to give the President the powers he claims, even though he claims that he will be infallible in the use of these powers, that I am opposed to this particular tag in Article 40.  That gives the Executive Council power to legislate down to very small matters.  It gives it power to legislate down to such matters as the holding of public meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Executive Council is given power to legislate down to the low level suggested in this particular section, we may find that a future Minister for Justice will have power to issue a proclamation preventing meetings which, in his opinion, are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or calculated to be a danger or to cause a nuisance. The Minister for Justice representing, let us say, a provincial constituency may think it would be calculated to be a nuisance to the general public, and to his friends amongst the general public if a very large public meeting were held in his constituency.  He may think it would be a very good ruse to say that a particular meeting being held in that constituency&mdash;&ldquo;my supporters being of the fiery character they are&rdquo;&mdash;may cause a breach of the peace and should be prevented.  I want to prevent any Minister having the <Col N="1755" /> power to regulate small matters of that kind in that particular way.  And I want to try to ensure, once you declare the rights of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms, that they will be entitled to exercise that right, and that it will not be within the power of the Minister to put a microscope on every particular meeting and to say, in respect of that particular meeting, that laws may be enacted to prevent or control it because it is calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public.</P>
    <P>I think the general power conferred by the State in the opening sentence of this section ought to be good enough, namely, that the State guarantees the liberty to assemble peaceably and without arms subject to public order and morality.  If the Minister takes it upon himself to proscribe a meeting which he thinks ought not to be held, having regard to the desirability of maintaining public order, then that meeting will not be held.  But the ordinary citizen in that circumstance can go to the court and say: &ldquo;This meeting was in no way calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or a nuisance to the general public, and it was just an exercise of spite on the part of the Minister that induced him to proscribe this particular meeting.&rdquo;  In that case the courts would have power to say to the citizen: &ldquo;Yes, you had a perfect right to hold that meeting and the issue of a proclamation proscribing that meeting under that type of legislation was an invasion of your rights.&rdquo;  In such a case the Executive Council could not repeat the trick at the next election. I think that is a reasonable proposition from the standpoint of the Government and from the standpoint of the citizen.</P>
    <P>It is up to us to safeguard the citizen. The Executive Council can pretty well look after itself.  It is not right that we should enact a Constitution here which enables a future Minister for Justice to proscribe meetings by advertence to the factors mentioned in this section, none of which is of any great importance, having regard to the control <Col N="1756" /> and safeguard which the State has in the opening sentences of this section. Apparently even the President thinks there is even now too much liberty in this section, and on the next stage he will have an amendment apparently further restricting such right as is conferred here upon the citizen.  I think if this section is enacted the citizen in the future may well petition Parliament asking that those co-called rights which are supposed to be conveyed to him should be removed because he will have much less liberty if this is passed than he has at the moment so far as public meetings are concerned.</P>

      <P>My view is that he will have very much more liberty, and that if the legislature is to be completely denied the power to make laws to enable it to deal with abuses, then there will be little freedom for anybody. It is in defence of freedom this is done&mdash;not closing the doors and preventing the Legislature passing laws to meet situations which may possibly arise.  There has been talk about Constitutions in other countries. I have some of them here.  This is the Constitution of the Polish Republic. Article 108 says: &ldquo;Citizens have the right to meet by association as well as common exercise of opinion; the application of these rights is regulated by law.&rdquo;  Under a provision of that sort the door is open to do anything you want.  In the Belgian Constitution, Article 19, the Belgians have a &ldquo;right without previous authorisation to assemble peaceably and without arms and conform themselves to the laws which regulate the exercise of that right.&rdquo;  In other words, the exercise of the right is to be determined by law. &ldquo;This provision does not apply to assemblies in the open air which remain entirely under police laws.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Not at all.  There is enacted here quite clearly that there is the right normally and that the <Col N="1757" /> exercise of that right ought be normally free.  But we are living in a community or society.  Your society has arranged or is to arrange to govern itself and see that there is order, so that the individual citizen's freedom may be maintained and the good of society as a whole may be preserved.  We cannot close our eyes to what is the tradition in other countries and what it is necessary we should make provision for here.  We would be quite foolish to close the door in our Constitution.  It was all right when you could amend your Constitution by a piece of legislation, but we will not be in that position in a very short time.  Consequently, we want to see that the door is not closed against legislation that may be necessary. Deputy McGilligan has quite clearly indicated that the only difference between us is the question as to whether the right should be determined by, say, the Executive of the day; whether it should be arranged that it should be determined by the Executive of the day or by the courts.  That is, no doubt, a matter of very grave importance.  The question is whether, in these circumstances, the courts are the people best fitted to determine.  That is a matter on which there can be differences of opinion. There is nothing to prevent the law from arranging it in such wise, if they so wanted it, that the courts would have to determine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. I do not want to see the courts prohibited in advance or to see the Legislature prohibited in advance from arranging by law that, if the circumstances demand it, the Executive that is immediately responsible for law and order and that will have most information as to the situation, should have the power to determine.  The question is, are we going to close the door and create a new situation?  I think it would be unwise to do it.  It has been suggested that these clauses are sufficiently wide in themselves, but my present feeling is that it is very much better that it should be explicitly set <Col N="1758" /> down in the Constitution and not hidden away in some law report.  I think it should be explicitly set down in the Constitution so that every citizen may know the rights given to him.</P>
      <P>I think it is right that the State, the Legislature, the Executive, should have the power in the public interest to prevent, for instance, a meeting which it was satisfied was going to provoke a breach of the peace, when the Government might not have forces sufficient at their disposal to control that meeting, and I think it should be in a position to regulate meetings also. It is quite understandable that there should be a difference of view.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 124:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 6, sub-section 1º, to delete paragraph iii.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have much the same point of view on this as on the previous amendment, and I think the arguments are very much in line with those used on the previous amendment with regard to the right of citizens to express their convictions.  I object here definitely to the limitation in respect of the right of the citizen to form associations or unions.  It is subject to public order and morality by the preamble and yet it is thought necessary to put in here that &ldquo;laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the foregoing rights.&rdquo;  Here, at any rate, there is not the same detailed objection there was to the last, because there are not so many grounds of exceptions stated in detail, but there is still the big point of difference that there is constitutional right to form associations and unions, and if that is subject to public order and morality, the courts will decide whether any law passed to regulate and control this right is constitutional or not.  When, however, the same Constitution, inside the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; and, therefore, as a further limitation on it, enacts that laws may be passed for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of that <Col N="1761" /> right, it seems to me to leave it open to this: that the Government of the day may persuade a legislative body in which it has a majority to pass laws which will enable the determination of the public interest to be made by the Executive.  That, I think, is wrong.  If that public interest were to be a matter to be adjudicated on by an independent judiciary outside, and if the question of the public interest were to be ruled as the words &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; would be ruled, it is on a different footing; but I conceive that when you have as a limitation &ldquo;public order and morality,&rdquo; and then, inside it, as a constitutional provision, leave taken to have laws passed to regulate the exercise of the foregoing right in the public interest, it means that the public interest will be judged on each occasion by the standard of whatever is the view of the Government that gets the laws passed.  I think that is a complete and entire abrogation of the right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of difference here is the same as before, and I do not think we will get anywhere by arguing.  It is necessary in the public interest to have that right.  For example, we might have an arrangement for the restriction of trade which was clearly not in the public interest, and, if you did not have some provision like this, the right to form an association of that sort would be asserted, although it was clearly not in the public interest.  Again, this is simply leaving the door open so that Legislatures of the future, in whatever conditions may arise, may be able to step in, and, in the public interest and for the common good, say: &ldquo;Very well; this particular exercise of this right here would be detrimental to the community as a whole.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has used a phrase that throws very considerable light on the mentality behind this.  He says that, for instance, it might be possible, if that right were given in an untrammelled way, to form associations and unions to restrict trade.  If the President looks at the provisions of the Trade Union Acts, he will find that one of the definite rights given to trade unions is to restrict trade.  As a matter of fact, the ordinary structure of a trade union is based on the fact that it is given particular rights because of the normally non-legal character of its activities.  The President now says that it is, apparently, necessary to introduce laws so as to prevent any restriction of trade.  Let us examine that for a moment.  Trade unions in their efforts to secure improved wages or improved conditions for their members may find it necessary to engage in a dispute.  They may find it necessary to ask a semi-public undertaking like the Sugar Company, not too famous for paying good wages, or the Electricity Supply Board for improved wages or conditions. That may be held to be a restriction of trade, having regard to the significant phrase used by the President. If what the President said is to be interpreted literally, it would be possible to introduce a law to prevent a trade union taking such action as would be a restriction of trade in that instance. The President's viewpoint is extremely interesting in the light of a recent development.  I was informed recently that, in a trade dispute with the E.S.B. in the city, a police officer called on a secretary of a trade union, quoted him the terms of an Act of about 60 years ago, and said that, under the provisions of that Act it was an offence for a union or for anybody to act in restriction of the provision of gas, light or water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Take notice,&rdquo; said the police <Col N="1763" /> officer to the trade union official, &ldquo;if there is another strike in the E.S.B., we may find it necessary to prosecute you as the responsible official of the union for having anything to do with the strike.&rdquo;  That was a most amazing attitude for a police officer to adopt.  I do not know whether the police officer acted on his own responsibility or whether he was instructed to do so by the Department of Justice or by the Executive Council, but the incident throws an interesting light on the viewpoint of his superior officers&mdash;that a police officer should intimate to a trade union that if it exercises its normal and natural right to withdraw the labour of its members from an industrial undertaking, the union officials and the members who withdraw their labour may be prosecuted by a Free State Government under a British statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would raise that question on some other occasion, with the Minister responsible, it would be more appropriate. We are not now dealing with a British statute.  Obviously, the matter to which the Deputy refers concerns the administration of a Department, the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, with all respect, that the President's statement that it is undesirable to restrict trade and that we may have to legislate for a situation in which it is likely trade will be restricted must be taken with the police officer's recent dislike of the restriction of trade in order to get a picture of the mentality of the Executive Council responsible for the introduction of this Draft Constitution.  However, I have said sufficient regarding the police officer's activities to draw the attention of the House, and particularly the attention of those members of the House who are interested in the preservation of the rights which the trade union movement has under the law, to the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Draft Constitution is passed in its present form, it will be possible for the Legislature in the future to enact laws for the regulation of trade <Col N="1764" /> in the public interest and the exercise of the right of citizens to form associations and unions.  The statement now made by the President causes me even more uneasiness than I felt when I read this particular section in the Draft Constitution.  It is quite possible for the President, or for any future President, to come to the House with proposals for legislation calculated seriously to invade the rights which the trade unions have under the present law.  If the police officer was acting on instructions, apparently there is a mentality somewhere in Governmental circles which would like to restrict the activities of trade unions.  I am, therefore, opposed to the limitation contained in this section.  It has within it the possibility that the Legislature may be asked to enact legislation to restrict and fetter the rights of workers under existing Trade Union Acts.</P>
    <P>I suppose the President will say, as he said on other sections, that you must trust the Executive Council of the day.  I wonder where the trade union movement would be if it had always been content to trust the Government of the day.  It was not by trusting this President or that President, this head of a Government or that head of a Government, that it got its rights.  It has only been able to obtain its rights by long, bitter and intensified struggle. To advise trade unions to indulge in the pleasant contemplation that their future rights will be safeguarded by having faith in a President or Taoiseach is not a thing that will commend itself to these unions.  The President would be well advised not to insist on the insertion of this sentence qualifying the right as set out earlier.  This sentence has caused considerable misgiving to trade unions, and the unfortunate phrase used by the President in resisting this amendment is well calculated to intensify their fears.</P>

      <P>The Trade Union Acts guarantee the right of every worker to withdraw his labour in the course of an industrial dispute.  It would amaze me if it were contended by any Deputy that there was any restriction on the right of workers in semi-public undertakings, like the E.S.B. or the Sugar Company, to do so.

      <P>I listened with attention to Deputy Norton's account of his worries in connection with this provision. You could also apply that restriction to trade. The right could be exercised under this Constitution to bring about such a state of affairs that rationalisation or artificial restriction in surplus commodities or goods might be interfered with.  What Deputy <Col N="1766" /> Norton asserts in regard to trade unions, if it became legitimate, could also be applied to industries and trade, because very often it is necessary to have curtailment in trade or in a particular industry if you want to save that industry and do not want the whole bottom to fall out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has an amendment on the Order Paper&mdash; amendment No. 126&mdash;in which he proposes that &ldquo;in the interest of the community restrictions may be imposed by law on the formation and conduct of profit-making enterprises or associations&rdquo;.  The way we propose to deal with that amendment is to say that it is covered by this clause. There may be dangers in certain directions, and is the Legislature to be prevented from making laws in the interests of the community?  In the present social conditions are we to be told that the Legislature must not have that power: that every form of organisation and association, no matter whether it is in the public interest or not, must be allowed to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a question of wide public interest, and the Legislature may have to regulate, in the general public interest, the formation of associations of that kind. I think it would be unwise, in the present condition of things, to say that the Legislature must not be able to regulate the formation of associations when those associations conflict with the general public interest.  I think that we would be simply blinding ourselves to obvious facts if we did that.  Deputy Norton calls out for it in one case, but there may be other <Col N="1767" /> cases where the regulation of the formation of associations may have to be looked after in the public interest. Consequently, this is giving a power to the Legislature, a power which I believe is necessary in the present condition of things.  It would be ridiculous for us to say that we should shackle ourselves just at the time when the greatest freedom of action by the Legislature is necessary on behalf of the public.  We have very serious problems of a social character to deal with.  You cannot foresee completely the most effective way of dealing with them, but surely you should, in the interest of the community, allow the Legislature to be free to deal with them and not have it tied up with Constitutional restrictions. The purpose of the Article is to make the way open so that the Legislature can do that in the way best calculated to serve the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President has unwittingly let his real mind be known to the House on this matter. I think the mentality in the Government regarding this particular part of the Article, referred to by Deputy Norton, may be traced back to the transport strike here in Dublin.  We know what the Government's mind was on that strike.  I think that the Government, through one of its Ministers, let the trade union movement in this country know what its mind was.  I do not think I am going too far in saying that, subsequent to that strike, the Government delivered what was almost an ultimatum to the trade unions as to setting their house in order, and that it was intimated to the trade unions that if they themselves did not take certain action, then the Government would be forced to do so.  In my opinion, this is the most serious part of this Article.  From a practical point of view, it is even more serious than the first part which was under discussion yesterday and for the greater part of to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President talks about the Government or the Legislature taking action in the public interest.  As we <Col N="1768" /> know in this country, and particularly so to-day, the Government is the Legislature when it comes to taking action.  It is the Government that will decide what is, and what is not, in the public interest.  It can decide to ban an association, trade union or group if it decides that it is in the public interest to do so, although it may be far from the public interest to take the action that the Government determines to take.  I think it ought to be quite clear now, if it has not been long before this, that all the talk we have heard both inside and outside of this House from the occupants of the Government Front Bench as to their sympathy with trade unions, with working men, and their desire to see associations formed for the protection of the workers, was all nonsense.</P>

It is ridiculous to say that the powers are being directed against one group rather than against another group.  These are general powers, and we do not know in what direction it may be necessary to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The big point is still that it is a general power to be adjudicated upon by an Executive.  It is a power which can be operated by an Executive which wants to do something and which can get laws passed inside the term &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;.  In that connection, I am assuming all the time that the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; carries forward from &ldquo;order&rdquo; to &ldquo;morality&rdquo; in the Preamble to this.  I notice that in the Irish text the adjective is attached to the other words, but I think that is because the adjective always comes last. The only way to reconcile the two is on the ground that the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; applies both to the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;order&rdquo;.  That being so, what does &ldquo;morality&rdquo; cover? Would it cover such things as the abuse of the power of forming associations? Would it come anywhere near the phrase &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;? I think it would come very close.  Is it intended to be something near that? If it is, and if it does approach to something near, then the only point of distinction and the only reason for bringing this in is that, when you get a judgment on &ldquo;order and morality,&rdquo; it will not be an Executive operating from a Legislature that will be the judges; it will be somebody outside. <Col N="1772" /> But when you get this other phrase, it means that, even though it is contrary to public order and morality, laws may be passed with regard to the restriction of the exercise of the right.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this parenthesis is to get away from the courts&mdash; not to have people sitting outside in an impartial spirit interpreting whether some law is governed by the phrase &ldquo;public order or morality,&rdquo; but to have it here so that the Executive of a Party, working through a majority in the House, can get laws passed which will enable some member of the Executive Council to declare that, according to his view of what is the public interest, various things may be done.  The only change really that we get in these three lines from the Preamble phrase&mdash;public order and morality&mdash;is that change of whether to have some outside body decide or to have a Minister decide what is in the public interest.  Do you want to have the courts decide on whether the right to form associations is being abused, or do you want a Minister to be given power to say, &ldquo;My view is that that particular kind of thing should be stopped&rdquo;?  Once that law is passed, you cannot go to the courts on the ground that that law is unconstitutional because once it goes into the Constitution, then, even though it is not contrary to public order and morality the Minister gets powers to do something in the public interest.</P>

      <P>Now everybody has a choice in knowing where the Deputy stands.  As has been pointed out to the President when the previous sections of this Article were being discussed, the overriding condition, in the guaranteeing of certain liberties to citizens, is that they must exercise these liberties all the time subject to public order and morality.  It seems to me that in that overriding condition set out in the opening sentence of the section, the Executive Council has all the powers that might reasonably be required. The President, however, is not satisfied with that.  He wants in addition to give the Executive Council powers within the confines of the Party meeting room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss the relevancy of it when we come to it. The President wants in this sub-section to enable powers to be conferred on the Executive Council to enact legislation providing for the regulation and control in the public interest of the right to form associations and trade unions.  Of course, what that means is that the Executive Council of the day, having an obedient majority behind it, will be able to secure an endorsement of its proposals from the Party machine and to steamroll them through this Assembly, even though a fraction of the members probably will not know what the legislation is about, and will pay as little attention to it as many of them are paying to the provisions of this Constitution. That is the situation with which we may be confronted if this Article is passed in its present form. I, therefore, object to the inclusion of this limiting sentence because it <Col N="1775" /> gives power to an Executive Council with a bare majority behind it in this Assembly, to pass legislation which may be a serious invasion of long-recognised rights held by trade unions. Some of the provisions of that legislation may enable the Minister to come in to exercise further functions, without his action in that respect being restrainable by the courts.</P>
      <P>In the United States it used to be possible, when an industrial dispute took place, for employers' organisations to get the court to sequestrate union funds.  In that way the employers were able, because of the peculiar legislation that existed, to render the use of organised power by the trades unions entirely ineffective. It may be possible under the legislation contemplated here to give power to the Minister, in any circumstances in which he may think fit, to apply to the court to sequestrate union funds which are being used to finance an industrial dispute.  It may be possible in that legislation to give the Minister power to proscribe a strike in any particular industry, in any particular service, or in any group of particular services.  Of course, many of the utterances of members of the Government give grounds for considerable fears in that respect.  The Department of Industry and Commerce or the Minister did not come out of the tramway strike in this city with any great credit from the trade unions' standpoint.  We had in the course of the strike what was tantamount to an ultimatum by the Minister, telling the union that he would not exercise his normal functions as mediator unless the workers on strike went back to work.</P>

      <P>I think you will agree, Sir, that I spent scarcely a minute in referring to this matter, and the Minister's attitude towards the trade unions, I think, necessitated my recalling it.  As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, we had a subsequent declaration by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a meeting to which he was invited in his capacity as Minister, foreshadowing legislation affecting trade unions.  The Minister's speech on that occasion occasioned grave disquiet amongst the trade union movement, which had every reason to fear that the manner and the matter of the speech indicated the imposition of restrictions on trade unions.  Now we have the President coming along some time after that action and that statement by the Minister, indicating that it is desirable to give the Legislature power to enact laws regulating and controlling the exercise of the rights of citizens to form trade unions.  One of the reasons given in favour of putting this sentence into this Draft Constitution is that somebody might desire to restrict trade.  That is the case for giving the Legislature this power.</P>

      <P>Let the President defend his own Constitution.  Little as the President knows about the dangers of some portions of it, he at least knows ten times as much as Deputy MacDermot.  The President is not satisfied with having inserted in this Article a provision that the formation of associations and unions shall be subject to public order and morality. He says that is not wide enough, and he wants some wider powers for regulating the formation of associations and unions.  He, therefore, proposes that he should have power to regulate the formation of associations and unions, and control them in the public interest.  Of course, &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; is so wide a term that it might well mean, when translated into <Col N="1778" /> legislative action, that the unions had practically no rights and no powers whatever.  The President says, of course, like the just man, &ldquo;trust me.&rdquo; The President's whole attitude on this is &ldquo;trust me.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a repeating seven in this case.  What assurance have the unions that this particular phrase will not be used in such a manner as to enable legislation to be introduced proscribing the right of unions to withdraw their labour; proscribing them alternately from withdrawing their labour in the case of public services, or in the case of transport, or the variety of other industries in which the Government are shareholders? That is the danger which trade unions see in this particular section.  The President wants a wider power than that set out at the commencement of this section.  Not satisfied with ensuring that the unions must conform to public order and public morality, he wants in addition to ensure that they will be controlled in the public interest.  That may mean the withdrawal from the unions of many of the rights which they have got.</P>
      <P>The President's statement about its being desirable to interfere in order to avoid restriction of trade, the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the transport dispute in Dublin, and the Minister's subsequent intimation that he intended to introduce legislation dealing with the position of unions, because there were too many unions, and that certain other matters required to be adjusted, legislatively, convince the unions that the Government has under contemplation proposals which, if they are to take the form of the utterances to which I have just referred, must inevitably mean the restriction of the rights which trade unions have enjoyed for generations.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy and Deputy Norton have been quarrelling lately; they may have been shadowboxing. What is the position to be, from the public interest point of view, for instance, if an association or associations have a general strike?  I can see that there are needs of definite safeguards for the public interest.  At the same time I can see that there may be, from the trade unions' point of view, an anxiety intermingled in it that there may be a restriction of the trade unions' rights.  Obviously the public interest must be protected.  One has only to go back to 1926 and see what happened in Great Britain, when the whole community was held up by a general strike.  If the Government had the power at that time the trouble would never have occurred.  If the trade union leaders&mdash;one has read a good deal of their statements on it, and some of the biographies afterwards&mdash;had realised that Sir John Simon was going to come along and declare it illegal, that general strike would not have taken place.  The public would have been saved, and the trade union members themselves would have been saved.  Deputy MacDermot says it is better to have a written Constitution, but if you have a written Constitution you must have something in it guaranteeing the public interest in certain eventualities that may arise, as, for instance, a general strike.</P>

A system of checks and balances does not mean you are to tie yourself up so tightly with red tape that you cannot move hand or foot, and that is the danger which Deputy <Col N="1780" /> Norton seems to have lost sight of. On almost every Article of the Constitution on which he speaks he is advocating that we should tie ourselves up tightly with red tape and bind the Legislature&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nobody is proposing to muzzle the citizen or to handcuff him.  Nobody is introducing a law at the present moment for the restriction of the liberty of an association.  What is being done is to say that when we are laying down the fundamental principle of the liberty of association, it is desirable to take note of the fact that the liberties of certain associations may sometimes have to be restricted by law, by the Legislature in its wisdom, with the full democratic consent of a democratic House.  Deputy Norton must know that in America, where very important democratic measures had to be carried through by the actual President of the United States, the interests of the people were very gravely endangered by the fact that he found himself tied up with red tape in just the same way that Deputy Norton is trying to tie us up with red tape here.</P>

      <P>Maybe, but also by the Supreme Court interpreting an unduly rigid and detailed Constitution, and it is exactly an unduly rigid Constitution that Deputy Norton is trying to impose upon us here.  It was only the merest prudence on the part of those who drafted this Constitution to leave room for such contingencies as may arise in the life of every nation. We must not suppose that every Legislature which is to follow us is to be a Legislature that cannot be trusted.  We have no right to adopt that superior attitude to posterity.  The Irish people will have just as much right to legislate <Col N="1781" /> for themselves when we have gone as they have when we are here.  In any case, Deputy Norton has ruined every particle of plausibility that there might be in his argument by the fact that he himself has put down an amendment restricting a certain kind of association.</P>

      <P>I see that a profit-making association is an association.  I am perfectly well aware that Deputy Norton thinks all members of profit-making associations, if not actually depraved, are well on the road to being depraved; whereas members of every trade union, if not angels, are the next thing to angels.  That is not the point of view of everybody, and I for one would prefer to take the view that the possibilities of depravity are about equal in the two cases.  What we have to do is to hold the balance fairly between all classes of the community. I do think it is thoroughly possible that associations might arise which did not offend against public morality, and yet which might in the interests of the people have to be restricted.  I suggest that Deputy Norton thinks so, too, unless he goes so far as to say that a profit-making association is <i>ipso facto</i> one that offends against public morality.</P>

      <P>I know that the Deputy assumes he is never wrong and I will not waste my time contradicting <Col N="1782" /> him.  My simple view of a Constitution is that it is a document which lays down clearly the rights of citizens.  It is a document which declares beyond yea or nea what rights they are to have, and it should not be utilised in order to lay down for all time a mass of restrictions on the liberty of the people.  If it is the President's intention, as it is obviously, that it might be necessary by law at some time, either in the near future or in the distant future, to restrict the right of citizens to form unions and associations, then, why have anything in the Constitution giving the citizens the right to form associations and unions when, in fact, the next clause asserts the right of the Government to take that right from the people?  Is not the honest way and the decent way to do it to cut out the reference to the people having any right in that direction, and to leave them dependent on whatever rights the law may or may not give them in the future?  That is what we are doing here.  One step forward, three steps back.  That is characteristic of every Article in this Constitution that gives any right to anybody.  In big print on the top of the Article you proclaim the rights you are giving, but in little print, in sub-sections you take back every one of these rights, with the characteristic exception of the rights given to the President.  When dealing with the rights and powers to be given to the President, then all the sub-sections are devoted to making it impossible ever to curb those rights; making it impossible even for the courts to judge that individual and making it impossible, even for the Parliament of the people to do so.  But when dealing with trade unions or with the individual citizen, or the property of individual citizens, then a right is declared, but underneath that is laid down a whole lot of powers that are being given to an Executive either to limit, to restrict or to filch those rights from the individual or from the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one thing which should not be in a Constitution it is meaningless paragraphs that are so much frothy humbug.  The beginning of this Article and the subsequent sub-sections merely enshrine in a Constitution, <Col N="1783" /> which should live for a considerable number of years, a piece of Parliamentary humbug and chaff.  Apparently, the whole test of the possibility of abuse or misuse or otherwise of powers that are being given over the people's rights is to be purely the President's personal opinion.  It is &ldquo;I,&rdquo;&ldquo;I,&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rdquo; since we started to consider this document.  The Executive Council or the Parliament were never mentioned.  It is &ldquo;I will consider this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will consider that.&rdquo; It has been the first person singular all the time.</P>
    <P>The President may be and, certainly in his own opinion, is the most just and reasonable man that ever pulled on trousers, but this Constitution is a document that is meant to live and to last, and it will be worked under other Presidents and under other Executives of all types, politically venomous, politically vindictive, anti-the individual right, and anti-the right of unions. Are you when you start out in the Constitution to assert the right of people to form associations and unions, in the same Constitution to make it not only possible but to invite any bigoted and narrow-minded Executive in the future to formulate laws to restrict and to rob individuals of the right you proposed to give in the earlier part? Is not that obvious, when you start off by setting out in big print that citizens have the right to form unions and associations, but as an afterthought consider that is a dangerous right to give and put in, in small print, these words: &ldquo;subject however to whatever laws may be passed from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the President has that suspicion, that lack of trust and lack of confidence in Irish associations, in Irish trade unions, and in Irish democracy, then cut out the whole lot and define no right in one breath which you take away in the next breath.  It is this double shuffle, the advertisement in the shop window &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and the article as it crosses the counter &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; that is the characteristic feature of the Constitution from beginning to end.  The first portion of it, referred to as &ldquo;the just and reasonable portion,&rdquo; which will be quoted from Fianna Fáil platforms, is that in which you have <Col N="1784" /> enshrined the right of citizens to form associations and unions.  There will be no reference to the next features. There was not a colleague of the Deputies who spoke during the last two weeks who did not refer to this document as the charter of liberty.  I do not know any piece of legislation that ever passed through this House&mdash;and there were times, past and present, when harsh and restrictive measures had to be passed&mdash;that contained more restrictions; that so limited the powers and filched the rights of individual and organisations as this great charter of liberty.</P>

We ought to have some exposition given by people who assert that there is a difference.  I want to hear how one differs from the other.  If there is any difference, it is for those who are bringing forward this document to explain where the difference lies.  We have the declaration that the State guarantees the right to form unions and associations, and if the only limitation on that right is that it should be &ldquo;subject to public order and morality,&rdquo; it will be the courts will determine whether any limitation was put upon the right as caught by the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo;  There are two changes: the extent of the possible limitation of the right has been extended, and more onerous still, the person to determine the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; will no longer be a judge but will be a member of the Executive of the day.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is any use in going over the same ground.  It is quite clear that if I speak 50 times, we will have 50 Deputies going over the same ground.  We had Deputy Norton talking as if all these terrible things, which he apprehends could be done in future, could not be done to-day.  Why are they not being done? In future the Legislature will have to look after the public interest, as it is doing to-day.  Are we going to shackle the Legislature in the future <Col N="1785" /> in a way in which it is not shackled to-day, and in which it would be most unwise to shackle it?  We are providing for that freedom of action to work in the public interest and to safeguard the public interest in the future which the Legislature has to-day&mdash;that and no more.  As to &ldquo;public morality,&rdquo; the lawyers on the opposite benches, I understand, are accurate enough&mdash;it has been pretty well defined.  &ldquo;Public interest&rdquo; is a wider term, as I understand it.  Public interest would enable the Legislature to regard the good of the community in any direction.  Whether the narrower interpretation, as I understand it, of &ldquo;public morality&rdquo; would enable them to do that or not I do not know.  I think the Legislature ought to be enabled in its own judgment to decide and not the courts. The courts have to interpret the laws. The courts have not placed upon <Col N="1786" /> them the responsibility that the Legislature has.  The Legislature has the responsibility of working in the public interest and of seeing, in the passing of its laws, that the rights of the individual, as an individual, and the rights of the community, as a community, do not conflict and are properly co-ordinated.  That is the duty of the Legislature; and what we want to see is that in future the Legislature will not be so restricted that it will not be able to function properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 125:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of Section 6, sub-section 1º, iii, line 5, after the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;provided that nothing contained in such laws may limit or restrict the rights and liberties enjoyed by the citizens previous to the enactment of this Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to enshrine in the Constitution a provision that whatever type of laws may be introduced to provide for the regulation and control of the public interest and of the right of citizens to form associations and unions, nothing contained in such laws may limit or restrict the rights and liberties enjoyed by the citizens previous to the enactment of this Constitution.  I take it, for instance, that the President would agree that the existing system of society in respect of legislative provision for regulating the establishment and control of associations and unions gives no grounds for concern so far as the State is concerned.  The legislation which is in existence at the moment has been on the Statute Book for quite a long time, and, so far as the public is concerned, there has been no demand for a revision of that legislation in a restrictive sense.  The President endeavours to justify this section of Article 40, and says that it may be desirable in the public interest to enact legislation to provide for the regulation and control of associations and unions.  The object of this amendment is to ensure that such legislation as may be enacted will not limit or restrict the rights and liberties enjoyed by the citizens previous to the enactment of this Constitution.  That amendment would ensure to the citizens that whatever rights they have got will be continued to them, even after the proposed laws are passed, and citizens will be assured that their rights cannot be invaded by any legislation that may be subsequently enacted.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Norton is not serious in asking that we should stabilise the present situation <Col N="1788" /> without knowing what the future may hold.  We cannot do that.  It is absolutely ridiculous that the Legislature of the nation should be tied up in such a way that it could not in the future act in the public interest.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President is splitting hairs on the difference between the Executive of the day and the Legislature. What does the Legislature mean?  Does not the President know that he can simply sit in his seat while any particular amendment is being discussed; does he not know that he need not offer the slightest shred of opposition to any amendment and that all he need say is that he is standing by the Draft Constitution?  Then, if a division is called, his loyal legionaries will walk into the Lobby and make sure that the President's viewpoint is upheld in the manner prescribed by the Standing Orders of the House.  What is the use of trying to split hairs on the difference between the Legislature and the Executive of the day?  Do we not all know that the Executive of the day, commanding a majority, is capable of putting through any type of legislation?  When you talk about the Legislature, what you really mean is the majority Party in the Legislature, because it is the all-powerful Party so far as the Legislature is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A minority Opposition, no matter how virtuous their viewpoint may be, or how laudable their objective, could never hope to pass any legislation protecting the rights or liberties of the people unless they had the approval of the Government.  So when you come to examine the Legislature and ascertain what exactly it means, you are driven to the conclusion that for the purpose of the enactment of legislation, while the Legislature may either approve or criticise, the fact remains that in the last resort the decision rests with the Executive Council, which in turn means the Party caucus. In future a body of that kind, acting in that way, may be able to come before the House with proposals for <Col N="1790" /> legislation which may seriously affect the rights and liberties that trade unions enjoy to-day under existing statutes.</P>
    <P>The President says that my amendment would stereotype the existing position and prevent the introduction of legislation dealing with the position of associations and unions in future.  Of course, the President knows perfectly well that it could do no such thing.  There would be nothing to prevent the President introducing new laws dealing with the position of associations and unions; but my amendment would prevent him enacting in any of these laws a provision which would give the citizens less rights or less liberties than they have to-day. The President could, in his new legislation, maintain their existing rights and liberties and give them more rights and liberties and more responsibility or less responsibility; but my amendment would ensure that he could not give the citizens less rights or less liberties than they have to-day. Is there anything unreasonable in asking that?  This Draft Constitution is taking us into uncharted seas.  It is taking the trade unions into uncharted seas where they do not know what is in store for them.</P>

      <P>Let me take this whole Article which deals with public order and morality, plus control in the public interest.  Let me take these three points together with the speech made by the President on the last section and the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I say that there is grave ground for fear that the position in the future may not be so satisfactory as it is to-day. I want, therefore, to ensure, when the position is thrown into the melting-pot, that at least we will be able to say that whatever changes are to be made they will not give the unions less rights and less liberties than they <Col N="1791" /> enjoy to-day.  That, whatever rights they have to-day, they will be anchored to them and no Executive Council anxious to restrict their powers will be able to invade such rights and liberties.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was talking about an invasion of rights. The whole body of laws as it exists is being taken over by this Constitution. The passage of this Constitution does not make any change in that respect.  What the Deputy wants us to do is to tie our hands now and go blindfolded and tied into the future. Does the Deputy want the same sort of position with regard to other associations? It is the duty of the Legislature <Col N="1792" /> to look after the interests of all sections of the community and it would be ridiculous for any responsible body of people to agree to a suggestion such as is made by Deputy Norton, that they should now tie their hands and go blindfolded into the future.  There is no invasion in this Constitution.  If the Deputy says I want to make something out of this Constitution so as to give a special position to certain organisations at the present time, then he is on quite a different footing, but we are not touching that.  That is a matter that can be dealt with quite as freely after this Constitution is passed as it can now and, consequently, no one in his senses, with any sense of responsibility whatever, would accept that proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day, Deputy Martin Ryan addressed the following question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If his attention has been called to statements made to the effect that in the town of Nenagh on Saturday, May 8th, two families, one a man, his wife and seven children, the other a man, his wife and five children, found themselves at 9 p.m. destitute; that they were refused assistance by the relieving officer, but were given tickets for the county home 25 miles away; if he has made any investigations in the matter; were the facts in accordance with the statements; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of such a thing and to ensure that such cases are not left unprovided for.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should say, with regard to the question, that the statements referred to were statements made by me in this House.  I should also explain that the date, May 8, was not the date given by me, but May 1.  Therefore, the error referred to in the reply was not mine.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in reply, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My attention has been called to the statements referred to by the Deputy.  I called for a report on the matter and I find that the statements do not accurately represent the facts, and that the persons applying for assistance were not genuine cases of destitution.  The facts are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;The incident took place at Nenagh on the 1st May, not on the 8th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The superintendent assistance officer was approached by a number of able-bodied men who were at the time employed by the county council on a temporary employment scheme.  The men demanded home assistance on the plea of destitution.  In view of the <Col N="1794" /> fact that the men were working at the time and considering that they were given provisional assistance during the previous week while awaiting payment from the county council, the superintendent assistance officer could not regard them as destitute persons and, consequently, he refused assistance, explaining to them that they should approach the county council who was employing them.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;After consultation amongst themselves, in the course of which one of the men remarked &lsquo;we will torment him, anyway,&rsquo; the men demanded tickets for admission to the county home.  This, the superintendent assistance officer also refused for the same reason.  Later in the day, the wives of two of the men approached the local assistance officer and asked for tickets for admission to the county home. The assistance officer did not consider the applicants destitute, but he issued the tickets applied for as he considered he should do so when the applicants themselves alleged destitution.  Neither of the women asked to be conveyed to the county home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that answer is read and studied by any member of the House I think he will admit that, on the face of it, it shows that the information supplied to the Minister was, to say the least, contradictory. Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary's answer was based on the information supplied to him.  I stated to-day that the information was inaccurate and untrue.  I want to repeat that.  The Parliamentary Secretary, on the information supplied to him, said he was perfectly satisfied that my version was not in accordance with the facts.  In reply to Deputy Mulcahy, he said that assistance &ldquo;was refused for the reason that payments by the county council are fortnightly payments. The home assistance the applicants got was in respect of the first week of their employment, when no payment was made by the county council.  The incident referred to in the question occurred on the night they had been paid for this fortnight's employment.&rdquo;  The men to whom I <Col N="1795" /> referred were not paid on that Saturday night by the county council. They had received no payment whatever from the county council.  Certain men, taken into employment by the county council the week prior to that in which the men to whom I referred were taken into employment, did receive, in respect of ten days' work, four days' pay.  The men to whom I referred and to whom these tickets were issued by the home assistance officer received, although they had worked periods from five to eight days for the county council, no payment whatever, and they were absolutely destitute.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The men demanded tickets for admission to the county home.&rdquo;  Does the Parliamentary Secretary believe that?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary imagine men who were destitute, who had not even the price of a loaf, demanding tickets for admission to the county home 25 miles away?  The fact is that this officer refused to give that assistance&mdash;notwithstanding that he was instructed by the county council to give provisional assistance to men employed by the county council and, subsequently, deduct the amounts of the advances from the paying orders issued to them&mdash;and told them he would give them tickets for the county home. One man replied: &ldquo;If I had what would take myself, my wife and family to the county home at Thurles, 25 miles away, I would not have to come here to look for assistance.&rdquo;  They were refused assistance on the plea that they were not destitute.  The ticket issued to a man, his wife and seven children says: &ldquo;Pat So-and-So is a person in the county eligible for relief, and cannot be effectively relieved at less cost to the rates otherwise than in the above-mentioned institution.&rdquo;  If the assistance officer was satisfied that he was not a destitute person entitled to assistance, why did he issue these tickets?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was informed&mdash;from whatever source he got his information&mdash;that one of the men was overheard to say: &ldquo;We will torment him, anyway.&rdquo;  I saw these men on Saturday night, when they came to <Col N="1796" /> me with their wives, and I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, whoever got the tormenting, it was not the assistance officer.  The men and women who were with the assistance officer from 12 o'clock on Saturday until 9 o'clock on Saturday night got, in my opinion, the tormenting.  I do not want to go fully into this matter. I am not going to weary the House by giving all the details which I could give regarding these happenings.  This question was asked by a Deputy who is chairman of the county council&mdash;a body which cannot make arrangements which will enable them to pay this money weekly.  Let it be said to their credit that the county council, under the chairmanship of the Deputy who asked the question and who was present at the meeting, were anxious to pay these men weekly if the machinery could be so worked as to enable that to be done.  When they failed to get from the officials an assurance that that could be done, they issued instructions to the assistance officer that he was to advance a certain amount&mdash;I think 10/- &mdash;to men in this position pending the receipt of their wages.  The Deputy who asked this question could have got all the information he sought without coming to the Parliamentary Secretary or to this House at all.  The question was asked for one reason, and one reason only.  That was to attempt to discredit the statement I made in this House.  The effect of the answer will not be as it was hoped it would be.</P>
    <P>The statements contained in the reply are inaccurate and untrue.  I am satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary based his answer on the information which he received.  These men were destitute, and at 9 o'clock at night, having failed to secure either wages in respect of the work they had performed or assistance from the assistance officer, they went, on my suggestion, to the president of the local St. Vincent de Paul Society&mdash;a gentleman who has been connected with that society for over 25 years, who knows every person in the town and who is as conversant as anybody could possibly be with the conditions of these poor people.  He issued to the four families orders on a local grocery <Col N="1797" /> establishment for 4/- worth of groceries to tide them over from Saturday night until Monday morning.  Those orders would not have been issued unless the president of the society was satisfied that those persons were destitute and, in fact, were not issued by him until he had so satisfied himself&mdash;all the more so because, during the past winter, there has been a greater drain on the resources of that society than there has been at any time within the memory of the members.</P>
    <P>I want to make this quite clear: that those men to whom I refer, and to whom those tickets were issued, were not paid on that day by the county council.  Other men were offered tickets for the county home and refused them.  Those men did not ask for tickets for the county home, but they were offered to them and given to them by the assistance officer. The county council had issued instructions to that assistance officer that, pending the receipt of their wages, he was to make certain advances to those men, the advances to be afterwards deducted from their wages.  As to the destitution, if the Deputy who put down the question has any doubt on that matter, I am prepared to supply him with the names and addresses of the persons affected, and I suggest to him that he should go and interview them himself and find out from them what exactly happened on that date. I do not ask him to accept my word for it, but I ask him to go to those persons and ascertain from them what happened on that date.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that if I had any doubts as to the destitution and hunger, they were removed by a widow who lives next door one of these men, who has a wife and seven children.  She came down to me early on that day, many hours before I saw any of those people.  She asked if I could possibly do anything to get some support for them.  She said: &ldquo;There are seven children in that house and they are crying with the hunger since yesterday evening.&rdquo;  I can give that lady's name to the Deputy if he wants it, and if he wishes he can go and interview her himself. I did not want to go into this matter <Col N="1798" /> in this way at all.  I can only see one reason for raising it in this way, and I hope the Deputy who did so has got full satisfaction out of it, but I am afraid he has not.  All the information could have been got locally.  Accurate information could have been got.  I say that the information supplied to the Parliamentary Secretary is inaccurate and untrue, and the persons affected as well as many others know that quite well.  I do not propose to detain the House any longer on the matter.</P>

      <P>I put down this question because it is only too clear to everyone that the inclination of Deputy Morrissey and his Party is to make political capital out of happenings of this sort rather than to assist in alleviating the hardships that they complain of.  I am rather surprised at some of the statements that I have just heard from the Deputy.  He said that a meeting of the county council, over which I presided, was held for the purpose of trying to secure weekly payments for the men.  That is correct. That has been a grievance with casual workers as long as I have been associated with the county council: that they have to wait too long at the start of a working period before they get any payment.  It would have been remedied but the staff did not find it convenient.  However, a meeting was held.  Deputy Morrissey has just stated that the county council instructed the assistance officer to relieve those people.  The Deputy should have enough experience of public life and of local administration to know that the county council has no jurisdiction whatever over the assistance officer.  He is an officer of the board of health and not of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the statements that were made here in the House by Deputy Morrissey, and I saw reports of his speeches in the Press where he dangled those tickets from platforms at public meetings up and down the country.  I made it my business when I went home last week-end to meet the assistance officer concerned.  I questioned him about the circumstances of the case, and his statements to me were exactly <Col N="1799" /> in keeping with the statement supplied to the Parliamentary Secretary and quoted by him to-day in answer to my question.  Deputy Morrissey now states that early that day a next door neighbour of one of the families came to him and told him that the children were crying because of hunger for more than 24 hours.  The Deputy resides in the same town as the assistance officer, and it sounds very strange, from the information that I have, that he made no move to go to the assistance officer and point out to him the condition and the circumstances of that family, or to suggest to him that they were entitled to some assistance, but he availed of every opportunity that arose to refer to this matter at every public engagement in which he took part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to dangle those tickets before the public.  It is evident and quite clear that the only concern of the Deputy was to make as much political capital as he possibly could out of this case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had his opportunity to make his speech, but if he was speaking here until morning he would not convince me, and I am certain he would not convince anybody in the country, but that his whole ambition is to make as much political capital for himself and his Party as he possibly can out of any sufferings or hardships that may be endured by unfortunate people in the country.</P>

      <P>I may point out at the same time that the authority to determine whether or not a person is entitled to home assistance is not the <Col N="1800" /> Dáil or the Minister for Local Government, but the home assistance officer, who affords provisional relief and reports to the superintendent assistance officer.  The superintendent assistance officer has power to issue an order for relief pending the next meeting of the board of health, and the board of health, on consideration, finally determines who shall or shall not receive home assistance, as well as the amount to be given.  The Minister is definitely precluded by law from interfering in matters of home assistance.  According to the reports to hand, in the cases under discussion the board of health at their meeting on 29th April discontinued the provisional assistance given by the home assistance officer, and I suppose it is reasonable to assume that they satisfied themselves, before deciding to discontinue the relief, that the persons affected were not destitute. I have not been furnished with the names of the applicants under discussion who were alleged to have been destitute on the night of the 1st May, and hence they can only be identified by inference.  I have no information at my disposal other than the report of the superintendent assistance officer to the secretary of the board of health. My reply has been based on that report. Perhaps it is as well, in the light of the divergence of opinion amongst the Tipperary Deputies as to what actually did take place, that I should read for the House the letter of the superintendent assistance officer to the secretary of the board of health, a copy of which I have here.  The letter is dated 29th May, and reads as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;District Hospital,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Roscrea.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Meagher,&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 28th inst., with communication from the Local Government Department attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with the latter I beg to say that the matter referred to occurred on the 1st May and not on the 8th, as stated.  I was in Nenagh on that date, for the purpose of home assistance inspection. and while I was at Mr. McDonnell's office a number of able-bodied men <Col N="1801" /> who were employed by the county council at the time on a temporary relief scheme, approached me and demanded home assistance on the plea of destitution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the fact that they were, at the time, working for and earning a living weekly wage and considering that they had been given provisional assistance the week previous so as to help them whilst awaiting payment from the county council, I could not consider them as &lsquo;destitute persons,&rsquo; and consequently I refused home assistance. After a consultation amongst themselves, in the course of which I heard one of them say, &lsquo;we will torment him, anyway,&rsquo; they demanded tickets for the county home. I also refused these, for the same reason.  I, furthermore, explained that &lsquo;if they had a reason for approaching anyone for help it should be the county council, who was employing them and who should in my opinion make provision for paying them weekly.&rsquo; They were most insistent on getting county home tickets, and I was almost compelled to call in the Civic Guards to have them removed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I left the office about 6.30 p.m. and afterwards learned from Mr. McDonnell that at about 8 p.m. the same evening the wives of two of the men referred to above approached him and asked him for county home tickets.  Mr. McDonnell, whilst not considering them destitute himself, issued two tickets for the home, his reason for so doing being that he thought he should do <Col N="1802" /> so on the person's own allegations of destitution.  The tickets were accepted by the applicants on this understanding and neither asked for any mode of conveyance to Thurles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the information of the Department, I would like to say that in the matter of home assistance administration, Nenagh area is unlike any other in my district.  There is a section of people there who think they can get assistance on any plea, and who use any and every means to try to obtain it.  Investigation of cases is most difficult because of the unreliability of statements made by applicants and the attempted interference of outside parties on behalf of applicants for apparent personal reasons.  A fair indication of the type with whom Mr. McDonnell has to deal can be ascertained by the admission of the parties referred to by Mr. Morrissey, T.D., &lsquo;that no grocer would give them a week's credit for goods.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all the information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a nice statement from a public official</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information before me on the matter, and if that report is not accurate and in accordance with the facts, the interested Deputies ought to take the matter up with the board of health.  The Minister has no functions in the matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a scandalous reflection on the people of the town of Nenagh.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until Friday, 4th June, at 10.30 a.m.</P>
