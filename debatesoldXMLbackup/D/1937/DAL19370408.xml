      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he can give the Dáil any information with regard to the activities of the Irish Free State Minister to Spain since his return to his post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (the President)</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other diplomatic representatives now resident at St. Jean de Luz, our Minister to Spain has been endeavouring, as far as present circumstances permit, to carry out his normal functions. He visited Salamanca last month for the purpose of informing himself of the situation in that area, and also of securing the withdrawal to the rear of the fighting line of a number of minors who are citizens of Saorstát Eireann and whose parents had requested the intervention of the Government on their behalf.  He has not so far been able to obtain permission for the return of these minors to their parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If the President comes to the conclusion, at any time, that the Minister is not really serving any useful purpose during the civil war, will he consider suppressing the Irish Legation to Spain altogether until after the civil war, and possibly transferring Mr. Kerney to Italy, where, I understand, a Legation is to be established?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, were any similar representations made to the Valencia body, and, if so, can <Col N="470" /> he say whether the Valencia body made any reply to the request of our Department of External Affairs, that minors who were with the forces of the Valencia body, without the consent of their parents, should be repatriated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to ask the Deputy to put down a separate question.  I do know that the Minister has endeavoured to do his duty, no matter what side they are on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in default of attendance at the forthcoming Imperial Conference he will make a written communication to that body on the subject of partition and in particular of the continued incorporation in Northern Ireland of counties that desire to join the Irish Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember that the Imperial Conference is a purely consultative body, the resolutions of which have no binding force.  The members of the Commonwealth are already aware of the attitude of the majority of our people towards partition.  Partition was created by a British law, and the solution of the problem must depend <Col N="471" /> ultimately on the attitude of the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that foreign policy is to be included in agenda of the forthcoming Imperial Conference, and whether he will state the circumstances which make it desirable for the Irish Free State to continue in association with the nations of the British Commonwealth in the realm of external affairs while abstaining from conference with these nations on the principles of external policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will refer to my answer to a similar question put by him on the 17th February, he will see that the Imperial Conference has nothing to do with the determination of the external policy of the individual members of the Commonwealth. The matter for discussion at the Imperial Conference is foreign affairs, not foreign policy.  It can mean nothing more than a noncommittal exchange of views and information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the President has just said about the foreign policy of this country not being in any way subject to the decision of the Imperial Conference, has it now dawned upon him that the absolute sovereignty of this country is in no way compromised by its membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, or has it taken him five years or 15 years to learn that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause which has brought about an increase in the price of bread is the increase in the price of flour.  The increases in the price of flour during the last 12 months are due to the increases in the world price of wheat.  During the 12 months from the beginning of April, 1936, to the end of March, 1937, the price of Manitoba wheat per 496 lbs. rose from 33/- to 60/-.  In the same period the price of Australian wheat rose from 32/- to 52/-, and other wheats advanced correspondingly.  The price of flour and the price of bread are constantly under review in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he received from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union a suggestion that he would take steps to bring about a settlement of the dispute between the Committee of Management of Ardee Mental Hospital and their staff; whether he has in fact taken such; and, if so, what steps towards a settlement of the dispute, and whether it is his intention to invite the parties concerned to confer with a view to a settlement.</P>

      <P>The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union has informed my Department as to the dispute at the Ardee Mental Hospital, and my Department has been in touch with the Committee of Management through the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The Committee of Management have been asked by my Department whether they would be prepared to send representatives to attend a conference with representatives of the union, but they have declined.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention was directed to the resolution adopted at a meeting of the local branch of the Labour Party protesting against the proposal to increase the harbour dues chargeable at Balbriggan; whether he is aware that if effect is given to the order authorising an increase in the harbour dues, a large amount of tonnage will be diverted from the harbour, involving a loss of £4,000 per annum in wages, and displacing the labour of 70 men; and whether, before authorising any increase in the dues charged hitherto, he is prepared to inquire into the condition of the harbour, the nature of the services it provides, and the effect of increased dues on the available quayside employment in Balbriggan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was directed to the resolution referred to, but I am not aware that the result of an increase in the harbour dues would be as suggested in the question.  As regards the remainder of the question, I would refer the Deputy to an answer given on the 21st July last to a question by Deputy Corish regarding the condition of Balbriggan harbour.  An application for an order increasing the harbour dues chargeable at Balbriggan is at present under consideration in my Department.  The Harbours (Regulation of Rates) Act, 1934, requires public notice to be given of any proposal to make a Harbour Rates Order.  Due consideration will be given to any representations received in response to the public notice which will be given in due course in regard to the proposed increase of charges at Balbriggan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Beckett)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the many commodities now subject to taxation, he will cause inquiry to be made as to whether the returns collected for the purpose of the compilation of the cost-of-living index figure take sufficiently into consideration the matter of quality; and if, further, he will so <Col N="479" /> readjust the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; given to the various commodities included in the return as to produce an index figure that will probably reflect changes in actual costs of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost-of-living index figures are intended to indicate the trend of retail prices (and rents) for the same qualities of the household commodities included in the computation. While the individual price quotations for each commodity cover a considerable range of quality at each inquiry, every effort is made to ensure that, on the average, the quality of each commodity for which prices are quoted remains unchanged between consecutive inquiries.  Provision is made, however, in the technique of the computation to allow for changes from time to time in quality of the commodities quoted for, in accordance with changes in public demand.  These index figures are not intended to reflect changes in the actual standard of living, for which periodical budget inquiries would be necessary, and such inquiries in this, as in all other countries, are exceedingly onerous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Returns from which national average prices are derived for the quarterly cost-of-living inquiries are sufficiently numerous for the computation of figures which will indicate the trend of retail prices (and rents) in the Saorstát as a whole, but are too few for the computation of reasonably accurate figures for individual cities and towns or even for groups of cities and towns.  A very considerable increase in the number of returns would be necessary before a useful computation could be made, and I am not satisfied that the value of the results would be commensurate with the labour and expense which such an extension in the scope of the inquiry would entail. It should also be pointed out that even <Col N="480" /> if such returns were obtained there would be no possibility of obtaining reliable regional average prices in the base period (July, 1914), and that in any such computations the possibility of substantial differences in the family budgets in different cities and towns would have to be taken into account. No data are available from which such regional &ldquo;weights&rdquo; could be obtained.</P>

The <Col N="490" /> President of the Executive Council has not sat in this House in debate or in general business for more than three minutes on any day in the last 12 months.  His duty for calling the order of business has been consistently delegated by him to the Vice-President.  I suppose that is presumably in accordance with the rules of order, but I want to say that a well-established principle of this House was that the President held himself in readiness until the end of question time, that he then called the business, and afterwards he reasonably and frequently attended in the House and showed the House that he did not ignore it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(1)  What amount of money, if any, is being expended or proposed to be expended on the Wolfe Tone Square housing scheme for the purpose of carrying away roof and surface water since the completion of the contract.&rsquo;  The answer to that query was: &lsquo;Estimated by the surveyor at £120.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(2)  If any sum is being expended on completing the scheme, is it intended to recover the amount from the contractor who built the houses?&rsquo; The answer to that is &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(3)  Was a final certificate issued to the contractor in respect of the scheme and a final payment made?&rsquo; The answer to that is &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(4)  Who prepared the plans and specifications for the houses in Wolfe Tone Square?&rsquo;  The answer to that is: &lsquo;Mr. E.M. Murphy, B.E.&rsquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(5)  What is the all-in cost of the scheme, including purchase of land, development, salaries and bonus to officials?&rsquo;  The answer is: &lsquo;According to returns submitted to members of the Council, £106,670 15s. 5d., including £120, as mentioned above.&rsquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" />&ldquo;Question 6 was: &lsquo;What was the actual amount paid to the contractor?&rsquo; The answer was: &lsquo;£82,025 14/-.&rsquo;  Question 7 was: &lsquo;What grants have been obtained from the Government for the houses built by the Bray Urban District Council in respect of the scheme?&rsquo; The answer was: &lsquo;£1,200 during the year 1935-6, and two-thirds of the yearly charge on £300 per house of all-in cost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 2nd February the Bray Ratepayers' Association sent the following resolution to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We call upon the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to hold a sworn inquiry into the cost of the Wolfe Tone Square housing scheme, Bray; the materials used in the construction of the houses, the general control and management of the scheme, and the present condition of the houses.  We consider that this inquiry is urgently needed in view of the complaints of the great majority of the tenants, who have been moved from comparatively dry houses to these new houses which, they allege, are reeking with damp, and, in the words of Deputy The O'Mahony, who inspected the houses (Parliamentary Debates, 3rd February, 1937, col. 149), are a breeding ground of consumption. As a very large sum of ratepayers' money has been sunk in this scheme, we demand this inquiry for the purpose of fixing the blame on the responsible parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 23rd March the Department of Local Government and Public Health sent the following reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 2nd instant on the subject and to state that the question of the condition of the houses erected by the Bray Urban District Council at Wolfe Tone Square is receiving attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I now understand that on the 30th of last month the Minister sent a notification to the Bray Ratepayers' Association that he would not hold a sworn inquiry into the matter, and that it was a matter for the Bray Urban <Col N="493" /> District Council and their technical advisers.  With regard to Question No. 1, to which I have referred, namely, the amount that was expended or that was proposed to be expended on the Wolfe Tone Square scheme for the purpose of carrying away roof and surface water since the completion of the contract, the reply of the town clerk was £120.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that when I inspected these houses it was a very wet night, and I saw down-pipes with water coming out at full force and emptying itself under the clay soil.  There was no provision for carrying away the water and the state of things was truly appalling.  With regard to the seventh question, as to what grants have been obtained from the Government for the houses built by the Bray Urban District Council, in respect of the scheme, the answer was £1,200 during the year 1935-36 and two-thirds of the yearly charge on £300 per house of all-in cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the responsible person for the public money being spent by his Department.  He has refused to hold a sworn inquiry into this question of the houses in Bray.  It is impossible to get away from the fact that something went wrong.  Who the culprit is I do not know, but surely the Minister is the proper person to go to.  One would imagine that he would be the very first and the most anxious person to get to the root of the whole of this trouble. To my mind he is the one person who should help, but I am sorry to say that instead of trying to help he endeavours to put the onus on the local council and apparently his attitude is: &ldquo;It has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must appreciate what impression this is going to have on the public mind.  A very large sum is being expended on a housing scheme and for some reason the houses are not what they should be.  People were taken out of dry houses and put into houses which are not dry.  Not only that, but they were taken out of houses where they paid a comparatively small rent and put into houses where they have to pay an increased rent.  What are the public going to <Col N="494" /> think?  They are already asking themselves why has not the Minister taken some action.  They wonder what is the good of electing Ministers unless they accept responsibility?  If there is trouble the Minister should be the first person to find out the cause of the trouble.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious point which may occur to the public and that is that if the Minister will not take any action it is because there is something to hide.  The Minister is in a very responsible position and to my mind it is his duty never to allow any grounds for such a thought crossing the public mind.  Supposing there is something to hide, is it not all the more the Minister's duty to bring it to light?  The Minister is the responsible person and it is obvious to me&mdash; and I am very certain it will be obvious to everybody&mdash;that unless a sworn inquiry is held into this matter, the people will say that the Government dare not hold an inquiry.  I do not want that to be the result.  The Minister has it in his power, if he so wishes, to hold a sworn inquiry and find out who is responsible for this deplorable condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>Now, unfortunately, those houses at Bray are not the only ones.  There are other places in County Wicklow where there are also leaking houses, and I remember going along, not very far from where I live, and seeing the tiles going on to the roofs of certain houses.  Very shortly afterwards, I passed that place, and the roofs were completed; but I passed again a short time afterwards, and what did I see? I saw all the roofs being taken off again.  Naturally, I made inquiries, and what did I find?  I found that the tiles were so porous that they were incapable of keeping out the rain, and so all the tiles were taken off, and on top of the boards on which the tiles had been placed, what did they do? They put on tarred felt, and then they put the same tiles back again.  Well, I do not profess to know a great deal about building myself, but I know a certain amount about it and I can picture what is happening between that tarred felt and those tiles, especially in the summer time after anything, <Col N="495" /> such as a storm of rain, comes. These, however, are the very things which should not take place.</P>
    <P>We have heard mention about this housing board that is supposed to take an interest in such matters and to see that these sorts of things do not happen.  Apparently, however, nothing is done.  I gather that some very large salaries are paid to members of this particular board&mdash;again, public money.  What are they doing?  It should not be necessary for me to get up here in the Dáil and make these complaints to the Minister.  It should be absolutely unnecessary to do so, but since it is driven in upon me to get up here in the Dáil and make these statements, I think it is up to the Minister to do everything in his power to have the matter put right. We have heard a great deal about the various housing schemes, and we have heard a great deal about the slums in Dublin.  There is one matter, however, which I should like to mention. I know it affects another Department than the Minister's, but the Minister is responsible for the medical officers of health.  We talk about the slums in Dublin, but I should like to ask, what about the school slums in the country?  I know that some of them exist under very deplorable conditions, and I would urge the Minister to ask his medical officers of health to make reports on these schools and, as far as he is able to do so, to bring pressure to bear on the Minister responsible in this matter.  I shall not say anything more with regard to that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I should like to appeal to the Minister to take a firm stand on this question of housing in Bray.  Those houses have been put up at very considerable expense to the ratepayers of Bray and to the public as well.  This is a matter that should not be left alone.  It is in the Minister's hands to clear up the whole matter, and I hope that, for the sake of the country, and for the good name of his own Department, he will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that Deputy The O'Mahony might have added some of the dispensaries to some of the school houses that he mentioned.  I <Col N="496" /> should like, for the few short minutes I shall be on my feet here, to refer to the very heavily overworked officials that exist to-day in our counties: namely, the surveyors.  Large amounts of money, either voted from the Central Fund or raised through the rates or some other source, have been raised for the purpose of giving relief grants for unemployment, and it would seem that the surveyors in the counties where these grants are being administered or allotted&mdash;I am sure this applies to every county, but it certainly applies to the constituencies of which I have experience&mdash;have had their work doubled and, I might say without any exaggeration, trebled, as a result of this.  There seems to be some conflict between two Government Departments.  You have the Board of Works, and you have the Minister's own Department of Local Government. Now, apparently, the first thing the surveyor must do is to work out specifications for the different parts of the county where unemployment exists, and these specifications are sent on to the Department of Local Government or to the Board of Works.  In the meantime, a census has got to be taken in that area of the men that are unemployed.  Sometimes, the employment offices are quite far removed from the actual district affected in the county, but the surveyor seems to be the one responsible individual to gather and collect this information to the local labour exchanges.  The result is that, when his specifications are passed and when the actual unemployed number is verified, that money must be spent actually within that area where the unemployed are and in connection with which the specifications are sent up. The result is that by the time the grant is passed and the specifications passed, the unemployment in that area has probably gone up by, say, from 20 to 30, with the result that with regard to the particular part of the county which is to be helped the whole plan breaks down. Then, again, it goes to the other extreme.  Sometimes men are taken from a particular part of the county to go eight or nine miles away on a particular job, with the result that, <Col N="497" /> when the specification is passed, the scheme comes down worked out for, say, 30 men, and there are only 20 or 15 or ten men there.  There must be something wrong there.  The scheme does not seem to work.  My view is that it should be worked from a central point in the county; that it should have nothing to do with county councils or urban councils, or even with politicians, if that pollutes it. Let the surveyor have some elastic way of working the scheme.  I am sure that if the Minister will ask for a report from his chief officials, they will be able to verify what I am speaking about and they will be able to give him details which I am incapable and incompetent of giving here, and naturally, because I have not time to go into these things here.  However, that state of affairs exists, and his officials can verify it.  Now, further, I think the Minister ought to have a fairly extensive inquiry into the administration of vocational education in this country.  There is no doubt at all that vocational education is a very excellent thing and that, possibly, in many places it is a great success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>However, Sir, I should like to ask the Minister first of all to pay attention to that matter, if I am not in any way disrespectful in the few remarks I have made.  Deputy Norton here yesterday made a very strong complaint about the erection of, and the progress made in the erection of, the housing schemes in County Kildare. Now, I think the Minister will agree that anything that Deputy Norton has <Col N="498" /> said has not been exaggerated in any way, as far as I can see.</P>
      <P>The time has come when some more drastic method, power or authority in supervising and dealing with the erection of artisans' houses and cottages should be rigorously invoked.  It is quite obvious, as Deputy Norton said yesterday, that we have contractors going into this type of business, some of whom have no experience whatever, some of whom have no capital at all, and some of whom, apparently, have been able to get some form of surety which seems to satisfy the powers that be, local or otherwise.  The surety very often is not worth the paper upon which the bonds are written.  At all events, houses are going up which are not a credit to the county in which they are being built; neither are they fulfilling the idea for which housing grants were made available.  The housing grants were made available, I am sure, in order that houses might be erected for unfortunate poor people. They were not to be exploited as a money-making game or gamble.  I am sorry to say that seems to have been the experience in the constituency from which I come.  I do not say that all contractors are to blame, but, unfortunately, there has been more or less an epidemic of faulty building in our particular part of the country. Hence, I find myself in complete agreement with what Deputy Norton has said, and I should like to support him in every possible way.  I myself have seen houses built into which the former occupants of condemned houses some short distance away were sent to live. One thing certain is that the condemned houses were far and away healthier and better places than some of the new houses.  One sees roofs leaking and chimneys not drawing in many of these new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember bringing this matter forward this time last year.  I brought it forward with every sincerity, and I hate to have to refer to it again, but I do believe that very little has been done to bring about an improvement in that respect.  If there is one authority which could make everybody sit up, it is that of the Vice-President <Col N="499" /> from his office here in Dublin.  There is no use in merely sending letters down to local authorities.  A definite threat should be made that grants will be withdrawn if local authorities do not carry out a through examination of the fitness or otherwise of those who offer themselves as contractors for housing schemes.  Handy-men may be able to carry out certain work very successfully, but they are not qualified, and that is the trouble.  Last year I said, and I want to repeat it before I sit down, that the time, in my opinion, has arrived when it is necessary to face the fact that county councils and urban councils have so much work of a specialised nature thrust upon them that they are absolutely unable to give any proper detailed attention to it.  As a matter of fact, local administration is becoming a specialised, whole-time business, and if the money expended on local administration is to be spent properly and to the best advantage, some new method of local administration will have to be evolved.</P>
    <P>What is the suggestion?  I shall probably be accused of being a Fascist or something like that if I say that the managerial system must come sooner or later and that small local bodies will have to be joined up or interlocked with the managerial system.  The smaller these bodies are, the more effective they will be.  How exactly that system will be introduced I am not in a position to say.  It only requires pluck and determination to do it, and I believe that local administration will be greatly improved.  At the present moment, it is necessary, in view of the fact that we go up for election to local bodies as political representatives, to have our fling and to indulge in politics now and again.  I am sorry to say that sometimes we go in for vote-catching as opposed to good administration and doing the unpopular thing.  Anybody reading the local Press cannot deny that we are all affected now and again by that practice. In order to get votes, we have to take up a certain attitude on certain questions.  We are not saints.  We may be political sinners.  I suggest that a new system of local administration will <Col N="500" /> have to be adopted in the general interest of the ratepayers, the poor people, and particularly of those tenants of new cottages.  It may be unpopular to suggest it, it may be unpopular to introduce it, but it will become popular in the end, because it will have good results.  It will clear away abuses and quicken our country's progress in local administration.  It will make it move more rapidly forward and change the present system of a little progress now, a halt here, a little backsliding again, and sometimes no progress at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the last speaker that the managerial system will have any effect in making the smoke go the proper way in County Kildare.  As a matter of fact, the smoke has been going the wrong way in County Kildare for many years.  I remember reading of the experiences of a traveller in Kildare in 1785, and even then, he said, the smoke went through the windows.  It will continue to go through the windows, no matter how many local authorities you put under the managerial system.  Last evening I was on my feet at the same time as Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon was called before me, by what right of precedence I do not know.  I am a member of the Dublin Corporation and, if there is any right of precedence, I think it should be accorded to members of that distinguished body.  To my amazement, the Deputy for 50 minutes launched into a personal attack on the abilities and the achievements of our Minister here.  What his idea could have been I do not know.  I am afraid he represents the bad boy here. He has all the impertinence and assurance of the bad boy.  He may not be as young as he looks at present, but we can give him the benefit of the doubt&mdash;apply a sort of probation to him.  I have been here for three and a half years and constantly during that time, on the benches opposite, especially from those decorating the Front Bench, there have been produced documents time and again, documents which they called plans, promises, and all that class of thing.  They have become, so far as I could judge the last <Col N="501" /> time they were produced, fairly worn out and mouldy-looking now.</P>

      <P>I suggest they should give them a coat of size.  Varnish would be too much for their funds as the subscriptions are not coming in now.  Preserve them; they are wonderful documents.  I myself have always had a fancy for old documents, especially when they get a bit of mould, because I always remember the number of distinguished hands which they must have passed through during their period.  Look at all the distinguished hands those documents have passed through over there.  Recently there has been a new appearance. There has been a document discovered and introduced here in evidence by Deputy McGilligan in his latest speech. It was got out by a charitable organisation here in the city, I think about November last, and contains an appeal to the charitable people of Dublin. In that document it was stated&mdash;I have not seen it myself&mdash;that there were certain references to the Dublin Corporation housing activities.  So far as I could judge from the way in which Deputy McGilligan phrased it, this document represented that people were now accommodated with good-class dwellings, but unfortunately they were not able to pay for them, the consequence being that they were on relief, and in order to pay the rent of those houses or flats they had practically to starve.  That was the construction, so far as I could judge at any rate, that the speaker put on the statements contained in that document.  If that were so, the poor people's last case would be worse than their first. If they were on relief of some kind or another, and had to pay much higher rents than they had been paying in their other dwellings, having to deprive <Col N="502" /> themselves of the necessaries of life in order to do so, that would be a position in which none of us would like to take pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A document like that, in the hands of what the Deputy might refer to as politicians, would become a dangerous document if it could not be explained. Therefore, I propose to explain it here, not that it will do us any good at present, but it will get on the records of this House and will be available later on.  The position at present in connection with that particular matter is as follows: The corporation has a total of 13,755 families housed at the present moment.  Of those, 1,000 families are receiving relief.  The population that the corporation deals with amounts to about 70,000 persons. Out of that, 5,000 would be regarded as being on relief.  Of those 1,000 families, 446 owe nothing; they have paid their rents up-to-date.  The total weekly relief that those families get is £639, and their weekly rent is £287 9s. 7d.  The arrears due by those 1,000 families at present amount to £540 18s., so that at least 50 per cent. of those on relief pay their rents and are clear, and the other 50 per cent. do not starve because they do not pay their rents.  It is an extraordinary thing that at this time of our lives I have to put those figures before the representatives of the nation, but they are necessary because of statements made by men over there who have a great responsibility, but a responsibility which they do not seem to recognise. That would be a nice thing to spread all over the world&mdash;that families housed by the corporation have to starve in order to pay their rent. About 7 per cent. receive relief; it is not very high.  I do regret that there are so many, but certainly it is nothing to try to make any political capital out of.  In some of those districts where the corporation has dwellings the people are exceedingly poor.  They live on casual labour, having maybe one month's work and two or three months idle.  That type of men and women have to be housed by us. In some of those places it is extraordinary how well they pay their rent. Having referred to that portion, I was going to read out the various areas <Col N="503" /> in which those houses or flats are erected, but I will not take up the time of the House in doing so.  For the present I am satisfied to give those total figures, in order, as I said before, that they might be recorded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon last night went a good deal further.  He charged the Minister and his Department with the responsibility for the erection of the corporation dwellings.  They have no responsibility whatever for them.  The responsibility for those dwellings rests with the Dublin Corporation, and with nobody else.  It is true that, before the buildings are started, plans are submitted to the Local Government Department for their approval.  A certain standard is laid down by the Local Government Department, which must be followed by all local bodies who wish to erect dwellings.  That standard was fixed&mdash;this is important &mdash;by the late Government, after prolonged conference with their representatives in the year 1931.  When Deputy Dillon, or any other Deputy over there, complains about the size of the houses erected, he should remember that they are erected to the standard set up by the late Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon described a visit which he paid to the Anchor Brewery, as he called it.  It is now called Oliver Bond's house.  Why the corporation fixed that name on it I could never understand.  It is a matter of historical interest to those who think something of Dublin that Oliver Bond's house is in Bridge Street.  There is a marble slab on it, indicating that in that house he lived. It was erected in 1898 by the commemoration committees which existed in those days.  Right beside that house in Bridge Street the corporation has erected a large block of flats, and those would be the proper houses to which to apply the name of Oliver Bond, rather than to the Anchor Brewery site which is more than a stone's throw away.  This is a most historical neighbourhood, teeming with historical incidents, and I am sorry that the name is not locally applied to it.  He describes the <Col N="504" /> visit which he paid to Oliver Bond's house, otherwise the Anchor Brewery. Whether he went alone or was accompanied by anybody he did not say. He said that the Minister and the housing board ought to be ashamed of themselves&mdash;he used some such term&mdash;to have allowed such places to be erected; that no matter what were the position or circumstances of the people of Dublin who needed better accommodation the old ruins in which they had lived were lofty and airy, whereas the Deputy, with the brilliant vocabulary he has at his command, described these places as cubby-holes, dog-boxes, and things like that.  Now what are the facts?  These special flat dwellings&mdash;everybody I have met who has seen them has congratulated the corporation on their achievement &mdash;are erected on a site lately known as D'Arcy's Brewery.  The reason that it was selected for the carrying out of a housing scheme was this, that it was not necessary to disturb any existing tenant.  No one lived on the site.  That is always a great advantage in the City of Dublin: to be able to get a site where you have not to evict and get rid of people in order to pull down old houses and that class of thing.  It is true that a lot of old brewery buildings had to be pulled down, but, nevertheless, no tenant had to be disturbed.</P>
    <P>On that site we have erected a large number of flat dwellings, mostly of the three-roomed type.  The average size of the living-room is from 157 to 163 superficial feet.  The bedrooms have from 110 to 139, and the total space is 436 square feet.  In each of these flat dwellings they have a bath, hot and cold water, lavatory, scullery, etc., and the electric light is laid on.  For that accommodation they are asked to pay a rent of 6/- a week.  The total cost of the erection of each of these flats is about £524.  Now, the economic rent to be charged on an expenditure of £524 for the erection of a dwelling would be at least 15/- or 16/- a week, but the tenants in those flats are only asked to pay 6/- a week.  The flats have other amenities that it is not necessary for me to mention.  There is, for instance, a fine, spacious playground <Col N="505" /> for the children, and all the accommodation that is necessary for a comfortable home.  When I and others know the terrible state in which those people were living before they were put into those flats, I cannot understand the idea of any man standing up here to point the finger of scorn at the Minister or anybody else who has had anything to do with the provision of those flats.  I say that it is politics gone mad.  As a matter of fact, I ought to be very glad that the Deputy picked out this special case, because the fact of his doing so can, I think, be used with great effect at the coming elections.  It can be said, &ldquo;Here is a place where there are 300 families decently housed; they are all perfectly satisfied that they are getting splendid value.&rdquo;  It was only the other day that I met one of these people, and he said to me, &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Kelly, I never was as well off in my life as I am now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, the statement made here by the Deputy last night can be used with great effect at the coming elections.  I wonder why his Party allowed him to make such a statement. There are some supporters of the Deputy's Party on our housing committee, and I must say that they are splendid workers.  They take as much pride in this splendid work as I do myself.  I wonder why the Deputy did not make some inquiries from some of his colleagues.  One of them is Deputy Doyle, the Whip of the Deputy's Party. Deputy Doyle is a member of the housing committee, and takes a great interest in its work.  He knows this building well, and I am perfectly certain that if Deputy Dillon had made inquiries from him he would not have allowed the Deputy to make such a statement as he made last night.</P>
    <P>Now, what are the facts in connection with the relief business?  There are 62 families in this special block of flats on relief.  Their total weekly relief comes to £32 16s. 0d.  The rent they pay out of that is £15 12s. 1d., and the balance is due, so that the corporation have to bear the rent in some of those cases where the families are not able to pay.  That fact ought not to be made public.  Certainly it ought not to be presented here in the sense of political propaganda.  I do not <Col N="506" /> know that there is anything more that I have to say in connection with this rather unpleasant business.  I hope that, if other members of the Opposition propose to speak on this Vote, they will make some amends for the statements made by Deputy Dillon concerning this special work done by the corporation.  I do not know whether they will or not, but I suggest to them that they should.  I think they ought to ask Deputy Doyle to speak.  I would be very much interested to hear what he would say.  Last year I presented here a very melancholy picture of the conditions under which the very poor live in Dublin.  Here we are making a splendid effort to try and relieve that situation.  It is a very costly effort.  These flat dwellings with three rooms, with hot and cold water, a bath, and other amenities, are costing us £524 each to erect.  Just imagine what the cost is going to be when you have thousands and thousands of families in the city to be dealt with as the families in those flats have been.  The Government are blamed for spending money and for increasing the rates and taxes, but the rates and taxes must be increased if all this work is to be done, and done it will have to be, because those families in Dublin have made up their minds that they are not going to continue to live under the conditions in which they have been living any longer.  The corporation is very hard pressed, indeed, to carry out the work as quickly as it is necessary to be carried out.  I can tell members of the House that the demands for housing accommodation are extraordinarily heavy, and more especially for those flat dwellings rather than for the cottage dwellings in the suburbs.</P>
    <P>I have listened to complaints here about the condition of some new houses built in the country and in other places.  Complaints have been made about houses built in Bray. Deputy The O'Mahony who made those complaints was, I am sure, very conscientious and very sincere in the statements he made.  After all, I think many of those complaints can be explained.  For instance, some of the people in our new dwellings complain when the walls get damp.  They <Col N="507" /> say the houses are damp.  The architects and other experienced men point out that that is due to condensation. They point out that if the tenants would only leave the windows open and let in plenty of air there would not be very much trouble on that score.</P>
    <P>We are told that some of the fittings in the new houses are faulty. If that is so it is due to this, that it is the policy of the Minister and of the Executive Council that all the materials used in the building of these new houses must be of Irish manufacture as far as possible.  What happens in that connection?  That the fitments necessary for those houses are being manufactured here for the first time.  Take one fitment&mdash;the slop-stone.  We have trouble in connection with it.  I believe that in other countries slop-stones are made of white china or some such material. In this country they are making a substitute&mdash;concrete ones.  These have proved to be porous.  The water trickles through them.  They had to be taken out and others substituted. As regards matters of that kind, you are bound to have complaints, and especially from people who like to be grousing about the smallest possible fault.  Therefore, when I heard Deputy The O'Mahony speak about the tiles&mdash;he said he saw them being taken down and put back again&mdash;it occurred to me that probably the same thing had happened there as in the case of slop-stones&mdash;that they were Irish manufactured tiles, were probably the first products of the new factory, and not properly seasoned or dried.  These things, however, will pass away.</P>
    <P>We have demonstrated at any rate to those who make complaints to us that there is no fault to be put at anybody's door in connection with the matter, but that it was a genuine and patriotic effort to try and have all the fitments required in connection with these new houses made here.  The Minister was told by Deputy Dillon last night that it would be his last speech as Minister for Local Government, that the handwriting was on the <Col N="508" /> wall, and that the time was coming when he should give an account of his stewardship, and all that sort of talk.  Take care the boot is not on the other foot, because I think if Deputy Dillon continues his campaign there will not be sufficient of you left over there to keep yourselves warm when the election is over.  I would not like to see the Opposition done away with altogether; I would like to see some of them come back anyway. Some of them are very decent and quiet men, and I would certainly miss the pleasure of looking at them.</P>

I should like to see them back, but for the last three and a half years they have been doing nothing but grousing and producing documents and plans and resolutions about 20,000 men to be put into employment, and 80,000 men on top of them: about the rates which were to be reduced by £20,000,000 and all that class of thing.  For three and a half years I have been sitting here listening to them and looking at them holding up their documents.  Now they are dying and they are not repentant, evidently.  I would advise them that a death-bed repentance is even better than no repentance at all. Let them produce their plans for better housing in Dublin and in Kildare and other places and show how it can be done better.  If they cannot do that, I advise them not to be talking about it, as they might have a better chance.  The prospect looks very blue for them.  As this is a democratic institution, I would not like to see the Opposition wiped out altogether.  I should like to see some of them come back, and I hope that some of them will repent even at the last moment.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Kelly in dealing with the plans and promises.  I am sure the Minister, like the rest of his colleagues on the Front Bench, would like us to forget about all the <Col N="509" /> plans and promises.  Deputy Kelly apparently does not seem to relish opposition.  He seems to think that everything produced by Ministers is so perfect that it is not open to any opposition at all and that the country should submit to it meekly without raising any protest.  I am sure he will learn in time what constructive opposition does mean in this Dáil and in the country as well.  I have just a word of complaint, first of all about the delay in getting replies to applications for grants for the purpose of reconstructing houses or for new houses.  In many cases applicants have been waiting six months for a reply and they have not even received so far the printed card usually sent out from Government Departments.  I have also to complain of the delays, to me at least abnormal delays, in paying the balance of grants, especially in making final payments of the balance of grants to people who have either built new houses or reconstructed old houses. In fact the complaints from many parts of the country are exceedingly numerous under both the heads I have mentioned.  I hope the Minister will look into these two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an item in the Estimate to which I should like to refer briefly. I notice there is a provision of £132,750 made for the treatment of tuberculosis.  I have no doubt that that money is very well spent, but during the last few years I have met patients who have received treatment in these institutions; even during the past fortnight I met a patient who had just left one of these institutions. He was a very intelligent type of person and he really had not a good word to say for the treatment he received in that institution.  He complained of the indifference with which he was treated and, above all, of the lack, if you like, of proper medical attention.  His impression was that no attempt was being made to keep in touch with the developments which have taken place in other countries in the treatment of this disease; that we are still pursuing the methods of ten, 15, 20, 30 and 40 years ago, and that we are not making any attempt to modernise the institutions so as to bring them into line with the developments <Col N="510" /> which have taken place in the treatment of this disease in other European countries and especially, I believe, in many parts of the United States of America.  As I say, I have heard these complaints on very many occasions and I do think it is time that the Minister's attention was drawn to them and that he should cause an examination to be made into the manner in which these institutions are conducted and, above all, into the medical treatment given to patients. He might even go a step further and see if it is not possible to bring that treatment more into line with the modern developments which have taken place in the treatment of this disease in different countries.  It seems to be generally agreed, at least I have been told by many people, that the treatment in this country is far and away behind the treatment for that disease in continental countries and in the United States as well.  Deputy Rowlette yesterday drew attention to the fact that tuberculosis is on the increase in this country.  I was rather surprised at that statement, because I was under the impression that the disease was declining. But we have it on the authority of a medical man that it is on the increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That in itself, at any rate, provides the Minister with a reason, and a very sound reason, why he should cause an examination to be made into the whole question of the treatment of tuberculosis in sanitoria in this country.  I think some Deputy also called attention to the grants for unemployment relief and to the contributions which local authorities are asked to make towards the carrying out of the work for which these grants are provided.  It appears to me that the Minister imposes one condition which may operate quite satisfactorily and fairly in cities and perhaps in some towns, but which does not operate at all fairly or equitably in many counties.  I refer to the condition relating to the expenditure of money in the areas of greatest unemployment. It so happens that under the two or <Col N="511" /> three relief grants already given money has been spent in some counties in the same areas, and so long as relief grants are in existence it is only fair to assume that, in some counties at least, the money will continue to be spent in the same areas.</P>
      <P>After all, the conditions in the country are quite different from what they are in the cities and towns, and the same factors should not, in equity and justice, operate in regard to the expenditure of these grants in the county areas as in the cities and towns. If county councils are asked to make contributions from local rates, then it appears to be only fair and equitable that, at least, they should have some say in the manner in which the money should be spent.  It is a recognised democratic principle that there should be no contribution without representation. In this instance, the Minister is asking members of public bodies to contribute money from the rates for the purpose of relieving unemployment, and yet the members of these bodies have not a word to say as to how or where the money should be spent.  On the face of it that seems to be an absolutely unfair principle, one that the Minister will find it very difficult to justify.  I submit it is time that that condition in any event, was waived, or, at least, relaxed somewhat in country areas, because the Minister will find from his experience that as long as these conditions continue they merely stereotype the expenditure of that money in the same areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas that require relief.  The registers at the unemployment exchanges do not contain the names of all the people who are entitled to assistance under relief schemes.  There are still many people in this country who, for personal reasons, refuse to register, because they feel, notwithstanding all the social legislation that has been passed, that some form of stigma attaches to registration.  For that reason they will not allow their names to go on such registers.  Nevertheless, in the very areas in which they live, and very often they are the areas which contribute the rates most regularly to the local exchequers, there is just as <Col N="512" /> much hardship and poverty as in the areas where the major portion of the unemployment money is spent.  I suggest to the Minister that it is time to have an examination made into the manner in which this condition works out throughout the country, and that he should see that it is relaxed to enable county councils to exercise some slight authority in regard to the expenditure of the money.  The Minister stated yesterday that the Estimate provided roughly £1,000,000 for expenditure on social services. The amount this year is approximately the same as last year.  From the debate that has taken place I think it is perfectly fair to say that the expenditure of money on new buildings, sewerage, drainage and work in connection with public institutions, has been rushed, with the result that the country is not getting the full value for the money spent.  I submit as I submitted on the discussion of this Estimate last year, that to spend £1,000,000 on social services in a small State like this is too much for any single year.  It is characteristic of Fianna Fáil Estimates, and has been characteristic of that Party since it came into office, that they must rush expenditure at a breakneck pace, regardless of the financial consequences involved and the good of the State.  In this instance, they are spending a lot of money on social services instead of spreading the expenditure over a few years.  I submitted on a previous occasion that if the State is to get full value for that money, the spending of it must of necessity be spread over a period of years, and a fairly lengthy period.  You cannot get such work carried out in a few years.  If there is to be efficiency and full value got for the money and, above all, if the expenditure is to be proportioned according to the capacity of the ratepayers to bear it, it is necessary to insist on spreading it over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister in justification of this expenditure said that, to a certain extent, the rates were coming in better this year than in previous years.  That may be so.  I wonder will that continue.  I hope it does. As they believe that the public institutions <Col N="513" /> must be kept up the people will certainly pay rates before they pay shopkeepers or other debts.  Certainly, the ordinary country people believe in paying rates, and paying them promptly, if they are able to do so.  There is increased expenditure in this Estimate to the extent of £5,000 on salaries, wages and allowances, and there are other substantial increases.  The tendency is for the expenditure on the Department to increase, just as it is increasing in every other Department of the Government. If expenditure continues to mount at the present rate, does the Minister feel confident that the people in the country districts will be as well able to pay the rates as last year?  I doubt it very much.  Many people are meeting their liabilities up to the present out of savings that were made in the past.  These savings are now exhausted, owing to the operation of the Fianna Fáil policy, and I want to warn the Minister that in future he may find it more difficult to get in rates than it was during the past year.  For that reason, I submit it is his duty to keep expenditure down to the lowest possible point consistent with the efficient administration of his Department.  Deputy Minch spoke about defects in house building.  I do not want to make any complaint, but I could give some details if I wished.  Complaint is fairly general, but it is only another illustration of the result of the rushing that takes place in connection with these schemes.  As long as that rush continues there cannot be efficiency, and the State cannot expect to get full and adequate value for the money being spent.  As the Minister ought to know conditions in the country intimately it is time that he gave consideration to the points raised.  I hope that he will give consideration to the first point I mentioned, as I should like to have a reassuring statement on that as well as the other questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on the statement that he made to the House.  When we <Col N="514" /> realise the responsibility and work of the Department throughout the Free State we can form some little conception of the work of the Minister in connection with this Estimate.  Very little criticism of the Department has been offered and anything I say will be more of a helpful nature than of an attack.  The housing department came in for some criticism, but I am proud of the fact that I am connected with many public bodies that took advantage of the legislation that has been passed in order to have houses built for the people in urban and the rural areas.  I can speak with some knowledge of the subject, because these bodies occupy a premier place, having regard to population, in that respect, and endeavoured to meet the wishes of the people by providing them with decent and comfortable houses.  Those in touch with the housing department have some idea of the work done by that department, and they realise that it is anxious to meet the wishes of Deputies and the clamour of people who are looking for houses.  The housing department is always anxious and willing to assist representatives of public bodies to get over difficulties in connection with their plans for housing schemes in different areas.  I can speak with some knowledge, having received great assistance from the officials of the housing department from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one feature I criticise, and my criticism is not on the lines of Deputy Roddy's, who complained of an increase of £5,000 in the Estimate. Social services have been increased in the last two or three years and, with those increased social services, you cannot expect the same staff to run a Department.  I do criticise, however, the Department's policy of starting engineers at a miserable pittance of £250 a year, and I say it is a scandal for any Government to ask any qualified engineer to come into the service as temporary engineer or inspector at a salary of £200 or £300 a year.  Acting as clerk of works to a public body, the same engineer will receive a much higher salary, six or seven guineas a week, <Col N="515" /> and the public body will be glad to avail of his services.  The Department, however, expects an engineer to go around the country at a salary of £250 or £300 a year.  You will not get good engineers at that figure and, if you are fortunate enough to get them, you will not have them for a very long time.  I would prefer to see a salary fixed that would give an engineer some contentment in his position and leave him independent of any contractor or public body he might come in contact with.</P>
    <P>We must realise that it is not possible to carry on such work as the care of the blind, provision for widows and orphans, old age pensions, the poor and sick, hospitals, houses, sewerage and roads for the Twenty-Six Counties with a small staff, and I think the officials of the Department are to be congratulated because, from the highest to the lowest, they are prepared to meet any Deputy or any member of a body and ready to assist and advise as to what is best to be done.  They do not always agree to the proposals put up to them, but you have to accept their decision as being in the best interest of all concerned.</P>
    <P>We have heard complaints from the Labour Benches in respect of houses built in County Kildare.  I remember some years ago the argument put up by the Department to us in Wicklow as to Kildare being able to build houses so cheaply.  We had yesterday from Deputy Norton an explanation with regard to these houses and we saw that, although they appeared to be cheap at the time, they have proved to be very expensive houses.  It is very easy for a man not connected with a public body to criticise public administration, as Deputy Tom Kelly has pointed out.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy The O'Mahony with regard to the complaints of the tenants in Wolfe Tone Square in Bray. He has not exaggerated in the least, and I can go further because I have a signed document from the secretary of the tenants.  I have no complaint to make against the present administrators of Bray, because the baby has been handed over to the public body <Col N="516" /> there.  The price given for land in Bray was enormous&mdash;£200 an acre for a swamp&mdash;and the tenants are now asked to pay the enormous amount given for that swamp.  The urban council is in an unfortunate position, and I say that it is not fair for men to attack public bodies because public bodies are always guided by their officials.  Their engineers and executive officers are solely responsible and, if any blame is to be attached to anybody, I hold that it rests on the officials, and not on the members of the body, because the members have very little power at present and are advised and guided by their executive officers who are in receipt of good salaries.  Where the fault is, I do not know, but with the position of the Bray Urban Council, with the heavy rates and with the financial position of the tenants of these houses, it is a serious matter for the local ratepayers if there is to be further expenditure to put these houses in a habitable state.</P>
    <P>Deputies cannot expect the housing department to have inspectors present all the time where houses are being built, when you have a clerk of works and an engineer there being paid good salaries.  There is a problem to be faced in Bray.  The people are unable to meet their demands, and if something is not done, there will be no use in having county hospitals and county medical officers.  According to the signed statement I have from the Bray association, the beds in these houses have to be moved to the centre of the rooms.  Damp is coming in and there is water outside, even on the concrete paths.  People going into these houses at times of flooding have to walk through five or six inches of water.  The Bray Urban Council is not in a position financially to remedy this state of affairs.  There must be a special grant given to deal with the situation, because the £120 suggested by Deputy The O'Mahony will not remedy conditions in these houses.  I should like to know what was the Government engineer's report following his two visits to these houses?  I understand that the council did not accept that report, but I certainly say that something will have <Col N="517" /> to be done.  The houses must not be left in their present state, and if there is a further increase in the rates, the residents in these houses will be affected, and they are already paying very large rents for them.</P>
    <P>Complaint has been made as to delay in the issuing of reports in connection with housing schemes by the Department.  We have a similar complaint in connection with Wicklow housing schemes.  We had an inquiry, I think, last July, and the Minister has attacked public bodies for not taking advantage of his Housing Acts. I am satisfied, however, that it is not the fault of the Department or the local bodies that the report is not issued, and, having received information from the Department, I am satisfied that we will have their report very soon.  Where you have a big housing scheme and a public body anxious to get on with the scheme and a Government anxious to assist it, you will find some faults, but I make a special appeal to the Minister to take the Bray situation in hands and see if anything can be done to improve the position of the tenants.  If not, there will be chaos in the Bray area, because you cannot expect people to pay the high rents which these people are paying for those houses, and not have houses as good as those which they were forced to leave.  I can give the Minister full information as to the position, and I say that the officials in charge, let it be who it will, the executive officers and not the council members are the persons I hold responsible for whatever has happened in Bray.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was giving grants for roads, and some Deputies have complained that there was not a substantial grant given for roads other than trunk roads.  County councils are enabled, under the grants for the relief of unemployment, to make money available for roads other than trunk or main roads, but there is a condition that the work must be provided in districts where the greatest number of unemployed is.  It often happens that the road in the district in which is the greatest <Col N="518" /> number of unemployed is in a good condition and it is not possible to expend money on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister should make it a condition of these relief grants in every case that the public body concerned should put up a certain percentage.  A special appeal has been made in connection with the road grants on behalf of Kerry.  We claim that a larger number of cars, registered and insured, from other parts of Ireland and from abroad, pass through County Wicklow than pass through any other county.  For that reason, we should receive a grant substantially greater than that given to the other counties. Our roads are used by people from all over Ireland and by people from other countries, and it is not fair to ask the ratepayers of the county to keep the roads in order for the benefit of people from other areas.  The Tourist Association recognises the special claims of Wicklow and I hope that, in considering the appeals made on behalf of Kerry, the Minister will not forget the claims of Wicklow.  As I pointed out, relief grants have been made available on condition that the public bodies put up a certain amount of the money.  It is hard lines on the unemployed in certain areas when relief grants are not made available because the local authority may not have been able to fulfil its obligations regarding the repayment of loans to the Board of Works.  If a public body has failed to repay its loans, the grant is not made available and the unemployed of the area suffer in consequence. When the Minister is satisfied that default in repayment of the loans is not due to maladministration but is due to financial stringency, he should relax that rule.  Special consideration should be given to Bray urban area so that the position of the unemployed men there may be eased. The Minister should not make it a condition of any grant he may make to Bray Urban Council that a certain amount should be put up from the rates.  In that area the council have had this baby of the housing scheme handed over to them.  Much as they would wish to avail of any grants, <Col N="519" /> they may be reluctant to do so when it means that 40 or 50 per cent. of the money may have to be raised from the rates.</P>
    <P>There is a great agitation in that area regarding the rents and they are putting the blame on the Minister's Department.  They state that they are willing to reduce the rents in Bray if the sanction of the Minister's Department is forthcoming.  I agree with Deputy Holohan that, even in the rural areas, the rents are too high. We had the admission from the Minister for Agriculture to-day that the highest wage paid to agricultural workers in what was practically an urban area was 24/- a week and broken time.  That means that if they were able to put in a full week and get the Government grant, they would receive 24/-.  If 24/- is the maximum wage paid by farmers, 2/10 is too high a rate to pay for a cottage in the rural areas.  I hope the Minister will agree with the public bodies when they ask him to have the rent of new houses fixed at the same figure as that for the old houses&mdash;about 1/6 per week.  The argument can be used now that, as admitted by the Minister for Agriculture, 24/- is the maximum wage paid to rural labourers.</P>
    <P>There has been great criticism of the Housing Board.  I had personal experience of an area in which the public body concerned refused to proceed with the building of houses although over 500 houses had been condemned by the medical officer of health.  Special appeals made by the Department failed to induce the public body to take action and to provide houses for people who were living in condemned habitations.  Then, a member of the Housing Board arranged to meet representatives of the urban council and of the ratepayers.  The result was that agreement was obtained and that a housing scheme was proceeded with.  Under that scheme, 200 houses have been provided for people who were living in condemned hovels.  The houses which have been built are amongst the best in the country, fine brick houses.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary for the Minister <Col N="520" /> to amend the Housing Act.  A difficult position arises in the case of a house which, conscientiously, you could not condemn but which you might include in a clearance order. In that event, you could not give compensation to the owner; you could only give him site value.  I think there should be some amendment of the Act which would permit an engineer or valuer to give market value for such a house instead of depriving a man of the little income which he may be deriving from it.  As Deputy Corish pointed out, building costs have increased by about 20 per cent. and it will no longer be possible to get a house built at an all-in cost of £300.  Without the co-operation of the public bodies, the Department of Local Government would not be able to bring its housing policy to the point of success which we all desire it to reach.  I am glad that there is close co-operation between these bodies and the Local Government Department and I hope it will continue.  I trust, too, that the advice which is tendered to local bodies by the Department will continue because, in that way, public men will be able to improve the schemes mapped out in their area.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to allocate an extra grant in those rural areas where schemes have been initiated so that the good work may be continued without imposing an undue burden on the people.  I ask the Minister not to turn down the appeal made by Deputy The O'Mahony on behalf of the tenants of the houses in Bray.  I hope his Department will help the Bray Urban Council to get out of the difficulty they are in in connection with the repair of these houses.  In future, I think that the executive officer or town clerk should be held personally responsible in these matters for seeing that the engineers carry out their work.  I am not attaching any blame to the Local Government Department. I do not expect their engineers to go down daily to see how the work is being carried out.  No matter what engineering supervision you may have or what vigilance you may exercise, if a contractor is anxious to deprive a council of the workmanship to which <Col N="521" /> they are entitled, he will do so.  I congratulate the Minister on his work. He has a huge administrative task and I am glad that there is such a good co-operative spirit between the public bodies and his Department.  In that way, greater social services will be carried out.  I hope the Minister will not be worried by Deputy Roddy's criticism of the £5,000 increase in his Department.  I trust he will take his courage in his hands and, instead of engaging temporary staff, pay permanent engineers a living wage.  If there is an adequate and well paid staff, there will be fewer complaints in connection with housing schemes. Some Deputies who have spoken here have very little conception of the work involved in initiating and pushing forward a big scheme.</P>

      <P>I think we all feel that there are few pleasanter and more instructive hours spent in this House than those hours in which the Estimate for Local Government and Public Health is being discussed.  One gets the impression then, as rarely else, that we are really here a united and a very intelligent family, if I may say so, with <i>pater familias,</i> our genial Minister, giving us all the attention we need.  I notice that the criticism is nearly always very helpful and the suggestions are always constructive. From all sides of the House the Minister has been congratulated on the magnificent work done by his Department.  The excellence of that work cannot, I think, be questioned. This is not merely a matter of complacency on our part because I think outsiders are also impressed.  This was brought home to me recently in a very interesting way which perhaps the House would like to hear.  In connection with the Paris Exhibition the woman editor of one of the great Parisian dailies is bringing out a kind of account of the social work done in every country in Europe, and women writers from every country were invited to tell what their respective countries had done for mothers and children from the earliest ages, and what they are doing to-day.  It fell to my lot&mdash;I think I was selected because I was a member of this House <Col N="522" />&mdash;to write the Irish section.  I was glad to be able to tell what Ireland has done from the earliest ages for our mothers and children.  As those interested know, the Brehon laws were very advanced on the matter of child welfare.  So that child welfare as understood now by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is not a new thing in this country.  I was invited at the end of my contribution to give a synopsis of what is being done at present. Through the great courtesy of the Minister's private secretary, whom I wish to thank, I got an account from the Department of what was being done.  Deputy Tom Kelly also got from the town clerk an account of what was being done in the matter of child welfare in Dublin.  These I put as a synopsis at the end of my article and I received a congratulatory note from the lady who has undertaken the task of editing the work in question.  She said she was absolutely astonished at what had been done.  She asked my permission to write an article in her paper on what Ireland was doing in the matter of maternity and child welfare.</P>
      <P>I hope we will continue on those lines, and when other people are spending money on bombs we will be spending money on babies.  I think we are giving a lead to the world in that respect.  Perhaps I might also add to what the Minister mentioned in connection with the Infant Aid Society.  That society has done extremely useful work.  It is charged at present with the administration in Dublin of the money voted in this House for free milk.  From the very earliest stages of its activities it insisted that no milk that was not tubercle free, and tested as such, should be distributed.  That is a practice that should be followed.  I think the purest milk in the world is produced in Dublin, and the Infant Aid Society is largely responsible for it&mdash;in as much as the Infant Aid Society insists on pure milk for the children to whom the milk is sent.</P>

    <P>I noticed that Deputy Tom Kelly did not agree with what Deputy Dillon said about the flats on the Anchor <Col N="523" /> Brewery site.  I do not often disagree with Deputy Tom Kelly, but I do on this occasion.  There was a great deal of Deputy Dillon's speech with which I found myself in agreement.</P>

      <P>I am not going into what Deputy Dillon said about the Anchor Brewery flats.  Of that I know nothing.  I am aware that in country houses the big kitchen is the most important part of the house.  I do think that very great care should be paid in all schemes to the type of grates and fire-places used.  In Galway we have had rather an unfortunate experience in this matter.  As Deputies know, we in Galway are a turf-burning community.  Open fire-places had always been used for the burning of turf but in the Galway housing schemes this was lost sight of. I do not think that happened really during the régime of the present Minister.  At all events, ranges were used in the new houses.  Anybody will tell you that the ordinary range is a model of inefficiency but for turf-burning purposes it is absolutely useless. Because of that, the most comfortable part of the Irish home is being very largely interfered with; we have not had the proper type of grates in the new schemes.  On the housing board I think it should be possible to have at least one woman member. She would understand the question of fuel and things like that.  In other countries these matters are better arranged.</P>
      <P>Recently I got some papers from Belgium in connection with the rural section of their Catholic Workers' League.  There they go into the problem of the sort of houses that add to the family comfort and promote efficiency amongst the women and housewives. Perhaps on another occasion I may have an opportunity of speaking more fully on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that was mentioned in the course of this debate was the necessity for sanitary school-houses. These are absolutely necessary.  If we compel children to go to school <Col N="524" /> it is up to us to see that the children have a sanitary school-house.  Why I mention this matter at all is that it has been put to me in connection with the school meals for children.  A great deal of the difficulty that arose in the existing school-houses was in connection with getting these meals for the children.  This defect might be remedied in the new schools.  I suggest that there should be in all girls' schools a little kitchen where the simpler culinary operations should be taught. They would have the further advantage that the school meals could be given in comfort in such schools.  I know that in certain parts of the country there is no provision in the school-houses for keeping the bread. The loaves are delivered once or twice a week and there is no way of storing them.  The school meals, therefore, lose much of their value because of this lack.  The provision of such a kitchen would be a great advantage. We should so arrange the school-houses that the older schoolgirls would be able to help to cook soup especially; that would be of great advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of county homes.  I think I feel in the same way about these as does Deputy Dillon. When this Estimate was being discussed last year I made a suggestion that, perhaps, instead of trying to do something with the existing county homes, most of which were converted workhouses and not very suitable as county homes, attempts should be made when old mansions are in the market to have them purchased for this purpose.  These will make excellent homes for the old people.  If there was some place where the old men could go out with garden tools and do a bit of gardening it would be of very great advantage to them and to the county home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the desirability of training girls from the Gaeltacht as nurses.  He said that the facilities offered by the Government for the training of nurses from the Gaeltacht had never been availed of. I think the reason is that the people do not know about it.  I drew the attention of a vocational officer in <Col N="525" /> Galway to the matter and he had not heard of it before.  I am glad that Deputy Dillon has mentioned it and that this opportunity has been offered of using the publicity properties of this House to tell the people that there are such facilities being offered, that there are such opportunities for girls in the Gaeltacht to get trained as nurses.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made by Deputy Dillon, with which I am in complete agreement, has reference to the extension of the services of district nurses.  He stressed the difficult conditions produced in many Irish homes in cases of permanent illness, where, for instance, there might be a case of paralysis or something of that nature, and no doubt a district nurse in such circumstances would be of incalculable help.  Incidentally, she would be in a position to teach the woman of the house how to produce invalid dietary.  It is extraordinary how very little people in the country know about the simple remedies and the simple foods that would help convalescence.  Of course, there are administrative and pecuniary difficulties in relation to those things, but if it were possible, those ideas ought to be carried into practice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion of pensions for nurses, since it has been mentioned, I may say that we on this side of the House are very sympathetic to such a proposal.  I may say that Deputy Miss Pearse and myself met representatives of the nurses and it was pointed out to them the spade-work that would have to be done and the difficulties that would have to be overcome before what we all earnestly desire to see could come to anything.</P>
    <P>An important matter was raised in this debate by Deputy Rowlette, who drew attention to the tremendous mortality among illegitimate children. Of course, it is not a question that we can discuss at any great length here.  Obviously, every effort should be made in the direction of having those children born in wedlock and every possible step should be taken in relation to the protection of the mothers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> I take advantage of this opportunity to draw to the attention of the Minister a very helpful suggestion made by Miss Elizabeth O'Connor with regard to the establishment of a hostel for domestic helpers in this city.  She pointed out that, largely owing to a change in the way of living, the people are taking more and more to small houses in Dublin and there is not room for the domestic help to live in.  That means that girls coming from the country, instead of sleeping in their employers' houses, are obliged to seek lodgings outside and it is not very easy to get the proper type of lodging.  It is not easy to save these girls from the dangers that await them.  She made an excellent suggestion that there should be a hostel where domestic helpers could get training such as would enable them to command really good wages and, if they were working by the day, the hostel could be run in such a way that they could go to it and live a sort of home life there.  There are a great many organisations that would, I am sure, give assistance in this direction if the Minister would indicate his approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to help the Minister out of what has become a somewhat serious difficulty.  I refer to slippery roads.  I notice all the county councils are gravely concerned with this matter.  People using these roads, other than motorists, find it impossible to bring animals along them.  It is really very difficult to take horses or cattle or sheep or pigs along those modern roads.  We all want to see the motorist having the best possible value in return for the money he pays.  It would not be fair to collect road tax from the motorists and not give them good roads in return.  But perhaps a scheme could be devised by which the motorists could get satisfactory roads and accommodation could at the same time be made for other sections of the community. I am sure all classes would be glad to co-operate in the perfection of such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that instead of finishing off the tar-sprayed road with <Col N="527" /> limestone chippings a harder type of grit should be used.  For instance, it would be much better if white sand or gravel from the quarries were utilised over the tarred surface.  I believe if that were done there would be no fear of slipping.  This is not purely theory. I have seen the idea put into practice by the assistant surveyor in County Cavan.  It was done at my suggestion on the most slippery part of the road and that surface was not at all slippery for a considerable period afterwards while the material was on the surface. There is an unlimited supply of that material to be got in County Cavan and if it is used there will be no such thing as slippery roads.  The expense involved would be very little.  I believe, in fact, that money would be saved by using this material.</P>
    <P>When the hot weather comes in June or July it might be advisable to have plenty of this material thrown along the slippery roads.  When the tar gets soft this white sand and gravel would become embedded in it and that would not only make the roads safe but it would add considerably to their durability.  I ask the Minister to take a note of that.  If he recommends the county councils to use this type of material on the road surface I can assure him it will solve a problem that is causing the whole country a terrible amount of worry and is often responsible for serious accidents.  Hundreds of people are kept from using the roads because of the danger to themselves and their live stock.  In many cases their horses and cattle get their legs broken and there are many accidents to the people themselves.  This is a most important matter, because it means the making of safer roads. My suggestion will not entail any considerable expense and it will not deprive the motorists of good roads.</P>
    <P>The farmers are taking a very serious view of the attitude of the Local Government Department.  It seems to be the policy of the Department to have the roads kept in a slippery condition notwithstanding that every county council is in favour of making the roads safer.  I believe the engineering staffs are not going the right way <Col N="528" /> about it.  They must be well aware that if they use these white chippings to which I have referred there will be no such thing as slippery roads.  The Minister at least should recommend to the county councils an experiment on the lines I have suggested.  If they experiment in a small way I can assure the Minister that everyone will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken about the innovation with regard to inducing local bodies to contribute to the unemployment grant.  I think that is not fair, because in the particular counties where the expenditure of the relief grants is most necessary the ratepayers are less able to pay their share, and if they do not contribute their share the grant is lost.  That is a bad system.  A central body should be made responsible for the relief of unemployment.  There is a general complaint about the Department's attitude.  I hope that in future the Minister will allocate the grant to each county and, if the councils wish to add money to it, well and good, but the Minister should not make it a condition that they put up portion of the money.  Every section of the community is complaining of that, and I hope the Minister will not go on those lines in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the administration of the housing grants, Sir, I congratulate the Minister and his Department, and, although I have a couple of items to which I wish to refer this evening, it is not in criticism of the administration of the Department.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is his intention to devote any of the £5,000 extra for administration, which appears in the Estimate, to the appointment of additional inspectors for the carrying out of the reconstruction grants.  I find that in the county I represent considerable delays have taken place in having the inspection carried out and that the system there is not working satisfactorily.  I have satisfied myself that it is not the fault of the inspector.  He can only do a week's work in a week and, ofttimes, when I make inquiries as to his whereabouts, I find that he is <Col N="529" /> doing work in an adjoining county. Now, County Meath is a fairly extensive county, and I do think there is ample work there for a whole-time inspector doing whole-time work.</P>
      <P>There are applicants in the county waiting for their grants, which have been held up for a considerable time past, and they are anxious to settle their accounts with the merchants and with the contractors: that is, where the work has been completed.  Where new applications have come in, however, the applicants would be glad to know if they can go forward with the work so as to have the reconstruction started while the weather is good. What I would suggest to the Minister is that he should consider the advisability of appointing an extra inspector at least in that particular area until all arrears of work have been cleared off.  I must say that some very wonderful achievements have been carried out in the way of reconstruction.  I have seen old hovels of small-holdings that have been converted into very decent houses as a result of the £40 grants that have been given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, but I do think that it is a rather general complaint, because I have heard other Deputies refer to it with regard to their own counties.  However, in County Meath a cottage scheme was put into operation. Cottages were erected and the contractors were paid for their work, and afterwards it was found that the work was not satisfactory.  Now, let me say that the contractors were not at fault; neither were the board of health at fault, nor the officials of the board of health.  It appears that the plans adopted were defective and that the specifications, as carried out by the contractors or by the engineers, did not work out satisfactorily.  I refer to the general complaint of chimneys that will not draw smoke or will not function as it was intended they should function in these cottages. In a number of cases it has been pointed out that during the winter months the tenants of these cottages were compelled to leave the <Col N="530" /> door and one window, or sometimes two windows, open in order to create a draught so that the smoke would go out the window.  Of course, we are all aware of the fact that smoke is very objectionable, especially where people are compelled to live during the day and where they have to sit at the fire in the evenings.  Furthermore, it discolours the walls and the furniture and it adds to the general discomfort of the tenant and his family.  I am satisfied that, in the schemes which are contemplated to be carried out in the near future, these defects will not show themselves&mdash; that we have learned from experience and that the board of health will ensure that this will not arise again. What I want to point out to the Minister, however, is that something must be done to alleviate the hardships inflicted upon these tenants.  I would suggest that he should have the whole position examined with a view to having some suggestion made that would help to remedy the defects.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, as far as the giving of money is concerned, the Minister has done all in his power. He has urged local authorities to go forward with their housing schemes. He has not been stinting the authorities, nor has he held up money in any way in connection with the reconstruction grants.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister will do all in his power in that connection, and I am sorry that I have to make this little complaint about the houses that have been built in the past, and I hope he will see his way to do something in connection with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers have stressed the point&mdash;and I think most of us would agree with it&mdash;that this Department of Local Government is a many-sided Department and that those elected to administer local government works would need to have a great deal of time at their disposal because it is highly technical and very detailed in its work.  The county councillor who is a member, not alone of the county council, but of the various other committees, such as the board of health, the mental hospital <Col N="531" /> board, and all that sort of thing, is engaged on practically a full-time job, and one has the greatest sympathy, not alone with the Minister in administering his Department, but with those who, under the present system, are charged with its administration in the different areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern has just mentioned&mdash;and I understand other Deputies also spoke about it&mdash;the problem of the slippery roads.  That is a natural outcome of the modern demand for a better surface.  Many suggestions are put forward to remedy that, and we who live in the country, and who have to drive our cattle along the roads, would be grateful for a solution of this problem.  I think it would be very comforting if the Minister would put out a special circular to the many engineers&mdash;and I should like to call them competent engineers&mdash;that we have throughout the length and breadth of the Free State, with a view to remedying this problem.  It has become more acute in recent years owing to other legislation that we have passed in this House.  Before the Transport Act came into full operation we could be neighbourly, and those farmers or carriers, who were fortunate enough to possess a lorry, could leave our cattle at the different markets for a small consideration.  Under the operation of the Transport Act things are not so easy because the former carriers have been put off the roads and instead we have the railway company who do not cater in the same way for us, so that the problem of slippery roads is becoming much more acute since the coming into operation of the Transport Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about housing. It is a great source of satisfaction to people generally to see all over the country improvements in the dwellings of the people.  Much progress has been made in that respect for many years.  Housing was seized upon in the early years after the war as a means by which useful employment could be given, the condition of the people could be improved, and <Col N="532" /> homes generally of a better standard could be provided.  We all say &ldquo;more power&rdquo; to the Minister for Local Government if he can carry on and extend housing schemes still further. There are a few suggestions which I would make in all humility to him.  I see by the Estimates that we are giving an extra £51,821 to the housing department.  I would suggest to the Minister that we have had now a considerable number of years' experience of housing and it is full time that we pushed for a better type of house.  I do not see that it is going to cost us much more.  I couple this suggestion with the fact that we are taking a certain responsibility for the treatment of tuberculosis.  It cannot be denied that whilst we have built numerous labourers' cottages and have given many reconstruction grants, we have, after all, what may be described as very low cabins.  If we are to give a helping hand to those responsible for the treatment of tuberculosis, I think one very fruitful way of helping them would be to ensure that there are sleeping apartments upstairs in these houses.  I do not mean to say that for all labourers' cottages and for all houses built or reconstructed with the aid of grants, we should stipulate for a full two-storey house but we could arrange that in the majority of cases, there would be an upstairs in the house.</P>
    <P>All of us know from experience the difference between sleeping on the ground floor and sleeping upstairs. Many of these houses are put in situations where one-storey houses should not be erected.  The ideal site for a bungalow or a cottage is an elevated position, but one finds that frequently in the country they are built at the foot of a hill or in a very low situation. In such cases, we are not getting the full benefit of the money spent on the housing scheme.  Many years ago when I was a member of a rural district council I advocated that in building houses for labourers we should arrange for sleeping accommodation upstairs.  In one district in the county that suggestion was carried out, and to-day the houses there are of a much better type than other <Col N="533" /> houses that have been built.  They cost practically nothing more than if they were erected according to another plan.  I would suggest to the Minister that we should make a push towards that end, and that especially in making reconstruction grants, we should insist that as far as possible there should be sleeping accommodation upstairs in houses on which such grants are expended.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the standard of the work done on these houses.  I do not want to add very much to the complaints that have been made, but I know from experience that the work on many of the houses that have been built could have been of a much higher standard.  After all, we are investing this money on behalf of the State in these houses and we expect the houses to last longer than our own day.  Unless the materials and the workmanship are up to a fairly reasonable standard, they will not last a very long time.  Complaints have been made about raindown, leakages and one thing or another, and a number of Deputies have mentioned that there are general complaints about smoke.  Broadly speaking, I think my suggestion if it were carried out would help towards a solution of that problem.  I would also suggest to the Minister that grants should be made available for reconstruction purposes for persons with a higher valuation than £25.  In these days a person living on a holding of £25, is not a man of very great resources.  Even the person living on a holding of £30 valuation, is not a man of very great means.  I think a very good argument can be put forward for extending these grants to people with a higher valuation than £25.  We want not alone to encourage people with valuations of £25 and under to erect decent houses, but also to give some incentive to others even with a higher valuation to erect proper dwellings.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another matter for which there is no particular heading in the Estimate but, as it is the officers of our county councils who collect the money, I think I should be permitted to refer to it, namely, the collection <Col N="534" /> of road tax on motor cars.  The manner in which it is being collected is hardly fair to the poorer man.  There are many people who have not the money to take out a year's tax on January 1st.  If a man takes it out per quarter he pays considerably more.  That I think is hardly fair to the poorer section of the community who have not the ready cash to pay a year's tax. There is another matter in that connection for which I think there is no redress.  Some of these people may pay the tax on a motor car or a motor lorry which is perhaps not of the very best construction.  If such a vehicle meets with an accident in the first month of the year I think it would be only reasonable that that person should get a refund of the amount paid or that the tax should be transferred to another vehicle.  If he has to scrap the vehicle, at present he loses whatever tax he has paid upon it.  I bring that matter to the Minister's notice as one that should in all fairness be remedied.  If a person meets with an accident and his vehicle is smashed or put out of commission after his road tax has been paid, he gets no allowance or refund under present conditions.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is perhaps a detail but which is, nevertheless, worthy of the Minister's attention has reference to our institutions throughout the country and to the dietary scale in them.  In the different institutions the practice is to take tenders for the supply of bread.  As far as I understand it, it is white bread for breakfast, dinner, tea and supper, without any variation.  Complaints have reached me in respect of that.  In those days when we are preaching so much about the value of brown bread and about producing bread from whole-meal, why should we deprive the people in institutions of a change of food?  I do not see why there should be any extra cost.  If we were served in the restaurant here with the one kind of food every day I am sure we would be going elsewhere to give our patronage.  Another thing I understand is that the supply of vegetables to our institutions is very poor.  There is not at all the quantity that there <Col N="535" /> should be, especially in country institutions where there is accommodation for raising a lot of vegetables to vary the diet.  I suggest to the Minister that provision ought to be made for greater variety of a healthier nature. In those institutions we are told that many of the people suffer from various forms of stomach trouble.</P>
    <P>I should also like to and my plea to that which Deputy Mrs. Concannon has made about nurses, although perhaps not under the same heading.  In the winter time, when there are epidemics of 'flu in the country I think we should have further development in regard to the supply of nurses available in the homes of the poor.  I think those suggestions are worthy of the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for me to congratulate the Minister; that has been done by the majority of the Deputies who have spoken.  I was glad to hear Longford mentioned in the Minister's speech yesterday as one of the six counties that were taking full advantage of the reconstruction grants, but I have to complain that since January last we have had no reconstruction inspector, with the result that a lot of people are in a bad way with houses finished and half finished.  Again, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the matter of new houses.  Complaints have reached me&mdash;whether well-founded or not I cannot say&mdash;that people made application six months ago, but no inspector has called so far.  In regard to reconstruction, I should like to refer to a matter which I touched on last year, namely, that the Minister should consider raising the valuation for reconstruction grants.  I would suggest that on £20 valuation there should be a £40 grant; on £30 valuation, a £30 grant, and on £40 valuation, a £20 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to suggest to the Minister that he should look into the matter with the Minister for Lands to see if anything could be done for those small farmers who would get the grant but have not sufficient money to build new houses, <Col N="536" /> and under existing arrangements loans do not seem to be practicable. Perhaps he could, with the Minister for Lands, arrange some scheme under which loans could be added on to the annuities over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Longford hospital, I do not like to go into the matter of who is to blame and who is not to blame.  The matter seemed to be held up at headquarters, although latterly the trouble seems to be at the other end.  I would ask the Minister to look into it, as Longford is in a very bad way for a hospital, and there is very poor provision there for the sick.  I may say that there is no accommodation whatever for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister and his Department have well earned all the nice things which have been said about them during the course of this discussion on this Estimate. I certainly wish to pay my tribute to them for the good work which they have done, but there are just one or two points about which I have to express dissatisfaction.  In the Housing Act we have a section which is supposed to give a certain amount of protection to wage-earners employed under housing schemes. Complaints have been raised here time and again by way of Parliamentary Question, and members have been told that if they will furnish to the Minister or his Department documentary evidence showing that a higher rate of wages has been paid for work of a similar kind in the district the contractor will be compelled to pay that rate.  From Thomastown in my county, where the board of health are carrying out a housing scheme, I received a complaint which I transmitted to the Minister's Department, that the rate of wages being paid was only 30/- a week.  I substantiated my claim by submitting documentary evidence showing that not only was 36/- paid generally by building contractors in that area, but in fact as much as 42/- had been paid.  I was very disappointed at the manner in which the matter was disposed of.  It resulted, anyhow, in the fact that the labourers <Col N="537" /> employed on the board's housing scheme there received no more than the 30/- which was originally offered. I hope that the Minister may still find it possible to review that question, in order&mdash;if I may be permitted to mention it on this Estimate&mdash;that something might be done to improve that section of the Act.</P>
      <P>While a good many water and sewerage schemes have been carried out in my county, it is rather strange and very disappointing to find that I think the very first one in regard to which application was made there has not yet been sanctioned.  I refer to the Ballyragget water scheme.  I take a very serious view of the situation there because of the medical reports submitted time and time again for many years, and the fact that a number of both children and adults have, year by year, died from typhoid and other diseases contracted through the unhealthy water which they are compelled to use.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will use his power to induce the board's engineers to supply whatever documents may be the cause of the delay in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The types of contractors who are engaged in the building of labourers' cottages generally have been referred to, and I am sorry to say that that is the position in my part of the country. I think that something ought to be done to find a system by which labourers' cottages can be erected throughout the country without having to depend on that type of person to carry out the work.  They are unsatisfactory, not only as employers but from the point of view of producing good houses.  While a good deal of money is being spent in regard to salaries, offices and all the rest of it for the county medical officers' services, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that when I recently raised the question of the necessity of providing a proper hospital in Kilkenny for the treatment of tubercular patients I was told that the matter was not considered very urgent.  I think that anybody who will go to Kilkenny, and see there the building that is being used for the treatment of those patients, will have <Col N="538" /> no hesitation in saying that it is nothing but a place where people are condemned to die.  In olden time it was some kind of a prison, and it is most unsuitable in size and in every other way for the treatment of tubercular patients.  I earnestly hope that something will be done, and done as soon as possible, to have an up-to-date hospital provided in Kilkenny for the treatment of patients suffering from this terrible disease.</P>
    <P>When speaking about housing, it just occurs to me that I omitted to say that I would like if the Minister would revert to the position that obtained here between 1923 and 1932 in regard to reconstruction grants for people in urban areas.  If I may say so this, in my opinion, is the one black spot in the present Housing Acts.  I cannot understand why, in improving the Housing Acts that we have in operation, that particular provision should have been removed.  In urban areas, as I am aware, there are many people who have no other means of improving their dwellings and, therefore, I think the restoration of that provision in the present Housing Acts would be welcomed by very many people throughout the country generally.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw attention to the fact that claims are being made by many local authorities, particularly urban authorities, for an increase in the £300 subsidy.  I think the Minister will have no difficulty in agreeing that there are many reasons why the subsidy ought to be increased now. The £300 may have been adequate originally, but I think a good case can be made now for an increase in the amount to, say, £350 or £400.</P>
    <P>To-day I had some questions on the Order Paper in regard to the Ardee Mental Hospital dispute.  I do not know if it is in order for me to refer further to the matter on this Estimate. Arising out of my questions to-day, I learned that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had been asked by the trade union catering for the staff at Ardee to invite the committee to enter into negotiation with a view to the settlement of this, as I think we may call it, very regrettable dispute.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="539" /> and Commerce communicated with the Minister for Local Government on the matter, but I think the Minister for Local Government might go further. The position, to my mind, is that the committee of management there are being allowed to carry on a kind of a fight to a finish, and do not care what it is going to cost the ratepayers, or what the consequences may be to the inmates.  Already there has been the loss of one life there, and while I will not say anything about the answer that I got on the matter to-day, it is still doubtful as to whether or not that death was due to the inadequacy of the staff.</P>
    <P>A temporary staff, composed of about 25 people, has been employed there since the dispute started.  A strange thing about it is that they are being paid more than double the wages of the staff who are in dispute with the committee.  I think that the Minister might intervene in the matter in his capacity as Minister for Local Government, and induce the committee to perform the duty that they owe to the public.  I do not want to say anything on the matter that would inflame feeling on either side, but I feel that the Department of Local Government and the Minister could do something, and I am sure that my brief reference to the matter will not do any harm.  I have done so in all good faith, and I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to bring this regrettable dispute to an amicable settlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the grants made to local authorities by the Minister's Department, if I am in order in referring to the regulations governing the conditions of employment, I would like to say, in view of the recent proposal particularly, that a local authority must provide not by way of loan but out of revenue a certain proportion of the money allocated by the Minister.  Because of that, I think it would be only fair that the local authority should get full power to give employment to all unemployed ratepayers. There are many ratepayers unemployed who are debarred from receiving unemployment assistance <Col N="540" /> because of the fact that they have some miserly income.  In some cases they may have 5/- a week profit out of a small huckster's shop; others may have a small Army pension of 6/- or 7/- a week.  I think, in view of the fact that they are ratepayers willing to work and scarcely able to pay their rent and rates, and that they are being asked to contribute towards the relief of unemployment, that they ought to be allowed to share in the work which they are willingly seeking.  The conditions of employment on those grants allocated by the Department of Local Government are pretty generous I admit, but the amendment I have suggested would, I think, meet with the good wishes of everybody.  That is all I have to say.  I again congratulate the Minister and his Department on the many good things that they have done, and I hope that my suggestions will receive careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate, all of them, if I may be pardoned for saying so, being helpful, whether they were complimentary or otherwise.  It is a useful thing once a year for the Minister of a Department, and particularly useful for the Minister for Local Government, to come to the Dáil with his Estimate and give an account of his stewardship; to hear from the members of the House what is thought of his work and the work of his Department.  It is instructive for the Minister, and instructive, I am sure, for his staff.  A Minister, especially if he has been some time administering a Department, knows a good deal about the work of it, but I must confess that even I, after five years in the Department of Local Government seldom listen through a debate on this Estimate that I do not learn something from Deputies even about my own Department; something new to me that I did not know before. Points of view are put forward that may not have occurred to the Minister or his staff and they sometimes open up new avenues of thought and development <Col N="541" /> which are valuable to the Department and its operations.  I do not know whether I got more than the usual number of suggestions, but I seem to have a great array of notes here.  I noted down carefully the points made by all the speakers, and I should like to go over all these in detail and give an answer to them, but if I were to do so I would probably occupy more time than has been occupied by all the Deputies who spoke since the debate started at 3 o'clock yesterday.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, if the House will permit me, I will refer to those which I think are of outstanding importance.  The others, as in previous years, I will go over again and the Department will go over, and those which are of value and worthy of note will be carefully considered by the various sections of the Department. I think I might take it that the general tone of the speeches on the Estimate was complimentary.  In some cases, in fact, the remarks made by Deputies on different phases of the work of the Department were flattering.  I do not think, however, that the Minister is likely to suffer from what in American slang is called &ldquo;tight hat&rdquo; because of that, as there are plenty of people of another type knocking around who remind the Minister that he is very far indeed from perfection.  Although that is not necessary in my case, I submit that it is useful.  Sometimes these critics imagine that by wholesale exaggeration, extravagance of language, and talking in a pompous and posturing way their speeches make a greater impression and are more effective than the quiet but effective speeches that we have listened to from all sides of the House, delivered in language of moderation, even though sometimes it may be severe criticism. That type of speech, to my mind, is much more effective and more note is likely to be taken of it than of the other kind which I referred to and which, happily, we have not very much of in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> Deputy Brennan, who spoke first, raised a number of points, most of them small points, such as money for international congresses, too much centralisation, increase in salaries of officials, etc.  His reference to the free beef scheme might be regarded by some as important.  He also criticised the type of work done out of relief grants for unemployment.  Reference was also made by him&mdash;it is a hardy annual now&mdash;to the Housing Board and its work.  I said last year, and I think I said in a previous year, how helpful the Housing Board had been to me and to the Department in housing work all over the country. There are numbers of things that crop up in this housing and re-housing campaign of ours that can be better attended to outside the ordinary routine of departmental officials.  I have found the members of the Housing Board most helpful and most anxious and willing to help in every way in the type of matter I refer to.</P>
    <P>One matter that occurs to me is that reference was made by Deputy Dillon a year ago to the position of public utility societies and certain types of so-called public utility societies that existed in the country.  He made the suggestion that it would be useful to have an inquiry made into their operations.  I asked the Housing Board to make that inquiry, and it was made.  A short time ago I received a very excellent report on these public utility societies of various types, and their work, and arising out of information contained in that report, legislation will probably be necessary to alter the constitution of these societies and to provide for a closer watch over such societies as Deputy Dillon is acquainted with. That is one of the types of work done by the Housing Board, and there are many others.  I think Deputy Dillon said that he had never heard of the members of the Board visiting his county.  They have visited his county frequently.  If the Deputy will consult the county surveyor, the secretary of the board of health, and the secretary of the county council, I believe he will find that the Housing Board afforded these officials valuable help and information <Col N="543" /> with regard to the work of housing in his own district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I think all the members of the Housing Board have been in Roscommon at one time or another at the request of the local authorities, giving help, advice and assistance to them.  Deputy Brennan also mentioned that matter, and it is because it has been mentioned by both that I refer to the work of the Housing Board in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies commented upon the figures I gave in my statement as to tuberculosis and the results of the Department's activities in the treatment of that disease.  Unquestionably, considerable success has been achieved in the treatment of tubercular people for the last 20 or 25 years even here in Ireland, but it is my opinion that we are not as up-to-date in the treatment of tuberculosis as we ought to be.  I do know that the matter is at present receiving careful attention and consideration by the Department and its medical advisers.  I hope, as a result of the further investigation, that improved facilities for treatment will be made available where necessary, largely through the help afforded by the Hospitals Sweepstakes Fund. While I say that we are not as up-to-date as we ought to be, I do not say that that is universal.  Of course, it is notorious that there are institutions in the country where the facilities are not what they ought to be; where the hospitalisation is not modern; where the treatment is not up-to-date; and where the most modern methods are not used.  There are other institutions&mdash;not as many as there should be &mdash;where the most modern treatment is adopted and where everything is up-to-date; but, unfortunately, they are only in a position to deal with a small percentage of the cases requiring attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is true that as the years go on notification of tuberculosis is becoming more regular.  Heretofore people who were afflicted with that terrible disease, and also their <Col N="544" /> families, liked to conceal the fact as long as possible.  I do not say that that still continues.  Probably it does. But that type of mind is disappearing, and since the institution of county medical officers all over the country, and since we instituted school medical inspection, notification is growing, and the number of cases notified in proportion to the number existing must be higher.  I have no statistics on the matter, but, of course, the numbers must be considerably higher than they were ten or 15 years ago.  Medical men will agree that there are now better opportunities for diagnosis.  Possibly that will tend to increase the numbers shown on the books of people suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies complained of delay in approving of schemes for the erection of labourers' cottages.  Deputy Brennan was one of those who referred to that matter.  Where there are schemes of compulsory purchase they take a considerable time.  When they are finally adopted by the local authorities they are sent up to the Department, after which the usual legal notices have to be given and an inquiry held.  An inspector has to visit every site.  If there are objections made, and they are made frequently, on behalf of the owners of property, or on behalf of people affected by the erection of labourers' cottages in their immediate vicinity, all the complaints have to be heard and examined, so that it takes a considerable time, even if there are no objections, to carry out all the legal machinery necessary in cases of compulsory purchase of labourers' cottages. All I can say on behalf of the Department is that our anxiety is to push forward schemes of housing of every kind in urban or rural areas, county boroughs, villages or towns, and no avoidable delay is allowed to occur as far as the Department is concerned.  If there are any particular cases of delay which were mentioned by any Deputy in any area, I have noted them, and I will have these complaints examined.</P>
    <P>Speaking generally, I know that it is true that the Department is anxious, and that my anxiety is to see, that housing schemes go ahead as rapidly <Col N="545" /> as possible.  Some Deputies complained that we were going ahead too quickly.  I am sorry that these Deputies were not here to listen to Deputy Dillon's complaint about housing. The opinion of two Deputies in Deputy Dillon's Party was that we are going ahead much too quickly.  For my part, so long as we can get efficient work and get houses satisfactorily built, we cannot go too quickly at present to meet the demand that is there for housing, and to eradicate the horrible housing conditions that existed all over the country in the towns, cities and rural areas.  It is a big problem to deal with the housing situation.  It should have been tackled many years ago, and tackled in a wholesale way.  It has been tackled for the last five years, and we are going ahead as rapidly as we can. Unquestionably faults will be found and mistakes will occur.  They have occurred here and there.  There is no use denying that.  Generally I do not think the failures were greater than 5 per cent. in a big attempt.  I would rather that than not to make the attempt and to leave housing conditions as they were five or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan complained of the delay in building hospitals in his county.  Deputy Dillon had something to say on that subject also, but I do not think he complained of delay. There has been delay with regard to the county hospital in Roscommon and it occurred chiefly because the architect selected by the board of health, in drawing his plans for the county hospital drew them on a very generous scale, indeed.  His plans, if adopted, would work out so that it would cost about £1,500 per bed to fit up the hospital for County Roscommon.  We have had hospitals that were satisfactory to the local authority and to my Department erected at one-third of that price in other counties, and we do not want to pay more in County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>We had to hold up the plans and to ask the local authority and the architect to make the necessary modifications to bring them within reason, and to make them something like what the Department could sanction.  In speaking of the delay in building an hospital in Roscommon, I was sorry to hear a man like Deputy Brennan, speaking from a responsible position&mdash;whether he is a responsible man or not is another question&mdash;suggesting that the Department of Local Government and the Government were holding the Sweepstakes moneys and intended putting them to other uses than those to which they are allowed to put them by law. That was a statement that ought not to have been made in this House by anybody who would be allowed to speak from the front Opposition Bench.  The Deputy knows as well as any Deputy that the law laid down how that money was to be spent.  Even if there was such a thought in the mind of any individual Minister, or of the Government as a whole, it would not be possible to spend one cent. of that money except for the purpose allowed by law, for the very good reason that the money is not in the hands of the Government.  The money is in the hands of the Hospitals Trustees.  I believe Deputy Brennan knows that.  I believe it was a malicious statement, made possibly to sabotage the Sweepstakes and to help those abroad&mdash; enemies of the Sweepstakes Fund&mdash; who are doing everything they can to hurt the Sweepstakes, and to hurt this Government through the Sweepstakes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the use of the moneys, many Deputies mentioned the delay in building hospitals in their respective counties.  Only one Deputy, Deputy Rowlette, mentioned the other aspect and the other claims on these Hospitals Sweepstakes Fund.  On at least two occasions in the last 12 months, when laying the foundation-stone of one or other of these county hospitals, I thought it my duty to warn those who were present, members of local authorities, and I asked the Press to publish my words for the benefit of other local authorities all over the country, of the unwisdom of asking for too much money and building hospitals that will be too expensive. Deputy Dillon referred to that aspect of the matter yesterday&mdash;and I was glad to hear him refer to it&mdash;and so did others.  Many of these counties that are making demands, not for one hospital, but for three, four and five hospitals of different types, county hospitals, district hospitals, cottage hospitals, fever hospitals, and sanatoria, want enormous sums of money spent on these institutions.  When the free grants are going, they do not care what they ask for, but I should like to warn them, as I did a couple of times in the last 12 months, of what it is going to mean for them if they build large and expensive hospitals all over their counties.  First of all, it is not likely that they will be allowed to do that to the extent of the excessive amount that some of them desire, but even in the case of those county hospitals that have been sanctioned, demands are made for equipment for some of these hospitals that are out of all proportion to what <Col N="548" /> the hospitals were designed for.  In some cases, if the equipment asked for were granted and money given out of the Sweepstakes Funds, the equipment would lie there idle and would rot and rust, because there would be nobody competent to use it.</P>
    <P>Later, when these hospitals are finally completed and equipped, they will have to be staffed.  In many places at present, there are competent medical men in charge of these hospitals, but there are possibly two doctors at the utmost available.  If the equipment which some of these local authorities desire to have granted and sanctioned for their hospitals were to be given to them, they would have to have a staff almost as big as the staffs of some of the large voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin, and where would the money come from to pay them?  They would not provide the money out of the rates, and the next thing would be that &ldquo;The Sweepstakes must come to our assistance.&rdquo; Possibly that is at the back of their minds&mdash;that if they make the demand, and get away with it, the rates later on will be freed of any cost for the upkeep, maintenance and staffing of these hospitals.  That is not likely to happen.  I should like public men, and especially members of boards of health and county councils, to bear their responsibilities in mind so far as these demands on Sweepstakes Funds for the building and equipment of these hospitals are concerned, and to be reasonable and prudent, not thinking alone of to-day or to-morrow and of the free grants that are available, but of the hereafter when the ratepayers have to be called on to maintain and to pay for the staffing of these new, highly-equipped institutions.</P>
    <P>Another point is that we have not spent any year, and it is not our intention to spend, on local authority hospitals more than one-third of the net amount received out of the Hospitals Sweepstakes Funds for hospitals.  We have to bear in mind the commitments of the Fund to the voluntary hospitals.  The voluntary hospitals, as Deputy Rowlette reminded us yesterday, brought the Hospitals <Col N="549" /> Sweepstakes into existence.  They could not, of course, have come into existence without the sanction of this House.  This House gave the sanction, but it was on the initiative of the representatives of the voluntary hospitals, and the authorities of local hospitals when making demands on the fund ought to bear in mind that there are liabilities on the Fund which I would regard as primary liabilities, and that, while there has been one large new hospital built&mdash;and it is not even yet completely built&mdash;out of these Funds, the liability is there.  I do hope that at not too remote a date we will be able to announce our decision with regard to the schemes put up for the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin.  I notice particularly that Deputy Rowlette, in speaking of this matter yesterday, spoke with great moderation, when he and others like him representing the voluntary hospitals might have talked in much stronger terms.</P>
    <P>I realise that Deputy Rowlette, and some of the others interested in the voluntary hospitals, are getting uneasy as to what is going to happen with regard to the institutions in which they have a special and particular interest.  I know that Deputy Rowlette realises, and the representatives of other hospitals equally realise, that this question of the hospitalisation of the City of Dublin is a very big and important problem, and a very thorny problem.  It is one in respect of which it would never do to go on wrong lines, and we have to take time in order to try to arrive at what, I hope, will be thought the wisest decision as to how that hospitalisation scheme is to be developed.  I will not go into it further than to say that the matter is receiving constant attention.  It is not being neglected and the Funds are being watched and nursed.  I hope that those interested, when we come to deal with that subject, if they do not know it already and I think they do, will find that the Funds have not been spent in any way to the detriment of those who had, ethically and in all justice, a right to primary consideration when <Col N="550" /> distributing the Hospitals Sweepstakes Funds.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton yesterday mentioned Carlow and the delay there.  The delay in County Carlow is not a matter for which the Local Government Department is primarily responsible.  The board of health itself had several meetings last year and has changed its mind, to put it mildly, more than once on the matter of how they wish hospital institutions in their county to be developed. I received a deputation which represented eight out of ten members of the board.  They were not all of one political party.  I think they represented three political parties.  I gathered&mdash;I do not know whether this is correct or not&mdash;that a minority of two wants to dominate the majority of eight on the board of health, and that that is partially responsible for holding up a decision on the question of hospitalisation in the County Carlow. I gathered that, through pressure of various kinds, the board of health is coming together and agreeing to a certain course of action.  When they agree amongst themselves, I shall see that no unreasonable delay occurs so far as we are concerned in regard to hospitalisation in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned defects in construction in building schemes in different parts of the country.  Deputy Norton was the first Deputy to draw attention to these defects.  He gave us an account of some houses which he visited in County Kildare, and described some of the defects which he, accompanied by an architect, found.  I know that there have been defects in construction.  In one or two cases, there have been serious defects. Unfortunately, the matter is a little more serious in County Kildare than it is in most of the other places about <Col N="551" /> which we heard complaints, or in places which were not mentioned in the debate.  In some areas in County Kildare, there has been an entire lack of competent supervision.  In justice to everybody, I think I should say that there are some officials&mdash;so-called engineers&mdash;who ought to be dismissed and who ought not to be allowed any longer to have anything to do with house-construction in the county.</P>

      <P>Deputies have reminded us that a lot of public money is being spent on this housing work. The taxpayers are quite prepared to provide the necessary money to secure that people who are living in these awful conditions shall be properly housed, but it is most annoying and most disappointing to find that, while the taxpayers are willing to pay and while very generous grants are provided by this House for this good work, officials in certain areas seem to take absolutely no care and to have no proper notion of their responsibilities to those who pay them or to the country, as a whole, in so far as house building is concerned.  County Kildare is one of the worst places, in this regard, I have come across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is true of County Kildare is true, though not to the same extent, of the scheme to which Deputy The O'Mahony referred at considerable length last night and this afternoon. I think there has been exaggeration of the defects in so far as the description of the houses in Bray is concerned. There have been defects in construction that were perhaps avoidable. I gather that the chief defect arises from a certain string course put into these houses as an attempt at variety and to make them a little more pleasing to the eye.  This string course of brick was not a success. Whether it was put in properly or not I do not know.  So far as I can gather, the actual building part of it was properly done, but, as an experiment, it was not a success.  So far as rain is concerned, the past winter was unusually severe and these houses in the Oldcourt district in Bray are on an <Col N="552" /> exposed site, but a very beautiful site from the scenic point of view.  I myself visited the site at the opening of the scheme and was very pleased with it. To me, as a layman, the houses looked very fine.  The builder, who comes from County Waterford, has done very good work all over the country and these houses looked, to me, well-constructed. I was surprised at Deputy The O'Mahony suggesting&mdash;he did no more than suggest it&mdash;that the Minister would be a party to hiding something. He said: &ldquo;I wonder if there is anything to hide and why the Department will not give us this inquiry.  Perhaps it is they are consenting to the hiding of this thing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt? What I intended to convey&mdash;I am very sorry if I did not succeed in conveying it&mdash;was that I did not want anyone to have in his mind the idea that there might possibly be something to hide. In all I said, I was trying to help the Minister.  The last thing in the world I intended to insinuate was that the Minister had anything to hide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>That is what I would expect from the Deputy and I am sorry if I misunderstood what he said.  I am glad when Deputies bring these complaints to my notice.  The Minister cannot be everywhere.  I did happen to be in Bray but it would look as if my judgment was wrong.  I saw these houses and I thought they were well-constructed and beautiful houses. It may be that they were not as well constructed as they seemed to me, as a layman, to be.  Where there are complaints, I do not want any hiding or the sheltering of anybody responsible. If people are consciously doing wrong to the public and to the tenants, I should like to have them called upon to give an account of their responsibilities. I invite any public man or private citizen who finds that there is ground for complaint in connection with these housing schemes to let us hear about the matter.  He can report it to one of his Deputies and the Deputy can bring it up in the House. We shall examine the complaint and, if a remedy can be found, we shall be happy to find it and help the local authority or the tenants in having the <Col N="553" /> defects made good.  I was disappointed when I heard more than a year ago about the Bray houses.  It cannot be expected that the Minister, or the Minister's inspectors, should be on the job supervising the building of houses in Bray, Kildare, Castlebar or anywhere else.  The engineers visit these schemes once a month, perhaps, at most.  We have stock plans which we give to the local authorities.  Many local authorities adopt them and use them without alteration or amendment. Other local authorities alter them and use them as they think fit. The plans of local authorities are sent in and are examined by our engineering and architectural staff, but it would not be reasonable that our inspectors should be held responsible for every house built in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Bray they happen to have a borough surveyor of their own.  He is a man who is of high standing in the profession, at any rate; he is a man who is often called in as consultant in other parts of the country.  He is responsible for constructional and other work for the local authority in Bray.  It is on his certificate that the contractor would be paid.  I cannot believe, from what I know of the standing of this man in his profession, that anyone could suggest that he is not a first-class engineer.  That is what I gather from what I have heard of him.  People speak of him as a man of repute in his profession.  I take it that he, not to mind the Minister going down to open houses on a nice warm day with the sun shining in that lovely spot, would say that the site looks most pleasant.  Certainly things might look their best on a day like that.  But take the case of the borough surveyor who visited the job possibly once a week and saw it from the foundations being laid up to the roof being put on, and who approved of the innovations that were suggested in that scheme.  He should, when complaints of dampness and other complaints were put forward, have been in a position there and then to say what was wrong.  Whether he was or not, our inspector was called in, I think it was in January, 1936, to deal with certain complaints.  He made a report to us.  We sent a copy of that <Col N="554" /> report to the Bray Urban Council. So far as I know, from that to February, 1936, nothing was done.  Then some time after that, when bad weather came on and the dampness again appeared, the Bray Urban Council rushed in a state of excitement to the Local Government Department. What they did to their own engineer I do not know.  We made certain suggestions.  What they did with these suggestions I do not know. However, they said they were attending to the business.  I do not mean to let the matter drop there.  So far as I know the circumstances, I do not think a sworn inquiry is necessary.  I think we know what is wrong.  As far, at least, as experienced technical advice is available in the Department, we have that and we know what is wrong.  We have examined the houses. We saw them go up.  I do not think a sworn inquiry is necessary.  If I thought a sworn inquiry was necessary I would not hesitate for 24 hours in having it.  We will have the matter examined again, and whatever suggestions are necessary to remedy what is wrong with the houses, to find the responsible person and to call him to book, will be available.</P>

      <P>While on that question of inspectors, may I say, in answer to a number of Deputies who have complained about the delays in the inspection of private houses, reconstruction and similar matters, that there have unquestionably been delays in some counties.  I do not know whether it is an excuse or not, but the explanation is the shortage of inspectors. At present we are short, I think, 10 or 11 inspectors for this business of housing schemes, including private houses and public utility societies.  As to the temporary inspectors that we have employed since 1932, we usually have 25 or 26 of them and at present we are 10 or 11 short. <Col N="555" /> We advertised some weeks ago for 12 inspectors, and as a result of our advertising we got two.  One of these came from another Department. Strange as it may appear, there is a shortage of engineers in spite of the numbers turned out by our universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that difficulty since we started in 1932.  We started with a full complement of engineers but they change.  One cannot blame the inspectors.  Every time an inspector is offered £50 or £100 a year additional in another post he will take it and leave us.  We get new men, but some go from our Department to other Departments.  They leave us for better posts in the Government service.  We have had that trouble all the time since the housing scheme started.  Consequently there is a shortage of inspectors.  There is also, at any rate for rural housing, a <Col N="556" /> shortage of contractors.  When I say contractors I mean competent contractors. There are people who have got into the building trade and have not sufficient experience of the business. Some of them have not sufficient money.  We have had difficulties of more than one kind with regard to contractors.  As Deputy Norton said, we have cases where the officials of the local authority accepted contractors whose own workmen were offered as sureties.  On the other hand, if we make too stringent and rigid regulations in connection with contracts it would mean that we would be hanging up the work and slowing down the building of houses.  Some hold that it would be better to do that than have contracts accepted from incompetent contractors.  But we have to listen to the clamorous demands in all areas around the country.  Private individuals in every county write to me, to the Department and to the local authority as well, begging, for the love of God, to get cottages built for them owing to the horrible conditions in which they and their families are living at present.  In these circumstances it is sometimes very difficult to know which is the better course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette mentioned another subject, payment for immunisation.  I was surprised when he said that the doctors were treated with contempt. That is not so; that is not true.  A year ago I received a deputation consisting of five or six medical men, sent by the Medical Officers' Association, to discuss with Dr. Ward and myself this question of payment for immunisation against diphtheria.  I heard the deputation at great length and we did recommend an increase in the amount paid to the medical officers for immunisation. Of course, it was not enough&mdash; that is the difficulty&mdash;but I was advised by medical men of experience as dispensary medical officers and they told me that it would be unwise and improper to raise the amount to the figure suggested by the representatives of the medical officers who came on the deputation to me.  We did offer them an increase in their fees for immunisation but, so far, the doctors are not satisfied.  Perhaps new facts <Col N="557" /> will be brought to my notice, but so far as the information and the advice that I have at my disposal are concerned, I do not feel like raising the fees any further at the present time. I do not like the suggestion made by Deputy Rowlette, that the doctors were treated with contempt.  They were not.  I received the deputation and heard them and did make an offer to them.  I do not think, therefore, that to say they were treated with contempt is a proper description.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette also mentioned the question of mortality among illegitimate children.  We discussed that matter this time 12 months at con siderable length, and I told the House then that a number of institutions had been set up in different parts of the country in an endeavour to deal, to some extent at least, with the problem. I said there were special homes established in County Cork, County Tipperary and County Westmeath to deal with girls who had got into trouble in that way and to teach them to look after their infants.  In the case of those not able to look after their children, every effort was to be made to find a way of having the children properly cared for.  I may say that other institutions of the kind are in contemplation. Perhaps when these others are finally established the reduction which is evident in the mortality rate of illegitimate children will be still further evident.  There has been a decrease in the death rate in the last three or four years, a not inconsiderable decrease, and I am hoping that that decrease will continue and will grow at a more rapid rate as a result of the institutions already established, and the similar institutions which I am hoping will be established later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette and other Deputies mentioned insanitary school buildings. The Department of Local Government is not primarily concerned with school buildings, but it is concerned with the public health aspect of this matter, and I may say that not alone our inspectors, but the county medical officers in every county have been instructed to pay particular attention to schools, to the sanitation of schools, and I will be glad if Deputies would ask for and get the <Col N="558" /> annual reports of the county medical officers of health in their respective counties, because in these reports they will see for themselves that the county medical officers of health are taking notice of the matter and are calling attention annually to the need for proper sanitation in the schools.</P>
    <P>I think I might say, too, although it is not in my particular province as a Minister, that in the last three or four years the amount of money set aside by the Government for the building of new schools has been very considerably increased.  There were more new schools being built within the last three years at any rate than for many years before.  I know there is no Deputy who does not hope that even more money still will be found for this very proper and desirable object. There are too many insanitary schools in the country, too many schools in which there is no thought of sanitation &mdash;that is a fact.  I hope that Deputies not alone here but wherever they have an opportunity of speaking on this matter, will call attention to it because it will be all to the good.  It will get the public mind educated on the matter and will help in inducing everybody who has a share of responsibility to be wide awake in regard to the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nally asked about some housing schemes at Ballyhaunis and Ballindine.  I do not know what the conditions are; I have not had time to find out, but I will inquire as to what has happened with regard to these two towns and their housing schemes and if there are any difficulties in the way I shall try to have them smoothed out.  He also referred to the scarcity of slates.  That is one particular matter that the Housing Board have been dealing with since they were appointed.  The utmost difficulty has been found in getting slate quarries developed.  There is any amount of money in slates at present.  There is nothing else certainly in the building line that there is a greater demand for.  People in this country would, I think, prefer slates as a roofing material to tiles, but slates are not available. The Housing Board have been after every slate quarry owner in the <Col N="559" /> country begging them to develop their output more and more.</P>
    <P>By reason of our housing schemes, we were responsible for reviving development in quarries in several places all over the country that had ceased to produce for a number of years. The most notable one was in the Deputy's county, where a quarry closed for many years is now employing 600 hands.  Possibly even if that quarry were further developed and if it had three times that number of hands employed it would not be able to go anywhere near supplying the demand there is for slates.  When the matter was raised last year I spoke in the same tone in the hope that some people who had money to invest would look around them and develop some of the slate quarries in their own areas.  There are quarries in Wicklow that have produced excellent material and that have doubled and trebled their output in the last three or four years, but they could do still more.  The same applies to Cork, and the same applies to Tipperary and Waterford and other places; but why people, with money to invest in Irish industry, will not look at slates or slate quarries, is a thing that I find difficult to understand.  Perhaps some of them have in mind that this housing development of the last few years is only a flash in the pan.  Well, I believe that this Government will be here for a considerable time to come, but this Government, if it is here, or whatever Government is here, will have to keep the housing problem before it and to develop the housing scheme, and keep it going, if that be possible at greater and greater speed. So that I think there is, at any rate, a period of ten years' intensive building before this country&mdash;not alone before the Government but before the country as a whole, the private speculator as well as the public society or local authority.  Therefore there need not be any fear that there will be a stoppage in the development of building or in the demand for slates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly, of North Cork, was one of those who complained about the scheme of his local authority, the North Cork Board of Health, being <Col N="560" /> held up.  In his case the scheme is being held up because the county board of health, as I understand it, decided that they would not take the sites for labourers' cottages by compulsory purchase, but would pay £70 an acre everywhere they took a site. Well, we looked up what had been paid for similar sites in the same area &mdash;paid by an arbitrator on the compulsory housing scheme that was in operation a short time before&mdash;and we found that the average price was less than half, or about half, what the board of health proposed to pay. Well, when they can get, by using the compulsory purchase method, sites at, roughly, half or about half the price, why should they pay £70 for a site? That has been put up to the board of health, but up to the present, at any rate, they have not agreed with us on the matter.</P>

The arbitrator will pay the market value.  I do not know who the arbitrators are.  I have nothing to say as to who appoints them.  I think it is the Chief Justice who appoints them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, I do not know the case to which the Deputy is referring at the moment, <Col N="561" /> but I do say that there are places where, unfortunately, it has been found that one cannot get sites otherwise than by paying a sum of that kind.  Some Deputies raised the question of the grants in connection with public health schemes&mdash;for waterworks and sewerage&mdash;and suggested that the grants were not generous enough. Well, I think the grants are generous. Not alone are they generous, but there were more of them available in the last three or four years than were ever available before; and we are only too anxious that the local authorities would take up these grants, use them, and put public health schemes of waterworks and sewerage into every hamlet as well as into every village and town in the country.  In some areas the cost is heavy, and that applies to one scheme mentioned by Deputy Daly last week.  He talked of the town of Newmarket.  What is true of that scheme is possibly true of others, and that is that the local authority, when developing that scheme, wished to put the area of charge for a water supply scheme on a very restricted area and, as the North Cork Board of Health did suggest a restricted area in that case, the charge on a limited number of ratepayers is, therefore, very heavy and very high.  I think that a way out of it, and a way that has been adopted with success by a number of boards of health and that, I think, is generally approved of, would be to make the county the area of charge for all these schemes.  If that were done, there would not be any longer the competition, or at least there would not be competition to the same extent, between towns and villages in the same county area in order to get their scheme developed first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first became Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I discovered that there were several counties where there were towns that were in a shocking state from the point of view of public health&mdash;without any water supply or sewerage; and the reason was that the representatives from two towns in, let us say, County Cavan, would not agree that the third town should get <Col N="562" /> a water or sewerage scheme because they did not get it in their own town, and each town blocked the other because it wanted its own scheme developed first.  I made the suggestion to them, as I did to other counties: Why not agree to give all the towns&mdash;these two, three, five or six towns&mdash;a water or sewerage scheme and put the charge on the county?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion, I suppose, was hailed with joy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, and it was adopted, and all these towns have now got water and sewerage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They all will have all over the country if you make it a county charge.  If it is made a county charge, you will have a water supply scheme for every two houses that are gathered together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, well, there is no use in exaggerating the thing and going to extremes, but the towns in the county did benefit in that case, and in other cases also.  There is an attitude of mind&mdash;a rural attitude of mind&mdash;that I think is wrong, in regard to payment for water and sewerage schemes in the towns.  The rural dweller looks upon that matter in a certain way.  I have often argued with members of boards of health, and I have heard them say many a time: &ldquo;Why should I pay for water and sewerage works in the town of Ballaghaderreen?&rdquo; That is what they want to know.  Well, there is very good reason why they should pay, because the little they pay for waterworks or sewerage for the benefit of having proper public health installations in that town or village, as the case may be, may be the means of saving their own lives, their wives' lives, or the lives of their children, because these epidemic diseases, such as scarlatina, measles or diphtheria, are more likely to arise in the urban areas and be carried out to the country districts by the visitor from the rural district to the towns or villages.  They are likely to arise in the schools in the village or town, or in the immediate vicinity of the village or town.  These diseases will arise there more <Col N="563" /> readily than they do out in the open countryside, and if the rural dweller looks at it in that way and thinks of the value he will set on the life of his child, or several children&mdash;it is not a right way to evaluate it, if you like&mdash; he certainly will agree, if it is put to him in that way, that he would rather put the life of his child out of danger than object to paying the necessary twopence or threepence in the £ so that there should be a general improvement and uplifting in the social life of the people so far as the public health is concerned.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke on roads, and on the amount of money spent on main roads compared with county roads, as a result of the money available for the relief of unemployment. I think that, speaking roughly, an additional sum of £400,000 has been made available in the last couple of years for work on roads, and most of that money has gone into county roads, not main roads.  The money made available out of the Vote for the relief of unemployment was spent, not on the main roads, but on the county roads.  Therefore there has been at least close on £500,000 more per annum spent in the last couple of years on county roads than ever was spent on them before.</P>
      <P>From many points of view, I should like to see more money made available for expenditure on the main roads, especially in districts referred to by several Deputies where tourists come in large numbers.  I should like to see that, but until the Road Fund grows and develops more rapidly than it is doing at present, I do not see that there is much possibility of getting more money for the main roads.  The revenue from the Road Fund is increasing.  Two years ago it was, in rough figures, about £1,000,000. Last year it was £1,079,000.  This year it is anticipated that it will come very near to £1,150,000.  Whatever money will come in in that way will be used to the advantage of the main roads in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy, in addition to speaking of roads, mentioned the Moate water supply.  I have been disappointed that the Moate water supply <Col N="564" /> scheme has not developed much more rapidly than it would appear it has. In fact, it has developed hardly at all, but the delay I understand now is due to the difficulty of acquiring rights over land that must be taken in order to carry out a water supply scheme for the town.  The difficulty is being got over but it will probably take a little time longer to complete operations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan seemed to resent some remarks of mine made to him one day in reply to a question.  He resented my suggestion that, from his benches at any rate, he ought not to be suggesting that the Minister should demand or direct the local authority to do this, that or the other.  There appears to be an idea in the minds of some Deputies&mdash;and it is in the minds of some Labour Deputies, though not all&mdash;that all the Minister has to do is to send down an ultimatum to the local authority and the thing is done.  They frequently make demands on me as Minister to order that this, that or the other thing should be done by the local authority. First of all, I was a member of a local authority for many years and I would resent very much, during that time, orders of that kind.  Secondly, it is not my nature to give orders of that kind, unnecessarily in any event.  If I am driven to it, and if I have the power to carry it out, I shall give the order, if necessary.  If I have not the power to carry it out, I shall be very careful about giving it.  That is what happens in the case of many things suggested to me, especially when I am asked to order a board to do this, that or the other thing.  I have not the power to do all the things that are sometimes asked for.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Hogan should have felt offended with what I said.  I did not intend to give him any offence.  I know he is deeply interested in this question of housing in Clare, and housing in Clare is not in a very satisfactory condition.  That is quite true.  It seems to be very difficult to get over a number of things in County Clare.  The board of health and the local authorities find it difficult to get competent contractors. Whatever the reason is, there is that <Col N="565" /> particular difficulty in County Clare. I know that Deputy Hogan is being pressed.  Goodness knows, I have heard from him often enough as I hear from other Deputies about the different things of which they have complained.  Deputy Hogan is one who writes to me frequently in reference to complaints, particularly about housing in Clare.  I do what I can in the matter.  I am pressing the authorities in County Clare.  Anything I can do to help Deputy Hogan or anybody else to get the local authorities to build houses more satisfactorily and rapidly, I shall be only too happy to do.</P>

      <P>When the members of local authorities sit down and discuss their problems, very frequently these political differences disappear. They treat the problem as they find it, squarely and honestly.  It is not a question of the interests of one Party or another.  I would say that, as far as I am concerned, I have got as much help from one Party as another and I have got good help from all.  Some boards have suggested to me that a good way out would be to allow them to build by direct labour.  I have no rooted objection to direct labour, if I am satisfied that there are competent people to supervise and carry out the scheme.  There have been some experiments in direct labour in rural areas that have been disastrous failures.  There have been some contracts likewise that have been disastrous failures.  All seemed to be confusion, with nobody in charge to see how the work developed.  It would be a very useful thing for local authorities, when they found that contractors were not doing their work, to be able to set aside the contract and set their own machinery in motion, but in one or two experiments that I saw carried out in direct labour the results were not satisfactory. Either the prices were very considerably over what they should have been or else the supervision was not what it should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of roads, several <Col N="566" /> Deputies mentioned the question of leaving a margin on the sides of the tarred roads.  That has been done with success in many counties.  In others it has not been so successful. These counties dropped the system because they found, as Deputies mentioned here, that for one reason or another&mdash;technical reasons, about which I need not bother you; probably you are as familiar with them as I am myself&mdash;it did not prove satisfactory.  Every month of the year experiments are being carried out by our county surveyors all over the country&mdash;as they are in other countries &mdash;in an endeavour to find a road that will serve the two purposes; that will serve the motorists in the best way, and will also be practicable for the man who has to drive a horse or drive cattle.  Those experiments have been going on.  There have been satisfactory results in one or two counties, but, on the whole, nothing has yet been discovered which is quite satisfactory and could be put into operation all over the country.  I took a note of what some Deputy mentioned in regard to County Water ford&mdash;I think it was Deputy Corry&mdash; and what had been done by the county surveyor there.  Deputy Goulding, I think, also mentioned how satisfactorily their county surveyor had got over that difficulty.  I intend to have that looked into.  I have been speaking at great length, and have probably tired the House&mdash;incidentally, I have tired myself&mdash;but there is only one other matter to which I want to refer, and that is the question of housing in Dublin.</P>

      <P>He did speak on one matter which was very relevant and very interesting&mdash;that is, the question of housing in Dublin.  He again <Col N="567" /> mentioned the question of the difficulty in regard to money.  Well, the last report that I received from the city manager on the question of housing was one that he submitted to his housing committee in the month of February, and it was the most comprehensive report on housing that I have received from the Dublin Corporation since I became Minister.  It viewed the housing problem from almost every angle; it set out the difficulties and surveyed the problem as a whole in a way that was to me, at any rate, satisfactory and pleasing. I noted that the city manager did say to the members of his council that so far as money was concerned there was no difficulty.</P>

      <P>The city manager stated that so far as money was concerned he had no difficulty, but there were other problems which gave him and his council and his housing committee great concern.  I am not satisfied, the corporation is not satisfied, and I do not think anybody in Dublin is satisfied with the rate of progress. We will have to speed up the housing supply in the City of Dublin.  The problem is an enormous one.  There is no use in enlarging on that now; possibly everybody here is as familiar with it as I am.  I do think, however, that an effort is now being made to organise in a satisfactory way to deal with the problem, and to co-ordinate effort.  I am hopeful that as a result of the new way in which the problem is being tackled, and the greater energy that, judging from the information at my disposal, is being put into the consideration of the problem, possibly by this time 12 months better results will be able to be shown.</P>

      <P>There are three or four important matters that the Minister has not dealt with, and I wonder if he will be good enough to deal with them now.  One is the question of a subsidy on houses costing over £300. Two or three Deputies have raised that matter.  Another question is whether he would consider the advisability of renewing the grant for reconstruction in urban areas.  The next matter to which I want to refer is a very important one which I raised, and that is the question of providing an amount of money in this year's rate by local authorities to enable them to qualify for an unemployment grant.  The local authority to which I am attached might have been prepared to do that, but, unfortunately, our rate had already been struck.  I wonder would the Minister give us the grant in the circumstances and allow us to raise our own portion by loan for this year?  The other matter to which I wanted to refer was the refusal of the Department to permit local authorities to put their tradesmen on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recognise that the old age pensioners have experienced practically a martyrdom since the old age pension legislation was brought in, in trying to get their ages, because prior to 1851 there was no considerable registration.  Then we came to the time when the registers were pretty complete, but found to our dismay that, in the early stages, a great many children were not registered at all.  Apparently, the reason for that was that, in certain areas, vaccination was coming in at that time and parents would not notify the doctor, who was the registrar, of the child's birth for fear he would insist on vaccinating it.  In those days it was vaccination from child to child, and the country people objected to it.  The result was that there were large areas where children were not vaccinated, and, consequently, their names cannot be got now.  Could we not make a survey now, or a rule, to the effect that if a person's name is not on the register at all that he will be deemed to be over 70? The registers are complete from 1851. Could we not say now that, if a person obviously over 60 years of age is not found to be on the register, he will be assumed to be a person who is over 70?  I do not believe that if my suggestion were carried out it would involve the Minister's Department in £10,000 a year, but it would remove a load from the old age pensioner's back, and, to be perfectly honest, it would remove several loads from the average T.D.'s back who is driven mad by this question.</P>

      <P>I think the time has come when the Minister ought to give us some kind of report, from an expert commission, on the stage which therapeusis in these insane asylums has reached in this country.  There is a popular impression abroad that insane asylums in this country are availed of for nothing except purposes of detention. All over the world very considerable progress has been made in curative treatment for persons of unsound mind, and I think it would be a consolation to a great many people, the relatives of afflicted people in these institutions, to know what stage our institutions have arrived at.  I would direct the Minister's special attention to recent improvements in the treatment of G.P.I.  There is a certain form of mania which has recently become amenable to treatment by insulin shock, a very prevalent form of unsoundness of mind in this country, and if curative treatment were availed of this problem might be very materially mitigated in its present form.  There is another extremely important matter that has to be raised.  It is one of the <Col N="573" /> utmost possible delicacy, but one which I feel it to be my duty to bring under the Minister's attention because the Vote in question deals with an asylum for the maintenance and detention of criminal lunatics.  This is a case where there is divided authority as regards the persons committed to the institution. Most of the persons committed to it come first under the charge of the Minister for Justice, and when they leave his jurisdiction they are handed over to Dundrum, and come under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Therefore, what I am about to say might appear more relevant to the Vote for the Department of Justice, but really it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a type of case which, unfortunately, comes before our criminal courts from time to time of crimes arising from unnatural offences of one kind or another.  It is manifest to me that these cases are cases which are psychopathic in their nature and do require something more than restriction and detention in an ordinary jail.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be added to this asylum an annexe where cases falling within that category could be sent not only for detention but for cure.  Some Deputies may say that this is a matter that could have been more properly raised by way of private representations. I have raised it in another form in a confidential way, and was there informed that it was too wide a topic for consideration and must be postponed.  Therefore, I feel driven to mention it in the Dáil because I think it is a problem of such immense gravity that it does not permit of postponement and ought to be attended to forthwith.  I do not ask the Minister, who is not an expert naturally in a problem of this kind, to undertake to deal with it on his own authority.  I shall be quite content if he will say that he will advise the Minister for Justice to set up a commission of qualified jurists and alienists to examine this problem, and assures the House that if that commission recommends the establishment of an annexe at Dundrum for the purpose of dealing with this type of case he will use his influence with the Executive Council <Col N="574" /> to secure whatever funds or authority may be necessary to carry into effect the recommendations of the commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum now asked for is to complete the sum of £294,084 required under the National Health Insurance Vote for 1937-1938.  The figure covers the cost of central administration of National Health Insurance, and also the cost incurred for staff of the Department engaged on administration of widows' and orphans' pensions.  It also includes the amount required for the statutory Exchequer Grants for <Col N="575" /> National Health Insurance and expenditure in connection with the district medical referee service.</P>
    <P>During the year 1936 the Provisional Committee of Management which had organised the new Unified Society and had carried through the transfers of the old Approved Societies handed over their duties to the new committee of management set up under the provisions of the Act of 1936.  The transfer of their functions took place on the 14th July last.  The new committee consists of a chairman, three trustees and three representatives of employers&mdash;all nominated by me&mdash; together with eight representatives of insured persons, of whom three are nominated by the Executive Council of the Irish Trades Union Congress and five are elected at an annual meeting of an electorate consisting of insured persons nominated by the councils of county boroughs and county councils.  In electing the five latter members of the committee, provision was made for two being representative of the province of Leinster, two for Munster and one for Connaught and Ulster (i.e., Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan).  The persons elected were residents of Dublin, Longford, Tralee, Clonmel and Westport, which I think is a satisfactory distribution of representation.</P>
    <P>I appointed the Most Reverend Dr. Dignan, Bishop of Clonfert, as chairman and Mrs. Helena Concannon, T.D., Mr. Thomas Foran and Dr. Robert J. Rowlette, T.D., as trustees.  The employers' representatives appointed were: Mr. Seán Noonan, manager, Freemount Dairy Society, Charleville; Mr. William O'Meara, Smithwick's Brewery, Kilkenny, and Mr. John O'Neill, President, Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  All members of the committee will hold office until the 31st July this year, and thereafter the persons appointed or elected will hold office for one year.</P>
    <P>The membership of the society at the end of 1936 was over 500,000 and the number of insured persons in receipt of sickness and disablement benefits at 31st December, 1936, was 24,747, which is about the average throughout the year.  It will be seen that the percentage <Col N="576" /> of insured persons in receipt of those benefits is nearly 5 per cent., a figure which is higher than the actuarial expectation.  The value of the contributions from employers and employees collected in 1936 was £675,000, an increase over the previous year of £24,000.  The expenditure on benefits during the year amounted to £738,549, made up of: ordinary cash benefits £710,103; additional benefits £28,446; showing a decrease from the previous year of £14,750 cash and an increase of £2,040 additional benefits. The decrease in cash benefits is reflected in the number of medical certificates issued in 1936, which was 36,000 less than in 1935.</P>
    <P>The accumulated funds forming the assets of National Health Insurance amounted to £3,942,240, showing an increase of £139,390 during the year. The income derived during the year from dividends, interest, etc., was £161,000; and it is evident that the income from other sources, i.e., contributions and State grants is about £22,000 short of expenditure.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to have the whole question of the financial basis of the Acts investigated as soon as statistics, which are at present being prepared, showing the income and expenditure of the Unified Society up to the end of 1936, are available for the actuary. Although the contribution income is still increasing, I think that there is still considerable non-compliance with the provisions of the Acts.  During 1936 it was found necessary to protect the interests of insured people by prosecutions of 637 employers.  In addition, a sum of £356 was recovered from employers in respect of benefit lost by employees owing to the employers' failure to pay contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very remarkable statement and is a bland announcement by the Minister that the National Health Insurance Society has gone bankrupt&mdash;that is what it amounts to.  He has announced it in modest terms and with careful circumlocution, but that is true.  It is interesting to cast our minds back to the days when some of us here in this House were warning the Minister of the danger of the policy <Col N="577" /> he determined upon when he set his hand to the task of amalgamation. We suggested to him then that he was dealing with a large series of solvent societies.  There were one or two which were unsatisfactory&mdash;I think the Foresters and one other&mdash;but the vast majority were found to be solvent.  What the House may now forget, but which they ought to remember, is that the vast majority of these societies were paying extra benefits&mdash;some of them dental benefits, some of them oculist benefits&mdash;and their members were enjoying special privileges of that kind.  I remember in the case of one approved society with which I was associated, that we were ordered not to increase our benefits because it was not thought good to increase benefits when it was the Government's intention very shortly compulsorily to amalgamate us with a new grouping where such increased benefits might not be available.  Some of the Protestant societies, where you had a comparatively rich membership, were giving very extensive increased benefits.  There were a few societies which were sectarian.  Other societies, which were purely craft societies, admitted anybody within certain walks of life and were giving modest extra benefits.  Others were simply giving the statutory benefits as fixed by the early National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the amalgamation took place, all the extra benefits were swept away, with the exception of one or two small societies where special provision was made for the retention of the rights of existing members.  At the time of amalgamation, everybody was put on the lowest common denominator for statutory benefit.  In spite of that, after operating for two or three years, the whole shooting match has gone bankrupt after an amalgamation consisting, in the vast majority, of solvent societies.  That requires some more explanation than the Minister has been in a position to give us.  The Minister points out that contributions are going up and benefits are going down.  He finds that an average number of persons was getting benefit&mdash;there was no remarkable increase.  He finds that contributions have gone up by £24,000 <Col N="578" /> per annum and that benefits represent a decrease as compared with those paid out in the year before, and the funds do not seem to be materially depleted.</P>
    <P>What is it that has created this actuarial insolvency?  There must be some reason for it.  I have been told that there was a disproportionate amount of disablement amongst women employees.  That seems to me to be a specious kind of excuse.  A society of this character, which collects contributions from every work-person in the country ought to be, actuarially speaking, more solvent than most of the old approved societies were, because in the old days, before this amalgamation, you had the men who never were unemployed and who paid in regularly week after week, mostly segregated in their own approved societies.  They gathered themselves into small groups; they had small societies; and they excluded those who had only casual employment so that they themselves might enjoy the extra benefits which the regularity of their contributions would permit.  The result of that was that you skimmed the cream off the insured population for these societies, and that the general membership of the other societies was something below the average, because all the cream had been segregated into these few which catered for persons who were constantly employed and in good jobs.</P>
    <P>Now we have everybody, those who are permanently employed, who are never out of work and, therefore, whose contributions are never suspended, all lumped together with the casual man and the man in precarious employment, likely to lose his job from time to time.</P>
    <P>Instead of the situation getting better, it is getting worse.  Why is that? I think the reason is pretty easy to understand.  When this Government came into office, there was a pretty general impression all along the front bench that every Minister sitting there could do everybody's job better than that person could do it himself. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to run every factory and workshop, the Minister for <Col N="579" /> Local Government thought he could run everybody's business better than the people could run it themselves, and the Minister for Agriculture was quite prepared to run every farm. Accordingly, we had amalgamation, centralisation and monopolies.  In fact, they were quite unconsciously putting into operation the theorems of socialism.  They believed that bureaucracy could run everything.  In regard to National Health Insurance business they swept away altogether the system of individual initiative and competition and substituted therefor a socialistic monopoly.</P>
    <P>The result, of course, has been that you have an immense bureaucracy in Arachas Sláinte Náisiúnta.  Anybody &mdash;as far as I could find out&mdash;who made himself or herself a nuisance was dumped on Arachas Sláinte Náisiúnta, and given a job on condition that they would keep their tongues within certain limits.  I suspect that you have an altogether excessive staff there, overlapping, and that you have all the inefficiency associated with monopoly.  Before this each approved society struggled to keep its expenses as low as it could so that new members would be attracted to it, and the officials running the society a better expense ratio, a securer position, and a better public record.  You had one society competing with another in efficiency, in economy, in vigilance to see that there were no fraudulent claims and that the funds were not depleted in any way.  If they did not do that, a society would go to the wall, some other society would take the membership, and the officials running the collapsed society would lose their jobs.  Now it does not matter if Arachas Sláinte Náisiúnta goes burst, because the Government will have to build it up.</P>
    <P>The committee of management, as explained by the Minister, was nominated by him.  He cannot find fault with them; they are his own nominees. To tell the honest truth, devil a much had the committee of management to do with it.  It is run by civil servants. I believe the officials are hard-working <Col N="580" /> and zealous in their own way.  While I am at a loss to understand how the present condition came about, I believe they had not the beneficial effect of competition.  They have been forced into methods of bureaucracy, and they regard themselves as a semi-Government Department and are allowing the Civil Service mind to dominate their activities.  You cannot run anything like a business enterprise on the lines of a Government Department. If you do run it sufficiently long on such lines the end must be what we see to-day, to go to the Treasury and say that it has to make up a deficit.</P>
    <P>I find it hard in the existing situation to recommend a solution.  It is easy to tear down what you find there, but it is very difficult to re-establish it.  I do not see how you could get back to the approved society.  We have this baby, the Unified Society, and we have to make the best of a bad job.  But the Minister does not discharge his responsibility to this House by merely saying that he does not know what is happening or what is wrong here.  He ought to know.  This is his baby.  He recommended it to the House.  Presumably he investigated the whole problem before he came here and took the responsibility of recommending unified legislation. The calculation that he made before he recommended the scheme to the House has gone wrong.  He must know that.  He ought to be able to tell why it has gone wrong.  He told us when he recommended the scheme that it provided an absolute guarantee against bankruptcy.  He admitted that it was a hardship to many to do away with the extra benefits that existed, but he was doing it to ensure that there was no danger of insolvency.  He told us that he earnestly hoped, when the emigrants started to come back from America to take up the jobs provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there would be an immense surplus and that we could spend it by embarking on extra benefits to be provided out of the surplus and out of the aid provided by the Government's new policy in the years to come.  We are told that <Col N="581" /> there are more people employed, that there are more people in insurable occupation than ever before in the history of the country, yet the fund into which this greater number of insured people is paying has gone burst.  How is it, if more people are paying into the fund, and if less benefit is being paid, that it has gone burst?</P>
    <P>Remember, it is heresy, it is sabotage, it is trying to destroy the State, if anyone questions the fact that great industrial development has taken place in the last five years. &ldquo;The March of Time&rdquo; says that Fianna Fáil has stimulated the demand for Guinness, built Trinity College, and new industries, including Cleeves' Creamery, which was built years before they came into office.  All those in these additional factories, all these hundreds of thousands of men and women who were put into permanent employment by Fianna Fáil, are paying into this fund that has gone burst.  Emigrants would have to pay into this fund if they came home to take up jobs.  They have not landed yet.  Probably they will come and they can make their contributions, too.  The trouble is: &ldquo;Live horse and get grass.&rdquo;  This horse is going to die before the emigrants get here. The Minister comes here but does not know what happened, except that something has gone wrong.  I want to know what has gone wrong.  Is it the plan or is it the scheme?  If the Fianna Fáil plan has gone wrong, I admit that that has upset the Minister's calculations.  It may be that the scheme which he fathered to this House has gone wrong.  He must know.  If his calculations worked out, this would be a solvent fund, an immense and prosperous undertaking, considering ways and means for the distribution of the surplus that the Minister foresaw three years ago. What has gone wrong?  The Minister does not discharge his responsibility to this House until he tells us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this Estimate was before the House I refrained from passing any adverse comment.  As one who opposed the unification scheme from <Col N="582" /> its inception, I felt, that having been defeated&mdash;if you like to put it that way&mdash;it was only right and proper that the scheme should get a fair try-out.  I submit that it has got a fair try-out.  We were led to believe that when this amalgamation or unification scheme would fructify there would be increased benefits.  What do we find now after it has got a fair try-out?  We find that there are decreased benefits.  There was considerable opposition to the unification measure in this House and throughout the State amongst persons who were insured under the National Health Act, because it was felt&mdash;and the impression has now been verified&mdash;that a well organised and well managed national health society would be asked to pay for badly managed and inefficient health insurance societies that operated before amalgamation took place.  We were told that, with greater numbers, great benefits could be paid.  We had some excellent national health institutions in Cork. We had St. Finbarr's Diocesar Society, which paid benefits with which the present payments do not compare.  The payments made by the Cork society were infinitely more numerous.  The financial benefits were certainly many times higher than the rates paid under the present system. The Minister has promised an investigation, and I hope it will be a fairly exhaustive one.  It will take very exhaustive investigation indeed to reveal what are the real or root causes of the doleful account the Minister has given us of the state of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers that some most important services have been dropped under the unification scheme, one begins to wonder at the patience of the persons who comprised the well-organised and efficiently-managed societies before this unification scheme became operative.  I want to say that, so far as the officials of the new organisation are concerned, that is, the National Health Society with its headquarters in Dublin, I have nothing to say.  They have been most courteous on any occasion I have had to approach them and I must pay particular tribute to the secretary of that <Col N="583" /> institution.  He has always been most courteous and has always gone to a great deal of trouble to explain, or perhaps I should say, to explain away, the causes which operate against deserving people getting the benefits which they believe, and which their medical advisers believe also, they are entitled to.  I have come across many cases, which I do not want to recount now, in which applicants for medical benefit were turned down, who received none for a considerable time and who were vouched for by two or three doctors as suffering from certain diseases and complaints which necessitated their remaining away from their work.  There have been a good many cases of hardships of that kind and my feeling in the matter, and it is a feeling shared by a large and growing number of citizens in this country, is that it is the loss of the personal contact which the various local societies had which is responsible for most of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware, because he was, I think, told it here when the Bill which gave birth to this central institution in Dublin was going through, that the fact of the head office being situated in Dublin would result in many cases of hardship. These cases of hardship have occurred.  A patient leaves the doctor with a certificate; he goes to the local office, and the local office official says that he knows no more about it, that it has gone to Dublin.  This delay is a source of complaint to me week in and week out.  I do not at all times bother the officials because I know they are efficient and hardworking.  It is not their fault; it is the fault of the system.  I think it was wrong in its inception and the prophecies of those who said at the time that it would prove a rank failure have now, I am very sorry to say, been fulfilled. We were told then, and I think it is fairly generally accepted, that the larger the organisation numerically, the more benefits it could pay.  That was true of Cork City up to the time of the amalgamation, but the members of the St. Finbarr's National Health Society and other societies operating, feel that they have been badly let <Col N="584" /> down by the Government in this scheme.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that these organisations paid maternity, optical and dental, as well as sanatoria benefits. We find now that one most important service which is regarded by medical authorities as being of primary importance to the health of the nation, the care of the teeth, has been dropped. I refer to dental treatment.  Up to July, 1936, persons who complained of their teeth were entitled to get certain benefits in the shape of extractions and so on.  When these extractions took place, they were entitled to get dental plates, etc., but now all that benefit is gone.  In many cases, members of the dental profession state that they frequently have working-class people coming into them to get teeth extracted, and they find, on examining their mouths, that they want several teeth extracted.  Some of these people are unable to pay the cost of the extractions and, to my knowledge, there are two or three dentists, personal friends of my own, by the way, who are giving free extractions to persons who cannot afford to pay. That is not a position that should be allowed to continue very long, and I make this appeal to the Minister that, when this investigation takes place, this dental treatment should be extended to the members of the National Health Societies.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that the medical profession now recognise that the care of the teeth is a very big factor indeed in the health or ill-health of the people, and that this benefit has been taken from the working-class people is something of which, I am sure, the Minister does not approve.  I urge upon him the absolute necessity of doing his best in this matter after this investigation, and to scrap this national health institution you have here in Dublin which is out of touch with the people in the country and give us back the old institutions. Deputy Dillon said it was very easy to destroy and very difficult to build up.  I agree, and I prefer to be a builder rather than a person who would destroy, but I do not see why this institution should continue, and should take money from working-class people. <Col N="585" /> That is what I want to emphasise. Why should they take money from working-class people and refuse to give them the benefits for which they are paying and have paid?  One case will illustrate what I want to put to the Minister.  A man who had been paying national health contributions since the Act was introduced had occasion some time ago to go to his local doctor, and, when his teeth were examined, the doctor told him that he should get his teeth extracted and replaced by others.  He went to his medical society and was told he could not get any dental benefit after July, 1936.  He was a man who had been paying National Health Insurance all his life, and I consider that that is a fraud on the private citizen.  I wonder if that private citizen committed fraud on the Department, if, for instance, he drew unemployment money while he was working, or national health benefit when he was only malingering, what the Minister's answer would be.  He would be entitled to prosecute him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We would if we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but what position does the private citizen find himself in now&mdash;the man who has been contributing for years and years into this fund for certain benefits he was promised and who, when he falls ill and goes to his local office, is told that after July, 1936, he cannot procure any dental benefit or treatment?  That is a state of affairs which I consider to be a fraud on the part of the State.  If a fraud is committed against the State, the State will take jolly good care to prosecute the offender and to have him in the dock.  In this case, the State, as represented by one of its institutions, is in the dock.  Again, I say I have no fault to find with the officials who are endeavouring, to the best of their ability, to run this ungainly institution which is out of sympathy and out of touch, and will continue to be out of sympathy and out of touch, with the working-class people throughout the country.  So long as you have centralisation of institutions of that kind in Dublin, you are going to have these injustices perpetrated every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> My last word to the Minister is that he should endeavour to secure that dental treatment should be restored to these people, and, again, I want to register my protest against the way in which the whole affair was managed. It was rushed through this House with a flourish of trumpets, and we were told that it might result in increased benefits because of increased numbers. I do not want to stress Deputy Dillon's points, but I think they should be emphasised.  You have increased numbers; you have increased revenue, and you have lesser benefits.  What is happening?  I hope this investigation will result in clearing the air and will result in the poor man, who is unable to pay high fees to dentists for plates or extractions, getting what is his due and getting treatment for which he contributed and paid over a long period of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any great loss or expense incurred in this matter it cannot be attributed to the payments made to agents through the country.  I think the agents of this society are a very hard-working, conscientious section of the citizens, but with regard to the rates of wages allowed to these agents in the rural areas, there is no consideration taken of the journeys these agents have to travel.  They have to travel five or ten miles, perhaps, twice a week to visit a sick person, to collect certificates or to pay benefits.  It may be quite different in the city, where a large number of insured persons reside in one street.  You may have a larger number in one street in the city than you have within a 20-mile radius in a rural area.  The payment allocated to an agent in the City of Dublin should not be put on a par with payment in the country, at so much per head.  I know a large number of agents who earn about 30/- per week and who have to provide their own bicycle and travel ten or 12 miles in all classes of weather.  In addition, they have to maintain an office and they are not allowed for postage.  These men are asked to carry on this responsible work conscientiously on a miserable pittance. Apart from the commission that is to be appointed, I make a <Col N="587" /> special appeal for special consideration for the deserving sections of the Minister's employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The service is costing a considerable amount more than it did when the old insurance committees were in operation.  There is more money being spent by the Minister's own Department in dealing with insurance than there is in England and less benefit is being given.  That cannot be attributed to the small wages paid to the agents and I protest against payment of 30/- a week to men who must be trustworthy in every way and who have to maintain an office at a cost of about £10 or £15 a year.  I was opposed to unification from the start but I do not want to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; now.  Coming from a rural constituency, I ask the Minister to carry out what was intended by the Insurance Act&mdash;that is, to make payment to sick persons during the first week of sickness.  A breadwinner who is sick should not have to depend upon charity during the first week of illness, whether that charity comes from the St. Vincent de Paul Society or by way of home assistance.  Under the present administration of the Act, a man in the country may be ill for three weeks before he receives the first payment of insurance benefit.  The agent sends up his certificates on a particular day at the end of the week.  By the time these certificates are examined by the Department in Dublin and the cheque reaches the insured person he is very often back at work after his illness. I think that that is a matter that calls <Col N="588" /> for special consideration.  That man should not have to depend on relief from a local authority.  The first week's benefit should be sent out so that he would not be dependent on charity.  During the present week I had to draw the attention of the Department to the case of a man who had been sick for three weeks and who had not received the benefit to which he was entitled, through the fault of an agent who sent up only one certificate, leaving a couple of certificates due.  The local authority must come to the rescue in those cases. The rates in rural areas are not coming in as well as one would wish.  There is high expenditure on home assistance and it is hard lines that the local authority should be obliged to come to the assistance of people who are entitled to benefit from the National Health Insurance Society but who do not receive it for a fortnight or three weeks.  I protest against undue delay in sending out cheques to sick people in the country.</P>

      <P>No Deputy in this House talks more blatherskite almost every time he gets up than Deputy Dillon, and I think he outshone himself to-day.  He claims to know something about the management of national health insurance societies before amalgamation.  If he does he should know, and every Deputy who was interested in the debates on the unification Bill should know, that if there was ever any question of bankruptcy, it had arisen when the fourth valuation report by the actuary was submitted.

      <P>Yes, because if it is a national scheme, you must, in fairness, treat all citizens alike. <Col N="589" /> How could you stand for a select little body, or coterie, getting its own members around it, getting them into a society, and keeping out everybody who was likely to have a claim against the society?  That was done.  Some societies hand-picked their members, and only allowed them in after strict medical examination.  Other societies &mdash;decent societies&mdash;had, unquestionably, strict regulations, but not so strict as those others.  County societies, trade union societies, and societies with religious affiliations took in everybody.  There were bound to be differences in these circumstances. The select body could have additional benefits for its members.  They got good lives, from the insurance point of view, and they accumulated funds. They could allow additional benefits, such as dental, optical and hospital benefits, to their members, but the vast majority of the societies could not afford to allow these benefits.</P>

      <P>Not altogether, because this fourth valuation showed that the vast majority of the societies were extending at too great a rate. Even with that report, Deputies will see that Deputy Dillon cannot keep out of trying to make politics out of this discussion on National Health <Col N="590" /> Insurance.  I could make politics out of this discussion if I wished, taking this report of the valuation from 1929 to the end of 1932.  We were not in power four years out of the five during the period of that valuation, but I am not going to make politics out of it. Probably if we were in power the same thing would have happened.  I think it is certain that it would have happened; we are not going to discuss the matter from that point of view. Therefore, I say that Deputy Dillon is dishonest in talking blatherskite of that kind.  It is not his first time doing so.  Every day he is talking blatherskite.  I am not going to say that that institution went bankrupt then nor that it is bankrupt now.  At least, according to the actuary, it was not bankrupt.  Deputy Dillon would probably say that the actuary was appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government. He was an Englishman.  I do not know who he was, but I know he was not appointed by me, anyway.  He was appointed before my time.  His figures show that there was a loss of at least £500,000, and during the last year there was a loss of £45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are trying to do is to gather the members into one association, make them stand together, make them strong and have the strong ones paying for the weak.  That is what we did.  I am not now making this argument for Deputy Dillon.  Nobody takes him seriously, but Deputy Anthony and Deputy Everett are two Deputies who are experienced and sensible and I am putting the matter to them.  They are not, I am sure, getting up to say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; For the time being the Government saved the National Health Insurance from going on the rocks.  There was a very stiff rise in expenditure during those five years.  If it were worked out in a graph it would be found that that rise was a very rapid one.  I do not say that the rise is anybody's fault.  I am not blaming anybody, but the fact is that there was a very rapid rise in expenditure and the income was not there to meet it.  That rise reached its peak some time in 1934, and it is going down since because of the careful nursing and management by the new committee of management. <Col N="591" /> That is what has happened. The new committee are being strict and they are watching the working expenses and the benefits because of that loss of £500,000.  We are not out of the wood yet and it will take some time yet before we are out of the wood.  The report showed that in the last year of the period there was a loss of £22,000; in the previous year the loss was £45,000.  We are gradually cutting down the loss.  It is untrue&mdash;I will not use any stronger word than that&mdash;for Deputy Dillon to make the statement he has made here. I put it to Deputy Dillon that I am afraid he knows it is untrue to say that the majority of the societies paid additional benefits.  They did not.</P>
    <P>If it were not for unification being put through and the responsibility taken by the Government and by me for that operation, and the House here adopting it with a considerable amount of opposition from interested parties and from people who had good societies and good membership and who were getting additional benefits, this loss would continue to increase instead of being reduced.  These societies did not care a damn about the poor persons who were in the weaker societies, the weaker societies who had to take the sick, the blind and the halt into their membership.  These societies were often subject to losses through sickness and so on.  The strong societies did not care a snap of their fingers about these weaker societies, but I want to point out to the House that this is National Health Insurance, and the strong and the healthy and the wealthy have to stand in with the weak.  Otherwise it would not be a national scheme.  I do not say that we are quite out of the wood yet.  We are not.  We are awaiting the report of the next valuation.  It would be disastrous to the future of National Health Insurance if we had not unification, despite what Deputy Anthony and Deputy Everett now say in criticism of it.  Unification was the salvation of National Health Insurance. Otherwise, the position would be that you would have people thrown on the wayside without any benefits.  Even the small 7/6 benefit would not be <Col N="592" /> available to them.  We had to ask the wealthy and the healthy people to stand in with the weaker ones.  It is a compulsory scheme as well as a national scheme.  The Government and the taxpayers of the country are paying a very considerable sum towards it.  They were not going to continue paying these considerable sums to a number of societies for the sake of enabling these special societies to handpick their members.  The Government were paying the same for everybody and, consequently, the same benefits should be available for everybody.  If we found it necessary to take some benefits from those who had additional benefits, well then we had to do it.</P>
    <P>I still hope that National Health Insurance will be saved by unification without asking the State and the taxpayer to put their hands deeper into their pockets.  Until we had unification there was no hope for National Health Insurance, but there is hope now.  I would advise Deputy Anthony and Deputy Everett to look at the matter in a sensible way.  There is no use in offering sound advice to Deputy Dillon, because he would not recognise it if he heard it.  I ask Deputies to wait until we have a proper valuation and a certain number of years has elapsed. The usual period in National Health Insurance since it was first established was the five years' period.  We hope to get a valuation earlier; at any rate, there is a valuation coming shortly.  I ask Deputies to hold their breaths and not to be shouting: &ldquo;What a great fellow I am; I told you so.&rdquo;  I was going to say that it is damned little good to talk like that, only that that would be an unparliamentary expression. I ask Deputies to keep their mouths shut before offering any definite information about National Health Insurance.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £166,667 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1938, for payment to the Pensions Investment Account [Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935 (No. 29 of 1935), Section 42 (2)].</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum now asked for is to complete the annual sum of £250,000 which is required to be paid into the &ldquo;Pensions Investments Account&rdquo; under Section 42 of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.  This annual sum of £250,000 represents the equalised subvention over the first ten years of the operation of the scheme of pensions established by the Act of 1935 in order to meet the net excess of expenditure over income during that period.  Under the Amending Act of this year the scheme of non-contributory pensions has been greatly extended and provision is made in that Act for a corresponding increase in the annual State subvention by an amount of £200,000 for each of the eight remaining years of the first ten year period. <Col N="595" /> Provision will be made for this in a later estimate.</P>
    <P>The following is a statement of the position as at 27th March:&mdash;28,624 claims for non-contributory pensions were received.  This figure includes 510 claims for contributory pensions which, having failed to qualify under the contributory provisions of the Acts, were transferred to the non-contributory class.  Out of these 28,624 claims, pensions were awarded in 15,685 cases; pensions were refused in 11,631 cases; claims were withdrawn in 514 cases, and there are 794 claims under examination.  2,215 claims for contributory pensions were received, but of that number 510 claims failed to satisfy the contribution test and were transferred to the non-contributory class.  Out of the remaining 1,705 cases contributory pensions were awarded in 1,032 cases; pensions were refused in 185 cases; seven claims were withdrawn and there are still 481 claims under examination.</P>
    <P>The wider scope of the amending legislation which has been passed has had the effect of increasing considerably the number of claims received in the last few weeks, and the number of claims under consideration has increased correspondingly.  In most of these cases title to pension does not arise under the Act of 1935 but will arise under the Amending Act.  It is anticipated also that in the case of many claims which were rejected under the Act of 1935 pensions will be payable under the new Act.  Those claims are being re-examined at present.</P>
    <P>Appeals to referees against decisions that pensions were not payable, or were payable at a reduced rate, were received in 3,534 cases.  Considerable progress has been made in dealing with these appeals.  Decisions have been given in 3,024 cases, leaving 510 cases still to be decided.</P>

This year specific provision is made for the following commissions and inquiries:&mdash;Central Savings Committee, Civil Service (Compensation) Board, Irish Manuscripts Commission, Commission on Irish in the Civil Service, Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit, Tribunal of Inquiry into the Marketing of Fruit and Vegetables, and Committee of Inquiry into Patent, Design, and Trade Mark Law.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe that, as compared with last year, provision is not made for the Inter - Departmental Committee on Public Works, which has reported, and the Town Tenants (Occupation Tenancies) Tribunal, which has completed its public sittings, and is at present engaged in the preparation of its report.  The deletion of these two commissions is responsible for a decrease of £675 in the Estimate, and, in addition, it has been found possible to reduce the provision for practically all of the existing committees as well as for commissions and inquiries not specifically provided for.  The net result is a decrease of £2,256 in the provision made for 1936-37.</P>

      <P>The provision of £96,900 for the year 1937-38 shows a net increase of £730 on the figure for last year.  This increase is largely accounted for by payments which it is expected will fall to be made in respect of additional land intended to be acquired for forestry purposes. Under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 1852 and 1854, property in the occupation of the State is exempt from assessment for rates, but since 1874 <i>ex gratia</i> contributions have been made by the State towards the expenses of local rating authorities in return for benefits enjoyed.  This Vote is intended to cover such payments.</P>

      <P>Provision for 1937-38 is £5,332, which shows an increase of £65 &mdash;a casual one due to increased provision for bonus.  The Vote for the Tariff Commission scarcely needs any introduction from me.  As Deputies are aware, the commission consists of three members whose duties are to consider and report to the Executive Council on matters relating to the imposition, abolition, or renewal or modification of a tariff.  The members of the commission perform other functions as well.  They act on the Fruit and Vegetables Tribunal, for which provision is made in Vote 9.  The chairman of the commission also acts as chairman of the Dairy Disposals Company, Ltd., so that the Dáil can rest assured that, although not fully occupied on Tariff Commission work, they are fully engaged on public service.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will read over the statement he has just made, he will see that his statement was, to say the least, rather disingenuous.  In the statement which he has just read he talks about other matters as well as tariff matters, and I think that, in that regard, the statement was definitely misleading to the House.  I do not say that it was intentionally misleading, but the effect of it was to mislead the House.  If he reads his statement, he will see that they are not engaged on tariff matter and I think it is a fact, and was so admitted by the Public Accounts Committee, of which I was a member, that they deal with no tariff matter whatever. In view of what I have said, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will find that what he said in his statement did not reflect fact.  In view of the fact that for some years this body, that has been engaged in inquiring into all sorts of odds and ends, has had nothing to do with tariffs, I think ordinary parliamentary practice would require that that body should cease to be known here as a tariff commission, meaning a body having something to do with tariffs.  I think its name should have been changed and some other name given to it indicating the other odds and ends with which it deals.  I think that if the Parliamentary Secretary reads over what he has just read, he will admit that that was a statement calculated to mislead the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that if I say that a body, or members of a body, deal with certain matters as well as something else, it clearly means that they deal with that something else, although they deal with other matters as well.  Inasmuch as it is admitted that they do not deal with tariffs, I repeat that to say that the commission or members of the commission deal with other matters as well is definitely misleading.</P>

      <P>In view of the last statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, there is one question I should like to ask.  He has stated that members of the commission, in their individual capacities, deal with other matters&mdash;matters including anything and everything except tariffs. The authority that is given by this Dáil, when the money is voted, is to the Tariff Commission.  What authority is there to devote that money to purposes performed by individual members of the commission in a different capacity?  Surely, the Parliamentary Secretary is misappropriating public moneys when he applies moneys, voted by the Dáil for a Tariff Commission, to vegetables and things of that description?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the actual position is this: This Commission has been set up in a proper manner.  It consists of certain members who are receiving certain salaries, and until that commission is abolished they are entitled to those salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No further moneys are provided&mdash;I mean, as far as that money is concerned&mdash;and if those gentlemen, during the period in which they are drawing salaries as members of the commission which is not functioning, use their very excellent <Col N="605" /> energies for other activities of the State, I think that, so far from being misappropriation, it is a very salutary and creditable saving.</P>

The increase this year is accounted for by a provision of £1,200 as an initial grant-in-aid of a publication contemplated by the Royal Irish Academy called Contributions to Lexicography of Early Irish.  The full details have yet to be settled with the Academy.  This is offset by a reduction of £100 in the grant payable to the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, which is a variable figure dependent on the expenses of that Society in keeping the Roll of Solicitors, and a reduction of £500 in the expenses provided for temporary arbitrators under the Acquisition of Lands Act.</P>

The variations under the different sub-heads of this Vote this year are comparatively small and do not, I think, need specific explanations.  The very marked increase in Stationery Office expenditure in recent years is attributable to the growth of legislation and development under the various heads of State activity.  The Stationery Office, in addition to the large increase in expenditure in printing and paper and binding arising out of the actual passing of this legislation, had to incur comparatively heavy outlay on equipment in office supplies, etc., to meet the growing needs of State Departments.  It is hoped, however, that the end of the equipment period has now been reached, and that it will be possible to effect the savings anticipated in the current year.</P>

It may be remembered that last year I was asked what a quit rent was, and I had to admit that my legal education had not reached the level which probably it ought to have reached.  I have improved it in the meantime, and I am now in a position to inform the House what a quit rent is.  The quit rents collected by the Quit Rent Office, as distinct from manorial rents, fixed in early times in discharge of certain feudal obligations and to which the term &ldquo;quit rent&rdquo; is generally applied, may be <Col N="611" /> more accurately defined as an acreable rent reserved upon all the estates in Ireland which were forfeited by the rebellion of 1641, and granted by the Crown to adventurers, soldiers and debenturers; and on lands which were then seized and later restored to innocent persons by decrees and certificates; or on lands given to transplanters. These rents were fixed at the following rates per English statute acre: In Leinster, 3d.; in Munster, 2¼d.; in Ulster, 2d.; and in Connacht, 1½d.  The term &ldquo;quit rent&rdquo; is derived from the fact that the lands affected were relieved from all other charges in favour of the new rents which were fixed in perpetuity.  If any Deputy in the House desires to go more deeply into the subject I would refer him to Howard's &ldquo;Exchequer and Revenue, Ireland, 1776,&rdquo; which contains a full description of these rents, page 31, <i>et seq.</i></P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether what I might call the association of this Department with the general Government control has been tightened up?  When an inquiry into certain gold-mining operations was taking place, and relevant documents and information had to be got, if I remember rightly, the existence of the Quit Rent Office seems to have been overlooked, and the records one wanted were really not adequately supplied because nobody seemed responsible for it.  Nobody seemed to have thought that such a place existed, and that the matters which we were discussing to some extent came under the aegis of that Department.  It seemed to be a sort of orphan, a remote island which had no contact with any other aspect of Government business, and was completely forgotten except when it came to discussing an Estimate for it in this House.</P>

    <P>The total amount available for the new schemes will, therefore, be £1,082,950.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the Employment Fund for the financial year just closed may be most conveniently reviewed by examining the total allocation under each sub-head of expenditure as follows:&mdash;Public Health Works: The total allocation under this head is £807,000, of which £322,221 represents a State grant.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £434,545.  Roads and footpaths in urban areas: The total allocation is £300,800, and the State grant £187,900. The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £96,894.  Road schemes by county councils in rural areas: Total allocation, £461,120, including a State contribution of £311,620.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £223,071.  The allocation includes £50,000 for tourist roads in the Gaeltacht, given without a local contribution.  Minor relief schemes: Total allocation, £309,080; no local contribution.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £253,500.  Development of housing <Col N="614" /> sites: Total allocation, £167,000; State grant, £83,500.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £22,000.  I am giving these figures in detail so that Deputies may be able to estimate the efficiency of different headings from the point of view of getting expenditure away in a hurry.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation and distribution of manures and seed oats: Total allocation, £115,620 by way of a State grant.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £95,620.  Peat development schemes: Total allocation, £49,700, all State grant, of which the estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £29,700.  Miscellaneous: Total allocation, £189,840; State grant, £105,109.  The estimated expenditure to the 31st March, 1937, is £22,183.  That particular item will always be relatively low in its expenditure to the total.</P>
    <P>The employment fund for 1936-37 was made up of £1,565,000 State grant, and £942,160 contributions by local authorities&mdash;total £2,507,160.  The sum expended to the 31st March was approximately £1,177,513, of which £782,247 was State grant.  Works representing the great bulk of the balance&mdash;that is, the amount which the Dáil is now asked to provide by way of revote&mdash;are for the most part actually in hands or in a position to be begun at once, and it is estimated that the greater portion of the expenditure will be completed by the end of the summer.</P>
    <P>In this connection it should be stated that an employment programme, costing £2,500,000, cannot be put into operation rapidly.  If the money is not to be squandered, there must be careful organisation and planning.  The Budget speech announcing the employment fund of 1936-37 was made on the 12th May last year, and the moneys were voted by the Dáil on the 1st July.  At that time the second Employment Periods Order was in force, so that expenditure in the rural areas and the great majority of the towns (which represents two-thirds of the total expenditure) was possible only in a limited degree during the summer and until the middle of November, when the unemployment assistance register <Col N="615" /> had again filled up.  The most that was possible in the circumstances was to carry out summer drainage schemes in such areas as unemployed workers were to be found in sufficient numbers and for which suitable schemes were available, and this was done.  Other schemes in rural and urban areas necessitated negotiations with local authorities re local contributions&mdash;the preparation of plans and estimates&mdash; the examination of same by headquarters; and other details of collaboration as between different Departments, and between Departments and local authorities.  It was not, therefore, until the middle of November that the employment programme was fully under way.</P>
    <P>For the coming year the case will be somewhat different, as the revote from 1936/37 will provide work for the early part of the financial year, and, if the rate of progress achieved this winter is repeated, the great bulk of the new money should be expended by 31st March, 1938.  Instead of having to revote approximately half the total sum next year we do not expect to have to revote more than about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Thanks are due to all the Government Departments which have collaborated with the Office of Public Works for their cordial co-operation and assistance in the carrying out of the year's employment programme. The Department of Local Government and Public Health have had the lion's share of the funds for works administered by them, and they have done everything in their power to facilitate the smooth working of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Reference is made later to the special collaboration between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Office of Public Works in respect of (a) finding the data for the rational distribution of relief moneys and (b) recruitment of labour, and the opportunity must be taken to express the highest appreciation of the services rendered by the officials of the employment branch, both at headquarters and in the local offices.</P>
    <P>They have been subjected in the local offices to a very considerable, new and unusual strain this year, and <Col N="616" /> from the highest down to the last member of that staff we are under an obligation for the enthusiastic work which the labour exchanges have put into the schemes this year.</P>
    <P>The severest task of all has probably fallen on the local surveyors and engineers and their assistants, who have had charge of the actual execution of the works.  The volume of work entrusted to them was very much increased compared with that done in previous years, and it was rendered particularly difficult by the introduction, for the first time on a general scale, of the difficult principle of rotational employment.</P>
    <P>During the spring and summer of 1936, an average number of 3,000 workmen were employed on various employment schemes.  At the expiry of the Employment Period Order at the beginning of November, the unemployment assistance register filled up rapidly and employment schemes on a general scale began simultaneously. The actual numbers employed at different periods during the winter are as follows.  Taking land reclamation and relief works as a whole, the figure for the week ended 25th November is 10,141; week ended 19th December, 36,259; week ended 16th January, 45,132, and week ended 13th February, 50,456.</P>
    <P>That was the peak period and corresponded within three days with the anticipated peak period of necessity for employment.  It is very remarkable to say, with something like 3,000 schemes going together, carried on in all the different counties under the different surveyors, that co-ordination and co-operation were so excellent that it was possible to make the figure of artificial employment at 50,456 correspond practically to a day with the period with which it was required. Of these 50,456 men, approximately 10,000 were workmen who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance before employment, and about four-fifths of the total were employed on the rotational system with an average employment of 3½ days per week for each workman.</P>
    <P>This is a suitable occasion to review the developments that have taken <Col N="617" /> place in the administration of relief moneys since the task was taken over by the Office of Public Works in 1932. Before that time no special study had been made of the problem of effecting an equitable distribution of the available funds according to the relative needs of areas and individuals, with the result that the expenditure on relief works did not always take place where it was most needed nor did the wages always find their way into the pockets of the most necessitous individuals.  It is, of course, true that in previous years the great bulk of relief moneys had been spent in the congested districts counties, and it might appear at first sight that all that is required to effect a proper distribution of relief funds is to devote to each county an allocation proportionate to its relative poverty.  But that is not so, for the different parts of a county generally vary very much amongst themselves in their degree of poverty or comparative wealth.  This is made clear by examining the position of, say, Counties Galway, Cork and Donegal, where almost all the poverty and distress is to be found in the western portion of the county, and without a precise knowledge of the internal distribution of unemployment and distress very great inequalities of distribution might take place.</P>
    <P>The problem of distribution amongst urban areas is a simple one, as each of these areas is a self-contained unit so far as the provision of employment schemes is concerned; but in the rural areas the problem is conditioned by the distance that workmen can reasonably be expected to walk to work.  If the nature of this limitation is understood it will be clear that in a district covering 20 or 30 miles a single large scheme providing work for, say, 400 or 500 men cannot take the place of ten smaller works each requiring 40 to 50 men.  In practice this means that if workmen in rural areas are not to have too far to walk to their work suitable schemes must be provided in some 1,200 or 1,500 separate centres, and this, in fact, is what is being done at present.  It is unfortunate that the most suitable schemes of work are not always to be found in these areas <Col N="618" /> where the greatest need for providing employment exists, and this is one of the reasons why complaints are made that the most suitable schemes are not always those which are selected for the employment programme.</P>
    <P>The first effort in 1932, therefore, was to fix on a recognised unit of area which from the point of view of distance from workers to their work would not be too large, and from the point of view of obtaining sufficient workmen for a gang, would not be too small; the intention being to provide a separate work for each such area provided its poverty or unemployment position warranted it, and provided that a reasonably suitable scheme could be found.  The unit of rural area known as the &ldquo;District Electoral Division&rdquo; was selected for this purpose, and when this was done it became necessary to find a method of measuring the relative need of each of these areas with respect to the others.  There are some 3,000 of these electoral areas in the Free State. This, of course, was before the introduction of the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933, and the method employed was to fix what was called a &ldquo;poverty factor&rdquo; for each electoral division, based on the rateable valuation of agricultural land per head of the population.  A grant in proportion to the poverty factor was then made for every eligible electoral division. This system proved surprisingly reliable in the light of later checks and was in use until the Unemployment Assistance Acts came actively into operation.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the recruitment of labour for employment schemes proceeded on the basis of preference being given to the most necessitous workmen who applied.  The duty of selecting the workmen was entrusted for some time to the officials in charge of the works; but, though everything that was possible in the circumstances was done to choose the right workmen, the system led to a large number of complaints of unfair discrimination, as was indeed bound to be the case, for the reason that the officials in charge of matters had no precise method of ascertaining the relative measure of necessitousness of an applicant for work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> When the Unemployment Assistance Act came into active operation in 1934 it suggested a means of overcoming the chief difficulties which had hitherto lain in the way of the effective administration of relief moneys.  The Act provided a definite criterion or test of unemployment, and, by its graduated scale of unemployment assistance payments, disclosed the relative degree of necessitousness of recipients: it indicated the number of unemployed workmen in each area, and it made possible a precise system of recruitment.  Before these advantages could be made use of for employment schemes, however, it was necessary to arrange for the sub-division of the unemployment register records in the employment exchanges and local offices in such a way as to correspond with the system of distribution of moneys used by the Office of Public Works.  This important work was accomplished in due course by the setting up of a geographical register in the employment offices from which information can readily be supplied of the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each town and rural electoral division, and by means of which recruitment of labour for employment schemes can be carried out with certainty and despatch.  The Department of Industry and Commerce have already made several special enumerations of the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each town and rural electoral division in the Saorstát, and these statistics constitute the basis on which relief moneys are now divided.  The latest return we have is a special census made on the 4th of February of this year, and by ascertaining for every electoral area in the Free State the number of unemployment assistance people registered in the exchanges and at the same time the number of people from each of these electoral areas actually engaged on relief works at the time, we have now an accurate and up-to-date picture of the position, and that figure, subject to such corrections as may be necessary from time to time, will be used as the basis probably of distribution.  The respective systems of the Office of Public Works and the <Col N="620" /> Department of Industry and Commerce so far as the administration of employment schemes is concerned may be said to be complementary to each other, with the result that the areas in which employment schemes are required can be definitely ascertained and the most necessitous workmen can be recruited at the shortest possible notice.</P>
    <P>The fruit of this close collaboration between the Employment Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Special Division, Office of Public Works, has been to make possible during the past winter the employment of as many as 50,000 workmen at one and the same time on special employment schemes, of whom more than 90 per cent. had been in receipt of unemployment assistance before their recruitment, the remainder being nearly all skilled tradesmen and carters.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of the preliminary problems of (a) the proper distribution of the relief vote as between units of area and (b) the recruitment of workmen, attention was next directed to the question of the degree to which it would be possible to effect a distribution of the money available for wages in proportion to the relative needs of the individual workmen. This clearly can only be done by a system of rotational or part-time employment by which men receive varying numbers of days employment per week.</P>
    <P>In order to understand the question it is necessary to point out that the sums provided in the Budget for (a) unemployment assistance and (b) special employment schemes for the relief of unemployment, are complementary to each other; and that together they must be regarded as a joint fund which represents the direct provision which the State makes for the relief of unemployment and distress. The joint amount required for these two services is fixed before the Budget; an estimate is made in advance of the savings in unemployment assistance which will be effected by reason of the operation of the employment schemes, and the amount represented by this saving is then hypothecated to the employment fund for the <Col N="621" /> provision of employment schemes.  It is wrong, therefore, to suggest, as has been done, that the principle of rotational or part-time employment is merely a device to save unemployment assistance payments.  For the current year it is proposed to provide a sum of £1,121,000 for unemployment assistance payments and a sum of £827,750 (State Grant only), not including the re-Vote, for the provision of employment schemes for the relief of unemployment, and from what has already been said, it is clear that these two funds are inter-dependent, and that the amount made available for the provision of employment schemes already includes the estimated saving in respect of unemployment assistance payments.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the Unemployment Assistance Acts are based on the principle that the weekly payment made to each eligible unemployed person shall be proportionate to the degree of his need as measured by reference to the number of his dependents, and adjusted in respect of any means of which he may be possessed. This being so, it is difficult to resist the inference that the distribution of the employment fund as between individual workmen should be governed by the same general principle of graduated benefits.  This, in effect, is the principal justification for rotational or part-time employment on employment schemes provided by the State for the relief of unemployment. For example, the Unemployment Assistance Acts provide that an eligible unemployed workman with dependent wife and five or more other dependents shall, other things being equal, receive a weekly payment more than double that given to a single man with no dependents; and considering the inter-dependence of the two separate funds for the relief of unemployment, and their common purpose, there seems to be no reason why, to the extent to which it is possible in practice, a similar differentiation should not be made with respect to the wages earned on employment schemes.  It is only by doing so that the benefits of the funds provided for employment schemes can be distributed over the largest possible number <Col N="622" /> of necessitous workmen in proportion to their individual necessities.</P>
    <P>It was for these reasons, therefore, that an effort was made during the past winter to carry out as many employment schemes as possible, on the principle of rotational employment for unskilled labourers.  The type of rotation employed is of a modified kind, and does not purport to follow all the gradations of unemployment assistance scales.  The various categories of workmen are given three, four or five days' work per week, according to the scale of unemployment assistance payable, with a limited number of cases of two days' employment per week.</P>
    <P>Rotation of labour had been previously practised to a limited extent, and, curiously enough, Dublin City was one of the places in which a system of &ldquo;three day on and three day off&rdquo; rotation had been in use on relief schemes for some years, but it was, of course, inevitable that there should be a number of complaints and objections to the inauguration of the system on a widespread scale.  As compared with the very large number of works that were carried out, however, the number of complaints was almost negligible; and it is not too much to claim for the new system tried during the winter that it has been entirely satisfactory as demonstrating the following points:&mdash;(1) The administrative feasibility of a complex system of rotational employment; (2) the reasonable adequacy of the return of work given by the workmen employed on intermittent spells of work; (3) the general willingness of the workmen themselves to work under the conditions laid down; (4) the intrinsic usefulness and desirability of the work that can be done; (5) the distribution of the benefits of the employment scheme fund over a large number of workmen.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the workman himself, the chief advantages of the special employment schemes as compared with the payment of unemployment assistance are that (1) he is able to earn a larger weekly income while preserving his complete independence; (2) he does not lose touch <Col N="623" /> completely with the habit of physical labour and the discipline which it entails.  The advantage of the rotational method of employment as compared with full-time employment is that it distributes these benefits over the largest possible number of workmen, and preserves the principle embodied in the Unemployment Assistance Acts of adjusting the amount of State relief to the degree of necessitousness of the individual workman. Full-time employment means the same provision for a married man having six dependents and for a single man without dependents at all; rotational employment permits of the necessary differentiation being made.</P>
    <P>On the limited system of rotation at present in use, a workman earns in many cases from two to three times as much by way of wages as he would receive by way of unemployment assistance payments, and for this reason it is clear that even when working on a system of rotational labour, workmen are placed in a privileged position as compared with less fortunate unemployed persons who continue to draw unemployment assistance. The fact that we are employing 50,000 does not get over the fact that we have still 70,000 men on the register.  Full-time employment on employment schemes would carry the process of discrimination still further and emphasise still more the disparity of treatment by concentrating in the hands of a strictly limited number of workers all the benefits of the employment scheme fund.  It would be possible with a given fund&mdash;and you have always to start from the fact that you will have a limited fund&mdash;to increase the period of employment of every man of the 50,000 employed by a day, to give three-day men four days, to give four-day men five days, and the five-day men six days, or to increase them in every other proportion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>You can to the extent that some men are getting full time. That might be a perfectly legitimate discrimination to make.  If, with a limited sum, we were to increase the period of employment of all of the 50,000 now employed, it could only be done by increasing the number of the 70,000 men who were getting no more than unemployment assistance.  It could only be done by reducing the 50,000 now getting certain benefit to a smaller number.  Three alternatives to rotational employment have frequently been proposed: (1) Full-time employment all the year round for all the unemployed on the register.  I believe that proposal was put forward by a part of the Deputy's constituency last year.</P>
      <P>This would be admirable if it were possible, but the drawback is that a scheme of the kind would cost approximately £15,000,000 per annum; and it will probably be agreed on all sides that this would be a burden altogether beyond the resources of the country. It should also be pointed out that even if the money were available, it would not be possible to find suitable schemes over any considerable period of time, with any reasonable labour content. Taking the first year of the £15,000,000, we would skim the cream of all the high content labour works in every sphere of public activity; and to employ the same number of men full time for the following year would cost more, and in every succeeding year, more, because the labour content of the whole would fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second proposal is full-time employment in respect of whatever sum is made available for employment schemes.  This would reduce the number of workmen benefiting by the schemes to one-half as compared with the present system of modified rotation, and would increase the disparity of treatment between those employed and their less fortunate fellows who remain on the register.  Under the system of rotation during the past winter, as many as 50,000 workmen were employed at one time, but if full-time employment had been given it would have <Col N="625" /> altogether excluded some 20,000 to 25,000 of these workmen from participation and would have concentrated in the hands of the remainder all the benefits of the entire employment fund so far as the money is devoted to the payment of wages.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion is a species of rotation by which workmen would be employed full time for alternate fortnights and would be entitled to unemployment assistance payment in the fortnights during which they were not working.  This has the disadvantages referred to in the previous case, but in a lesser degree.  It would mean the employment of a somewhat smaller number of workmen, for the reason that it would entail increased payment of unemployment assistance, the amount of which would have to be deducted from the sum available for employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore it should be stated that there has always been a strong objection to providing full-time employment on relief schemes at current rates of wages, for the reason that agricultural and other workers would certainly be attracted and thus withdrawn from their normal employment. That does to a considerable extent already happen.</P>
    <P>With regard to local contributions, the grants for road works in 1936-37 were offered in two instalments; for the first instalment in rural areas, a local contribution of 40 per cent. was asked, and for the second, 25 per cent., representing a 36 per cent. local contribution on the joint offers.  In addition, free grants amounting to £50,000 were made to Gaeltacht areas. In the urban areas the local contributions sought were 50 per cent. and 25 per cent. respectively, or 37½ per cent. on the joint offer.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding protests and delays, the rural offers were well taken up, the first by all councils and the second by all but two councils.  In the urban areas, however, some councils refused or demurred to the offers, and exceptional treatment in regard to local contributions were claimed in several cases.  In some cases the offer of a State grant subject to a local contribution was regarded as suspect <Col N="626" /> from the point of view that it would not be financially advantageous to the council, and the view was expressed that it was merely an effort to save money in the form of unemployment assistance for the Exchequer.  I can assure the House that there is no possible means by which men can be employed which will save the Exchequer net on the unemployment assistance contribution.</P>
    <P>This question was raised, I remember, in relation to the City of Cork. A financial analysis of the position as affecting the city disclosed the interesting fact that on the assumption that no employment schemes were initiated, the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act resulted in a net profit of £68,000 to the city, being the difference between (a) the cost to the city of payments of home assistance plus the contribution made by the council to the unemployment fund; and (b) the benefit derived by the city from the unemployment assistance paid by the State and home assistance payments made by the local authority.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, employment schemes as sanctioned in 1936-37 were in operation, the profit to the city would be increased to £100,500, being the difference between (a) the cost to the council of home assistance plus the contributions made by the council to the unemployment assistance fund and to the employment schemes, and (b) the reduced unemployment assistance payments made by the Government, the cost of the employment schemes and the home assistance spent in the city.  The city received in additional benefit £100,500, plus the value of the work that was done.</P>
    <P>The Donegal County Council, or some members of it, appear to have had similar scruples about accepting the allocation recently offered.  A like analysis shows that the enactment of the Unemployment Assistance Act involved a profit of £130,000 to the county, while the operation of employment schemes, requiring a local contribution of only £4,000, would increase the profit to £189,000, quite independently of the value of the work done.</P>
    <P>Although the general level of local <Col N="627" /> contributions attained last year was highly satisfactory, it had to be recognised that this was the outcome of an almost universal recourse to borrowing, and when it was made clear that employment schemes were to be regarded as a recurring feature of the annual Estimates, it became evident that the encouragement of the continuance of borrowing for the purpose of local contributions in respect of road works and schemes of the kind would be unsound and that local contributions should be made from current revenue. This consideration prompted the fixation of a lower proportionate aggregate of contribution by local authorities for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, last year's experience went to show that the adoption of a uniform rate of contribution involved the anomaly that the poorest areas with the largest unemployment problem, and, therefore, requiring the largest sums for relief of unemployment, were automatically, and, as it seems, wrongly called upon to find the largest gross contributions.  To remove this anomaly in the coming year it is proposed to depart from the uniform basis of local contributions and to relate to some extent the contribution in each case to the capacity of the local authority to bear the burden.  The capacity of any local authority to make a contribution is regulated by (a) its immediate financial position and (b) its ultimate capacity, as generally represented by the rateable valuation of the area administered by the local authority.  What we are doing now is distributing money to the counties, and districts in the counties, in proportion to their necessity, to their poverty, and asking contributions from the counties in proportion to their wealth.</P>
    <P>It has been frequently urged that the Exchequer should assume entire responsibility for the cost of employment schemes.  There is much to be said in favour of this proposal.  It would have the unquestionable benefit of obviating the necessity of delicate and often difficult negotiations with local authorities, which not only delay the initiation of these schemes, but make it difficult to plan an employment <Col N="628" /> programme in advance with any degree of certainty.  Freedom from these causes of embarrassment would be a very great aid in the administration of employment schemes.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many sound reasons against abandoning the principle of local contributions, not the least of which is the fact that the making of a contribution secures the definite interest of the local authority, and of each ratepayer, in the work, and ensures not only that works of the highest public utility will be put forward, but that their satisfactory execution will be carefully watched. It is to be feared that if the total cost of the schemes were borne by the Exchequer and the local authority deprived of a serious stake in the business, the works, which must, of necessity, and for the most part, be carried out through local organisations, would tend to be given second place in the matter of supervision, control and public interest.  It is very desirable that a contribution should be made by the local authority in order that they will be actively conscious that they are paying a share of the cost of the works, and for that reason, will ensure the supervision which will enable them to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Last year, we found that the organisation which was set up was flexible and receptive, and more capable than we had anticipated to take the new load that was put on it.  I am satisfied that the new organisation, trained as it has been during the campaign of this year, will enter upon a new year capable of doing even better work. The only anxiety I have in that regard is in relation to the supply of schemes of a suitable quality both in the urban and rural districts.  It is not easy to find in any urban district at the present moment new works of the kind which ought not to be done as part of the ordinary expenditure of that local authority and which are themselves useful and possess a high labour content.  I am having put up to me proposals&mdash;very discouraging proposals&mdash;from local authorities for schemes with a labour <Col N="629" /> content as low as 30 per cent.  It is quite obvious that if the majority of schemes by the local authorities were to reach any figure of that kind, the actual money that would go to the employed persons&mdash;that is the thing with which we in this Vote are primarily concerned&mdash;would be very small.  Every effort must be made by local authorities, Government Departments, and ourselves as the co-ordinating authority, to see that the standard of labour content is kept as high as possible.</P>
    <P>The second point giving me anxiety in this regard is in relation to the supply of minor relief schemes.  We carried out last year 2,000 to 3,000 of these schemes.  If Deputies look at the map downstairs, they will see these little brown dots all over the place. Unfortunately, or fortunately, that has been going on for years.  We have done thousands of these schemes in the last few years, and while about 10,000 schemes altogether have been sent in to us, the best of these schemes have been done.  To envisage a system by which a continuous supply of minor relief schemes which will fit into every individual area in proportion to the need of that area can be kept up over a period of years is very difficult.  My supply of these schemes is running down.  On four or five occasions I have appealed to members on all sides of the House to give us these schemes. There has been prepared a special form which makes it extremely easy for Deputies to give the information in the page in which it is desired.  I have made personal appeals to my own friends to fill these gaps.  I am now making that appeal again to the House.  I shall require a whole lot of new schemes of the minor relief order to be distributed over the country.  It will be no use giving them to me in September, October or November. We start making our relief schemes for each year on the 1st January of that year.  These schemes are now in preparation.  I am asking Deputies in all corners of the House to use their local knowledge to see that these schemes are provided and in the possession of the Department of Public Works on the special forms which are available and which will be <Col N="630" /> supplied to any member of the House. I want to have a sufficient supply of properly-distributed minor relief schemes.  If that is done, I think the other portions of the work&mdash;the public health portion and the rural roads portion-will easily be met.</P>
    <P>There is, undoubtedly, cause for anxiety in relation to works in urban areas.  If Deputies know of desirable works in urban areas, I shall be glad if they will tell me.  In the ordinary way, people feel that they should thank you for the acceptance of a relief work.  Our attitude of mind is entirely different.  We are more anxious to receive from Deputies suggestions for good works&mdash;works which have a high labour content and a high economic value-than they can possibly be to put them forward.  I am glad and proud to say that I have had during the last couple of years the co-operation of Deputies from all parts of the House in putting forward these schemes.  I am looking for that co-operation in future.  I have had behind me in this work the very excellent staff of the special division of the Board of Works.  I take this opportunity of thanking that staff for the continuous, unceasing and unmeasured work which they have put into the success of these schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his closing invitation to Deputies to send in for his consideration as many minor relief schemes as they can suggest from their various localities.  I trust that frank expression by Deputies of what they think about the methods of administration of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department will not militate against the favourable reception of these schemes.  I express that hope because the Parliamentary Secretary intimated a couple of years ago that people who felt like castigating him and criticising the rates of wages paid upon relief schemes had no right to be coming along looking for schemes for their districts.  I propose to avail myself to the full of the invitation extended by the Parliamentary Secretary by submitting as many schemes as I can lay hands on.  I trust that what I have to say in connection <Col N="631" /> with the Estimate under consideration will not militate against the favourable consideration of these schemes.  Listening to the carefully-prepared and eloquent peroration of the Parliamentary Secretary to-night, one wondered if it was to the actual rotational schemes in operation in the country that he was referring.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out the advantages of the schemes to such an extent that one wondered how this country managed to get along before these rotational schemes were introduced. He furnished us with cause for serious thought.  The fact that the people who are concerned with the rotational schemes have not realised the beneficence of those schemes must be due to their crass ignorance.  He pointed out that if anything happened to affect the rotational schemes, 50,000 persons who are enjoying the advantages of these schemes would fall back into the category of their less fortunate fellows who are in receipt of less money.  I am going to suggest that it is not an advantage to get work on a rotational scheme. At all events, it should not be an advantage if the laws of the State are made operative.  If the Unemployment Assistance Act is to be allowed to operate, then it should be an advantage to married men with dependents not to get a job on the rotational schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that a definite privilege is given to the men working on those schemes as compared with the more unfortunate fellows who are unable to get on.  But if you concentrate on that type of scheme 70,000 or 50,000 employed and unemployed would have to change places because of the rotational system, and somebody will have to suffer.  I have here the case of a man living in the parish of Doon, in the County Limerick.  He is a married man with seven children.  He worked on this rotational scheme for three weeks before Christmas and three weeks after Christmas.  The average earnings of this man in those six weeks was 5/9 per week.  That was because of the bad weather, plus the limitations <Col N="632" /> imposed by the regulations in the working of the rotational scheme.  I can produce that man in evidence. Now, if that man had not the privilege of working on the rotational scheme he would be drawing 12/6 a week at the labour exchange.  If that man cannot see the benefit and advantage of the Hugo Flinn rotational scheme it is because he is an obstinate and evil-minded fellow!  This rotational business is the progeny of Deputy Hugo Flinn's 24/- a week.  We really thought he had plumbed the depths in this 24/- a week wages to labourers.  But he has now gone much further.  We have the figure of 24/- a week, minus deductions for insurance, etc.  Here is a case of a man earning 5/9 a week during six weeks around Christmas. He is one of the 50,000 people who had been put into employment.  I do not think that in the big, spacious case put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary there was anything that would justify this scheme of rotational employment.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that was not introduced for the purpose of saving the Unemployment Fund.  No one, he said, would make such a suggestion but one who was most stupid or obstinate.  I suggest, however, that that is the fundamental object of the rotational scheme.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the distances that men had to travel to their work.  He complained that in certain areas they were unable to get enough persons within the regular area to do a particular job. He was, however, careful not to mention what his Department considers the maximum distance or the reasonable distance that an unemployed man should travel to one of these relief schemes.  I might mention that quite recently I fought the labour exchange in Limerick in the case of five men who were disqualified from benefit because they refused to travel morning and evening a distance of seven miles to and from the place where they were offered work.  Because of that they were struck off from unemployment benefit.  It took two or three months before these cases could be brought to final fruition.  Then four of the men were admitted to benefit and the fifth <Col N="633" /> man was disallowed his appeal because he had a bicycle.  Because he had a bicycle he was supposed to be able to travel.  This man has actually travelled the distance until his bicycle broke down.  He borrowed a bicycle from another man but this other man wanted his bicycle back; this fifth man was unable to walk the journey and he was accordingly struck off benefit.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he considers it a fair test that a man should walk seven miles in the morning to his work and seven miles back in the evening?  The older men have no bicycles and, if they had, some of them could not ride them.  Men with families are supposed to be given a privilege, but here we find the men are being put out of benefit if they are unable to travel these long distances.  Perhaps the younger men would not so much mind, but it is impossible in the case of the older men.  A couple of months ago I referred to this question here.  When Deputy Murphy, of West Cork, said that the men in this district were expected to travel five miles I interjected that in Limerick it was often found to be eight miles.  Shortly afterwards when leaving the House I was told by a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party that in his case he would make it ten miles each way, for he had such cases in his area.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary maintain that there is really no limit to the distances our people are to travel to their work in these relief schemes so as to qualify them to share in the benefits of this 4/- a day scheme minus deductions for insurance, etc.?  I am prepared to admit that I have learned to-night for the first time of the five-day schemes. I suggest these schemes must be confined to the City of Dublin for the four-day week is the maximum down in our side of the country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke also of the fact that 90 per cent. of the people who come on to these schemes come off the unemployment assistance.  But he did not stress the point.  He mentioned that they had only finished the Employment Order period at the end of October. These men were not long on unemployment <Col N="634" /> assistance.  They had gone through their purgatory from July until October, when they were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go back to the abundant agricultural work that was there for the asking.  When doing that the Minister was not too particular as to whether these men had previous training in agriculture.  All kinds of people&mdash;pork butchers, railwaymen, toilers, carpenters, and so on&mdash;were caught up in that and were made compete with the agricultural workers for work in the hay-fields.  In competition with agricultural workers, of course, they were not employed.  No attempt has been made to find out whether employment was given to the men who were robbed by the operations of the Employment Period Orders.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that they came off the unemployed lists.  Very often we find, because of bad weather, that the four-day week works out at only three days, two days or one day.  When there is a three-day week, very often the man only gets one day's work, and still the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that that is privileged employment. Those men thereafter dare not go near a labour exchange.  They have been, we are told, transferred from the unemployed ranks to the employed ranks.  That is the statistical side of the operation.  We are told then at the end of a period that 50,000 unemployed men have been put into employment.  All these men, we are told, are working; but the fact is that very often none of them is working.  And then we must remember the case of the man with the wife and seven children who is earning 5/9 a week at this rotational work.  I am sure such a man must have a very big banking account as the result of his savings on those wages.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken about retaining the good consciousness of the local authorities.  I agree that there ought to be a connection between the local authorities and the executive authority in the spending of these moneys.  But is not the Parliamentary Secretary aware <Col N="635" /> that the most active consciousness of the local authorities is their helplessness to get one man employed on schemes where they are contributing on a fifty-fifty basis?  To secure work the men must go to the labour exchange.  We have had countless cases of men who were refused employment and who got into difficulties because of this very system which the Parliamentary Secretary says is managed so very successfully. In this matter of ascertaining whether the man made an effort to secure work, there is a revision court.  The man is held guilty until he has proved himself innocent.</P>
    <P>During the intervening period he cannot get any benefit from the labour exchange.  Neither can he get work on schemes under which the local authority pay 50 per cent. of the cost. That is the matter that has not been sufficiently looked into.  We have had repeated representations made as to the cases of men who were entitled to get employment on schemes where we put up £ for £ against the money put up by the central authority.  In these cases we found ourselves unable to secure the needed employment for the men.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that.  The Parliamentary Secretary has taken solace to himself over those schemes of his.  Does he believe what he has been telling us?  Does he believe that the schemes are really the huge success he claims they are?  He takes as evidence bearing out his claim that they are a success the willingness of the workers to participate, the willingness of the workers to avail of the schemes.  What are the facts?  The facts are that if the workers do not accept, they have no alternative but starvation.  They have to take what is offered to them&mdash;four days, three days or two days' work in the week. As a matter of fact, you have done nothing but degrade the workers.  I <Col N="636" /> know of nothing that has happened in this country during my lifetime that has created such a feeling of indignation, and rightful indignation, as those schemes which the Parliamentary Secretary tells us are such a huge success. He emphasises the willingness of the workers to take part in the schemes. What is their alternative?  If they do not take the work, they are denied recognition at the labour exchange; they have either to take what is offered or starve.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then tells us blandly that the willingness of the workers is one of the evidences he has of the success of his schemes.  He talks of the co-operation of the officials in the labour exchange.  I take off my hat to the efforts of the officials in connection with the administration of this additional and almost impossible burden.  It was never their job.  They have been asked to undertake a most difficult task and I endorse every word the Parliamentary Secretary said when he was paying tribute to them.  I take issue with the Parliamentary Secretary, however, when he suggests there was a willingness on the part of a single worker to participate in a rotational scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>They were compelled, they were forced in by circumstances and nothing else.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that a scheme was put forward by Deputy Keyes and others. There was only one scheme put forward by Deputy Keyes, in conjunction with responsible Deputies from the Parliamentary Secretary's own Party.  That scheme advocated a rotation of three weeks instead of three days.  The idea was to give a man three weeks' work instead of three days' work in each week.  I submit on examination that scheme will be found to be economically sound.  There is only one thing to prevent the Parliamentary Secretary from working it, and that is the fact that at the end of three weeks the men will be entitled to go back to the labour exchange.  I do not think that is a thing that will appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a band of men were taken on work <Col N="637" /> for a three weeks' stretch, to be replaced by another band of men for a further three weeks, and if that system were maintained, the men who would be disbanded temporarily would become entitled to go back to the labour exchange and sign for their unemployment benefit.  But that is not an aspect that appeals to the Parliamentary Secretary.  His idea is to give them three days each week and so keep them away from the labour exchange. That is the only scheme that Deputy Keyes and others with him have put forward.  I do not want to be misrepresented and I do not want it suggested that I fathered any other scheme.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary quite recently asking me about something that appeared in the provincial Press, something that I stated in this House on this very matter.  I am amazed that the Parliamentary Secretary should have to refer to a provincial paper when he has the Official Debates at his disposal, in which is recorded perfectly correctly all that takes place here.  I refrained from replying to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I suggest to him now that if he looks up the Official Debates he will find what I said reported there, and he will find what his Minister for Finance said in the same debate, and he may derive some enlightenment from the discussion on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said that night, that I am definitely of opinion, and I am reinforced in that opinion by consultation with engineers in this country whose names I am not now going to disclose, that the money spent on rotational schemes is, and must necessarily be, wasted.  It is not necessary for anyone to be an engineer to realise that, but I am reinforced by the opinions of engineers in my viewpoint on that matter.  If a job is to be done and a man makes an estimate, he bases it on the normal working of the employees on the scheme.  Men going to a job prepared to work to the finish will naturally have a short period of apprenticeship, so to speak, getting into the running of the scheme.  In the case of the rotational schemes a man is hardly settled on the job when he <Col N="638" /> has to go.  He could not have the same interest in the work as if he were kept continually on it.  In the second place he could not have acclimatised himself to the conditions of the work by the time he is replaced.  The constant interchange, putting different relays of men on to the job, must be very disturbing to those in control.  The engineer could not expect the same percentage of a return as he would get if the same men were employed continuously on the scheme.</P>
    <P>I feel that argument ought to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has some engineering knowledge and knows more about these things than I do.  But I think he does not wish to admit that, because he has another object in view; he is trying to save the funds.  I am sure he will not deny the reasonableness of my contention that you cannot get the same return of work from 12 men working in relays as you can get from a lesser number of men working continuously on the one job.  If so, the rules and the laws that I knew something about must be completely upset since the rotational schemes were started.</P>
    <P>Apparently this boon and blessing, as the Parliamentary Secretary describes it, has so appealed to the workers that they are putting more into their efforts than they ever gave before.  I do not want to ramble too far from the subject; I want to concentrate on the rotational schemes, and on my objection to them.  I have travelled a good deal through the country, and I have not found anybody of any shade or colour in favour of these schemes.  It is really a pity that Fianna Fáil Deputies would not have an opportunity of expressing themselves as freely and frankly as I am doing.  I have never met one of them yet who would honestly endorse the system of rotational schemes.</P>

      <P>I am glad to meet one Deputy who is.  There are plenty who <Col N="639" /> would not, but they keep their mouths shut about it.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has given any justification in his long address to-night for the continuance of these schemes.  If they want to cover a greater number, my suggestion is that they ought to give this work only to the most deserving persons in the area for which the money will be made available.  If that is not considered satisfactory, and if a rotational scheme must be there, it ought to be on the basis of a period of two or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary has no right to attempt to employ our people on these schemes at a lesser rate than the local authorities have determined as a fair rate for the county.  He has been making attempts since he became Parliamentary Secretary to reduce the standard of wages.  Where the county council have decided to pay 35/- or 30/-, the Parliamentary Secretary favours 24/-.  His efforts have been such that he has reduced men now to a total earning capacity of 14/- a week.  Let us consider that a man is entitled to receive 12/6 a week to maintain himself and his wife and family when he is idle, and, on the other hand, we have the position that under the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="640" /> schemes this man is put working and all he receives is an additional 1/6 to what he would get if he were idle. That is the only advantage the workers have under this blessing, this boon and this great privilege the Parliamentary Secretary talks of.  I am charging him that this is a definite attempt to lower the standard of remuneration of Irish workers.  It is a headline to public authorities and private employers.  I maintain that the Parliamentary Secretary has put forward no grounds to justify that attitude.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to mention.  Minor relief schemes are determined upon at a certain period in the year and, for some Departmental reasons, everything connected with them is kept secret; it is not considered wise to divulge when and where those schemes are likely to operate.  In due course they are submitted to the county surveyors in the various counties.  Deputies have been invited by the Parliamentary Secretary to submit schemes for consideration, but they are not told when or where these schemes are likely to operate.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 9th April.</P>
