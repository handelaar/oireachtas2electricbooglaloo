    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that, apart from the attempt to get back young men below the age of 21, the Minister is not in fact doing any work for Saorstát nationals in Spain?  Is it a fact that he has no normal mode of intercourse with either Government in Spain, and no communication whatever except through the medium of British Consulate officials?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply that he was satisfied our Minister was doing useful work for Irish nationals in Spain, is it the case that the representations made by our Minister to the Burgos administration, on behalf of minors who had gone to Spain without the consent of their parents, were courteously acceded to, whereas similar representations made to Valencia, which the Minister is in <Col N="1484" /> fact accredited to, were met with the curt invitation to go to blazes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>

      <P>The rate of wages fixed for forestry workers in each county is related to the average rate of wages paid to agricultural workers in the same county, and the reduction to which the Deputy refers and which took place prior to 1929 was made on this basis.  As regards wages lost by workers absenting themselves from work, the existing regulations provide for a six-day week with a privilege half-day with pay on Saturdays, provided that the worker is not absent from duty during the preceding five days.  As already intimated in the Dáil, it is proposed to review the rates of wages paid to forestry workers generally when rates of wages have been fixed under the Agricultural Wages Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters that I want to mention on this Resolution. This is the first Resolution imposing taxation in this financial year.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to a practice that has grown up and that has merited observations by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the Appropriation Accounts for 1935-36, which were ordered by Dáil Eireann to be printed on the 3rd February of this year.  In that year taxation was imposed to meet a gross estimated expenditure of £30,577,013. At the end of the year it was discovered that the Departments, together, surrendered to the Exchequer £2,288,572 1s. 2d.  The only justification that the Minister has for imposing any taxation is that the Estimates require that certain taxation shall be struck.  The justification for taxation is brought before this House in the form of highly desirable expenditure, and inflated sums are provided, for instance, for the building of schools. We are asked, if you want to reduce taxation, &ldquo;show the head under which you propose to reduce it?&rdquo;  We must increase the taxes in order to meet the Estimates, but when you see the financial year worked out, you are told quite blandly in the Appropriation Accounts that it was impossible to spend the money for which the Estimates were made, so that money for relief works and for social services is returned to the Treasury.</P>

      <P>The House is dealing with the Report Stage of the Financial Resolutions.  A discussion on any one of these Resolutions must be relevant to and confined to the matter thereof.  I do not agree with the suggestion made by the Minister that the matter referred to by the Deputy could be raised on Resolution No. 11. There is no precedent for debating the General Resolution on the Report Stage.  The Second Stage of the Finance Bill will afford ample opportunity for the raising of general questions.</P>

      <P>The Dáil is now reviewing what the Dáil, sitting in Committee, did, and surely the Deputy is entitled to refer, in effect, to any part of the Budget, and is entitled to quote the Appropriation Accounts for the preceding year in support of his point.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ radically with the Deputy.  The Financial Resolutions are now being reported. The first Resolution deals with income-tax and surtax, and the debate must be confined to those two taxes.  Similarly with the other Resolutions.</P>

    <Col N="1491" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, Sir, that I will have any difficulty in bringing my observations well within the scope of your ruling.  The Chair will agree with me that if the Minister desires to have the income-tax and surtax Resolution reported to the House, he must satisfy the House that the revenue to be raised by this Resolution is necessary. If I can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the House that the estimated revenue is grossly in excess of what the Minister, in fact, proposes to spend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter might have been debated on Resolution No. 11 in Committee.  The Deputy surely sees that his line of argument would be equally relevant on any one of the ten Resolutions, and lead to a general debate on each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to tax the patience of the Chair by repeated points of order.  The Second Stage of the Finance Bill will afford an opportunity for discussing the matter more fully.  I do want to raise this net point, however, that the income-tax Resolution is a result of the Horse-Hen Pact into which we recently entered with Great Britain.  We took the tax off horses and put it on hens.  Now, that was a very left-handed kind of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it contended that we charge horses with income-tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to income-tax on horses.  One justification can be advanced for the Horse-Hen Pact, and that is that in order to save a very great industry, considerable sacrifices ought to be made by all sections of the community.  Even if the poor hen had to shoulder the horse's burden&mdash;perhaps the Minister will take further steps to confer so general a benefit on the community&mdash;the hen could be reasonably asked to square her shoulders and face the music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of burdening the hen has been to open the market for horses and that should stimulate horse breeding in this country.  But one of the most important branches of horse breeding is the maintenance of <Col N="1492" /> stallions of proved worth in this country.  This peculiar situation has arisen.  In Great Britain, a judgment of the House of Lords in a revenue case has decided that a person having a stallion and receiving very large fees in respect of its services can elect to have his stud farm assessed for the purpose of income-tax on a valuation basis.  Where the revenues from the stud fees are very considerable, as they sometimes are where a very valuable sire is concerned, this concession is of immense value to the stallion owner.  In this country, the law, as at present interpreted by the courts, entitles the Revenue Commissioners to claim that income-tax will be paid upon receipts in respect of stallion fees and not on the valuation of the farm where the stallion is kept. Unless a concession similar to that at present enjoyed by owners in Great Britain is made available here, we are not going to get the full value of the Horse-Hen Agreement, because the men who own immensely valuable stallions and who would be ordinarily attracted to bring them back to this country as the result of the removal of the tariff will be deterred from doing so if, by domiciling themselves here, they make themselves liable to income-tax on their full receipts in respect of service fees.</P>
    <P>At first glance it might appear that there was an unanswerable argument against giving the relief I suggest to a body of men who are ordinarily pretty well off.  They are big property owners and they own these immensely valuable animals, and one would say that there are many more deserving persons to be relieved, if there is to be a reduction in taxation, than these individuals.  But, when you come to examine the question more closely, you find that if you do not provide this relief for that type of person, that type of person will not carry on that business here at all, and the result of that will be that you will destroy in this country that branch of horse breeding which gives more valuable employment than any other department of horse breeding. Further, you may induce owners here who possess these valuable <Col N="1493" /> stallions to remove them to Great Britain, with the result that when a horse wins a classic race, instead of having a commentary in all the sporting papers of the world that such and such a great race was won by an Irish-bred horse, reference will be made to the sire as being a horse which is at present in England.  The advertising value which is lost as a result of that is of very material consequence to the horse-breeding industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The thing I most seriously apprehend in this connection is that the Minister for Finance is going to stick his heels in the ground and simply stick out his chin and say: &ldquo;The whole thing is nonsense; I will not move an inch.&rdquo;  I know that the Revenue Commissioners are very much opposed to this concession.  I know that, from the revenue point of view, there is probably comparatively little to be said for it; but, from the business point of view there is everything to be said.  If the Exchequer stands out for the few thousand pounds it can hope to collect under the law as it is at present interpreted, the country will be immensely the loser.  Therefore, I do very strongly urge on the Minister not to stick his heels in the ground with regard to this matter.  The amount of money involved is very small.  I think every interested party will subscribe to the representations I am now making; I think everybody who understands the business will subscribe to it; and I do urge most strongly on the Minister in this case to weigh against the expert advice that he gets from his revenue division the representations of ordinary business men in the country and persons who, from the nature of their calling, must take a broader view of this question than the Revenue Commissioners can be expected to take.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, though the House of Lords or the Court of Appeal in England have, by their decision, made the revenue law what it is to-day in England, there is nothing to prevent the British House of Commons altering the law and bringing it into conformity with the practice here.  But it is noteworthy that the <Col N="1494" /> Financial Resolutions have been introduced into the British House of Commons and there is no suggestion there that any such alteration in the law was going to be made.  If it were intended to alter the law, some steps would have been taken in this Budget, where precautions are being taken against bond washing and a number of other minor artifices which are resorted to for the purpose of defrauding the revenue in Great Britain. Therefore, we are faced with a situation whether we are to make permament this disparity between the revenue practice here and in Great Britain.  It will be an immense disaster for the horse-breeding industry if we do make it and, in my opinion, will throw away 70 per cent. of the value that the country may reasonably expect to derive from removing the tariff burdens from the broad shoulders of the horse and laying them upon the slender shanks of the barnyard fowl.</P>

      <P>The point which Deputy Dillon has made has already been argued at great length not merely here on previous occasions, but in the Second House, when we had such an institution under our Constitution.  All I can say is that there is nothing in the point.  The law here is what it has always been interpreted to be by our courts and, as the courts interpret our law, so is our law&mdash;we have not changed it.  It has been that way for the last 15 or 16 years.  By a decision of the House of Lords what was the obvious intention of the legislation, I believe, has been defeated elsewhere and a contrary interpretation has been placed on the law.  So far as our Supreme Court is concerned, the law has been interpreted as the Revenue Commissioners now administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No sound case can be advanced, either on the ground of equity or expediency, for the concession for which Deputy Dillon is asking.  The net effect, I am aware, would be to take some thousands of pounds out of the Exchequer and to place them in the pockets of a comparatively small number of individuals in this country, and to do that at the expense of the general body of the <Col N="1495" /> community.  I am satisfied that the horse-breeding industry has not suffered any serious disadvantage by reason of the fact that a person who owns a stallion is taxed upon the actual income which that stallion brings him in, instead of upon the mere nominal value of the land upon which the stallion stands, which, in fact, may not belong to the stallion owner at all.  If the horse-breeding industry has suffered during the last three or four years, it has not been by reason of the fact that the owners of stallions are chargeable for income-tax, but owing to the fact that tariffs have been imposed upon the import of horses into Great Britain from Ireland.  These tariffs having been removed, with the removal of these tariffs any disadvantage of real practical effect which the horse-breeding industry was labouring under in this country will have gone also.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 2.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that in the course of the Budget statement I said that I proposed to ask the Dáil to legislate to provide broadly that in future the income of an infant and an unmarried child, which is derived from the parent under any settlement made by the parent, or as a result of a transfer of investments made by the parent, so long as the child is an infant and unmarried, and the parent is alive, be treated, as far as income-tax and surtax is concerned, as the income of the settlor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of the Resolution before the House gives effect to this principle.  Paragraphs 2 and 3 contain provisions as to adjustments in respect to income-tax and surtax to be effected between the settlor and the trustee of the child.  Paragraph <Col N="1496" /> 4 provides for arbitration by the special commissioners, in the event of a dispute between the settlor and the trustees with regard to any adjustment to be made under paragraph 3. The necessity for paragraph 5 arises mainly from the fact that surtax is charged at different rates on each section of the taxpayer's income, and that paragraph provides that the transfer of the income shall be deemed to be the highest part of the income of the settlor.  For instance, if a person had an income of £10,000 and settled £1,000 of that income on a child, that £1,000 would be taxed as if it were part of the £10,000 of the parents' income.  Paragraphs 6 and 7 are consequential.  Paragraph 8 specifies the settlements to which the Resolution relates, and paragraph 9 defines the word &ldquo;child.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at paragraph 3, he will see that if a person obtains.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in respect of any allowance or relief a repayment of income-tax in excess of the amount of repayment to which he would, but for paragraph 1 of this Resolution, have been entitled to, an amount equal to the excess shall be paid by him to the trustee or other person to whom the income is payable....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is only if any question arises as to the amount of any payment, or any apportionment to be made under that paragraph, that the special commissioner is appointed there as arbitrator. It is a cheap and convenient tribunal to settle cases between these two parties, the settlor and the trustee.  It may often, possibly, be in the one family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an instinctive dislike to the appointment by statute of arbitrators without making provision for appeal to a higher judicial tribunal. There is a marked tendency on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to set aside the courts on every available occasion, and to draw into their own hands the right ultimately to determine matters arising out of their procedure, which, I think, is a highly objectionable departure.  The fact is, that when we come to examine a highly complex Resolution of this kind, it is not always easy to elucidate at first the exact significance of these terms.  I understand that this question will arise on the Finance Bill, and that there will be an opportunity to go into it, and that an amendment may be moved if desirable, but, between this and consideration of the Finance Bill, I would be grateful if the Minister <Col N="1498" /> would examine this point which occurs to me.  Under paragraph 9, the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; includes &ldquo;step-child,&rdquo; an adopted child, and an illegitimate child.  Is it desirable to include the illegitimate child, because one could imagine that good settlement ought to be made, that the strongest pressure will be brought to bear to make provision for a child in that position, and that it ought not to be made the subject of the penalties envisaged here. It is not a matter to be determined immediately, but it is worthy of consideration. Our object is to prevent fraudulent settlements for the purpose of avoiding the proper incidence of income-tax on individual property.  It is not to discourage a genuine settlement which, both from the point of view of public policy and domestic concern would be desirable.  The number of cases that would arise is infinitesimal. I do not press the point now, but I mention it as one that deserves reflection.</P>

      <P>At first sight it seems to me that the suggestion of Deputy Dillon would be rather contrary to public policy.  A man who is living with a woman who is not his wife is already given a very great advantage under the income-tax laws over a man legally married and if, in the face of that, you are going to say that a man with six lawful children is to be excluded from the benefit of any settlement like this while a man with six illegitimate children can make such an arrangement, it seems to me you are endowing a mode of life that the State would not wish to endow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise one point, in the hope that it may be considered between this and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  On page 10, reference No. 21, the question of the imposition of the duty on gramophone records and other similar articles designed and constructed for the reproduction of sound by means <Col N="1499" /> of a gramophone or other similar instrument is dealt with.  In an explanatory memorandum which has since been published by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it is stated that the duty in this respect is formally discharged as it previously existed, and is reimposed in this Resolution, but I think that what we are asked to do now is something different from the position which previously existed.  The previous position was that gramophone records designed and constructed for the reproduction of music were subject to duty.  Now, although we are told that there is, in effect, no difference in what is proposed, we find that under this Resolution gramophone records designed and constructed for the reproduction of sound are liable to duty.  Although some members of the House might not believe it, there is a considerable difference between music and sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised on a previous occasion and the Minister for Finance, speaking on behalf of the Government, then indicated that it was not intended to charge with duty gramophone records which were made, for instance, for the purpose of disseminating a knowledge of languages.  Under this Resolution, every record coming into the country and used for the purpose of assisting dissemination of a knowledge of languages will be subject to a duty of 9d. per record, so that those records which are made in Irish to assist the spread of a knowledge of Irish will be made liable to a duty of 9d. each.  It may be that the Minister contemplates that it is possible to produce language records in this country.  I have made inquiries into the matter and I have been informed that, while there is a company here manufacturing records, they produce in records only three languages&mdash;I think, French, German and Spanish; but there is another institution here which engages exclusively in the manufacture and sale of gramophone records extending over, I think, 28 languages. If we are going to charge duty on language records coming in, simply because one firm is making records in three languages here and none of those is yet in Irish, many people who desire <Col N="1500" /> to obtain a knowledge of languages other than the three mentioned will find themselves charged with a duty of 9d. per record, and that might run out at a duty of from 12/- to 15/- for the complete set of records for a single language.</P>
    <P>I think a tax of that kind is really a tax on knowledge, a tax on education, and I think it is a very shortsighted policy for the Minister to impose a tax on records of that kind, if these records are not going to be made here, and I very much doubt whether it is intended to make these records here.  The company which is making certain records here is the H.M.V. Company.  They are purely a gramophone company, whereas the other institution is more a language institution and the records are made for the purpose of spreading a knowledge of languages.  It may be, of course, that what I am saying will not be justified by the course which the Ministry intends to pursue in the matter, but under the Resolution, as drawn, the language record is liable to duty.  That seems to me, at first sight, at all events, to be a mistaken policy on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Further, I should like to call the Minister's attention to this fact.  The <i>Irish Press</i> recently adopted the course of endeavouring to sell sets of Irish records, and I understand that they sold quite a considerable number. The sale terms provided that if one of the records became broken, it was possible for the owner of the set to renew it with the company from whom the records were bought in the first instance but now, if a record becomes broken, it cannot be renewed unless it is imported and the particular duty paid on it.  It is not a record for musical purposes but for language purposes.  It may be that the Minister is not in a position to deal to-day with the matter I have raised, but I should like him to look into it between now and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to reinforce Deputy Norton's remarks.  I just caught them for the last few minutes and I am very strongly of the opinion that the Minister is doing a disservice to the country, and to education in general, by putting this tax on records.  I do not know whether Deputy Norton mentioned it, but I would also include musical records. Classical music can be taught in the most scientific way from very fine records and these cannot always be made in this country.  You can get on these records the greatest artists and the finest performances right into your house to educate our own musicians. I strongly urge the Minister to give full consideration to the arguments of Deputy Norton.  I have something to do with languages myself.  These arguments are, to my mind, so convincing that I cannot conceive of a person like the Minister, who is particularly shrewd, ignoring them.  I think he would do a great service to linguistics in general by taking off this rather absurd tax on knowledge.</P>

      <P>I do not think the situation is quite as bad as Deputy Professor Alton foresees, because it is not proposed to levy this tax on all records.  Some warrior started making records down in Waterford and he will bring in the dies, and I suppose will impart to us &ldquo;The Ring,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Valkyrie&rdquo; and the rest of classical music.  He might even give us the &ldquo;Six Symphonies.&rdquo;  This gentleman, however, apparently does not intend to press the records to which Deputy Norton refers, and in so far as he fails to make these records, they will have to pay the duty, but it is merely that we are engaged in the pious purpose of creating another monopoly.  The Deputy will hear his &ldquo;Six Symphonies&rdquo; and he will hear &ldquo;The Ring,&rdquo; but he may have to pay a little more for the pleasure.  He will do it in the sacred cause of Irish industry and he can study the names of the board of directors to find out how many of them were born in Ballydehob.</P>

      <P>Or Ballaghaderreen. Under the same Resolution, it is proposed to put a duty on elastic stockings, socks and bandages in reference No. 5.  Yesterday the Minister for Agriculture referred to a proposal whereunder he desired to stimulate the manufacture of milk powder, and he said he was first tempted to ask his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to invite the Minister for Finance, to put a prohibitive import duty on it.  Then he thought, no doubt with Deputy Mrs. Concannon in his mind, that if he ventured to make an assault of that kind on the mothers of Ireland, led by that redoubtable champion, the mothers would invade his sanctum and tear him to pieces, so that, instead of putting on a prohibitive duty, he provided a bounty.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is, of his very nature, a &ldquo;chancer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>His panacea for all ills is to slap on tariffs without much regard to the reactions which those tariffs may have on the individual who comes within their scope. Elastic stockings are largely worn by persons who suffer from a very painful condition.  A necessary element in the satisfactory use of these stockings is that they should be skilfully made and that they should fit with surgical accuracy.  It is well known that you can get cheap elastic stockings which frequently do more harm than good.  It is well known that there are firms in this city who, on merit alone, were able to provide elastic stockings long before the Minister was born or heard of, and who will continue to provide that kind of accommodation long after the Minister has been forgotten, no matter whether he puts on a tariff or not. But there will be a very small number <Col N="1503" /> of persons suffering from a very painful condition who will find that, in the peculiar circumstances of their illness, they cannot get the exact type of stocking they require here and must get it from London or New York or some other such centre.  If they are rich people, it does not matter a hoot whether the tariff is 40 per cent. or 140 per cent.  If they want that thing as badly as they will want it if they are suffering from trouble which makes it necessary, they will pay the money.  But take the case of a poor person who, on leaving hospital, has to be fitted out at the expense of charitable funds with elastic stockings, or articles which would come within this sub-head. The average hospital which has to pay for these things out of charitable funds will say that that person must do with what can be got here, that they cannot afford to pay 40 per cent. on an expensive article brought in from New York, London or Vienna.  The net result is that it is the indigent person who is suffering from a painful complaint who has to do with the second best.  The comfortably off person will not do with the second best; he will pay the price.  That does not occur to the Minister's mind.  He will get up here and jeer and sneer at that and say it is a matter of no significance whatever. That does not alter the fact that this is a tariff which is going to confer no substantial benefit on anybody but which is going to cause intense suffering to a very, very few people.  Those, however, will be people who are the least able to endure the kind of annoyance that a levy of that kind is calculated to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head 15, it is proposed to impose a tariff of 50 per cent. on tables, including medical instrument tables and medical dressing tables, chairs, stools, seats, couches, cupboards, food wagons, lockers and draught or bed screens, the framework whereof is made fully or mainly of steel, iron or a combination of steel and iron.  I do not know whether that will cover operating tables or not.  If <Col N="1504" /> it does, it seems to me to be a very undesirable type of resolution.  Hospital equipment should be left free of tariffs in so far as it is humanly possible. Here, again, the question arises of getting the very best for the relief of sickness or distress.  No inducement should be offered to the controllers of any public institution to make the poor do with less than the rich can command for the relief of suffering.  If you levy a heavy tariff on the hospital equipment which would ordinarily be bought for the County Home in Roscommon, the Board of Health in Roscommon will buy what can be got here, without regard to quality, in order to save the money. If I go to a nursing home in Dublin and the equipment is not what I think it ought to be, I will leave the nursing home and go into another, because I can afford to do so.  I see no reason why we should impose disabilities on the occupants of the poorer houses in Roscommon in times of sickness or discomfort that we would not impose upon ourselves.  It is simply self-deception for any member of this House to imagine that if he were really sick and uncomfortable and wanting support or assistance from the appliances referred to in this Schedule, he would not insist on getting the best appliance calculated to relieve his distress. No matter what side of the House we sit on, our determination to get the most effective means of relieving our distress would be limited, in these circumstances, only by our capacity to pay.  This resolution is not going to stop any Deputy from getting the best but it will quite likely seriously interfere with the amenities available to those in hospitals and public institutions all over the country.</P>
    <P>I desire Deputies to bear in mind that, in saying what I have just said, I include in my observations paragraph A5 of reference No. 15, which refers to surgical bed cradles, surgical walking frames, leg rests, back rests, hospital wheeled stretchers and wheeled biers.  I feel it extremely difficult to speak with moderation on this matter.  This reference to surgical bed cradles, walking frames, leg rests and back rests, will catch all the surgical appliances being used in the orthopædic <Col N="1505" /> hospitals at the present time.  Every child with a tubercular spine or a tubercular hip, every child whose very survival depends on proper surgical frames, particular surgical walking frames, bed cradles and leg rests, is going to have the choice of the appropriate fitting gravely influenced by the tariff of 50 per cent. which we propose to put on here.  If, as a result of this resolution, the surgical walking frame of one child in this country should have to be altered, I consider that that alone is quite sufficient to damn this tariff. The idea of any rational man coming to this House and asking to promote Irish industry, if you please, but putting a tax on the surgical walking frames required to save the lives of small children, seems to me to be so extravagantly absurd as to surpass belief.  Does any Deputy seriously mean to say that if a surgeon told him that his child ought to have a particular frame, and that the surgeon was prepared to go to the trouble of ordering that frame from London or abroad, he would say to the surgeon, &ldquo;You can get one 40 per cent. cheaper in Dublin, and, therefore, buy it&rdquo;?  Of course not.  He would not be deterred for a moment by that duty from buying the frame somewhere else.  The only person who may be deterred is the person who has no choice in the purchase&mdash;the child in a public institution. At present, no surgeon in this city who can get a surgical walking frame satisfactorily made here to fit the peculiar circumstances of the case he has in mind is going to get it from London or New York.  He will ordinarily get it here in Dublin from the surgical instrument makers and frame manufacturers who are in Dublin now, and who have been there for the last 100 years.  The only case that this duty can touch is where a surgeon makes up his mind that he cannot get the best surgical instrument here, and when he has made up his mind that he can get such an instrument abroad.  The children of Deputies, perhaps, can get such an instrument abroad, but the poor of the city and country and the people who go to the institutions will have to do with what they can get here in Dublin City. To me, the whole idea is rotten, and is <Col N="1506" /> sufficient to damn the tariff of 50 per cent. which the Minister proposes to impose.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister had in mind in reference No. 24:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Prepared material which is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, designed and suitable for use in the kindling of fires.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That description can be deemed to cover all newspapers, for 90 per cent. of the people of this country light their fires with newspapers.  I do not suppose that we are putting a tariff on paraffin sticks which are manufactured in the Labour Yard, in the South Dublin Union and in the Morning Star Hostel, because I have not heard of any foreign competition with that industry yet.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 25 deals with another kind of tariff which, I think, is inequitable.  We are going to put a tariff on such things as &ldquo;wigs, transformations, toupets, scalps, switches, chignons, plaits, curls, beards, moustaches,&rdquo; and so on,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but excluding any such article which is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to be imported solely for theatrical or fancy dress use.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the purpose of fancy dress I would not have the slightest hesitation in going down and fighting out with the customs officials that I was entitled to get this free of duty.  But take the case of a woman who has to buy a wig.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is why exactly on the same grounds I object to a tariff of this kind.  Take a woman who is wearing a wig.  It is, of course, a source of great mental distress to her to wear that at all.  The necessity of wearing it is a cause of mental distress. The wealthy person will go to London or Paris or wherever the best hairdressers are to be found.  She will go where the most acceptable thing of this kind can be procured.  To such a person the mental distress caused by wearing a wig is small.  But, take a <Col N="1507" /> poor woman who has to earn her living.  And if a poor woman has to earn her living she will have to wear something of this kind for the sake of her appearance, and to make it possible for her to get and keep her job. That woman may, because of this tariff, be forced to buy something that is perhaps not ideally suited to her position.  But she has got to buy it and to wear it because whoever she gets it from will not give her anything else.  I know that in speaking on this matter it is extremely difficult to get the House to give these things proper consideration.  But when you follow those things down into individual cases and when you witness the intense mental misery that is caused you will understand the position better. People may be irrational for feeling that way, but people are sensitive and their embarrassments are dragged out when they come up against a problem of that kind.  I say that to cause mental distress by the imposition of this tax is a very evil and callous act. This is all the more true especially when no valid case can be shown for it.  Nobody would suggest that because of the manufacture of these things here there will be any great outcry for emigrants to come back from America to make wigs here. Nobody can pretend that this thing is going to confer any substantial employment or benefit on anybody except the few interested individuals engaged in this trade.  Those people will be able to knock more out of it than in the past.  Everybody knows that this part of hairdressing business has been carried on in this city for years and will continue to be carried on there whether a tariff is imposed or not. Interested parties come to the Minister, who likes to bear the reputation as being the man who would put a tariff on the import of a yellow god. They put up this proposition to him and he gives them the tariff they ask. I object in particular to this tax, because I think it is most unfair and unjust.</P>

      <P>One does not expect Deputy Dillon to make any elaborate inquiries as a preliminary to speaking on matters here.  But it is not <Col N="1508" /> unreasonable to ask the Deputy to avail of the information that is supplied to him officially and have some regard to that before addressing the House.  If the Deputy had done so he would talk more sensibly in the matter of gramophone records.  I think Deputy Norton and other Deputies are considerably misinformed about the company to which reference has been made as engaged in the manufacture of these gramophone records.  The manufacturers turn out these from imported matrices and they will be able to supply them at the same price from the factory established by this company in Waterford as the price at which they are turned out in their factory in Great Britain.  The company will, of course, supply the language records which they had been hitherto supplying from Great Britain. In so far as any particular set of records may not be manufactured here because of the scarcity of demand for them, then the licences will be issued to admit them free of tax.  Deputy Dillon, of course, made some disparaging references to the company engaged in the manufacture of those goods.  That company is a subsidiary to a British company.  It is probably the largest firm in the world engaged in the manufacture of gramophone records.  It manufactures all the well-known records which are sold under its name at present; it will supply these now from the factory in Waterford, and at the same price as that at which they are now supplied.  The only change made is that some 100 Irish people at present employed there would not be employed if the importation of these articles continued as before.  I can assure Deputy Norton there will be no difficulty about supplying the language records.  If they cannot be produced at Waterford they will be admitted on licence, free of duty.  Deputy Dillon in relation to reference No. 5 said something which, of course, indicates his attitude of mind on all matters associated with the establishment of industries in this country.  He said that those who can afford to pay the duty will still continue to get these goods imported, from abroad.</P>

Those who want the best will buy the Irish-made goods, I am sure.  Deputy Dillon went into a long tirade on the subject of the duty upon steel furniture, and he dealt particularly with the operation of that duty on certain hospital equipment.  It is in relation to that and other remarks that I referred him to the information given him officially.  If he had referred to that information, he would have found that this duty has been in operation for a considerable time.  It is not a new duty.  Under one of the references of another Resolution the existing duty is being repealed, and under this reference it is being re-enacted, but restricted to certain classes of tubular steel furniture which have been manufactured successfully here and which, as a result of our experience, can be made economically here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, therefore, no new impost being effected by this duty and, in so far as it has been in operation for some <Col N="1510" /> time and hospital authorities, doctors and others have had full experience of the effect of it and the ability of the Irish firms adequately to supply their requirements in these goods, it is rather surprising that not a single complaint has been received as to either its suitability or the price, or the ability of the Irish firms to supply the goods. If the Deputy had made inquiries amongst hospital authorities or doctors or persons who can speak with authority on the matter he would have had more information on the subject than he revealed to-day.  Reference No. 24 does not impose a duty on newspapers or sticks.  It imposes a duty on certain kinds of manufactured firelighters which are becoming fairly popular.  It is a small industry as yet in this country and it is located in Wexford, but I understand that it gives not inconsiderable employment.</P>

Any number of records can be produced if the necessary matrix is supplied.  Any record can be manufactured here and this company has associated with it a number of processes which do the actual recording and the production of the matrix.

Could the Minister tell us to-day what revenue the Exchequer derived from that licence fee, because the acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he mentioned this proposal, forecast that it would come to a very substantial sum.

      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 5.</P>
      <P>I may explain that the effect of the changes contemplated by this Resolution is to simplify that large number of duties which have been in operation upon apparel of various kinds, other than boots and shoes.  Heretofore, there have been some 200 separate items of clothing and wearing apparel subject to duty, and the code is becoming very complicated and difficult for traders as well as for the officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  It has been decided, therefore, to attempt to simplify the classifications of the articles subject to duty, and that is the main purpose of this Resolution.  It does, of course, effect certain changes in the rates of duty for the purpose of that simplification, but its main design is to effect that simplification, and I think it will be welcomed by traders and importers generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I do not want to delay unduly the Ministers or to attempt to propound conundrums which they cannot reasonably be expected to answer at a moment's notice, but in connection with the codification of the apparel duties, might I suggest that the Minister should cause to be circulated a white paper, such as is sometimes circulated with the Finance Bill, explaining the reference and the changes which it is proposed to make?  It would be of assistance, <Col N="1515" /> for instance, if a schedule of the tariffs, which it is proposed to repeal, were set out and a reference provided for where the tariffs, which are provided under sub-section (6), are to be found because, in sub-section (6), certain articles are excluded from the categories contained in the Schedule because they are liable to duty under other heads.  I sympathise with the Minister's difficulty in trying to codify any existing system of law, and it may very well mean that this attempt at codification will make confusion worse confounded unless we proceed very cautiously at the enactment stage.</P>
      <P>In a cursory glance, I have already discovered one thing which is certainly going to appear ambiguous to merchants.  Part III says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Part of this Schedule does not apply to any article chargeable under Part II of this Schedule.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Part II of the Schedule describes as liable to duty articles which are</P>
      <P>&ldquo;all garments, whether complete or incomplete, which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners have, before importation, been substantially worn or otherwise used outside Saorstát Eireann by a person other than the importer and the members of his family or household.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that that is meant to be a description of secondhand clothes imported for sale.  Part III, however, which does not apply to any of those clothes, which I understood meant secondhand clothes, sets out that there shall be 5/- per article chargeable on proofed overcoats and other proofed coats; 10/- per overcoat or per suit, as the case may be, on overcoats and suits which are made wholly or mainly of woven tissue and are not proofed, suitable for wear by men or by boys; 4/- per article on coats, jackets and trousers of similar type; and 2/- on waistcoats; and so forth.  Is it proposed to remove the minimum rates of duty on secondhand clothes and to go back to the old system of <i>ad valorem</i> duty on secondhand clothes which broke down, as far as I am aware, on a previous occasion, and which had to be altered to a specific duty per garment?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look further, he will see that Part IV applies also in respect of goods that are chargeable with duty under Part II, and the minimum duty specified there will operate.  With regard to the suggestion that a more elaborate explanation of the effect of the changes brought about by the Resolution should be given in a memorandum circulated to Deputies, I think that that can be done.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £1,395,885 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Puist agus Telegrafa (45 agus 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 agus 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; na hAchtanna Telegrafa, 1863 go 1928, etc.); agus Seirbhísí áirithe eile atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,395,885 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928, etc.); and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The total Post Office expenditure estimated for the year 1937-38 is £2,165,335, being a net increase, including bonus, of £118,697 on the Estimate for last year.  The higher figure is due to increased allowances by way of cost-of-living bonus, to incremental additions and staff changes, civil aviation and meteorological wireless services, etc., amounting in all to about £133,000 but the increases are off-set to the extent of £15,000 by certain items under other sub-heads of the Vote.  The financial position of the Department is ascertained from the commercial accounts which are prepared annually and the latest such accounts available (which are subject to audit) are those for 1935-36.  They show as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Postal services.&mdash;Income, £1,655,664; expenditure, £1,347,771; surplus, £307,893.</P>
      <P>Telegraph services.  &mdash; Income, £180,136; expenditure, £275,919; deficit, £95,783.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> Telephone services.&mdash; Income, £491,682; expenditure, £385,980; surplus, £105,702.  It will be seen that on the postal and telephone services there was a surplus of £413,595 against a deficit of £95,783 in the telegraph services leaving a profit of £317,612 on the combined services as compared with £206,860 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The gradual replacement of horsed vehicles by motor transport for mail services by road continued during the year.  There are now 160 motor and 37 horsed services.  Of the motor services 37 are staffed and equipped by the Department.  The ports of Cobh, Galway and Dublin are utilised to the greatest practicable extent for the exchange of mails between the Saorstát and America.  Some 17,200 bags were despatched through these ports, and 29,000 bags were received during the past year.  The frequency of utilisation and the volume of mails despatched depend naturally on the incidence of the sailings.  Correspondence forwarded for conveyance by the international air services approximated in numbers to that despatched last year, that is, 82,000 packets.  Of this traffic 42½ per cent. was carried by the London-India-Australia service, and over 33 per cent. by the London-Capetown service.</P>
    <P>Consideration is being given to the question of using the Cross-Channel air service for the exchange of correspondence where such a course would lead to acceleration.  The ordinary mail matter handled by the Department continues its upward trend and the number of items dealt with in the year show an increase of 20,000,000.</P>
    <P>Inland sample post within An Saorstát which was introduced on 12th November, 1934, is being availed of to a still greater extent by Dublin manufacturers, etc.  According to a recent return the number of sample packets posted in Dublin is approximately 3,500 a week&mdash;an increase of 1,000 a week as compared with a year ago.  So far the posting of sample packets in the provinces is light.</P>
    <P>The inland cash-on-delivery service showed a slight decrease in volume <Col N="1520" /> during 1936.  The number of parcels posted was 15,537 on which trade charges amounting to £16,240 were collected. For the previous year the corresponding figures were 16,883 and trade charges amounting to £17,635. Express delivery services are being well patronised particularly the telephonic express service.  Prior to 1st July, 1936, the fees for express delivery in An Saorstát were 6d. a mile or part of a mile from the office of delivery to the address and they were then reduced to 6d. for the first mile and 3d. for every mile or part thereof beyond the first mile.</P>
    <P>The Post Office factory is mainly engaged in repair work and it is not the policy of the management to undertake the manufacture of articles that can be produced by the home manufacturer at a reasonable cost.  This necessarily confines the manufacturing operations of the factory mainly to the production of special articles for the Post Office service and to a lesser extent for other Government Departments. The factory is responsible for the maintenance and repair of Post Office mechanical transport and the fleet consists of 91 vans and trucks and 75 motor cycles and combinations. The van and cycle combination bodies built by Saorstát manufacturers are proving satisfactory in service.</P>
    <P>The engineering branch which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the telephone and telegraph plant was subjected to special strain during the past year on account of the extensive damage done to the lines by successive storms.  The blizzard of the 11th of March this year which caused extensive damage in the Dublin, Naas and Mullingar areas was followed by the most inclement weather but despite this, service was practically normal by the 16th of March.</P>
    <P>Telegraphs are still losing to the telephone and the past year has seen considerable developments in the telephone service both in the way of reductions of charges and extension of facilities.  The reductions of rentals have resulted in an appreciable increase in the number of subscribers, particularly in rural areas.  The total number of subscribers at the end of <Col N="1521" /> 1936 was 22,844 and the total number of telephone instruments connected to the public exchange service was 37,712. These figures show increases of 1,214 subscribers and 1,892 telephone stations over the previous year. There are now 779 exchanges, 1,357 public call offices and 99 telephone kiosks.  The reductions in call charges have resulted in a considerable increase of traffic.  Local calls have increased by nearly 1,250,000 and trunk calls by nearly 280,000.  The &ldquo;personal&rdquo; trunk call facility continues to be appreciated and the number of such calls in 1936 was over 44,000 Last year's works programme provided for a large number of new trunk circuits; for the installation of an automatic exchange in Crown Alley, Dublin, to which subscribers are at present being transferred; for extensions and improvements in various exchanges throughout the country; as well as for heavy expenditure on subscribers' circuits particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>This year's programme provides for a new direct cross-Channel cable which it is expected will be in service some time in the autumn.  It also provides for conversion of the Clontarf Exchange to automatic working, and for the closing of the Drumcondra Manual Exchange, and the connection of the subscribers to Crown Alley Automatic Exchange. Provision is also made for the commencement of work on a big scheme for the conversion of the whole of the Dún Laoghaire area to automatic working. A new automatic exchange is also proposed for Cork.  This exchange will be located in the head post office. It will not be ready until well into the next financial year.  Development of the telephone system will involve increasing costs, but with the greater facilities afforded to the public and the reasonable charges operative, it is expected that revenue will continue to rise and that the favourable financial position of the service will be maintained in the future.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made by the Department for the exchange in each direction during the Christmas and New Year season 1935-36 of greetings telegrams at reduced rates between the Saorstát and extra-European countries. <Col N="1522" /> During that season 939 greetings telegrams were forwarded from the Saorstát, while 1,336 were received.  Last season the service was extended to provide for the exchange of greetings telegrams with all foreign countries, 1,467 telegrams being sent from the Saorstát and 2,293 received.</P>
    <P>The Department's building programme comprises: Dublin&mdash;The construction of the new post office in St. Andrew Street; completion of the new central motor garage at Sandwith Street in connection with the proposed central sorting offices scheme; provision of new warehouses at St. John's Road factory consequent on the transfer of portion of the Aldboro' House property to the Dublin Corporation.  Cork&mdash;Completion of structural works in connection with the provision of new sorting and customs office.  Thurles&mdash;Structural alterations and extension to provide increased space and improved facilities. Mallow&mdash;Alterations to provide additional accommodation.  In addition to the normal works of renovation and maintenance, minor structural alterations and improvements, including electric light installations, will be undertaken at a number of provincial offices.</P>
    <P>The progress of the Post Office Savings Bank was well maintained during the year 1936.  The net deposits continue to show a progressive increase, the amount for 1936 being £121,405 more than the figure for 1935, which exceeded the amount of the previous year by £107,779.  The total amount to credit of all depositors at the close of the year 1936 exceeded the corresponding figure for the previous year by more than £1,000,000, the average amount to credit per account being £24 12s. 4d. as compared with £22 19s. 11d. at the close of the year 1935.  The number of accounts remaining open at the end of 1936 represents an increase of approximately 23,000 over the previous year. For the current year to date, the number of accounts opened and the net deposits received indicate that the upward tendency of previous years is being maintained.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are now being made for the completion of the series of <Col N="1523" /> postage stamps of Irish design by the issue of new stamps for the higher values (2/6, 5/-, 10/-).  The design chosen for these stamps is the work of an Irish artist, and the stamps will be printed on Irish-made paper in the Stamping Department of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is expected that the new stamps will be on issue in the course of a couple of months.</P>
    <P>As you have heard in the Budget statement, the Minister for Finance has accepted proposals which I made to him, involving a cost of £43,000 per annum.  Although the telegraph service is, and has been, unremunerative, and, taken by itself, is not likely to become self-supporting, I think a case can be made out for taking it in conjunction with the telephone service, which is attracting most of the quick communication business, and which now shows a substantial profit.  Last year, telephone subscribers obtained the advantage of reduced rates; and in a recent examination of the telegraph charges, I came to the conclusion that the public who have to avail of the telegraph service might be enabled to do so at cheaper rates.  The existing rates for ordinary telegrams are: ? for the first 12 words or less, with 1d. for each additional word beyond 12.  As on and from the 1st June next, I propose to reduce the rates to 1/- for the first nine words or less, with 1d. per word for each additional word beyond nine.  The reduced rates will apply to internal telegrams only; the existing rates will continue in the case of messages for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The loss involved by this concession in a full year will be about £12,800.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;printed paper&rdquo; service is used mainly for the transmission by post of greeting cards, books and other publications, and by the commercial community for invoices, advice notes, advertising circulars, etc.  The present rates of postage are: Not exceeding 1oz., ½d.; not exceeding 2oz., 1d.; and for every additional 2oz. up to 2lb., ½d.  I propose to make a reduction in these rates to ½d. for the first 2oz., with ½d. for each additional 2oz., thus reducing the postage on all packets in excess of 1oz. by ½d.  It is estimated <Col N="1524" /> that this concession will involve a loss to revenue of £8,000 per annum, but it is hoped that the change will stimulate traffic and thereby provide some offset.</P>
    <P>I have had numerous requests from time to time for an increase in the number of days of delivery on rural posts operating on less than six days a week, and I am glad to say I am now in a position to authorise arrangements which will have the effect of increasing the frequency of delivery to six days in a large number of these cases.  The total number of rural posts is approximately 4,970, comprising at present: 3,500 six-day posts, 73 four and five-day posts, 1,200 three-day posts, and a small number (less than 3 per cent.) with a frequency of less than three days a week&mdash;principally services to islands and extremely remote areas.  A more favourable basis for the calculation of revenue against cost has been secured and as a result I anticipate that one-half, or about 600, of the present three-day posts will be increased to six-day frequency.  Some minor improvements on other posts will be effected, and in all the cost of the proposed delivery extensions will be about £22,200 per annum.  These changes will be carried out as soon as possible, when over 95 per cent. of the population will have at least one postal delivery on each weekday.</P>
    <P>I hope the House is satisfied with the progress which the Department is making and I think I am justified in claiming that the services generally are satisfactorily performed.  I can assure the Deputies that the various departmental activities are under constant examination with a view to making further improvements where these are found to be warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the reduction the Minister proposes to make in telegrams is taking the form it is, because I do not think it is satisfactory. I think to charge 1/- for nine words is a most unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter.  If you are going to reduce the telegraph rate to 1/- for nine words, with 1d. per word for each word afterwards, that reduces the cost of a telegram <Col N="1525" /> sent in the Saorstát, but when you come to send a telegram to Great Britain or Northern Ireland the old rate will still prevail.  In fact, it is a constant source of embarrassment to present a telegram in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for delivery in the Saorstát.  They generally demand 6d., but when they see it is addressed to a place in the Saorstát they ask for ?. An elaborate mathematical calculation will have to be made in order to work out what a telegram should cost if there are 11 words.  It has been a well-established practice in the telegraph service for years that there has been a basic charge for 12 words, and a further charge for every word thereafter. I do not believe it would break the Minister's heart if he allowed 12 words for the &ldquo;bob,&rdquo; nor do I think it is going to set the Liffey on fire if he does.  I do not like the nine words for 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that applied only to local telegrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies only to internal telegrams.  He is going to charge ? still for the telegram to London, so they will still be knocking three times the price of the telegram out of us when we wire from London. However, we will get over that, I suppose. Upon my word, I think it is waste of money to reduce the cost of the telegram to nine words for 1/-. You will find that the vast majority of people will not use the nine word telegram, and the difference between ? and ½ or ¼ is not worth financing. You will not get any increase in traffic as a result of it, and it will be a dead loss to you.  You would be much better employed in using the money for the purpose of making some further concession in telephone charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  One is in regard to the conditions under which sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in rural Ireland work.  The telephone service has always tried to maintain a kind of dual existence, partially as a public service and partially as a commercial enterprise.  It has been made an immense success in Great Britain, and is about to become <Col N="1526" /> a huge source of revenue to the Chancellor of the Exchequer there.  I do not know what the conditions are for rural postmasters and postmistresses there, but in this country there is no doubt whatever that the Post Office trades on the fact that to have a sub-post office in his shop is a source of revenue to a shopkeeper. That may be true in the very small offices, but when you get into the medium-sized sub-post offices you have postmistresses who have not got enough time to run a shop along with a sub-post office, and who are working like slaves for an entirely inadequate contract compensation.  I use the words &ldquo;contract compensation&rdquo; designedly, because the system apparently is that you pay her a lump sum for running the post office, and it is open to her to hire assistants or not. Well, a poor woman has to live, and the tendency is to struggle to do all the work herself without getting adequate assistance, the result of which is that the work is not done.</P>
    <P>Now, when you know that an individual is working like a black, you do not care to be sending in complaints that the work is not being done, because you know that no matter how hard he works he would not be able to do any more.  The only real method of relieving the situation would be to employ more help.  The money they are getting for running the post office does not permit of employing more help, unless both the employer and employee are prepared to live on half nothing.  I really think that the Post Office, yielding the profit it at present yields, could afford to be more generous in the treatment it metes out to postmasters and postmistresses in rural areas.  Of course one of the undesirable consequences of that cheese-paring in their remuneration is that you have deplorably frequent peculation, and some perfectly decent person who has been tempted by penury into the falsification of accounts is hauled before the courts and either sentenced to jail or allowed out under the Probation of Offenders Act, with all the disastrous surrounding circumstances.  I am not suggesting that the Post Office authorities are draconian, and throw everybody <Col N="1527" /> into jail.  As a matter of fact, in my experience the Post Office acts with extreme reasonableness in that regard.  I have found that the Post Office, in so far as its discretion allows, is not vindictive.  If they can redeem a man, get him back on his feet and gloss over his peculation, while maintaining the integrity of the public funds, they do not pursue him vindictively, but of course there are cases in which people get themselves into such trouble that the Post Office is obliged to prosecute.  A good many of those cases arise on account of the inadequate remuneration which the Post Office allows, and that is a matter which ought to be attended to.</P>
    <P>The trunk telephone has gone to hell.  It was good for awhile, but for the last six months it has steadily deteriorated and is now wretched.  If you want to get in touch with this city from any place a reasonable distance from Dublin, it takes from half an hour to an hour, and when you do establish contact it is quite impossible, in many cases, to hear what your correspondent is saying.  I have on more than one occasion written to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs directing his attention to delays on specific calls, because I believed it might be of assistance in tracing down the reason why those delays are occurring. You cannot expect people to do that with any degree of regularity. A great deal of inconvenience is being silently suffered because people cannot be bothered writing to the Minister about it.  Now, the question of delay is bad enough, but what is even more provoking is that when you do establish contact you cannot hear the person at the other end.  The telephone, from that point of view, has deteriorated immensely during the last 12 months.  I do not know what the reason for that is.  I have complained to the operatives repeatedly, and they have admitted that they are deluged with complaints with regard to the unsatisfactory condition of the lines.  Now, that is intolerable.</P>
    <P>I remember suggesting here, I think about two years ago, that a comprehensive system should be developed <Col N="1528" /> whereby the telephones would be reorganised on a county basis and that one county should be connected with the next: that there should be a simplification of the existing circuits. I was told, of course, that that would be too expensive.  It was the greatest possible mistake that it was not done two or three years ago.  The cost of doing it now would be substantially greater than it would have been two or three years ago.  It will have to be done sooner or later, and the longer you put it off the greater the cost is going to be.  At the present time the telephone circuits in this country are pandemonium.  You frequently find yourself connected half way around the country in trying to get connected with a comparatively close centre. That arises from the piecemeal development of the telephone in this country.  However, that is a wide problem on which I said on previous occasions all that I want to say.  What I want to emphasise to the Minister now is: (1) that if he is going to reduce the charges for telegrams that he ought to reduce the price for 12 words to 6d. or 1/-; (2) that he ought immediately to provide that sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who are grossly overworked should be relieved by having their wages increased or assistance provided for them; and (3) that he should get the trunk telephone service improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous years I have had to complain about the late delivery of letters in the College Green, Dame Street, and Grafton Street area in Dublin.  The Minister's predecessor undertook to have the matter looked into, and I am sure he did, but nothing has been done. This matter has been a constant source of complaint.  Letters frequently arrive in those areas between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, requesting that a reply by wire be sent on some urgent matter before 12 o'clock the same day.  When the letter does not arrive until 11 o'clock, by the time the wire is got away and returned the tide is missed and business is lost. We have been pressing that matter on the Minister for Posts for a number of years, but nothing has been <Col N="1529" /> done.  I trust that the new Minister will look into it, and see that something is done because it is a matter of importance.  Further, there is a considerable increase in the number of letters delivered in that area.  I would be glad to know if there has been a corresponding increase in staff, because, from inquiries I have made, I learn that the delays that occur are largely due to inadequacy of staff</P>
      <P>In the Pembroke area, where I live myself, heretofore English letters were delivered by the first post.  Then, for a time we got the English letters by the first post on two or three days a week, but for the last six months we have not had an English letter delivered by the first post.  They do not arrive at our homes until between 11 and 12 o'clock, and by that time people have gone to town and do not receive their letters until they return in the evening.  That is a complaint I have to make with regard to the delivery of the English post.  I have made inquiries with regard to it and, again, I am told that the number of letters delivered in the area has increased very considerably owing to the increase in population.  While that is so, I cannot find that there has been an adequate increase in the staff.  Now, if the work in the area has increased, naturally one would expect that increased staff would be provided to deal with it.  It would be unfair to blame the existing staff for not doing the work in the circumstances stated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the delays that occur in making telephone calls.  It is not an uncommon thing to have to wait for an hour or two hours when you have to use the 'phone to a remote place in Ireland. It happens sometimes, too, that when one is down the country and wants to telephone to Dublin, you are told at the local office that it may be a half hour, threequarters of an hour or an hour before you can get through.  A great deal of time is wasted in that way.  These delays are a real hindrance to the service, and something ought to be done to get over that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> With regard to the reductions mentioned by the Minister, he said that they are going to cost the Department something like £40,000 in the year.  They are not, I think, the most useful reductions that could have been given to the public.  For instance, we have to pay and will have to continue to pay, 2d. postage on our letters, while the people at the other side can post their letters for 1½d. In fact, they are hoping to get back to the old 1d. postage rate.  This charge of 2d. on letters has been retained here for an undue period, and I think it is time that it should be reduced to 1½d.  That would benefit every section of the community, and the poor especially, because they avail of the postal service to a greater extent than those who can afford to use the telephone.  I hope that something will be done in the direction I have mentioned.  The reduction of charges in the telegraph service will be of little advantage because we all recognise that it is a dying service. The service in which to give reductions is the telephone service which is a largely expanding service, and one that deserves every encouragement that can be given to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no doubt a comforting thought to know that the Post Office is on a profit-earning basis and that the substantial profit of £307,893 was realised last year. Against that, however, I notice that there is an increase of approximately £119,000 in expenditure as compared with the previous year.  While allowing for the fact that the Post Office does undoubtedly employ a very large staff and that the normal increase in wages and bonuses would amount to a very substantial sum, I am certain that the sum of £119,000 far exceeds the amount represented by the normal increase in wages and bonuses.  That increase is somewhere about 25 per cent. more than the increase for the previous year. I was sorry that the Minister did not go into more detail in regard to the reasons for, to me at all events, the abnormal increase for this particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> The Minister mentioned at the end of his statement that there were about 1,200 areas in the Free State at present where people had only a three-day delivery.  It is proposed to reduce that number, I think he said, by 100. There would still remain, therefore, 1,100 districts having only a three-day delivery.  Surely, the Minister will appreciate that, if there has been a very substantial profit earned by the Post Office in the last year, there is one direction in which portion of that profit could be utilised, and that is in providing the people in the Free State with at least a daily delivery of letters.  There can be no question that business people especially are considerably hampered by the fact that in many areas at present there is only a three-day delivery of letters.  I know that in the constituency I represent in the majority of rural areas, I might say, you have only a three-day delivery of letters.  Surely in this year of grace there should at least be a two-day delivery of letters.</P>

      <P>On a point of correction. I said that</P>
      <P>&ldquo; A more favourable basis for the calculation of revenue against cost has been secured and, as a result, I anticipate that one-half or about 600 of the present three-day posts will be increased to six-day frequency.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There would still remain 600 districts, approximately, with only a three-day delivery and the point I made has still the same force that 600 areas will have only a three-day delivery. There is no question that these people are definitely placed under a handicap.  Traders, shopkeepers, and others who wish to do business are very definitely placed under a handicap. Again, it may be necessary for people to get into communication with a doctor, or nurse, or other professional people, and in so far as there is only a three-day delivery, they are very definitely placed under a handicap as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the development which has taken place in telephone communication in this country but that development has taken place in a most extraordinary way.  So far <Col N="1532" /> as trunk facilities are concerned, in certain counties the trunk lines were carried up to a certain point and then stopped dead at that particular point. There is no communication between the principal town and many important areas in the same country.  That has been the position for the last couple of years.  Then the engineers have proceeded from that county probably to the neighbouring county to provide trunk facilities there.  In County Sligo, for instance, trunk lines have been laid from Enniscrone to Ballisodare, but the engineers stopped dead there and proceeded to County Donegal to lay down trunk lines.  No effort was made to connect up with the principal town in the county, namely, Sligo.  I think my colleague who represents the county drew attention to that in the debate on the Estimate last year.  The same thing has happened in other counties.  If the engineering staff of the Department are laying down trunk lines at least they should connect up these lines with the principal town in the county and ensure that the facilities are such as will enable towns on the outskirts of the county to be in constant communication with the principal town.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed the wonderful developments which have taken place in establishing international communications. In fact, the main part of his statement on the telephone services was devoted to the wonderful developments which have taken place in establishing international communications between this country and Great Britain and continental countries.  Surely the main duty of a Minister is to ensure, first of all, that we have adequate telephone facilities in the Free State itself.  International communications were fairly adequate already and while I admit that they are very necessary I think they should be, to some extent, subordinated to the improvement and development of internal telephonic communication.</P>
    <P>The Minister has undoubtedly reduced the charge for telegrams, but again I submit that if the Minister had taken the advice of many people who have spoken on the Estimate in past <Col N="1533" /> years, and reduced the charges for telegrams in this State, he would be realising a very much better revenue from the service than he did last year. After all, the rate for telegrams in Great Britain was reduced, and, following on that reduction, there was a very substantial increase in revenue. Just as a very substantial increase has taken place in the revenue from telephones, because of the reductions effected last year, so a corresponding increase would be realised if a proportionate reduction had been made in the charge for telegrams.  A charge of 1/- for nine words is still exorbitant. After all, the business community and the professional community will still be almost as hard hit as in the past by the fact that they have still to pay ? in order to send a telegram from this country to Great Britain.  It is a definite hardship on the business community and on the professional community, and I submit that, relatively, the reduction means very little when a man, sending a telegram from one town to another in the Free State, or from one city to another, will have to pay at the rate of 1/- for nine words.  It represents a negligible reduction, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon complained of the bad service provided on the trunk lines between the provincial towns and the capital here.  I agree whole-heartedly with what he said.  I have occasion myself to use the trunk lines very frequently on business, and I find that the service is by no means satisfactory. I am not at all blaming the local people, because I know they are doing their utmost to provide as satisfactory a service as possible.  There are occasions when, sending a trunk call, say, from Sligo to Dublin, you may get the call in ten or 15 minutes, but very frequently you have to wait at least one hour before you get a reply from the Dublin end.  Deputy Dillon also pointed out, which I can verify, that oftentimes the service is entirely unsatisfactory.  It is difficult sometimes to hear the party speaking at the other end.  Sometimes, even after such a telephone conversation, I have to send a lengthy telegram, even at the charge of 1/6 for 12 words, explaining the <Col N="1534" /> nature of the business I had to transact with the party at the other end of the telephone.</P>
    <P>The Minister should certainly do something with the object of improving the trunk facilities between Dublin and the provincial towns.  The service is not at all satisfactory, and is not nearly up to the standard of trunk services in different parts of England. After all, the developments which have taken place, and all the money which has been spent in developing that service, the least we should expect is that we should have a moderately satisfactory service, which we have not at present.  In fact, in many respects, the service is very unsatisfactory.  I hope the Minister will take some steps to see that the country is provided with a more efficient trunk service.  I am not complaining of the local service. My experience of the local service in Sligo is that it is quite satisfactory. The local people are doing their utmost to improve the standard and efficiency of the service; and I am certain that in other parts of the country the same thing can be said of the local service. But the trunk services are not satisfactory, and I hope the Minister will take some steps to see that the trunk service between the head office in Dublin and the provincial towns is improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my appeal to what has been said with regard to the concession given on telegrams. The concession of from 12 words for ? to nine words for 1/- is so small that it is of little or no value. If there was any great value in the concession it would go to those who have not the telephone service available. It is notorious that people in the country districts have very long addresses, so that nine words for 1/- means very little in such cases.  It would be difficult for a countryman sending a telegram to another man to include both addresses in nine words. He would probably have to adopt the old practice in order to get in all he wanted, the net result being that it would cost him ? in lieu of 1/-.  If by chance someone does achieve the impossible, and sends a precise message of nine words, the saving would be something less.  It would be <Col N="1535" /> a reduction of about one-sixth of 1d. a word.  The average countryman finds it difficult when sending a telegram to keep it within 12 words, taking into account the number of words in the average address.  In my own case four words would be necessary for the address, but I can envisage cases where, to be recognisable, it could not be kept within four or five words.  The reduction in the number of words to nine makes the concession very little use.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the question of leaving the number of words the same as at present.  As to the delay in connection with trunk calls, I would like to add my voice to what has been said in that regard.  In some places trunk facilities are not available, but where they are available I found that I had often to wait a considerable time.  As Deputy Roddy stated, once or twice I was lucky enough to get through in a few minutes, but on an average a call takes over half an hour.  Possibly the Minister may find some method of getting over that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I can serve any useful purpose by mentioning the case of an employee of whose circumstances I am aware.  The regulations regarding employees are very strict and, in some cases, unfortunate workers in the postal service, and indeed in other Government services, are harshly dealt with.  The case I am concerned with is that of an unfortunate man in my locality who was a postman for 19 years.  I do not believe he was on the established service.  After 19 years service, whether due to an accident or not to his knee he was laid up for some months.  Eventually he applied to be admitted to his old job as his knee had been cured.  I think the reason he did not succeed was because certain doctors declared that he had a tuberculous knee.  While he was unable to work his knee was in plaster of Paris, but eventually he was cured, and for the past 12 months he is walking around doing nothing.  He is unable to find work and is living on two or three shillings a week.  I do not suggest that the regulations will permit of the reinstatement of such an official, but I say that there should be some <Col N="1536" /> compassionate treatment of such cases.  If it is not possible to find permanent employment for such a man who, to all intents and purposes, is able to do the work he was doing for 19 years, there is no reason why he should not get the benefit of temporary employment.  If he breaks down again there is no further loss and the Post Office can act as harshly as they did previously, by getting rid of him. Where such an employee is sound and able to work, there ought to be some method of employing him.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the case, and perhaps I might send him a note about it.  I thought I should raise this matter in case there are other instances of hardship towards unfortunate employees in the postal service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister started by talking of a reduction in charges I was beginning to feel very happy, but my enthusiasm disappeared as he proceeded.  For a couple of years I have felt somewhat of a Bolshie on this Vote, when urging that the question of a reduction of the charges should be tackled.  I was attacked for doing that, but I felt in doing so that I was a very radically minded person.  It was from the ordinary commercial point of view that I made the suggestion. What have we got?  We have got concessions on telegrams and some postal concessions, but they are concessions on stilts.  How were these concessions arrived at and who arrived at them?  Take the average rural address.  It will take up five words which, with the name of the sender, makes six words and the message is to consist then of three words if it is to go for 1/-.  Who concocted that and where was it concocted? And we are asked to waste time discussing that as a concession.  This thing is utterly futile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come down to the business side of it, there is a telegram form, printed and paid for, designed to hold any telegram of ordinary length. There is nothing lost on the printing or on the paper.  There is an official sending it off, and you are cutting that by three words.  That is not <Col N="1537" /> business at all.  I wonder would the Minister suggest that to any business man.  If the head of a department went to his employer and made a suggestion of that kind to him, what would he say?  The thing is fantastic and futile.  I have appealed to the Minister's predecessors for the past few years to take a reasonably bold step of some kind, but this is not a step at all.  It is merely putting the thing up on stilts.  There you can see it better and one may believe that one is getting something.  We are not getting anything at all and I ask the Minister to reconsider this. I have been appealing for a couple of years and I think he should reconsider it.  If he is going to give any concession in relation to telegrams, let it be 12 words for 1/- or nothing.</P>
    <P>A Considerable amount of telegraphic work is done with England and the Six Counties and, very often, if people in my own constituency who are going to Dublin want to send a message of any kind to Dublin, they will send it from across the Border, from Strabane, which is their main station of departure.  They are coming perhaps from a rural part of the county, and possibly there is no post office on their way to the station, or perhaps they are in a hurry to get there.  They have to pay ? to send that message.  Why not cut it down to 1/- and make the thing uniform? Why all this hotch-potch stuff of up and down?  Why not make the relief uniform?  The telegraph service is a dying service, and Deputy Good says it would be more useful to give concessions on the telephone.  That is so.  I believe it is good business to give the very best service you possibly can.  It is on that basis, and on that basis only, that successful business has been built up anywhere, and on that basis only will it be built up here. In the rural parts of Ireland, there are yet many districts in which there are no telephone connections.  There may be a connection to a village, but the surrounding rural district has no telephone, and if a telegram is sent there, it has to be sent out to that district.  I believe it would be good business to give a cheaper telephone service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> With regard to the trunk system, I think I mentioned this matter on an early Supplementary Vote.  Deputy Dillon has complained about the difficulty of getting a connection, and also of the difficulty of hearing the person one is speaking to.  I had an experience in the West of Ireland&mdash;I do not know whether this covers the area Deputy Dillon spoke of or not&mdash;when I went into the post office in Athenry a couple of months ago.  I wanted to put a call through, and the girl went over to the wall and began to wind up some sort of instrument.  She twisted and twisted at that instrument until I became thoroughly disgusted.  I asked her how long this instrument had been in the post office and she could not tell me. I made further inquiries, and I took down a list of the connections controlled by Athenry post office.  I think it controlled some five, six or seven areas.  How can one expect to get a good connection, so far as hearing the voice of the person to whom one is speaking is concerned, on an instrument of that kind?  I wonder is that centre connected with County Roscommon, to which Deputy Dillon referred?</P>
    <P>The new machines installed are modern, efficient, and in good order, and, in the main, the exchanges in County Donegal are new and efficient enough.  I am often rung up from the county, and I find the connection excellent. With regard to the West of Ireland, however, my experience is as I have related, but perhaps it is the machine in the Athenry post office, which is the exchange for a number of areas, that was responsible for it.  I am glad there is an improved service with regard to rural areas.  It has been said for the past couple of years that I was very radical in the matter of giving service.  I do not want to be too radical, but I am glad there is a beginning made towards improving the service, because serious complaints were arising that, since a native Government took charge of the Post Office service, it was being gradually restricted.  The people were not getting the postal service they had previously been getting, but Rome was not built in a day, and I think the <Col N="1539" /> Department are on the right road.  Let us hope that the improvement will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about a matter which requires serious consideration by all sides of the House.  It is the payment made to sub-postmasters and postmistresses.  There might have been a time, ten, 15 or 20 years ago, when the work of the post office was somewhat circumscribed, but the amount of work in a modern post office is out of all proportion to what it was 20 years ago.  Take the rural parts of Ireland along the western seaboard.  There, there is an enormous number of registered unemployed, and the post office deals with all those.  There is the cashing of these orders.  Add to that the old age pensions, and now, the widows' and orphans' pensions.  Then, in all these rural areas, you have now the telephone extension.  It is not fair or right that these people should be working on the amount they were paid 20 years ago.  I do not want to be definite about the amounts, but I understand that these people are paid annually from about £40 to £50.</P>
    <P>Nobody on any side of the House is going to defend that payment for such work.  I do not know any rural post office in which one person could do all the work and assist in the house or in the shop at the same time.  Take a post office area in which there are 500 registered unemployed persons.  All the orders sent out to these people have to be cashed.  Some of them may be cashed in the local shops, but they eventually reach the post office.  The old age pensioners have to be paid on Fridays.  The pensions for the widows and orphans have also to be dealt with.  When we were passing all this social legislation, nobody reflected that it all referred back to a central unit &mdash;the Post Office.  We never considered from the day we began on this hot race of social services that our work reacted on people who have never been considered by this House or by the Department with which they are connected.  The House should authorise the Minister to review the position of these people.  I would go <Col N="1540" /> so far as to say that some of the people who have post offices are, owing to the amount of assistance they have to employ, running the post offices at a loss or, at least, that they have no more than pays the cost of light and heating after they have paid for assistance.  Simply because they have had the post office in the past, they want to hold on to it but, from a strictly monetary point of view, they would be better off without the post office.  I hold no brief for these people but, when we pass measures that react on them, we should give them some consideration. Consider the amount of time a girl in one of these offices spends in getting a trunk call through, as mentioned by Deputy Good, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Roddy.  An account must be entered up of that trunk call and the money received.  These are things that require immediate consideration in justice to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good has referred to delivery of letters and I confirm what he has said regarding delivery of English letters.  Those who live in the suburbs leave home, as a rule, in the morning, with the result that they do not get their letters until they return in the evening or, perhaps, late at night. Particulars of an anomalous case have been sent to me by a very prominent man in Donegal, to whom I have written for more details.  He occupies a State position in the county and he told me that he had been staying at a little hotel in Ballyliffan in the Inishowen Peninsula.  He assured me that the only postal collection there was in the morning, notwithstanding that, in another village three or four miles south, a vehicle calls for the letters in the evening.  He did not say whether it was a public vehicle or a post office vehicle, but it collects the letters at Clonmany, while the letters in Ballyliffan are not collected until the following morning.  Who would tolerate a collection of letters in the morning, perhaps before people would be out of bed?  This district is being developed and contact has been made with English visitors.  They must have a peculiar idea of our efficiency and a funny idea of our conception of time.  Those letters were <Col N="1541" /> probably written the previous day and were left lying there until morning. This vehicle, I understand, passes through between six and seven o'clock in the evening and collects the letters at Clonmany.  I shall send the Minister more particulars of the complaint when I receive them, but I ask him now to make inquiry as to the position.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be very good business for the Minister to act boldly with regard to the postal rates.  I was told during the debate on this Vote in the last few years that this would involve money and extra costs. A public Department of a quasi-commercial character that has a mental outlook of that kind is not going to get anywhere.  In this age of intensive competition and lightning transport, something better is expected.  A transport service, such as this is, has got to move with the times.  It must move forward or backward.  There is no such thing as remaining stationary.</P>
    <P>Leave the ordinary civil population altogether out of this and look at what is the position of the ordinary commercial population who have to pay a 2d. rate of postage as against a 1½d, rate across the Border and in England. I am glad that the Department has taken one step with regard to the cost of telegrams.  If the Minister now takes a bold step with regard to the postal service itself it will be good business.  Considering the distribution of wealth everywhere, not only in this State but all over the world, and the trend of communications between the people of this country with other countries and with this idea of correspondence becoming more highly developed, it would be a good idea to give the people a cheaper postal rate than a 2d. rate so as to encourage them to develop that correspondence. We have transport of every character around us, over us and across us, and if we stick in the mud there is only one thing can happen us and that is decay.  We must go backward or forward; it is impossible to remain stationary.  I am very glad that the Minister has made a move at all with regard to concessions, but I am sorry <Col N="1542" /> he did not go further in the matter of telegrams.  A bad telegraphic service is not a good commercial foundation.  It is not good business, and as sound results cannot be shown as would be shown if the Post Office had been run on a good commercial basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House when the Minister made his statement.  I understand that he has decided to make some concessions in the telegraphic section of the Post Office.  I understand there are some slight reductions in the postal section. I hope those small concessions have not been given because of finding out that this was the section with which the Post Office regulations are concurring.  I do not think that is the right spirit in which to approach concessions.  If the Minister looks into the question closely I am sure he will find a great many instances in which it would pay commercial firms to send their correspondence out of the country because of the savings they would make in the rates of postage. The fact that that has not been done is more of a tribute to the patriotism of the commercial community than that they considered doing so would not bring them a considerable saving.</P>
      <P>Some mention has been made of the 2d. postage rate here as against the 1½d. rate across the water.  But there are cases where we are charged 1d. for what in Northern Ireland and across the water is given for ½d.  I do not think we should be asked to stand a 100 per cent. increase in business costs as against our competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the telephone service. That is a great and growing service; it has entered into the life of a community in a way that was undreamt of some years ago.  At the same time I would like to appeal to the Minister to spend money in order to make money.  Most of the wires here&mdash; telegraphic and telephonic&mdash;are carried on poles along the roads.  Ireland is not supposed to possess many trees, but I think most of the trees must be growing in proximity to the telephone <Col N="1543" /> or telegraph wires; because every time there is a storm it seems as if the morning after you will find in certain directions that the telegraph and telephone wires are down.</P>
    <P>What the country wants is a reliable telephone service.  When this matter was brought to the notice of the Minister's predecessor, he pleaded that the Government could not stand the capital outlay.  We spend a great deal of money on unemployment grants.  I see Deputy Norton looking at me.  But I often think we might spend more money on reproductive works and less on unemployment grants.  I know that is a very controversial subject, but I put it to the Minister for what it is worth.  I think other Departments besides that of the Minister should give that appeal consideration.  With regard to delays in the telephone service, I notice that some mention has been made about delays in calls to different parts of Ireland.  Last month I arrived in London on a Sunday evening at 9 o'clock.  I made a calculation that the difference between ringing up my home and sending a telegram announcing my arrival was not very much. I thought I would blow the difference and find out what the latest news from home was.  It was 9 o'clock, and having convinced the girl in the office that it was Dun Laoghaire and not Dundalk I wanted, I was told I would have to wait two hours.  I do not blame the Minister for that. If there was blame it was on the other side.  Waiting two hours meant that I might get the call at 11 o'clock, and even that was only an estimate, and I might be delayed after 11.  I presume that if on a particular Sunday night a person at this side of the water wished to call up somebody in England a similar delay would occur. I am not constantly ringing up this country from the other side.  But I do suggest to the Minister that if a delay of two hours can occur, there is a case for more telephone lines; the service would repay the capital cost.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in the Minister's Department to which I would like <Col N="1544" /> to call attention.  That is the Savings Bank.  Very many years ago the Savings Bank provided a useful service. I suppose some time early in the last century it was a valuable service, but with the growth of banks, thrift accounts and various other ways of keeping money, I suggest to the Minister that he ought to have the courage either to modernise the methods of the Savings Bank or to scrap the bank altogether.  I think I am right in saying that the practice still prevails of somebody wanting over £2 requiring to give so many days' notice, and they can shorten that time by sending a telegram to the Postmaster-General, but it will be duly debited to their account. I think that is like feeding a dog with a bit of its own tail.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister think that anybody is going to keep an account in the Post Office in place of being able to walk into a bank and get out the money on demand?  After all, the Minister ought not to be appalled at the idea of somebody requiring a couple of pounds. He ought not to require notice, as the head of the State Department, that a person proposes to withdraw a couple of pounds.  I heard of an instance, it was last year as a matter of fact, when some unfortunate had had his pocket picked in Dublin and all the money that he had in his possession was taken.  He was just left with his Post Office bank book, and there were very extraordinary Post Office officials who took their courage in their hands and allowed the man to draw money out immediately.  I do not like to give the name of any of the officials because it might not meet with approval.  At the same time, I think if that was done in a commercial concern that employee would be considered worthy of praise.</P>
    <P>I merely wish to point out to the Minister that he ought to take a bird's-eye view as to what he is in competition with, and he should give the same services as his competitors, or go out of business.  I see here that the Post Office Savings Bank is going to cost £16,000.  I am afraid that is partly an obsolescent service which is maintained by the State, and nobody has the courage to bring it up-to-date or to <Col N="1545" /> suggest that in the alternative it should be done away with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in portion of the suggestion made by Deputy Dockrell, namely, that the Post Office Savings Bank ought to be modernised.  In other countries there is a system known as the postal cheque system, which enables a depositor to operate on his account in much the same way as he would in a commercial bank.  It works very conveniently, relatively inexpensively, and I think it is a scheme which could be adopted here with quite considerable success.  I am not too sure, however, that if the scheme were in operation Deputy Dockrell would be as enthusiastic about it as he appears to be this evening. The Minister ought to look at the position in Switzerland and Holland, for example, and ascertain the advantages which are derived by the general community from the adoption of the postal cheque system.  If he can see his way to adopt that scheme for this country, I think he will make the Post Office Saving Bank a much more useful institution than it can possibly be under existing regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this debate reference has been made to the delay in trunk telephone operating, and to anybody who knows the real position it is little wonder that there would be complaints.  Deputy Dillon raised the matter and other Deputies also criticised the delay in trunk working.  To my mind it is a wonder that there has not been a greater measure of public indignation at the method of operating trunk telephones, particularly in this city.  If the Minister has any experience of up-to-date telephone apparatus, if he has any experience of what an up-to-date telephone exchange is like, and if he were to compare his knowledge in that connection with the type of apparatus in use in the central telephone exchange in Dublin, he would find that the apparatus used there for trunk working is unsuitable and out of date.  Indeed, it is incapable of carrying the present load of trunk work.  The staff endeavouring to operate the out-of-date apparatus is hopelessly overburdened with <Col N="1546" /> work and it is on the staff falls the responsibility of dealing with irritable subscribers, subscribers made irritable by reason of the unsatisfactory provision made by the Department.</P>
    <P>The members of the staff who are called upon to operate this out-of-date plant have complained bitterly to the Department about the handicaps and burdens imposed upon them.  They have declared that they are not able, under the existing circumstances, to give a satisfactory service.  They have complained that they are overworked and that the central telephone exchange trunk section is hopelessly understaffed.  I challenge the Minister to say that the position in Dublin is at all comparable to any city of the same size in these islands.  We have an out-of-date plant, understaffed trunk positions and no provision made for proper staffing or relieving an overburdened staff.  That is the kind of internal apparatus which is supposed to give the public a satisfactory service. If there were as much attention paid towards supplying decent telephone apparatus as there is to providing a reduction in telegraph charges, such as is indicated in this Estimate, I think the public would be much better pleased.  At least, they would be given an efficient telephone service which they cannot get out of the present plant.  There is good ground for the complaint made by Deputy Dillon and others.  When making these complaints Deputies are only re-echoing the complaints made by those who are called upon to operate the service.  Whether it is in the telephone section or in the postal section, there is the same kind of niggardliness in the matter of providing an efficient service; that spirit of niggardliness characterises the whole outlook and policy of the Post Office in staff matters.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention particularly to complaints which have been made for a pretty long period in connection with the inadequate staffing of the sorting office and postmen's office in Pearse Street.  Deputy Good was quite right in saying there has been a considerable increase in the volume of traffic and no compensating increase <Col N="1547" /> in staff.  The staff in the central sorting office and the postmen's office have complained that they are unable to deal with the heavy burden of work on the late evening and midnight periods of duty.  It has been shown to the Department that there has been a recurring breakdown in the postal arrangements of the city.  Evidence has been produced to the Department to show that both offices are utterly understaffed and that the postal arrangements in the city are no credit to the Post Office administration.  The staff have complained repeatedly, and particularly in the past two years, against that condition of affairs, but the Post Office, apparently, takes very little notice of these complaints.  The Post Office cannot be induced to do anything to provide adequate staff to deal with traffic, and I have begun to think that the Post Office, instead of welcoming additional traffic, have now developed the mentality that additional traffic is a nuisance, and that it is not they who are responsible for the conditions, but that it is the public, who post this additional traffic, who are responsible for all this annoyance.</P>
    <P>Just to give the House a picture of what the sorting office in Dublin is like in the eyes of people who have to work in it, I need only quote from a journal published by the Post Office Workers' Union&mdash;<i>The Postal Worker</i>&mdash; in which the condition in the sorting office on the 16th March, St. Patrick's Eve, is described.  The note in the journal says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again we have to draw attention to the necessity of making ample provision to deal with correspondence passing through the sorting office. During the recent &lsquo;shamrock&rsquo; pressure period ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the period when shamrock is being sent to exiles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the staff were subjected to severe strain, working conditions being anything but satisfactory. Particular notice must be taken of the morning of St. Patrick's Eve, when absolutely chaotic conditions were in evidence.  The need for extra staff on the up-night T.P.O.s ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> These are mail trains travelling up from the provinces into the city.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... was shown by the amount of &lsquo;shamrock&rsquo; packets forwarded to the sorting office, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are packets which could not be dealt with in the travelling post office.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... and in the latter office by the number of items left behind after the cross-Channel mails were despatched.</P>
    <P>Not only were the midnight staff retained on overtime, but an abundance of service messengers were despatched asking the late evening staff to attend at an earlier hour to try and reduce the chaos prevailing. It was evident on the previous evening that such a breakdown in the service was about to occur. The usual last-minute provision in the shape of looking for volunteers from the late evening staff, or requesting men to remain on extra duty from 11 p.m. to 12 midnight, being resorted to.  Such want of provision shows a continued lack of efficient organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description of the conditions in the Dublin sorting office on the 16th March, as seen by people who were in the office that day, and who know the traffic conditions there.  This condition of affairs has been brought to the notice of the Minister's Department on numerous occasions.  It is not being raised, by any means, for the first time. There have been constant complaints in the staff journal for quite a long time, and even organs of the Press have indulged in severe strictures on the Post Office Department for its failure to provide adequate staff.  If there were a scarcity of men, one could understand it, but there is no scarcity of men.  There is no scarcity of unemployed men, or of people looking for employment.  There is an abundance of them, and surely the Post Office ought to make some attempt to meet this increased volume of traffic by providing a staff adequate to deal with the requirements of the Post Office.  It surprises me that there have not been more public complaints about the conditions here in the city, and there certainly would be more complaints if the public really realised the unsatisfactory position which obtains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> If the Minister challenges the accuracy of the statement I am making here this evening, I invite him to set up a public inquiry to go into the whole matter, and I can assure him that all the evidence to substantiate these complaints will be forthcoming.  The most satisfactory thing to do, however, would be to remedy this condition of affairs at once and not allow what is already unsatisfactory to generate still further dissatisfaction.  On many occasions the attention of the Minister's Department has been called to the fact that there are 35 part-time officers engaged in part-time work in the Post Office in Dublin.  The Post Office has been repeatedly asked to abolish these part-time duties by converting them into full-time duties, and it is amazing that the Post Office still displays reluctance to provide these people with regular full-time duties, in view of the obvious need of their services.</P>
    <P>Now, let us turn to the case of the public counter in the G.P.O. in O'Connell Street&mdash;the chief Post Office in the city and in Saorstát Eireann.  There you have the same complaint&mdash;an inadequate staff for attending to the needs of the public.  There have been complaints there by the public for a very long time past, and, as a result of inadequate staffing, there has been severe pressure on the staff there&mdash;particularly at certain times of the day&mdash; which does not make their lot, by any means, a rosy one.  At certain times of the day the public are compelled to wait in queues in order to be attended to at the public counter.  Naturally, they become irritable, and very often their irritability takes the form of complaining to and about the staff.  The inadequacy of the staff is such that the volume of traffic becomes absolutely unmanageable at times.  Here, again, what is the central point of the Post Office policy in staffing matters at all? In Pearse Street they say the traffic is a nuisance: that it is not the Post Office that is responsible for not providing for the traffic, but that the trouble is with the public who insist on posting letters.  Every business man in the City of Dublin welcomes customers, but evidently the Post Office regard customers at the public counter in <Col N="1550" /> O'Connell Street as a nuisance and as something not to be welcomed, and instead of doing their best to provide a proper staff to attend to these customers, they proceed to carry on with an inadequate staff, irritating the public, and exposing to everybody their own niggardliness in staffing matters.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, since his office is in the same building, that he ought to go down and take an occasional peep into the public office and watch the conditions there.  I can tell him that it will do him good.  I suggest also that, when he finishes there, he ought to go over to the telephone exchange and look at the trunk positions there, and then he ought to go to the sorting office on a week-end or a month-end and get a picture of the condition of affairs which, I can assure him, will not reflect any great credit on his Department.  Additional staff at the public office would help to provide a satisfactory service there.  It would help to stop the irritability which the public inevitably generate by reason of the inadequate staff there. An adequate staff in the sorting office and in the postmen's office would also provide a more satisfactory service than is at present being provided, and an adequate and proper telephone apparatus to cover the trunk offices in the Central Exchange would help to provide the public with a much better telephone service than they are getting to-day.</P>
    <P>In particular, I again refer him to what I consider is the lamentable incompetence of the Post Office in facing up to big staffing or traffic problems.  The Christmas arrangements, particularly in this city, have been anything but satisfactory for many years past, and last year was no exception to a rule which has now been obtaining for many years.  At one particular office in the city the staff were required to work for 17 hours on Christmas Eve.  They finished at 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and were required to come back on duty at 4 a.m.&mdash;a working period of 17 hours&mdash;a gap of six hours&mdash;and then a fresh attendance at 4 a.m. At 7.40 a.m. they received a relief of 40 minutes for the purpose of having a meal.  They were <Col N="1551" /> then required to work until 5, 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening without a second meal.  There was no further relief for dinner provided.  That was on Christmas Day.  So that, while the Minister was at home enjoying his Christmas dinner and probably eating it luxuriously and throughly enjoying it, and while the officials responsible for these chaotic arrangements were probably doing the same, the staff in this particular office, having worked 17 hours on Christmas Eve, and from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Christmas Day, were denied any relief for the purpose of having their dinner.  I consider that that is a disgraceful condition of affairs, and it would amaze me if the Minister would stand over it, but that is what happened.  There is incontrovertible evidence that it happened. The attendance book, signed by the staff in this particular office, will show that it happened, and there can be no possible excuse for it.  I think it is a most outrageous and inhuman performance on the part of those responsible for denying to the staff a proper interval for their dinner on Christmas Day.  Does the Minister stand for that kind of chaotic staff organisation, which is just typical of the mess which is made of the entire staffing matters in this city?</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister now&mdash;probably I shall do it in more detail later on&mdash;a case of what I regard as a particularly mean attitude on the part of the Post Office Department. A case came to my notice recently where a person, an auxiliary postman, was due for retirement. Auxiliary postmen, when they retire, are not at present entitled to any pension or gratuity, but the Minister has at his disposal a fund known as the Special Fund from which he is entitled to give compassionate grants. This fund, while established long before the coming into operation of the National Health Insurance Acts or the Old Age Pensions Act, to assist persons not entitled to a pension or gratuity, has now been hinged around by regulations which provide that any person who retires either through age, ill-health or general infirmity cannot get any grant from the fund if he is in receipt of an old age pension, <Col N="1552" /> national health insurance benefit, unemployment assistance benefit or unemployment insurance benefit.  So that, in fact, although the fund was established to relieve distress amongst part-time people of that kind who are not entitled to a pension or gratuity, the fund is now administered in such a way that it is impossible for them to get any grant whatever from the fund.  The fund itself was created in the days of the British Administration and it was taken over by the Free State Administration.  The British people have amended their regulations so that the receipt of benefit from national health or unemployment insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions or the old age pensions does not disqualify persons from receiving assistance from the fund in England but it does disqualify them from receiving assistance from the fund as administered here.</P>
    <P>A case came to my notice recently where a part-time postman who had served for 51 years, over half a century, retired.  He got no pension or gratuity and he applied for a compassionate grant from the Special Fund.  Although he had served the Post Office for 51 years he was told that, as he was now in receipt of an old age pension, the Post Office did not think that he was in need and they did not give him a farthing's compensation for his 51 years' service.  I should like to put that case to the Minister and to ask him if that were a personal employee of his, or of any other employer in the country, would he not find it very hard to cast that person off without a farthing compensation, without even a letter of thanks? Yet to the representations that were made to try to secure some grant for that person, the reply received in the name of the Minister was that no grant could be made, the reason given being that the person was in receipt of an old age pension.  I think that is a particularly mean and miserly attitude on the part of the Minister's Department or, if that Department is not responsible entirely, then it is a particularly mean attitude on the part of the Department of Finance and the Minister's Department.  At all events that is obviously a case which should <Col N="1553" /> be remedied and remedied without delay.  It is nothing short of a shame that the Post Office should employ a person on a part-time basis, pay him a low wage for 51 years, and then, when he goes out, give him not a farthing compensation in respect of the 51 years' service which he has rendered.  I doubt if you could find even amongst the most grasping and greedy type of private employer a person who would treat an employee of such long-standing service with such meanness.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement on the Estimates has been announcing concessions to telegraph users and certain concessions in respect to postal charges.  Last year, of course, we had reductions in telephone charges.  The telephone, telegraph and postal users generally, have now been able to rake off some concessions from the Post Office Department.  I put it to the Minister that there is another section entitled to some consideration from him, and that is the section for whose wage standards he is personally responsible as Minister. The Minister employs thousands of people in the Post Office and in respect to 3,000 of them, he pays a wage of less than 30/- per week.  When the Minister was distributing benefits, he should have had some regard to the intolerably low wage standards of those who are his employees.  In February last a claim was submitted on behalf of the Post Office staff for an increase in wages and the Minister's Department was asked to receive a deputation.  I should like to know from the Minister what he proposes to do in the matter of receiving that deputation.  I should also like to hear from him that some of the surplus in the Post Office is going to be utilised for the purpose of improving the very low wage standards of those who made it possible for him to have that surplus.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the hardship endured by the people of the Aran Islands owing to the breaking of the cable between the islands and the mainland.  This happened some <Col N="1554" /> time ago and so far no steps have been taken to repair it.  At the time of the influenza epidemic recently this hardship was greatly accentuated, and on two or three occasions a lifeboat had to be sent out for medical supplies and medical aid.  Another way in which the hardship manifested itself was that in one particular case, a person from the islands died in the Central Hospital at Galway and the relatives could not be communicated with.  The first intimation they had of the death was when the coffin was brought ashore from the Dun Aengus. I should like to impress upon the Minister the necessity of getting this cable repaired with the least possible delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention for a few moments to a matter which I raised this time last year in regard to local telephones.  I must admit that there has been some improvement. Last year I referred to telephone services operating in certain towns which were closed down at 8 o'clock in the evening and to the fact that in other towns within a radius of a few miles the telephone service was kept open until 10 o'clock.  I think I went further and referred to other towns, still about the same distance away, which had an all-night service.  If we are to reach any measure of progress in this time of speed, and if certain towns are to get equality of opportunity with other towns, this telephone system will have to be standardised, and everybody put on an equal footing.  This may necessitate increased staffs.  This may necessitate coming up to scratch with modern instalments and scrapping old-fashioned instruments.  It may necessitate a tremendous effort, but it is warranted; the situation demands it.  I would ask the Minister's secretariat sitting on his right to take note of one or two of those appeals&mdash;not so much complaints&mdash;to have the modern system adopted in our country towns.  Take, for instance, the town which I come from.  After ten o'clock there is a complete cessation of all telephone services. In Carlow there is an all-night service.  With new industries coming into existence there is the necessity for long-distance telephone calls, and cross-Channel <Col N="1555" /> calls.  The system is perfectly futile.  First of all, in regard to the cheap evening service, you may get a booking before ten o'clock, and you find that the place is closed down after ten o'clock.  I am informed that the congestion and confusion which are going on in regard to the cross-Channel cheap evening service are of a very serious character.  The system is incapable of conveying the traffic.  Deputy Dockrell spoke about his experience on the other side.  I happened to be on the other side quite recently, and I found it worse than that.  On several occasions I tried to telephone from this side, and the conditions are equally bad.  We here in Dublin believe that we know the cause.  We are understaffed. I would ask the secretariat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return you my sincere thanks, Sir, for recalling that to me; it was the Minister I meant.  I would call the Minister's attention to such telephone numbers as Carlow 24 and Dublin 43179, and ask him to note the amount of telephone calls of different classes that those particular numbers get through.  He will find that they are large subscribers.  Complaints have come to me from those two numbers as to the impossibility of getting adequate services.  Why cannot we have in large towns&mdash;if we wish to call them large; towns with a population of over 3,500&mdash;an all night service? Telephones are now extending outside the towns.  If there is a sudden illness or an accident after ten o'clock you cannot call anybody.  I understand that the Guards can be communicated with&mdash;that when the local office is closed at ten o'clock you can get through to the Guards; possibly yes, and possibly no.  I should like if the Minister when replying would give us the objections to this equality of opportunity and fair play. Why is it that if one wishes to ring up Dublin aften ten o'clock one has <Col N="1556" /> to go off down to Carlow?  If one is living in Athy or in Bagenalstown or in Stradbally one would have to go to Maryborough.  I do not know whether Maryborough is open after ten o'clock either.  The whole system, which was capable of accepting traffic ten years ago, is utterly unable to do it now.  That fact might be faced up to with the necessary drive and enterprise which I think exist within the Post Office.  The trunk call system has been referred to here, and I got from Deputy Norton the first explanation I have ever heard about the general breakdown and the irritability of the public and the staff.  If there is one thing which is driving business people&mdash;and those who are not business people&mdash;mad, it is this trunk call system.  You are cutting in and cutting out.  You are told: &ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; and then word will come back that you are on the wrong number; you have to wait again, and ultimately after a quarter of an hour you will get through.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the ordinary trunk call, and not to the long distance calls which Ballaghaderreen may require.  I put it to the Minister in all sincerity that the out-of-date trunk call apparatus operated by the Post Office service requires to be scrapped.  The matter should be attended to at once.  The last matter I wish to refer to is the hopeless and antiquated post office telephone apparatus that is still in existence&mdash;those old systems that Mr. Bell had long before the war.  Over and over again there have been requests for modern apparatus, and the only result is that an engineer will come down and change a few little things here and there.  We all want to get down to the automatic dialling system.  We all want to get down to the modern receivers, to replace those antiquated ones which are impossible to keep clean and most unsatisfactory.  I have nothing further to say, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, except to refer to the matter in regard to which you pulled me up.  It was not my intention or <Col N="1557" /> desire to criticise in any way the officials here who cannot respond for themselves.</P>

      <P>I did not expect that there would be any bouquets thrown at me when I announced those concessions, but I must admit that I was almost overwhelmed by the manner in which those concessions were received by members of the Opposition.  I can only take it that it is part of their campaign of opposition and action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and leave it at that.  The various concessions which have been announced here to-day are concessions which restore to the people conditions which were taken from them in the lifetime of the former Government.  We are not responsible for the conditions which existed up to this, and we are now trying to do the right thing as far as we can.  In reducing the charge for telegrams from ? for 12 words to 1/- for nine words we are at least making a start in the right direction.  I do not think there is one member of the Opposition who gave us credit for that.  It is at least a reduction; no matter how the mathematicians may get at it, it is 3d. off the former charge.  That does not appear to be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin almost suggested that we should go back to the ?, that it would be much more acceptable.  With regard to Deputy Dillion's complaints in respect to trunk calls, I candidly admit that there is some reason for them.  At the same time, I want to say that the average all over delay is only seven minutes. I am certain some Deputies will regard that statement as almost an exaggeration, but that is the computation of the Department of the average over-all delay.  In view of that, I do not think the conditions are as bad as they have been said to be by a number of Deputies.  I am not defending, or attempting to defend, something that may appear to be wrong.  I may say <Col N="1558" /> that the complaints made here to-day are carefully noted, and that when the Official Report of the debate appears the statements made by Deputies will be carefully perused by Departmental officials.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that wherever there is a possibility, however slight, of making concessions, there are taken into account.  Where improvements can be made they are made.  I am as anxious about that as any member of the House.  The Post Office is the people's property.  It is not my property or the property of the Government, and we are all anxious, naturally, that the Post Office service should be what we desire it to be.  It is our desire to do everything that we can, within reason, to give satisfaction to the public.  But we must, of course, always keep our eye on the financial considerations involved.  I suppose, if left to my own desires, I would probably grant most of the concessions demanded by Deputies.  At the same time, it is perhaps a lucky thing for the nation that there is another Department to check my ambitions in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good, for instance, suggested that we should have a reduction in postal charges.  I am prepared to concede that that would be a good thing for business, if we could afford to do it, but when I tell the Deputy that it would cost us £267,000 a year, I wonder if he would agree that, in order to recoup the State for that loss, the Minister for Finance should put another 3d. or 6d. on the income tax.</P>

I may say that I have gone carefully into almost every demand made here this evening, and made investigations with a view to seeing what could be <Col N="1559" /> done in the way of meeting them.  I have indicated some of the obstacles in my way.  Deputy Good spoke of delays in the delivery of letters in the College Green area.  He referred particularly to the delay in the delivery of the cross-Channel mail.  The cross-Channel mail, which arrives here in the evening, is delivered by first post on the following morning.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy was not correctly informed when he said that only 100 of the 1,200 posts were being restored.  Actually 600 are being restored from 3-day to 6-day, and there will be some other minor adjustments as well.  He also spoke about the laying of telephone wires for trunk calls, and said that they stopped at certain places.  He almost suggested that there was something in the nature of sabotage by the officials in the way they are doing their work.  I am perfectly satisfied that the engineering staff of the Post Office is doing its work efficiently and well.  It has not done anything that is irresponsible, and if, in laying wires, it has stopped at certain places, then I am satisfied that it has done so for some very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell suggested that the time had now come for laying the trunk wires underground.  That is a question that has been raised very often.  It would involve a tremendous <Col N="1560" /> cost to put all the trunk wires underground. There is, I understand, a new system coming into use, a &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; apparatus being installed at each end which will provide for the transmission of as many as eight or ten messages on the one line, through some method of frequency.  Some possibilities may lie in that direction, but I cannot say very much more on the point.  Deputy Dockrell also raised the question of the Post Office Savings Bank.  He suggested, and Deputy Norton agreed with him, that we should make it possible for people to secure their money on demand.  I do not think that the people who use the savings bank have any desire to be allowed to do that.  I think the fact that they cannot get it out on demand is looked on by them as a kind of safeguard.</P>
    <P>In the course of my introductory statement I indicated that the net deposits continued to show a progressive increase, the amount for 1936 being £121,405 more than the figure for 1935, which in turn exceeded the amount of the previous year by £107,779.  The total to the credit of depositors, at the close of the year 1936, exceeded the corresponding figure for the previous year by more than £1,000,000.  These figures, I think, indicate the popularity of the methods adopted in connection with the Post Office Savings Bank.  It is also worthy of note that the average amount to the credit of each person using the savings bank was £24 12s. 4d. at the end of 1936, as against £22 19s. 11d. at the end of the previous year&mdash; an increase of £1 12s. 5d.</P>

      <P>I understand it is. Deputy Norton made certain charges with regard to conditions in the sorting office in Pearse Street.  The periods that the Deputy referred to were what would normally be regarded by everbody as rush periods.  Naturally the conditions which exist during rush periods are not normal conditions. I would be quite prepared to admit that during such periods conditions, such as the Deputy described, <Col N="1561" /> might prevail, just as they might in any other business during rush periods.  The Deputy also referred to the conditions that exist in the G.P.O. in O'Connell Street, and suggested that I should have a look in there.  I did have a look in on several occasions and did not find anything abnormal there.  I also had a look in at the Central Telephone Exchange which the Deputy also mentioned.  I was shown the whole system for dealing with trunk calls and I thought that the conditions and the methods in use there were fairly up-to-date.</P>

      <P>Yes, I would not be against it.  As regards Deputy Bartley's question about the repair of the cable to the Aran Islands, I am informed that it is a very difficult matter owing to the very bad weather prevailing, and that every effort is being made to get it repaired at once. As to closing the telephone exchanges, which was mentioned by Deputy Minch, some of them at 8 o'clock and others at 10 o'clock, so far as possible we meet the demands made by the people in the district.  There, again, business methods have to come into operation, and Deputy Minch, I am sure, will admit that that is correct. Where there are only two or three people wanting to use the telephone after a particular time, it would be very bad business on our part to have an operator remaining there the whole night merely to facilitate one, two, or three persons who might want to use the telephone on these occasions. Where we have found any demand for the service we have increased the hours, sometimes from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock, and we have even put on a whole night service where we have found there was a demand for it.</P>

      <P>I have not received it personally, but there may have been a memorial signed.  The Deputy will admit that it is an easy thing to get a memorial signed.  The fact remains that we know the demand there is for the use of the telephone after certain hours and it is on that we act.  As I stated we are always prepared, wherever we believe the necessity arises, to meet that demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  His predecessor in office introduced extended hours to 10 o'clock as an experiment last year in certain towns.  Has the Minister any statistics as to whether the results of that experiment were satisfactory or not?  The reason I ask the question is that there is no use waiting for the demand to arise before you supply the facility, because the demand cannot arise until you supply the facility. You cannot ring up on the telephone if there is no telephone on which to ring up.  You must provide the telephone before anybody can use it. In view of that, the predecessor in office of the Minister provided the facility when there was no demand. During the last 12 months I say you will find that that facility has created the demand.  If you extended the facilities still further, you might still further increase the demand.</P>

      <P>If the 50 memorialists Deputy Minch mentioned were in possession of telephones and stated that they wanted to use these telephones on certain nights, I am certain that that would be sympathetically considered. That would meet the suggestion which Deputy Dillon makes, that we cannot know there is a demand.  We would know there was a genuine demand there if we knew that 50 people with telephones were asking for a service from 8 to 10 o'clock, or from 8 o'clock until the following morning.  Deputy Dillon did not specify the particular towns he had <Col N="1564" /> in mind where this experiment was being carried out.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £40,874 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun na dTuarastal agus na gCostaisí eile a bhaineann le Fóirleatha Neashrangach (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £40,874 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for the Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the year 1937-38 is £61,374, as compared with £57,700 for 1936-37, showing an increase of £3,674 mainly under sub-heads A, B and E.  The extra expenditure is required principally to provide for increased staff, extension of programme hours, and additional power and lighting costs due to the increased power rating of the Athlone high power station.  There is a reduction of £7,030 under sub-head F, but this is due to the fact that last year an abnormal item of £14,000 was included to provide for raising the power of the Athlone station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revenue from wireless receiving licences last year amounted to £52,000 <Col N="1566" /> approximately, showing an increase of about £8,100.  Fees for advertisements and miscellaneous receipts amounted to £27,000, which shows an increase of about £3,500 compared with the previous year.  The total broadcasting revenue amounted to £79,000 approximately.  The direct expenditure on the Broadcasting Service out of all Votes last year amounted to about £69,200, so that revenue exceeded direct Vote expenditure by about £9,800.</P>
    <P>The number of wireless licences issued last year was 104,000 approximately, which represents an increase of 16,800 over the previous year.  It is estimated that the licences will reach the figure of 120,000 in the current financial year.  The employment of special inspectors for the detection of licence defaulters has been continued and a considerable number of defaulters were prosecuted during the year.  It is proposed to institute an intensive campaign against defaulters in the near future.  The revenue from licence fees in the year 1937-38 is estimated at £60,000 and from advertisements, etc., at £32,000, making a total estimated revenue of £92,000.</P>
    <P>The direct Vote expenditure during the year is estimated at £81,541, showing a surplus of £10,459.  It should be borne in mind, however, that no commercial account is prepared for broadcasting as for the Post Office, and in considering total expenditure on the broadcasting service it is necessary, in addition to the direct Vote expenditure, to allow for capital charges in respect of cost of erection of stations, interest, depreciation, etc., and if full allowance is made for these charges broadcasting revenue would fall considerably short of broadcasting expenditure.</P>
    <P>The outstanding broadcasting event last year was the increase in power of the Athlone high-power station from 60 to 100 kilowatts, which has resulted in better reception over a wider area. The power has been brought up to the limit allowed under international regulations, and the station now compares favourably with similar stations in other countries.  Programme hours have been extended during the past <Col N="1567" /> year by 5½ hours per week, and the broadcasting hours on Sundays are now the same as on week-days.  Broadcasts to schools have been extended, and a regular programme is now radiated on Monday to Friday from 2.30 p.m. to 3.0 p.m. With the further co-operation of the educational authorities it is expected that these broadcasts will form part of the curriculum of a large number of schools in the future.</P>
    <P>The number of players in the orchestra was increased last year from 19 to 24, and it is proposed to bring the number up to 28 in the near future. The number of outside broadcasts last year was approximately 300, which shows an increase of nearly 50 per cent. on the previous year.  The co-operation of local committees has been enlisted for regional broadcasts, and a good deal of talent has been discovered in the rural areas.  There have been considerable developments in the broadcasting service during the past year, and the staff both on the programme and on the engineering sides has been increased.  Additional equipment has been installed in the studio, and I think it may be claimed that programmes of better quality, more variety and greater interest are now being radiated.  Further improvements are in contemplation, and every effort will be made during the coming year to provide still more attractive programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it. I was quite distressed when I saw the grief on the Minister's face.  I urge strongly on the Minister that he should recover his sense of humour. None of the criticism has been levelled against him in any spirit of recrimination, and there is no necessity for <Col N="1568" /> introducing a note of recrimination into this discussion at all.  With regard to the quality of emission from Athlone, I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that it is far from satisfactory.  At the present time you can get almost any British or Continental station giving a better quality of transmission than we get from Athlone.  I am not referring to the quality of the programmes.  I am referring to the quality of the radiation itself.  You cannot get Athlone satisfactorily on a set in this country and I do not know why.  I suggest that this may be a contributing reason. I understand that in Great Britain and on the Continent, where large financial resources are available to the stations, they maintain observers at certain points around the stations, who continually check up on the quality of the transmission, and are in constant touch with the engineers in charge, and that in that way improvement can be effected.  I do not think any such service is at the disposal of the engineers at our station.  It may be that it would be impossible to provide full-time employment for such a body of observers; but if that is impossible, I think we ought to do something to provide the engineers in charge of transmission with a regular service of information as to the quality of the transmission at different points in the country at all times.  I would be interested to hear the personal experience of other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I most strongly press upon the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to realise that the kind of criticism levelled at his Department is constructive, and is not designed to wound his tender feelings, or to cast any reflection on the Fianna Fáil Party, or the programmes, or on any of the stock sore spots which Ministers in his position usually have.  I would like to make a few suggestions with regard to the programmes.  I realise the difficulty under which the Director is operating, but I feel that the programmes might be materially improved if, from time to time, we were given gramophone recitals of a set character in the evenings.  It is not possible <Col N="1569" /> for our station to command a great symphony orchestra, but, with modern methods of reproduction, we might have good gramophone concerts for one or one and a half hours once or twice a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>Once a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Even once a week. Everyone must be catered for.  It is not everyone cares for classical music. I think if we had once a week a classical concert from Athlone, a Beethoven concert, a Mozart concert or an operatic evening, people could hear a piece of good music in comfort.  It has to be borne in mind that with modern gramophone resources, it is surprising to the ordinary lay ear how little difference there is between a good gramophone programme of orchestral music and a programme provided by the orchestra itself.  In addition to that, I feel that, bearing in mind the limitations that our resources are subject to, we ought to consider the question of having more relays than we at present have. Ordinarily, our relays must be from Great Britain, because the expense of getting Continental relays by direct wire would be considerable and, of course, the longer the wire over which the relay comes the greater the danger of imperfection arising; but there are occasions when the British Broadcasting Corporation make a special effort and I have no doubt that by making a contribution on such an occasion from the Irish Broadcasting Station we could have the advantage of relaying these special arrangements which the B.B.C. make.  For instance, I understand that Toscanini is going to give four or five concerts in London.  You might not hear Toscanini on this side of the Atlantic once in five years, and I do not think it would be anything out of the way if our station opened negotiations with Great Britain to relay those concerts.  I think when the B.B.C. is relaying an opera during the grand opera season at Covent Garden we might take advantage of it, for the simple reason that if we do not a great number of our people will never hear these things at all, and if we do not get these things in that way <Col N="1570" /> it will be quite impossible for our radio station to get them at all.  If radio is to have any justification for its existence in the world at all, it ought to be to provide the ordinary people with opportunities which would be denied them but for the radio sets they have in their homes.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Belfast one night about a year ago and I heard &ldquo;Bean Dubh a' Ghleanna&rdquo; sung from Belfast as well as it used to be sung 20 years ago in Ballingeary, and I was so much impressed with the quality of the traditional singing which I heard that night from Belfast that I sharpened my pencil and wrote to the Director of Broadcasting, directing his attention to this programme and asking him to find out who the artistes were, and to take an early opportunity of inviting them to perform from our station because, to be perfectly plain, I listen not infrequently to Athlone between 10.30 and 11 o'clock at night and I am told that &ldquo;we are going to have an evening of gramophone ceilidhe music.&rdquo;  Of all the deplorable and gloomy hours of ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay I ever had to listen to, that is the worst.  I do not mind if people want to have a bit of a ceilidhe between 10.30 and 11 o'clock.  I suppose they are just as much entitled to it as others are to be dancing a foxtrot or listening to grand opera, but I think it would be very regrettable if our station were to content itself with providing that half-hour as typical of Irish music.  I have no hesitation in saying that nine evenings out of ten when that class of music is radiated, it is little short of a disgrace, whereas if traditional music of the kind I heard from Belfast were radiated early or late in the evening, it must be listened to by anybody with any appreciation of music with intense interest and with intense satisfaction, whether in this country or elsewhere.  In fact, you would be proud of such an exposition of Irish music and it is not until you hear traditional music sung in that way that you realise what an exquisite thing it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to labour a point of that kind.  The identity of these artistes must be known to the Director and officials&mdash;I do not know who they <Col N="1571" /> were&mdash;but I gave them the necessary information to enable them to find out who these people were.  I do urge that if we are to have what is to be described as Irish music on the Athlone radio, we should not content ourselves with radiating less than the very best.  Let the poor stuff be radiated by other stations which cannot claim to be the fountain head, but, from Athlone, if we desire to put out Irish music, let it not be wheezing ceilidhe band records but rather the most distinguished exponents of traditional music that can be found. Quite apart from the desirability of radiating it in the best possible way, we should bear in mind that many of these artistes who have kept alive traditional music do not reap a very golden harvest for their trouble, and, therefore, any opportunity that presents itself to the Athlone station of offering them encouragement and compensating them for their zeal should not be passed by.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to mention is this: I have no complaint to make against using the radio station for educational purposes, but you can overdo this business of radio programmes for national schools.  Remember that in Great Britain you have about 15 stations going all the time, and if you want to use one group of stations for the schools, there is always another station operating for the public.  We are spending £3,500,000 on primary education alone in this country, which is a pretty fair contribution, and if there is more money wanted for it, I am sure the Dáil will be prepared to provide it; but the money provided for broadcasting is provided for broadcasting, and not for primary education.  If the State comes to the conclusion that the primary education in the country cannot be satisfactorily carried on without substantial assistance through the medium of broadcasting, let provision be made but it is not reasonable to take away from the licence-purchasing public hours of the day of entertainment which they are paying for, and which they are entitled to expect, in order to use the station for the purpose of conducting educational programmes <Col N="1572" /> designed exclusively for children's schools.  I think there is a danger that the broadcasting authorities might be carried away by too much enthusiasm for a new plan.</P>
    <P>Let there be moderation in this scheme and if we find that we cannot provide sufficient hours for the schools without seriously interfering with the general programmes, let us radiate the school programmes from the local stations, such as Cork and Dublin, while Athlone is radiating a general programme, or resort to some expedient of that kind which will ensure that those who pay their 10/- will have available entertainment on the radio during the hours set aside for broadcasting. It would be ungracious, I think, on the part of any Deputy who spoke on this Vote not to say that there has been undoubtedly an improvement in the administration of wireless broadcasting over the last couple of years.  It is by no means perfect yet, but at least there is some evidence of enterprise and some evidence of an anxiety on the part of the Minister's wireless department to seek out suggestions and to entertain sympathetically any representations that are made.</P>
    <P>That is all to the good, and I think it would be only right for us to recognise that, while the Director himself may do a great deal, he must depend to a certain extent on the assistance of those who are in a position to bring to his attention the opinions and requirements of the listeners.  In that connection, I say my last word. If any of us were in business, and hired a half-hour of broadcasting time, our ingenuity would be taxed to devise a way of inducing those who heard the programme to write in to us and tell us what they thought of it, how it affected them, and so forth, because we would want to know what sort of value we were getting for our money.  It has often occurred to me that the Broadcasting Station itself would get closer to its listeners if the Director came to the microphone at infrequent intervals, addressed his audience, told them of some of his difficulties, invited their co-operation, and assured them that, if they wrote to him, their letters would be appreciated. <Col N="1573" /> It is amazing the difference getting into contact with your listeners makes.  Such a distinguished man as President Roosevelt has discovered that, and those who have been to America during his campaign realised that, gifted as he is with a radio personality, his power to reach people by coming to the microphone is phenomenal and the result devastating.  I have no doubt we could find in the Minister's Department somebody possessed of a similar personality.  The Director himself might have it.  If he could see his way to consult his listeners, as President Roosevelt consulted the listeners of America, he might evoke a surprising result, and he could not fail to get a great deal of information which would be very valuable. That would, undoubtedly, create amongst the body of subscribers a much more understanding frame of mind than is at present possible.</P>

      <P>Quite recently a very interesting series of lectures was given over the radio, entitled, &ldquo;If I Were Director of Broadcasting.&rdquo;  Many people said very interesting things, but it was rather unfortunate that we did not hear Deputy Dillon over the air.  That would demonstrate, perhaps, two things.  It would possibly demonstrate the difficulties of the Radio Director, and also, possibly, give an indication why the epoch-making decision was taken not to broadcast the proceedings of the Dáil. That might be worth while, and I seriously suggest to the Director of Broadcasting that he should ask Deputy Dillon to go to the microphone and take his part in that series of interesting lectures entitled &ldquo; If I were Director of Broadcasting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not find any difficulty in effectively getting Radio Athlone.  I find it easy to get very good reception.  I regret that I do not know very much about classical music, but I am satisfied that the programmes are as good as can be got in the circumstances under which the station is conducted and the amount of money available for producing programmes.  What I mainly rose to ask was: What is the policy of the Minister and of the Post Office <Col N="1574" /> regarding the sponsored programme? Quite recently I noticed a very marked change in it.  I do not tune in to the sponsored programme very often, but the other night&mdash;quite accidentally&mdash;I found myself listening to what I thought was an English programme. Even the voices were decidedly and distinctly English.  I want to know what became of those people whose voices were Irish and who were conducting and announcing the sponsored programme for some months.  Has it been necessary to go across to England to find people to run the sponsored programme?  Has the Minister any responsibility for this programme?  Is the Minister responsible for having persons with decidedly English accents running the sponsored programme when there are plenty of people in this country who would be in a position to act as announcers and conduct that programme?  Has the Minister only control over the programme, or has he control over the people who conduct the programme and announce the items?  I ask him to look into the matter and to give us some information about it when replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into this question of Oxford accents.  Perhaps they are improving their pronunciation. We have heard Deputy Dillon suggest that it would be a good thing if we had in this country celebrity concerts on the lines of those conducted by Sir Henry Wood, that the people would receive a great musical treat if something similar could be put across the ether from Athlone.  I understand that Athlone has increased its transmission in a technical way so that it can give service <Col N="1575" /> even to the smaller sets, so that if there were relays from London everybody here could hear them.  At the moment, everybody with an ordinary set can listen in to Sir Henry Wood and to the operas in Covent Garden, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham and others.  As a matter of fact, if you want to get on to an ordinary English programme when Covent Garden is going full blast in the summer months, you are confronted with great difficulty and must spend a great deal of time trying to avoid Covent Garden.  That is the case with persons like myself, ordinary citizens without any highfalutin musical leanings.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dillon will agree with me or not, but people tell me that at those big operas two-thirds of the charm is got in the conductor breaking through the bars and, as they say, unless you have the conductor in front of you, you lose the charm and the motion. I am sure Deputy Dillon appreciates that point.  To get back to sincerity, Deputy Dillon suggested that we should have, at least, broadcasts of records of these operas, in the form of a library, by which a complete opera, or a half, or a quarter of an opera could be sent across to Irish listeners.  I suggest, first of all, that some of our records ought to be scrapped.  I do not know whether the engineers or the testing officials can get the reactions which the ordinary listener is able to discover. But unquestionably we, at times, find that a particularly good record has been what one might call &ldquo;knocked about&rdquo; because of the way in which it is started and finished.  That may be caused by a flaw in the record itself, or it may be because the required extra attention was not given to it by the official who was attending to that record.  If you do not get a smooth start and a smooth finish with a record, it is not giving its proper service.  As a matter of fact, at times it is irritating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, with others, have on numerous occasions found that the announcer or announcers very in the acoustics or that there is a great variation in <Col N="1576" /> the intonation which one gets from one's machine.  Perhaps the engineering tests might bring something to light in the way of showing where in that respect the defect occurs.  I find one thing greatly in favour of the Dublin station.  There is more of a personal contact with the announcer there than one finds with the announcers in the British broadcasting stations. I think the majority of us feel that one is more at home when listening to the Dublin announcers.  There is something of an extraordinary superior tone about the British announcers. There is no doubt that in a broadcasting station the announcer is of vital importance.  I can quite understand that there is tremendous difficulty in getting an announcer who, one can feel, has the right lift and drop in his voice, and who is able to give that continuity which is so essential.  I ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that as we have, I believe, a good announcer, he should be retained and that the announcer should not be changed about.  I am not going to refer now to what Deputy Hogan said about that matter, though I agree with his criticisms.  We have had new announcers, who were very nervous, put on at times.  This might be due to the microphone or the receiving sets, but one did not feel certain that they had self-confidence. The defect might be due to the reception. That is often responsible for a tremendous part of the efficiency or otherwise of broadcasting.  It is a great satisfaction to have an announcer who is known to be always at the top of his job.  The news that comes on the air from Dublin is not very satisfactory at all times.</P>

      <P>I would feel I was funking the issue&mdash;and I hope I will never reach that stage&mdash;if I did not raise that matter here now.  On numerous occasions, or at least on some occasions, we had broadcast a little bit of pink news, or news that was somewhat tainted with the pink outlook.  I do not know whether that is an exact description of it.  On one occasion, we got news broadcast from Spain, giving the views of a self-appointed <Col N="1577" /> mission, a number of ecclesiastics who went there from England.  Few know who they were or what they represented. However, they appointed themselves and went across there.  I understand they had some difficulty in securing visas or passports from the British Foreign Office.  Some of their views were put on the air from our station.  Those views were about conditions in Spain, and in them an insult was offered to the faith of the majority of the people of this country. That bit may have slipped through.  I hope when news about Spain in future is going to be given, that proper care will be exercised in its selection. Somebody may ask, how are you going to get it?  We have the so-called Caballero, for the Madrid Government, at Valencia.  Their communiqués must be given, but at the same time an equally good show should be given to the Burgos Government.  I do not think I need say any more on that.  I remember on one occasion we had another celebrated ecclesiastic's views given on the wireless, and afterwards that broadcast was contradicted by the ecclesiastic himself.  I refer to the Bishop of Gibraltar.  Possibly in England and other countries so much attention would not be given to those broadcasts about Spain.  But here in Ireland, fortunately, we are interested.  While we do not want to be led up the garden with optimistic communiqués which may not be true, at the same time we would like to see that the truth about the Burgos Government is put on the air from our station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very sorry that it happened this year we did not have broadcast criticisms on the Budget.  Last year these criticisms were a very interesting and educational part of the programme. Why we did not have them this year I do not know.  There was an announcement in the Press that the Minister for Finance found it impossible to give his attention to preparing a broadcasting talk.  If the Minister for Finance found it impossible to do that, I do not see that is any reason why any of the Opposition or the Labour Party, or some prominent independent Deputy would not be <Col N="1578" /> allowed to give talks on the Budget. Why should everybody be penalised because the Minister for Finance did not find it convenient to prepare a broadcast talk?  In fair play, there may be an adequate reason as to why we did not have that broadcast.  I would, however, like to have an understanding now that this is not going to be a precedent, and that on other occasions, if the Minister for Finance is unable to give his views, other Deputies will be allowed to give theirs.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all but great credit is due to the Broadcasting Director and his assistants for the programmes they broadcast.  I have heard this commented on by people in England, Wales and Scotland.  They tell me that they find the Irish programme very attractive.  Very often they switch off from their own Regional or National programmes to hear the programme from our country; and they express themselves as charmed with the entertainment broadcast from 2RN.  That is a very great tribute indeed.  In this House we are more or less inclined to criticise, but on this occasion I am happy to be in the position to give that information to the House, to give that appreciation which I have just expressed.  It can certainly be taken by the Director and those around him as a very great tribute.  The people who gave the Irish station so much praise had nothing to gain by doing so; they had no reason for giving it beyond pure sincerity.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister and the Director on the manner in which they are protecting the Athlone station from what I might refer to as factions, from individuals who might endeavour to exploit it.  It is a great thing to know that the station is being used for the benefit of all and it is not going to be used for exploitation purposes by organisations, individuals or factions of any description.  As long as the Minister and those who are running the broadcast service act impartially, they will find that the overwhelming mass of public opinion will be behind them.  There were some, I am sorry to say, who rather thought that Radio Athlone was built specially for them and that no one <Col N="1579" /> else should air their views through its medium.  I am glad to know that that has been and is being fought against and that there are going to be no favourites, that the programme is going to be Irish in its outlook and that the station will be operated in a true democratic spirit, with fair play to everybody.  If the Director continues to run things in that way, he may always count on the support of a solid public opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry that I have complaints to make somewhat similar to those expressed by Deputy Dillon.  Last year I complained of the type of reception that we had in Wexford. I stated that it was really very bad.  I am sorry to say that that complaint still holds good.  We certainly have got more power from Radio Athlone, but the voices coming across the radio seem to be very indistinct. When Stuttgart, the station next to Athlone, is in operation it is impossible to receive Athlone distinctly.  I would suggest, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, that the Minister should send observers to various parts of the country to find out in what way the programmes are being received. Speaking from my own experience, I certainly do not get a good reception of the Irish programme, and that complaint is rather general in my constituency.  As I have indicated, the power is higher than it has been but the reception is just as indistinct as ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a good deal to be said for Deputy Dillon's point of view in so far as music is concerned.  Music is a thing in regard to which we cannot afford to be 100 per cent. national. There ought to be such a thing as an international outlook so far as music is concerned.  I am as fond of a céilidhe as anybody, but I cannot conceive anything more monotonous than céilidhe music lasting for an hour or more.  It is merely a repetition.  There are two or three bars of music and they are continued over and over again and I do not care how Irish anybody may be, he or she is bound to get tired of that.  Surely there is more music and better music in Ireland <Col N="1580" /> than céilidhe music?  Deputy Dillon referred to music he heard from Belfast.  I listened to that music, too, and it was far and away better than anything we got from Athlone for a considerable time. I also agree with the Deputy when he talks about the desirability of getting classical music, to have one day in the week or in the month devoted to it.  These records are available and the Irish people should be permitted to hear them.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I would like to refer to particularly.  It is in connection with an incident that happened &mdash;or rather an incident that did not happen&mdash;on last St. Patrick's Day. Published in the Irish <i>Radio News</i> was an item indicating that we were going to hear the hurling and football finals broadcast.  I do not know whether the wireless department submit their programme to Irish <i>Radio News</i> or not, but I do know that the programme published for St. Patrick's Day contained the item that the hurling and football finals in connection with the Railway Shield would be broadcast, as they have been for years past.  I understand there was some disagreement between the Gaelic Athletic Association and the radio station. The wireless authorities may have been right or wrong in the attitude they took up, but I think that in common courtesy to the people they might have been told that the matches were not going to be broadcast.  I think it was due to the people who possess wireless sets and have paid their licences, many of whom were expecting the broadcast that day, to be told that the broadcast would not take place.  I suggest that the condition of things of which I complain should not be allowed to happen.  So far as I know, even yet no explanation has been offered of that particular incident. One would expect an announcement to be made over the wireless as to what actually happened and intimating that the broadcast was not going to be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the station generally, I agree that there has certainly been a great improvement since Dr. Kiernan was appointed director.  The news <Col N="1581" /> feature has improved considerably and, with the exception of the matters I have mentioned, I must say that the programme generally has improved.  I would emphasise the necessity for sending out observers to various parts of the country to ascertain how the programmes are being received.  In some parts of the country the people have an awful opinion of the Athlone station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the difficulties there are in drafting the news, but there is no doubt that grave indiscretions have been perpetrated in the broadcast of news items.  For example, one night an enthusiast proceeded to give out the news&mdash;I think it was a lady and she was recounting events in Dáil Eireann.  She described how some Deputy advanced an argument, whereupon, according to her, the President rose and tore the Deputy's argument to tatters.  That is really grotesque, and I suggest it creates the impression abroad that there is an endeavour, an official attempt being made, to use the radio for the purpose of distributing Fianna Fáil propaganda.  I do not believe there is an official attempt in that direction, but I feel it is right to say this, that certain individuals charged with the responsibility of preparing the news, on occasion allow their feelings to run away with them.</P>

I quite realise that an enthusiastic supporter of the Minister's might say that there was not half enough given of Seán T. O'Kelly's lovely speech last night, whereas a violent supporter of Fine Gael might say that the Minister for Local Government was no great shakes at any time and they need not have reproduced so much of him on the radio.  I admit the difficulty of getting an impartial and detached report of current events.  It is very necessary that the utmost vigilance should be exercised, particularly in regard <Col N="1582" /> to reporting current events, to inject into that an atmosphere of complete detachment.  I am deliberately abstaining from being hypercritical, because I recognise the difficulty; but nevertheless, I think it is an opportune moment to sound a note of warning in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take these criticisms just as they were made, Sir.  Deputy Dillon started his criticism of broadcasting by stating that there was too much of a bad quality of céilidhe music being given. At least, I take it that it was to the bad quality of it that he was referring, and not because there was too much céilidhe music.  In the course of his remarks in that connection, he used the word &ldquo;disgrace.&rdquo; I do not want to misquote him, but I take it he was referring to the céilidhe music that has been broadcast at these particular times and that it was to this that he objected as being a disgrace.  Am I misquoting him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know why the Minister says that I started with that, because I started with something else.  However, I did refer to the céilidhe music between 10.30 and 11, and I think I said that in seven cases out of ten I thought it was disgraceful and that it was in no sense a credit to Irish music.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>With regard to the question of symphony concerts and classical music generally, at present nine symphonies by Beethoven are being broadcast in a series of one per week.  Very recently, the Director of Broadcasting, at very great inconvenience, I am sure, because of the tremendous amount of organisation that must have been necessary, held a symphony concert in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, and he broadcast the music from that concert for an hour.  I am pretty sure that it was appreciated, and I do know that the theatre itself was filled with a very appreciative audience.  I think it was a great tribute to the Director himself for the manner in which the whole thing was conducted.  He brought over a very eminent conductor, Sir Adrian Boult, the Conductor of the B.B.C.  Symphony Orchestra, and the evening was appreciated by everybody present as well as by those who were listening in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there is still some trouble in respect of the outside stations coming in and interfering with Athlone.  That matter is being examined still further, and there is a conference coming off very shortly at <Col N="1584" /> Cairo, at which we are going to have representatives present.  That particular question of the interference by these stations will be raised there, and I hope that some possible solution will be found whereby the interruptions will be removed.  Now, with regard to the school programmes to which, I think, Deputy Dillon more or less objected, there is a half-hour on five days, from 2.30 to 3&mdash;an extra half-hour which does not interfere with the ordinary broadcasting to the public.  The public still gets what they got previously.  If they do not desire to listen in to the children's broadcast, they need not do so.  The particular type of education the children can get by means of the broadcast is not a type of education they get in school, and that is a very good reason why we are availing of the opportunity to broadcast this type of education.  Irish poetry and Gaelic songs, choir singing, plain chant, Irish history in ballad form, and band music from No. 1 Army Band, and so on&mdash;these are the types of things the children are fairly certain to appreciate, and they do not interfere with the ordinary school programmes.</P>
    <P>The question of the sponsored programme was raised by Deputy Hogan. Our position is simply that we sell the hour to the people concerned, the Hospitals' Trust.  I understand that they have engaged an Englishman, or Englishmen, within the last few weeks, and these people, apparently, are acting as commentators for the programme at the moment.  However, we are looking into that with a view to seeing what we can do.</P>

      <P>Well, our position is simply that we sell the hour.  Of course, we look into the matter of whether there is anything objectionable. At any rate, certain objections have been raised here, and we shall look into the matter.  Now, in reply to a question asked by Deputy Minch, I can say that, recently, as many as 500 people have been tested with a view to seeing what their qualities or their abilities were as announcers. In a short time, we will be advertising, and I hope that we shall get the type of announcer that Deputy Minch and many of the other Deputies would be anxious to hear coming over the air.  With regard to the question of the news that is broadcast, I do not think that, in recent times at any rate, any objection can be taken to it.  The news is very carefully censored, especially news with regard to Spain; but we must remember always that the persons listening in put their own interpretation on the news as it comes over.  What may appear an ordinary matter of news to me may be impressed more on the minds of somebody else, because of their leanings one way or the other.  I may think that there is too much of a leaning in one direction and Deputy Dillon, possibly, may think that the leaning is the other way about.  It is a pretty difficult thing, when an announcer is making an announcement, to avoid putting an emphasis on some particular word, or he may create the impression that he is putting a particular emphasis on a word when he does not intend to do so.  Anyhow, I can assure the House that, from the point of view of sides being taken by the broadcasting establishment, there is no foundation, in fact, for that at all.  The Director has the confidence, I am sure, of everyone in this House in that respect. I think he can be congratulated on the advance that has been made generally in the matter of programmes from the entertainment point of view.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £27,829 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastáil agus Costaisí i dtaobh Iascach Mara agus Intíre, maraon le hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £27,829 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Estimate comprises four sections&mdash;Administration, Sea Fisheries, Inland Fisheries, and Sea Fisheries Association.  The total of all four sections shows a net decrease of £300,226 as compared with the figures for the previous financial year. Administration is divided into four sub-heads, A, B, C and D.  In sub-head A there is an increase of £1,057 over last year, which is explained partly by normal increments on salaries, and partly by the provision of two additional posts, namely, an assistant engineer and an assistant inspector of fisheries, the latter being really a revival of a post that had lain in abeyance for about three years. Sub-heads B and C show slight increases in view of additional travelling and other expenses which are anticipated. Sub-head D calls for no comment. It is right, however, that I should repeat a statement which I made 12 months ago, that in the event of rather extensive legislation dealing with our inland fisheries being enacted within the current financial year a certain measure of increased outlay upon administrative and technical staff will be inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sea Fisheries.&mdash;This section deals with the purely administrative side, together with the protection service, and the provision set down in the Estimate is virtually the same as that <Col N="1587" /> for the preceding year, the total increase being only £22.  There is not much to comment upon as regards the four sub-heads&mdash;E (1), E (2), E (3) and E (4)&mdash;which comprise this section, except in regard to E (3), which deals with protection work.  Speaking on this point 12 months ago, I reminded Deputies that everyone was satisfied that effective control of our entire coastline by one cruiser was not possible, and at that time my Department was actively engaged upon arrangements for the chartering of a second vessel for this duty.  Unfortunately, when we were ready to execute the charter, the owners of the vessel concerned changed their minds about hiring, with the result that we had to start all over again in our search for a suitable ship.  Our requirements in the matter are rather exceptional, and it is not easy to find a vessel which fulfils them.  I am glad, however, to be able to say that we have now practically completed negotiations, and, subject to the result of a final survey now to be made on our behalf, we hope to take over this second ship and have her in commission by an early date.  At the time that the Estimate which we are now discussing was being framed, matters had not advanced sufficiently to justify the inclusion of any provision in respect of the second cruiser, but what I am now stating is by way of information to the House rather than a comment on the Estimate before us, because, naturally, this is a case in which I shall have to come later on with a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Inland Fisheries.&mdash;This section of the Estimate is made up of sub-heads F (1), F (2), F (3) and F (4), and is just £35 below the total figure for the preceding year.  No change has been made in any one of the items except that in relation to grants for boards of conservators, which has been slightly reduced; that in respect of grants to local associations, which has been raised by £50; and that for Black Castle hatchery, which has dropped from £50 to £15.  I have already on three occasions explained to the House all the implications of this section of the Estimate, and I <Col N="1588" /> do not think that there is any need to discuss the details again.</P>
    <P>Sea Fisheries Association.&mdash;In this case I wish to offer a few special remarks. Under one of the rules of the association the duty devolves on the Minister in charge of the fishery service to satisfy himself that all moneys issued to the association, whether by way of repayable advance or as a grant-in-aid, are being utilised by that body strictly for the purposes for which such advances or grants had been made, and to the advantage of the sea fishing industry generally. That is to say, that while as large a measure as possible of autonomy is being accorded to the directors by whom the business of the association is managed, the Minister shall, from time to time, take stock, as it were, of the position.  To that end I have set up a small inter-Departmental committee to survey generally the results of the association's operations during the six years in which it has been actively employed.  Owing to the setting up of that committee, a departure was made from the normal procedure under which estimates of their requirements are furnished to, and discussed with, my Department by the directors of the association in respect of sub-heads G (1), G (2), G (3) and G (4) of this Vote.  It was felt that, in the special circumstances, the best course would be to set down for the current financial year a round figure in each case, issues from which would be subject to consultation with the Minister for Finance, and which, furthermore, could be reviewed in the light of the report which will be furnished in due course by the special committee referred to.</P>
    <P>This seems to me an appropriate point at which to advert to two matters that have been under discussion for the past few years.  One relates to the absence of Continental markets for our cured herring.  In that connection we had been strongly urged to do everything possible to have the German market for that commodity reopened to our people.  Accordingly, when the trade agreement between the Saorstát and Germany was being discussed last autumn, special efforts <Col N="1589" /> were made to induce the German authorities to allocate a reasonable quota for cured herring of Saorstát origin.  If our representatives were not as successful in this matter as we, and they, hoped might be the case, they at all events secured some results, and during the period April to July of this year, the German Government is providing import licences and currency facilities for some 15 or 16 importers in Hamburg and Stettin, with whom such of our exporters as are interested in the business are open to make their own arrangements. The names of these German importers have been circulated to all persons who are believed to be engaged in this trade, and a copy of the list will be sent to anyone else who chooses to ask for it.  It is true that the total amount of the quota is small, but it is to be hoped that, if satisfactory deals take place in the present year, it may be possible to effect some improvement in the quantity that may be taken by Germany in future seasons. This statement, of course, is made with all due reserve, because we cannot anticipate the result of negotiations from year to year.</P>
    <P>The other matter which has been greatly exercising those of our people who are concerned with it is the setting up of a plant for the cleansing of mussels prior to their export to British markets.  On at least two previous occasions I have explained to the Dáil that until, as the result of inquiries and negotiations which had been set on foot in this case, we could be assured that mussels so treated here and exported under the certificate of the Sea Fisheries Association will be assured of entry into Great Britain, the Minister for Finance&mdash;not unreasonably I think&mdash; could not see his way to authorise the capital expenditure necessary in the matter.  I quite realise that this question has been in abeyance for a long time, but I would counsel all who are affected by it to exercise some further patience, with the assurance that my Department is doing its best to find a way out of the difficulties confronting us.</P>
    <P>There are just two more points of <Col N="1590" /> general interest upon which I wish to say a few words before I close.  Following consideration by the Government of the report furnished by the commission set up to inquire into the position of our inland fisheries, legislation has now been rough-drafted departmentally. I had been hopeful of introducing such legislation during the present session, but I fear that, owing to the prolonged inter-Departmental negotiations which have arisen and certain complicated questions which have, as a result, come up for settlement before the Bill is put into final shape, it may not be possible to fulfil my intentions. In that event it will be necessary to have a short extension of the Fisheries Act, 1925, and of the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Act, 1934, approved by the Dáil; but I should like to assure the House that, even should such a temporary expedient become essential, it will not be permitted to delay work upon the major Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to repeat in substance what I stated last year as to the existence of a good market in this country for the landings which might be made by a well-equipped and well-managed company engaged in deep sea trawling.  Certain proposals have since then been presented to the Government; but in every case such proposals seem to entail a measure of State assistance, not to say of State interference with or control of the industry which, in my view, would in the ultimate tend to hinder rather than help the genuine commercial development of this business of deep sea fishing.  It may be taken that the Government will be found to be favourably disposed towards any sound, workable scheme for the development of deep sea trawling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not expand a little more on that question about deep sea trawling, because that has been greatly canvassed for a long time.  Does the Minister suggest that we are to find in this country a market for wet fish to be caught in deep sea trawlers?  If he does, I do not know where we are going to get it.  Far more important than embarking on a comprehensive scheme of deep sea trawling would be the getting of a market for the wet fish <Col N="1591" /> that can be caught by our inshore-fishermen. To have a successful trawling industry you want a disposal centre like Grimsby or Yarmouth.  To have successful inshore fishing is to confer an immense benefit on a great part of our western seaboard.  The bulk of our fishermen like to work on their holdings, and to fish in season. That is the way they have been brought up.  Those of us who believe that life in the Gaeltacht can be a very happy life for those who love it, wish to mitigate the rigours of that life in so far as possible without migrating the people out of the Gaeltact altogether.  Some people think that you ought to take all the people out of the Gaeltacht and plant them somewhere else.  Some people are now learning that when you take them out they prefer to go back there again. Those of us who know the Gaeltacht have seen people coming back from New York and Chicago and settling down in the middle of it, because they like it.  It is their home; it is the way they like to live.  If they are given a chance to earn their livings, albeit the work is hard, they are glad to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of spending oceans of money on buying trawlers, which are immensely expensive both to purchase and maintain, I would much sooner see the money spent on developing a distribution system for such wet fish as is caught by the inshore fishermen. Remember that life on a trawler is a nasty business.  There is as much difference between the life of a trawler fisherman and the life of an inshore fisherman as there is between the life of an industrial worker in the Black Country of England and that of a small farmer in the County Mayo.  The inshore fisherman has a perilous life, but he is always near home, and it is a healthy life.  It is the life he is accustomed to; there is nothing revolutionary about it.  A trawler man is an industrial worker, and an industrial worker on a particularly hard, arduous and disagreeable kind of work.  I am sufficiently old-fashioned not to desire to thrust that kind of industrialisation down the throats of our fishing people.  I do not think that <Col N="1592" /> the fishermen themselves want it. What they would like would be facilities for the disposal of the fish that are caught inshore.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is terribly difficult to provide those facilities.  If you could get regular landings, the problem would be considerably simplified, but they are very difficult to get.  Sometimes the men do not get the fish; they come in late; sometimes the men cannot go out.  But I feel that the wisest thing here is not to be too scrupulously businesslike, not to insist on a return of 20/- on every £1 invested. The problem is partly a social problem as well as an economic one. I should like to see a little money lost in providing a guaranteed market for inshore fish.  I would be prepared to lose money over 12 months in providing that guaranteed market for the fishermen, with a view to determining finally whether you can get the fishermen to deliver fish at a port on a given date, and reasonably near a given hour.  There is no use in closing our eyes to the fact that fishermen are not the easiest people in the world to work with.  They are very individualistic. They are very reluctant to fall in with any rigid plan, and they are sometimes inclined to complain rather more than the circumstances entitle them to. However, they have a hard time of it, and one does not want to be too critical.</P>
    <P>One has to bear in mind that there are great difficulties in the problem, but I have no doubt at all in my mind that the best solution of those difficulties would be, for 12 months from a given day, to give the fishermen a guaranteed market for the fish at their place of landing.  That would ensure supplies; that would regularise the livelihood of the fishermen.  I would then proceed to deal with the problem of disposing of the fish.  No doubt, for the first few months a great deal of the fish would have to be thrown away, because you could not sell it quickly enough, but I believe that, with the co-operation of local authorities and by carefully-planned circles which would bring travelling fish-vans into market towns on the market day, we could work out a system whereby a very considerable proportion of the fish <Col N="1593" /> could be disposed of readily through the country.  I do not think it would be any hardship on county homes to require them to give two fish meals a week.  We recently heard Deputy Haslett very reasonably complain of the monotony of the diet in some public institutions.  If you are in a position to give the inmates of public institutions really fresh fish twice a week&mdash;fresher fish than they ever get from Grimsby&mdash;I think it might be a very pleasant change from beef or mutton.  After all, fish is fish, but bullock beef may be elderly cow, and best wether mutton may be dilapidated ewe.  I am also quite sure that if we could get the vans to go into the market towns on market days you could sell fish.  I have seen the Sea Fisheries' van solemnly arrive in Ballaghaderreen on a Thursday to sell fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Deputy could have fish for his dinner on Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Concannon has fallen into the trap.  She says, so that I could have fish on Friday. I never buy fish on Thursday for Friday.  Most people, I think, buy fish on Friday for Friday.  If this van came into the town on Friday, the town would be thronged with people looking for fish.  What happens is that they come to us on Thursday, go some place else on Friday, and there is nobody in either place looking for fish because it is mainly country people who buy fish.  They greatly relish fresh fish, herrings and flat fish.  Therefore, I think that, if the vans arrived in country towns on market days, you could dispose of a great deal of fish in that way. The country people, mind you, are not wedded to fish on Fridays only. Fish is a novelty for them, and they like to have fish on other weekdays as well as on Fridays.  If they knew that it was to be obtained, that there was a constant supply of fresh fish available, I believe you could build up a considerable market in that way.  It would take time, but I am satisfied that it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> Now, while inshore fishing is important, it pales into insignificance beside herrings, and the herring business is being made a horrible mess of.  We are making trade agreements with Germany.  We are doling out to Germany butter at 4d. and 5d. per lb. cheaper than our own people can buy it.  We are sending them cattle at 27/- per cwt., cattle that are making 40/- on the Dublin market. We are sending them eggs which we do not want to send them and for which we have got a very much better and much more profitable market elsewhere, and, if you please, we are binding ourselves to take from Germany considerable quantities of merchandise in exchange.  We are in a position to tell Germany to go to blazes.  If she will not buy from us the things that we want to sell, we ought to tell her bluntly to go to blazes and run the German buyers out of the town.  That is the way to deal with them.  If they are prepared to deal with us on the same basis that they want us to deal with them, then we are prepared to deal with them; but we should make it perfectly plain to them that we will not give them exclusively what they want to buy, and buy from them exclusively what they want to sell.</P>

      <P>Apropos of fish, the Deputy and the Minister seem to have discovered a red herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that Germany is one of the principal markets that we have got for herrings.  Germany at present wants fats.  She is drawing out of this country animal fats, of one kind or another, at about two-thirds of their current value.  If Germany was to come to us and say that she was prepared to take off our hands something that we find great difficulty in selling elsewhere, <Col N="1595" /> I think the Minister would be perfectly justified in giving Germany concessions. I think there is something that Germany wants perhaps as much as animal fats, something which, I think, we would be quite entitled to give if we could get a market sufficient to absorb all the herrings that we have to sell, and that is sterling.  I think the German Government would be very glad to get sterling.  The Government here would, I think, be quite justified in giving substantial concessions to Germany if they would agree to take all our herrings.  Why not say to them: &ldquo;We will give you a two-to-one market if you take all our herrings, and pay you 50 per cent. in herrings and 50 per cent. in sterling.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The German market is a valuable one for herrings.  What maddens me is that we are giving valuable concessions to Germany, and selling them stuff that we do not want to sell them far cheaper than we sell it elsewhere. That, to my mind, is crazy economics. Suppose, as things are, that we cannot get into the German market any more herrings than we are getting in there at present?  It is now pretty clear to all members of the House that the British Government are quite prepared to make a deal with our Government whenever it suits the convenience of both.  Could we not make an arrangement with the British Government whereby we would exchange with them the purchase of British merchandise for the share of their herring quota in the German market?  I would remind Deputies that up to recently we habitually got it, because all the Buncrana herrings brought into Derry and cured there were shipped to Germany as British herrings.  It was only recently that stopped.  Could we not make a deal along those lines in order to get an outlet for our herrings?  I am convinced that if this problem was approached in a rational way, and with good-will, we could get this market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who is intimately acquainted with the Gaeltacht areas on our West coast can understand what a difference it would make if we had <Col N="1596" /> a market sufficient to absorb all the herrings that our fishermen are in a position to catch.  It would change large areas from being what they are to-day, vast workhouses of idle men&mdash; men anxious to work, who can find nothing to do&mdash;into hives of industry. Remember, also, that there are lots of girls who are now being driven over to Scotland to work at herring curing there.  They are being driven into highly undesirable surroundings, and they are being driven thither because the work which they used to do near their own homes curing the herrings on the North and West coasts of Donegal has completely ceased.  I would like to see those girls brought home again, and allowed to do that work amongst their own people.  It is rough work, and if they have to do it in Scotland, then they are going to be brought into contact with the roughest of rough, many of them simple, innocent girls who would be much better off at home amongst their own people.  The matter is one of great urgency, and I do not want to pretend that it is not one of very great difficulty.  I think that if the matter was tackled in a bolder way than the Minister has tackled it so far, more could be done.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right to remind the Minister that, when his predecessor was in office, he made the welkin ring.  He denounced him as selling the fishermen and betraying our national liberties and national rights, and prayed for the day when he could put his hand to the plough and plough a furrow which would surprise the natives.  It has surprised the natives, because he has done nothing except this one thing&mdash;he has learned sense and learned some realisation of the difficulties that confront a person in his position of responsibility, and that is something.  Do you remember the grand old days when Fianna Fáil was going to settle the Lough Foyle situation overnight?  I remember, in 1932, we had an election in Donegal.  I do not see Deputy Brady here now, nor Deputy Blaney, nor Deputy Hugh Doherty.  They were all in Donegal then, and Deputy Doherty from Inishowen was like a tornado.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This was made relevant to everything.  I think it comes under sea fisheries or protection.  We were going to send an Irish fleet in there and blast the British fleet out of creation.  We were going to send an expeditionary army into Northern Ireland and arrest Craigavon and bring him up before the Circuit Court in Letterkenny and give him six months for interfering with the fishermen.  In the glorious days of 1932 there was nothing we would not do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In those days the Minister was to lead the expeditionary force and to come back with these hostages, and, accordingly, scenes of great enthusiasm were created.  Deputy Joe O'Doherty was triumphantly returned to press the claims of the fishermen in Dáil Eireann, and from that day to this devil a word we have heard about them&mdash;not a whisper&mdash;until last week, after years of stout battling, the Saorstát Eireann Board, who used to issue licences to the fishermen to fish in Lough Foyle, gave in their guns and stated that after five years of Fianna Fáil nothing can be done and they had better wind up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again the only benefit that has accrued to the State is that the Minister has learned sense.  He has realised that there is a problem which cannot be dealt with on the lines of a bull in a china shop.  It is a very difficult problem, but one not incapable of solution, and the tragic part of it is that just when Fianna Fáil came into office the whole question was on the very verge of solution.  An agreement had been almost drafted, and was prepared to be initialled, which would have regulated the rights of the Northern Ireland and the Saorstát Eireann fishermen in Lough Foyle and done substantial justice to each.  But, of course, that would never gratify <Col N="1598" /> Deputy Joe O'Doherty, who wanted to have marching and counter-marching and a martial spirit throughout the land.  A perfectly useful arrangement that was being arrived at was torn up and thrown away, and the Lough Foyle situation is now that no Saorstát Eireann fisherman can put his nose into Lough Foyle, and the Six Counties have complete control to-day.</P>
    <P>There is another immensely important problem to which I am amazed the Minister has not referred this evening.  A situation arose in connection with a decision of the Supreme Court of this State in which a man, who had paid out an immense sum of money in good faith for a several fishery on the River Erne, woke up one morning to discover that he had nothing; that his property suddenly vanished into thin air overnight. Many opinions might be expressed on that judgment, particularly in the light of evidence given in an analogous suit which was before the courts in regard to the several fishery on the River Moy recently.  This is not the forum in which that might properly be discussed, but this much is certain, that taking those two suits together and the evidence given in them, it is eminently desirable that the Minister should use whatever powers are at present conferred upon him by statute to deal with this whole several fishery question in the country.  It may be that he will have to ask the Executive Council to authorise an <i>ex gratia</i> grant but, whatever is done, the men who have lost these several fisheries should be compensated from the public purse.</P>
    <P>The Government have acquired the value of these fisheries and that value is immense.  Many of these people who own these several fisheries are people who are traditionally associated with the Unionist minority in this country. Some of them are better Nationalists than ever sat in this House.  But the majority of them are held by men who were notoriously associated with the Unionist minority in this country. That should merely make us doubly solicitous to see that justice is done to them, not only in the letter but in the spirit as well.  It is a deplorable <Col N="1599" /> situation&mdash;I will not say further than that&mdash;that a perfectly honourable citizen of this State, having paid the full value of what was recognised to be a genuine, real property, should wake up one morning to discover that a title that was never contested for centuries has suddenly been blown sky high, more particularly when the decision to do so is founded on the evidence of historians, who subsequently come before the same court and say that, as their knowledge progresses, their opinions materially alter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go further into it.  Suffice it to say that the Minister ought to take the opportunity to-day of making a comprehensive statement on this matter and of saying categorically to these persons, whose property has left them, that the State will see that they will suffer no inequitable loss.  I urge on the House to remember that the effect of this decision was to transfer this property to the State, so that the State is now in enjoyment of these immensely valuable fisheries.  We are not asking for what is a <i>de facto ex gratia</i> grant.  In theory it is an <i>ex gratia</i> grant, but in effect it will be merely a just purchase price for valuable consideration.  I feel strongly about that, because this business has been dangling on for years.  When you have an elderly man with his entire property swept away overnight it may be the death of him. While none of these men would be unreasonable or press the Government unduly to rush into a solution, it would relieve their minds and greatly ease their personal positions if the Minister, sooner or later, were going to take whatever steps may be necessary to see equity done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about getting the tariff off shell-fish and salmon?  We got the tariff off horses.  The trade in shell-fish, even more than in horses, has been disrupted and spoiled by the tariff, not so much by the money that had to be paid, but by the delay and annoyance in getting them through to the London market in fresh condition. <Col N="1600" /> The amount of money involved must be very small, and I need not tell the Minister that the lobster industry on the west coast of Donegal is of great significance to the people. It would make an immense difference to them if it was free of tariffs.  I urge strongly on the Minister that he should start a little trade agreement of his own, and open up negotiations directly with the British Government to have this duty taken off, or, if not taken off altogether, let him shift it from shell-fish and salmon on to something else, and we will see about getting it off the other things later on.  So far as fishing is concerned, I am primarily concerned to see the market for herring recovered.  That is the main problem and I mentioned the last matter as a mere minor consideration.  There used to be a good deal of kippering done on the west coast of Donegal. I do not think it was done in other parts of the fishing country, but I imagine we could redevelop the kippering business, which would give a good deal of employment.  Remember, if you could get one good kippering plant going in West Donegal, it would employ more than all the silk factories that could be built there.  The talk of such factories is mostly &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; as we know.  If you have them, they must be second-rate, or producing under extreme difficulties.</P>

      <P>I am going on the never failing indulgence of the Chair.  If you had a good kippering plant, the most efficient that could be got&mdash;and you must turn out the best product to have it economic&mdash;and if you spent as much money trying to sell the kippers as you do in trying to build silk factories, you would build up a valuable and a permanent trade for this country.  These are the kind of lines I would like to see this Department worked on.  While I think it is a great pity it did not work more on these lines in the past, I hope it will do so in the future.</P>

      <P>The question of erecting a mussel purification tank has <Col N="1601" /> come up regularly on this Vote for a number of years.  In fact it is a hardy annual.  The Minister stated that until the result of the negotiations which he is carrying on with the health authorities in England have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion, it would not be possible for him to advise the Minister for Finance to place at his disposal the money necessary for the erection of a purification tank.  May I ask the Minister if any progress in securing this market has been made during the past year?  I should like to know also if any further assurances have been received regarding acceptance by the British medical authorities of mussels bred in tanks in this country.  I know that trade inquiries for mussels have been received recently by a number of traders from large towns in England.  If the Minister cannot secure a guarantee that certificates will be issued by medical authorities in England I suppose we cannot go ahead with the matter.  I am concerned about it in this way, that we have a potential source of wealth in the mussel industry at the mouth of the Boyne.  Some years ago thousands of pounds were earned annually by fishermen who were engaged during the winter months fishing for mussels. That source of income has been lost to them, and they are anxious that they should be allowed to commence operations again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various suggestions for dealing with the matter have been made.  One was that if the Minister was not disposed to agree to the suggestion to erect a central tank in Dublin Bay, which was provided for in the Estimates some years ago, that he would consider the question of allowing the local people to erect a smaller tank, thereby giving them an opportunity to find out if it was possible to secure a market sufficiently large to provide them with a livelihood.  These people have been provided with grants during the winter months, and a number of them were drawing unemployment assistance, so that if there was any loss on the erection of a tank, it would be made good by the savings that would be made by other Departments each year in the way of grants and unemployment assistance.  The Minister has asked <Col N="1602" /> the people to have patience, so that he would have further time to consider the question.  I suppose they may take that as a hopeful sign, that the Minister is convinced that certain progress has been made, and that in a short time he may be able to give a decision.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the question that concerns me is that the mussels at Mornington, at the mouth of the Boyne, are now at their best stage of development. I am satisfied there would be a quick demand for them if they were allowed into the British market.  I feel that the superior quality of the mussels would win the approbation of the medical authorities if there were a few markets open, and if health certificates were forthcoming from three or four towns in England.  I think it would be a very wise policy on the part of the Minister to allow the smaller tank to be erected, and the mussels sent over, because I believe their good qualities would convince other medical officers of health and that they would issue the necessary certificates.  I suggest that a bold step should be taken by the Minister.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would lend his assistance, and I believe the result would justify the expense.</P>

      <P>When dealing with this Estimate I will take the items in order.  Take Sub-head A, where it seems extraordinary to see the head of the branch down for a salary of £700, whereas further down on the list officers, who are working under him, are more highly paid, one being paid £800 and another £750.  It seems to me to be an extraordinary state of affairs that the head of the branch should not be paid a remuneration at least equal to the highest paid official working under him.  I do not say that the chief inspector, who gets £800, and the engineer who gets £750, are in the least overpaid.  On the contrary. There is no man alive who knows half as much about our complicated code of fishery laws as the present chief inspector does, and he is a great asset to the Department.  The engineer of the Department is one of the few marine engineers we have in this <Col N="1603" /> country, so that in no sense do I consider that they are overpaid; but, on the other hand, they are working under the authority of the head of the branch, and I think it is a very peculiar arrangement that the head of the branch should not at least receive the salary of the highest paid of those two officials.  I say that with no regard to the present occupant of the position.  I say it because I believe it is a bad principle to have the head of a branch paid on a lower scale than those who are working subordinate to him.</P>
      <P>I am afraid it is part of the policy that was adopted a few years ago when fisheries disappeared altogether from the cognomen of the Minister. There was for a period a Department of Fisheries under a separate Minister. About 1928, fisheries went in with the Land Commission, and the Minister was known as the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, but fisheries were still kept prominently to the fore.  When the present Government took over, after a very short period of office, the name &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; disappeared entirely. It was hidden away obviously with the idea that people would forget about it, because the Government felt that there was nothing showy and nothing flashy about fisheries work and the possibilities of fishery development. Therefore, they decided to hide it away in a corner so that people might forget about it until we came to the Estimates each year.  I think this is part of the same business.  There is one Department in the Book of Estimates, which I turned over here by chance&mdash;Local Government and Public Health.  Besides a secretary and assistant secretary, you have there five principal officers on a scale considerably higher than the head of the Fishery Branch, so that the estimation of the Government with regard to the whole fisheries business is that it is of less importance than any one of those sections of the Local Government Department which is administered by a principal officer.  I leave sub-head A with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no comment to be made on other sub-heads until we come to sub-head E (3).  The Minister has told us <Col N="1604" /> that he has stated before, and it has often been stated here, that it is agreed that effective control by one patrol boat was impossible.  In 1933 the Minister brought in a Bill, the Sea Fisheries (Protection) Bill.  I think it became law about December, 1933.  I remember when that Bill was before the House I told the Minister that the Bill as it stood was not worth the paper it was written on if he had not some additional coastal patrol to enable him to enforce its provisions, and I told him it would have been wiser for him to have waited until he had that additional coastal patrol before bringing in the Bill.  I felt that the poachers, the British steam trawlers and the French lobster boats, would only laugh at the impotence of this House in bringing in legislation with a flourish, setting out what we were going to do with the poachers, and then, in effect, allowing that piece of legislation to become a dead letter from the very first day.  I do not know what the mentality of the Government is on that matter.  A very prominent member of the Sea Fisheries Association has recently told us that it was almost good for our inshore fisheries that the sea bottoms should be trawled by British steam trawlers. I do not think that Father Shiels will get many to agree with him in his own county, or in any other county; I am certain that the Minister does not agree with him and that that is not the view of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly was not of that opinion when he brought in the Fisheries Bill of 1933, because I remember that one of the things he said on the Second Reading was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most serious injury to our inshore fisheries, and to the immature fish which frequent the shallow waters during their development from the fry stage, is done by the modern high-powered trawlers.  The existing laws for the protection of these inshore waters from such vessels have become inadequate, and further powers are required to meet the changed conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was at column 609, volume 50, of the Dáil Debates.  That was his view then, and I take it it was the view of <Col N="1605" /> the Department.  I am certain he does not agree with Father Shiels that this intensive trawling of our inshore fisheries is good for the inshore fisheries.</P>
    <P>There is one thing, however, on which the Minister must be congratulated on this sub-head, and it is the successful way in which he has muzzled his own back benchers, and, indeed, members of the Labour Party as well, because everyone remembers when Fianna Fáil were in opposition how vocal the Fianna Fáil back benchers were about sea fisheries protection. I remember that at that time members of my own Party were amongst the most critical Deputies in connection with this matter, but they could say nothing compared with what Fianna Fáil Deputies said.  It is amusing to read some of those speeches now, because, practically from the day Fianna Fáil came into office, we did not hear a word about the foreign trawlers from these Deputies. Some of them, of course, have gone to higher spheres, but looking through some of the speeches made then, I came first of all upon a speech of Deputy Domhnall O Buachalla, who waxed belligerent in connection with foreign trawlers.  This is what he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Maidir le ceist na n-iascairí, sé mo bharúil nach bhfuil aon intinn ag an Rialtais ná ag an Aire rud ar bith do dhéanamh chun ár n-iascairí do chosaint ó sna creachadóirí iasachta a thagann isteach annso chun ár n-iasc do thógaint leo.  Níl a fhios agam an é is cúis leis sin, nach bhfuil an comhacht ag an Aire nó nach bhfuil sé de mhisneach aige, nó ag an Rialtais, ordú do thabhairt do Chaptaen an &lsquo;Mhuirchú&rsquo; urchar so scaoile leis na creachadóirí seo chun a theasbáint dóibh nach bhfuil cead acu teacht isteach annso agus ár gcuid éisc do scuaba leo.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Má táimíd saor, cé'n chúis nach ndéantar rud ar na hiascairí? Deir sé linn go bhfuil bád ag an Roinn agus go bhfuil gunnaí air. B'fheidir nach bhfuil ann ach gunnaí bréige.  Ach má tá bád ann agus <Col N="1606" /> gunnaí air, cé'n chúis nach gcuirtear in úsaid iad?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down still, he talks machine-guns and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;B'fhearr i bhfad níos mó bád beag a bheith againn agus meaisínghunnaí orra agus iad seo do chur in úsáid má tá gá leo.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us turn to what he said in column 98:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In regard to the poaching by French boats off the Saltee Islands, the fishermen there informed us that there are certain spawning beds which they have never fished but that the French and British boats encroach on that area and around the great islands off Duncannon and take away the spawn of cod, haddock and other fish.  The &lsquo;Muirchu&rsquo; is costing £8,000, though her speed is only 36 miles a day or 1½ miles an hour, and she burns 2½ cwt. of coal for every mile she goes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Allen on the 26th March, 1930.  I asked him where he got the information and he said he found it in the Appropriation Account. He went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it would be a good idea for us to make a contribution to the Naval Conference in London by scrapping the &lsquo;Muirchu&rsquo; and getting a few submarines instead.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on in, more or less, the same tone.  Since Fianna Fáil came into power, or since he came back to the Dáil, Deputy Allen has not had a word to say about the French poachers off the coast of Wexford, or about the spawn of cod or haddock. Another Deputy who used to be very <Col N="1607" /> vocal when the Government Party were in opposition is hardly heard here at all now.  I refer to Deputy Micheál O'Clery.  Deputy O'Clery, speaking in 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another reason why I am going to vote against this Estimate is because one of the big things which is the great drawback here, and which will continue to hamper this industry, is this menace of the foreign trawlers.  Years ago, we were promised that something effective would be done to tackle this question of poaching by the foreign trawlers.  The &lsquo;Muirchu&rsquo; cost a considerable amount of money to maintain, and this year there was an increased cost of £600 for the &lsquo;Muirchu.&rsquo;  That is absolute waste of money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Clery is not here to tell us to-day that the money is being wasted.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole amount of money spent on that Vote is a waste, when we consider that for the past year there has been only one capture and one prosecution of foreign trawlers by that boat....  I think the Minister should seriously consider the scrapping of that boat and think out some better method of protecting our sea fisheries from foreign trawlers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he gives us this choice piece:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wonder, if we had some small patrol boats in some individual fishing quarters, if it would be possible to have the co-operation of the Army aeroplanes which are doing nothing at present if, perhaps, we exclude joy-riding over the Curragh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy O'Clery in 1931.  He proceeds to say in the next column:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of £10,000 a year or more on the &lsquo;Muirchu&rsquo; for the protection of our fisheries is an absolute waste of money.  I do not think that the Minister could justify that expenditure.  This is one of the main reasons why I am going to vote against this Estimate or vote to have it sent back.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must not forget the Labour Party. I am glad that Deputy Corish is here, <Col N="1608" /> because Deputy Corish used also hold forth very strongly about the inadequate protection afforded our fisheries.  We have not been hearing so much about that in recent years from Deputy Corish or any other member of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish used one expression two years in succession, so that I need not go any further back. Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Everybody in this country, especially people with nautical experience, knows that the operations of the &lsquo;Muirchu&rsquo; are an absolute farce.  The vessel is too slow to get out of her own way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is Deputy Corish in 1931.  He said exactly the same thing in 1930:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When she comes within miles of where the trawlers are, it is known all over the coast.  I cannot understand the shortsightedness of the Government in this respect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having succeeded in muzzling practically all that criticism since the Department of Fisheries was hidden away under his wing.  There is no question that poaching by foreign trawlers is, at least, as bad as ever it was and the French lobster boats are coming in just as much as they ever did.  In fact, up to the outbreak of the Spanish war there was a new type of steam trawler coming along the coast which did not constitute a problem in our time.  A considerable number of Spanish trawlers were operating off our coast up to the outbreak of the Spanish war. We were not troubled with those at all.  But the problem is there as much as ever it was and the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933, has not had the least effect in preventing this poaching. As the Minister was told, it could not possibly have any effect unless there was some arm by which the provisions of the Act could be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We next come to the question of inland fisheries.  I was sorry to hear from the Minister, in that connection, <Col N="1609" /> that the Bill which had been promised for quite a period to deal with the whole question of proprietary fisheries will not be introduced this session, which means it will not be introduced before the election.  I think that that is unfortunate.  I am no advocate of a Fishery Bill on the lines of the Fishery Report but, once the Minister has announced his intention to bring in a Bill following the Fishery Report, it would be advisable that legislation should be introduced with as little delay as possible, whether it be based on that Report or not.  The interested parties are very concerned as to what their position will be.  The proprietors of fisheries want to know where they stand.  They are in a state of concern as to whether or not these fisheries will be their property when the Bill becomes law.  They are inclined to neglect the fisheries to some extent. They are not inclined to spend as much money in the protection of the fisheries as they spent in the past when they knew they had an estate which they could look forward to owning for a comparatively long period.  On the other hand, you have the persons who hope to have these proprietary fisheries converted into public fisheries. These persons ought to know what their position is with as little delay as possible.  The other matters under the heading of &ldquo;Inland Fisheries&rdquo; stand very much as they always stood.  The Minister mentioned that it will be necessary to introduce legislation prolonging the provisions of Section 13 of the 1925 Act which, I take it, relates to rates on valued fisheries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, I see there is a drop in the amount provided under sub-head G (3).  Whereas £14,000 was provided last year, a sum of only £10,000 is provided this year for this purpose.  I should like to have some explanation of that.  I was rather sorry the Minister did not give us more information about the operations of the Sea Fisheries Association.  It looks rather retrograde that the amount of money allotted to the Association for boats and gear should have fallen.  One would hope that, at any rate, over a period of years&mdash;until we <Col N="1610" /> felt our fishermen were all pretty well equipped&mdash;this would be, if anything, an increasing Vote.  Certainly it should not be decreasing.  Many people are complaining that they have been applying and have not been met by the Sea Fisheries Association in their request for the standard boats the association have got built.  I am afraid that the conditions attaching to the getting of these boats is making it impossible for most of the members of the association to succeed in their applications.  That is not the fault of the Minister.  It is the fault of the Minister for Finance because of the conditions he has laid down for the making of these advances for boats by the association.</P>
    <P>There is a provision that these men have to put up portion of the capital required.  In very many cases this is absolutely out of the question.  Of course, nobody appreciates better than I do that the Minister has a very substantial reason for being cautious. The history of advances to fishermen in the past is not a very savoury one. For one reason or another the obligations were not met as they should have been met.  Even in very many cases where the fishermen made money on the advances that had been made to them by the Department they did not make a serious effort to pay their loans.  That was what happened in a number of cases.  It was not so in the majority of cases, I admit.  The majority of the cases in which the men did not meet their obligations were of the type where persons bought boats when they were at a very high price.  Having bought these boats at a very high price, and shortly after having incurred heavy financial commitments, the slump came and these men were absolutely unable to meet their obligations no matter how anxious they were to do so.  But if the Sea Fisheries Association is to have any chance of success there must be some elasticity in allowing them to supply boats and gear to the fishermen members of the association.  The association have means of knowing their men far better than the Department had.  The association should have a free hand.  Where you have a genuinely hardworking, honest, fisherman, <Col N="1611" /> especially if his past record with the Department has been a good one, the association should have a free hand to equip him with a boat and gear without any previous condition such as putting up portion of the capital.  Under the new arrangement they would have a very safe handle over him.  They would have the handling of his fish.  If he is doing well they can deduct a certain percentage which will enable them to recoup themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get the Minister for Finance to ease the situation for the Sea Fisheries Association in making grants of boats and gear to the members of the association. Otherwise, I am afraid that most of the Irish fishermen&mdash;some of them quite honest, hardworking people&mdash;will remain for ever on the shaughran. While on that question I would refer to the fishery loans.  Deputies remember that a big volume of these fishery loans were wiped out by, I think, the Act of 1930.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That left over other outstanding loans.  The Department of Finance would only go that far at the time.  That was because some of the loans were incurred in quite recent times.  I am afraid that was a mistake.  I think that, unless you start afresh with the fishermen, there is no hope in respect of the old loans now hanging over them by the Department; that attempts by the Department to collect these loans as best they can will be ineffective.  I think it would be better if the fishermen were handed over to the Sea Fisheries Association lock, stock and barrel.  Let them be handed over to the association rather than have the Department looking to the fishermen or, perhaps, what is worse, looking to the fishermen's sureties to pay. Most of those who went surety for fishermen were persons who did not make one penny out of fishing themselves. They were local business men, teachers, doctors, and so on.  Whatever was to happen they would not have made anything out of the loans. <Col N="1612" /> These sureties were men whose names were good in the bank.  They went to the bank or to the Department as sureties for these fishermen.  If the fishermen made good, those sureties did not stand to gain one penny.  It is very hard luck on these men that they should be harassed now by being asked to liquidate these loans, especially when they have before their eyes the example of very many other sureties who had been relieved of their liabilities under the Remission of Loans Act.  I suggest to the Minister that he would put it to the Department of Finance that the Department would, once and for all get rid of those loans.  Let the Sea Fisheries Association get all they can from these men, hand them over as members of the association and let them pay out of the catch as other members of the association do.  That would save the Department a great deal of trouble and annoyance, and it would relieve many decent people along the western and southern seaboard, and indeed along the eastern seaboard, too, from what has become a very unfair burden.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about cured mackerel.  I would like now to refer in a few words to the market for fresh mackerel.  I understand that a bounty is provided for the export of cured mackerel.  That is not, in fact, of any great value now.  Our export of cured mackerel to Great Britain was never of any great consequence. Nearly all our mackerel in the past went to America.  That market is, to a great extent, dead. There is a market for fresh mackerel in Britain, but as far as I can gather there is no bounty to help our fresh mackerel in that market.  We import fresh fish free of tariff here, while our exports of fish to Britain have to carry a tariff.  Salmon may be able to carry a tariff.  Luxury fish of the type of salmon can carry a tariff but mackerel cannot.  Mackerel is a very important portion of the fishing industry.  Valentia Harbour always did a very big trade in fresh mackerel.  I put it to the Minister that that is a trade which should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> Putting the fishing industry on a solid basis is most important to the people of the seaboard.  I know, of course, that in doing that there will not be all fire crackers and all the glory that there is to be got in going down to one of our provincial towns, turning a key in a factory, and coming back to Dublin with a nice key for the china cupboard.  But there is a solid old Irish industry there.  For generations upon generations Valentia Harbour, the part at Cahirciveen, had a big trade in fresh mackerel with the London market and other centres. That market should be encouraged by a bounty on fresh mackerel.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry to hear the reference to the purification tank for mussels. It is a pity that this thing has been postponed so much.  If my recollection is right, I think this tank would cost only £5,000.  My recollection is that the erection of a purification tank on the lines of the tank at Conway in North Wales would cost something between £5,000 and £6,000 &mdash;something less than £6,000.  If that is so, it does seem absurd to postpone it.  That, I believe, is the suggestion that the Minister put to the House. I suggest to the Minister that the condition that is asked for by the Department of Finance is utterly ridiculous. If I understood him aright, what he said was this, that unless we secured beforehand some assurance from the British authorities that fish or mussels bearing the certificate of the Sea Fisheries Association will be allowed into the market without question, then we are not going to provide the £5,000 or £6,000 necessary for the erection of a purification tank.  Is that not absurd?</P>
    <P>After all, the persons we are concerned with are not the British Government.  If it were a matter of negotiation between this Government and the British Government, that might be a reasonable proposition; but the fact is that we are dealing with the medical officers in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and so on, medical officers in big industrial cities, and not with any British Government Department.  Does it not stand to reason, if we have a purification <Col N="1614" /> tank here on the lines of the Conway tank, that automatically the mussels that have been purified in that tank will be accepted by the medical officers in these various British centres because they will stand any test to which you put them? The Minister ought to appreciate that himself.  How could a medical officer give a free bill of health beforehand in regard to something he had not examined, and merely on the certificate of the Sea Fisheries Association, which, after all, is a body of laymen? There is not a medical officer on the board of the association, so far as I know.</P>
    <P>Very naturally each one of the medical officers will realise that once the mussels have gone through the purification tank they are all right.  After a little while the bacteriological examination of the mussels in these centres will be a very formal affair, I should say, once the medical officers are satisfied that the mussels have passed through the tank.  It is a ridiculous proposition that the Minister should ask such a certificate when the amount for the erection of a tank is such a small thing like £5,000 or £6,000. Surely it would not break us to embark on that expenditure and ensure thereby a very profitable market for a very poor class of our fishermen.  The men who engage in mussel-fishing are amongst the poorest of our population.  In my constituency they are very poor indeed.  They are from one point in the constituency, Cromane.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to see the Minister for Finance and tell him that the condition he has imposed is absurd, that no medical officer could possibly give a certificate of that kind beforehand, and that it was a thousand to one that the mussels which have gone through a purification tank will pass any bacteriological test that may be put up by any of the medical officers in the industrial centres.  They are not going to go out of their way to reject our mussels, because mussels are a very important portion of the dietary of the poor industrial workers in these areas.  They are not going to go out of their way to exclude mussels from <Col N="1615" /> the menu in those areas, and if they find, after half a dozen inspections of the mussels that have been through the tank, that they are free from the bacillus coli, there will be no difficulty in regard to future consignments.</P>

      <P>I do not desire to take up the Minister's time at any great length, but I wish to pass one or two comments on this Estimate.  I regret very much to see that the Estimate for inland fish hatcheries shows a decrease for this year&mdash;that is, for the year 1937-38.  At the same time, I am pleased to note that the grants to various boards of conservators remain in or about the same.  The Minister must be aware that there is no activity of the Department of Fisheries which gives more benefit to the country and does more good in a general way than the money allotted under the sub-heads to which I have referred, namely, the grants for inland fish hatcheries and the grants to boards of conservators.</P>
      <P>In connection with the boards of conservators, I am almost certain that the Minister must have had some representations from the Blackwater Board in relation to the Lismore weir. If that weir were controlled by the Minister, I am sure it would not be the menace it is to-day to the fishing on the Blackwater.  If that weir were nationally controlled, or if some arrangement could be arrived at between the Duke of Devonshire and the Minister&mdash;perhaps if the Minister would approach him in his usual manner such an arrangement could be arrived at&mdash;it would confer an inestimable boon on the local fishermen and sportsmen and would add considerably to the attractions and value of the Blackwater and its tributaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would give the House some indication as to whether or not he will receive a deputation from the riparian owners on the Blackwater, whose interests are very seriously affected by the weir at Lismore.  I subscribe to a lot of what has been said by Deputy Lynch in relation to the care that was bestowed many years ago on some private fisheries and the neglect that has taken place over recent years.  But I <Col N="1616" /> do not quite agree with him as to the causes, because the Minister must be aware that many of those riparian owners find themselves in a very extraordinary position; in many cases they do not know what rights to the river they have; in other cases where the riparian rights have been purchased the tenants find themselves, owing to economic conditions, in a very bad way.  I know of several fisheries which are to be had quite cheaply and which formerly were let at a fairly high rental.  Indeed, they can now be had in many cases for merely paying the rates.  I can supply the Minister with numbers of cases of the character I have indicated.  I have actually been offered fishing in exchange for paying the rates on the fisheries, fisheries which, to my own knowledge, were let at anything from £150 to £300 for the season previously.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to say that, with regard to the weir at Lismore, many years ago a well-known and even famous authority on fisheries, the late Henry Ffennell, Scottish Inspector of Fisheries, was employed by the Board of Conservators to look into the question of Lismore weir, and he stated, amongst other things&mdash;I do not wish to quote now all the things he said&mdash;that he had come to the conclusion that it would be no exaggeration to say that the weir presents as formidable a barrier to the ascent of fish as it is possible to conceive, while the Queen's Gap may, without any hesitation or reservation, be pronounced to be an absolute farce.  I could-quote from the late Judge H. D. Conner, with whose Fishery Acts the Minister must be conversant, but most fishermen, who take any interest at all in the stocking of our rivers, know that, amongst other things, Judge Conner urged that the only way to deal with such cases as arise, due to the existence of this weir, was to empower the Department's inspectors with authority to inspect all weirs and salmon passes from time to time and to hold inquiries and to issue such instructions to weir owners as would cause every gap to conform with the Acts and become a genuine free pass for salmon.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear the <Col N="1617" /> Minister say that he does not propose to introduce legislation, for some time, at any rate, dealing with such matters.  Possibly, by that, he means until after the general election.  I regret very much that he cannot see fit to introduce at an early date the necessary legislation, based, to some extent, on the report on inland fisheries, which was issued some time ago.  With much of that report I find myself in agreement, but there are many other portions of it with which I do not find myself in agreement. In that connection, I should like&mdash;I do not want to use the word &ldquo;warn&rdquo;&mdash;but I should like to urge upon the Minister to have no regard whatsoever to the suggestions made in a part of the report that a 5/- licence should be imposed per rod on trout anglers.  There are two matters in which I feel a deep personal interest, and that is No. 1. The other is the fact that, to fish for white trout, one must have a salmon licence.  Let us take the question of this 5/- licence that is suggested. We have endeavoured, and every sportsman in this country has endeavoured, to make this country as much of an angler's paradise as we can possibly make it.  One of the biggest attractions in this country to visiting tourists, and to visiting sportsmen especially, is to find that most of our brown trout fishing is free. That is an asset which, I do hope, will not be in any way affected, and I sincerely hope that it will not be affected in the way proposed in one of the recommendations in that report, namely, to impose a 5/- licence on anglers fishing for brown trout.</P>
    <P>There is a very large and growing number of persons going in for fishing for trout.  I think it is a thing that should be encouraged.  I feel we should rejoice to see so many of our young people making for the country on Sundays and holidays and enjoying themselves on the river bank. In that connection, it must be remembered that many trout anglers bring their sons with them, and if they are compelled to pay this 5/- licence per rod, many of these people will find themselves unable to do so.  I hope <Col N="1618" /> the Minister will appreciate that, when these men bring their children along with them on Sunday mornings or on holidays, they usually bring rods for the children also; and if any Act is passed in which a provision of that kind is included&mdash;namely, to impose a 5/- tax per rod on trout fishing&mdash;it will cause inestimable damage to fishing generally because I do know that in many cases rivers may be poisoned at their very source, and it will be a tax that will be very difficult to collect and, in my view, it will be a most objectionable tax to put on that class of sport.</P>
    <P>Now, there is also the question of the £2 licence that is expected from a man who fishes for white trout. I am speaking, if you like, from an uninterested point of view, because I hold a salmon licence for two areas, namely, from the Board of Conservators of the River Lee and also for the Blackwater.  I know that the Minister has no control over the fact that any salmon angler, leaving one conservator's district and going into another, has got to pay 10/- for every other district in which he fishes.</P>
    <P>As I just mentioned, I may have to add to that list, as I have before, towards the end of the season, and that is a grievance.  However, as I feel that the Minister has no control over that, I do not wish to urge it upon him, but I do urge upon him the necessity of reducing that £2 licence for white trout.  Many of these anglers go fishing for brown trout, and they occasionally hook a white trout or a salmon trout, and if they are caught they will be hauled up and fined.  Cases such as that have happened, where men went out to fish for brown trout and caught a white trout by accident, and they are then fined for having caught the white trout.  I urge upon the Minister that he should do something in that connection.  If it requires legislation, as I know it will, I would urge upon him to consider that aspect of the case.  Principally I want him, if and when he is framing fishery legislation, not to allow himself to be influenced by a certain number of people in the country who want to inflict this fine of <Col N="1619" /> 5/- on a number of persons who can ill afford to pay it.  I am speaking, as I say, as one who knows sufficient about the sport and about the people who take part in the sport.  I do hope that the Minister will bear that in mind, and I would also ask him, when replying, although perhaps this is not the appropriate time to make the request, to tell us that he will receive a deputation who would go fully into the matter of the weir at Lismore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Fisheries Estimate, Sir, we are dealing with an industry that is practically disappearing altogether from the Irish shores.  I am referring now completely to sea fisheries.  That industry, to a great extent, and particularly in the last few years, has been a fadeout. In fact, latterly it is becoming almost what is called, in the language of the films, a black-out, and shortly, as I said last year, there will be no necessity to bring in an Estimate for fisheries, because the fishing industry will not be of such a nature as to warrant any expenditure on it.  Paradoxical as it may seem to advocate it, I do advocate that more money ought to be spent on this matter, and, instead of looking for £41,749 for what ought to be a very important matter, I think that this matter ought to be grasped and grappled with in a very big way.</P>
      <P>For many years past, under the British régime and under the Government that previously held office in this country, our fisheries seemed to decline but I think that the decline has been much more marked for the last few years than it has been for any similar period previously.  In spite of this decline in the industry, there is an increase in the cost of administration. There is a small increase in the number of salaried persons and in the amount of travelling expenses.  The increase in the general administrative cost is £1,115.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the figures in connection with the industry, we shall see very clearly the effect that the Fianna Fáil administration has had on this important industry.  In 1931 the total <Col N="1620" /> quantity of fish landed was value for £223,074 and in 1935 the value of fish landed had decreased to £163,298, that is a decrease in the five years of £59,776.  A curious thing is that while in the year 1935, the amount of fish landed by our fishermen was value only for £163,298, we imported for consumption in this island of ours, a country with the biggest coastline in proportion to its size to any nation in Europe, fish to the value of £264,953, very nearly double the value of the fish caught and landed here.  There has also been a terrible decline in the number of boats engaged in the industry. In 1931, the last year of the Cosgrave Government, the number of boats engaged in fishing was 3,634 and in 1935 that number had fallen to 2,834.  That is a decline of practically 25 per cent., a decline of 800 boats. That included boats that were engaged in part-time fishing and boats engaged in whole-time fishing.  The number of men employed fell from 11,926 in 1931 to 9,072 in 1935.  That is a decrease of 2,854 men.  Only about one-third of these men are regularly employed, that is men who spend their whole time at the industry and have no other occupation or calling except that of fishing.  So that in this great maritime country of ours we have less than 3,000 men employed as whole-time fishermen. Certainly there is something wrong in an industry that we speak of as one of our most important industries, an industry that should be next in importance to agriculture, when it can only employ less than 3,000 men in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, speaking on this Estimate, told us that we should have no interest in trying to develop sea fisheries on the lines of the big trawler system, that we should go out to develop inshore fishing.  He gave as his reasons that if we had trawlers on the lines of the big commercial concerns we would not be able to handle the fish in the first place, and, in the second place, we would not be able to dispose of their catches, because the Irish people are very particular about the quality of the fish they eat and also about the quantity of fish they eat.  Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of the people of this <Col N="1621" /> country are Roman Catholics, they eat fish very sparingly.  We are not a fish-loving people.  There seems, on the contrary, to be an inexhaustible demand for fish in other countries and particularly on the other side of the Channel.  It may, perhaps, be out of order to refer to the economic war in this respect, but it does affect our fisheries very seriously.  There are certain classes of fish caught at certain times of the year which we cannot absorb on our markets.  I would particularly refer to shell-fish.  On the south-west coast, during the winter season, fishing is carried on for shell-fish known as scallops.  About 250 men are employed in the worst months of the year in this particular branch of the industry.  Fishing begins in November and comes to an end in February.  The men engaged earn very sorely indeed the little remuneration they get from that fishing.  There is no local trade, no home trade, for that fish.  The fish is caught only for the British market, but there is an import duty upon it.  I think the Minister refunds one-third of the tariff on shell-fish.  I would suggest to the Minister that, particularly in regard to periwinkles and scallops, he ought in all cases to give a bounty equal to the tariff.  The amount involved would be very small as far as the National Exchequer is concerned, but it would mean a very big thing indeed to the poor men along these coasts who have to depend for a living during the winter months on that precarious class of fishing.</P>
    <P>Speaking about our inshore fishing, it is very difficult to see how inshore fishing can ever be developed unless some protection is provided.  The best means by which that protection can be afforded is a matter that has never seriously occupied the attention of any Ministry here.  We have the Muirchú, of course.  She is costing us from £8,000 to £10,000 each year, but she is certainly no good from the point of doing anything effective to keep off the marauding trawlers which were so eloquently referred to by Fianna Fáil Deputies when they were in opposition.  The problem with which the Fianna Fáil Government has to <Col N="1622" /> deal in this respect is the same problem with which we had to deal, and I am sure that Fianna Fáil Deputies, though they are so silent now, appreciate the difficulties as much as we do.  Everyone who lives in a maritime county, those Deputies especially who know West Kerry, where conditions are similar to those in my own district, wishes to see this problem tackled in a practical manner. I put it to the Minister last year that to defend these coasts properly&mdash;I am not using the word &ldquo;defend&rdquo; in any extreme sense&mdash;we must have more than one boat.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should have at least four boats, four good-sized boats, which would patrol the coast in four divisions from Donegal right round to Carlingford Lough.  These boats should be of such a size that they would be able to put to sea at a time when a good-sized trawler could put to sea.  They must be able to get out to sea quickly and they must be manned by a good class of sailor.  Here I come to an important point: would it not be much better if our Government had four boats of this kind manned by, say, 20 young fellows&mdash;that would mean the employment of 80 to 100 young fellows altogether&mdash;who could be given a proper training at sea, than to have these young boys drawing the dole and standing at the street corners in our towns?  It would be giving some of them a taste for the sea.  It would be training them to take an interest in sea work, which might become very useful to them afterwards as deep-sea fishermen or deep-sea sailors.</P>
    <P>Having done that, you are up against another problem.  I think it is evident to most people who have studied inshore fish habits that the fish are receding each year; they are going further out.  The men sometimes have not got the boats and gear to follow them, and when they have they are up against the trouble of the marauding trawlers.  At the present time there is no power to keep anybody off our waters to a greater extent than three miles.  Being now a nation in every sense of the word, and enjoying our own sovereignty, we cannot frighten anybody off further than three miles according to international law. <Col N="1623" /> Anybody interested in fishing will understand that three miles are absolutely no protection whatever.  We must have some arrangement by which we will be able to protect a greater depth of coastline than three miles. Some time ago some persons who had studied this problem said that you must get the big trawlers kept 15 miles outside.  We do not ask that; we are not going to ask the Minister to do impossibilities, but it is a question that might be tackled in an international way, in conjunction and by arrangement with other countries interested in fishing, who might have as big an interest in preserving the spawning beds as we Irish people would have in preserving them for our own interest.  Latterly an international arrangement was come to and a commission sat, I think, in London on which our Board of Fisheries was represented. I think they came to a unanimous agreement in the end with regard to certain sizes of meshes and certain nets.  They also came to a conclusion regarding the taking of small or immature fish.  If we can arrange with other countries on those very important points for the preservation of fish, I think we should be able to deal with them on the still more important matter of preserving our territorial waters, and try to get from those other countries a promise that they would not encroach beyond a point which would ensure to our inshore fishermen at least some sort of livelihood from their efforts.  I think I have dealt sufficiently fully with that mater.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Finian Lynch, I was very sorry to see that there has been a cutting down of the amount for boats and gear in the Sea Fisheries Association part of the Vote.  I think our men ought to be encouraged to a greater extent to get up-to-date boats and gear.  Like Deputy Lynch, I would ask the Minister to make a clean sweep of the legacy in regard to old debts which, perhaps, Deputy Lynch himself left behind in the Department. I have been interesting myself in a lot of them, and I am sure the Department will know that in cases <Col N="1624" /> where I found any money could be got I was able to give them some information by which the debts could be considered good, and by which an arrangement could be made to have them settled on some compromise. Where there was no use in trying to get the money, I also told the Department that it was better to write off the debt.  I think the time has come &mdash;after all the assiduous care that the Department of Fisheries and the State Solicitor have taken to get in those debts&mdash;to write them off as bad debts, and not to continue carrying them on in their books as something still due. The fishermen must get a chance. Although they did their very best to pay those debts, unfortunately, the times and circumstances went against them.  The fish disappeared, the boats became out-of-date, and the debts remained unpaid.  I would appeal to the Minister to do what he possibly can to extend his consideration to those men, at least 80 or 90 per cent. of whom honestly intended to pay those debts if they were able to do so.</P>
    <P>Speaking about inshore fishermen, I said that the amount of fish which were landed was only £163,293 worth. Taking the total number of fishermen engaged, both regularly and casually, that works out at £18 per man per annum, or the large sum of 7/- per week.  I think it is a terrible reflection on the Department and on this industry to say that the greatest remuneration which the sea fisheries of this country can afford to those engaged on them is the magnificent sum of 7/- per week.  I think it should be the aim of the Minister to do something better than that. As I said, this Department has been getting worse and worse; although I say the Department, I mean the results of the industry rather than the Department.  The Minister probably does not know much about fishing, as we have ceased to have a real Minister for Fisheries.  As was said, the word &ldquo;Fisheries&rdquo; has disappeared from the nomenclature of our Ministers.  We have no such thing. It is tacked on to a Minister like the Minister for Agriculture, who is <Col N="1625" /> already so overworked and whose office is so overcrowded with activities that he is unable to pay any proper attention to such an important matter as fisheries.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to do what in him lies to put more energy into this work, to exercise more imagination, and to try to realise the possibilities of this industry.  Do not run away from the difficulties of it.  Try to grapple with them.  Good men in the past have been beaten, I will admit, in trying to put the fisheries of Ireland on a proper basis, but I say that they were never on a more unsatisfactory basis than they are on at the present time.  If anything at all can be done in the future, surely to God the next change will be something for the better, because worse they cannot be than they are.  I would ask the Minister then to do what he possibly can by getting together more specialised knowledge with regard to this matter; by getting men expert in this important industry, men who have had experience in the industry, business men with business ideas, to see how it can be worked.  If I were the Minister for Finance in this country, I would act on the assumption that the country can well afford to try the experiment of spending a large sum of money on this fishery industry, so that we might see, once and for all, whether anything can be made of it.  If we fail, in God's name let it be a magnificent failure; let us be able to say that we have done our best to do something for this really important and basic industry, which would mean so much to the very poorest of our people, people who would have a good livelihood at their very doors if only something could be done to afford them in this industry the protection that a Government Department should be able to afford.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Neill referred to the point made by Deputy Lynch, namely that those arrears should have been wiped out. I am glad that Deputy O'Neill admitted that Deputy Finian Lynch, as Minister of the previous Government, had to insist on the full amount being paid and the full deposits being made <Col N="1626" /> available.  As Minister, it was his duty to insist on that system, and insist on those amounts being forthcoming. Now that he is in opposition, it is more popular to come along and say that they should be wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>On a matter of correction, in 1931 Deputy Lynch brought in a special Act to wipe out the biggest part of those arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that neither Deputy O'Neill nor Deputy Lynch can have it both ways. As a Government, they had to insist on those moneys being paid.  Now, when they are in opposition, because they seem to think it is more popular, they suggest the wiping out of those arrears.  I should like to point out that for years, since we became the Government, as representatives of the people we have tried to gain concessions from the Department of Fisheries in regard to the payment of those arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the officials concerned have given us every facility, but the agreements entered into under the previous Government have to be honoured and the moneys made available.  At the same time I think it is imperative on the Department and on the State to make some concession. In view of the conditions prevailing, I would suggest that there should be some writing off in regard to the arrears mentioned by Deputy O'Neill. The people in the area that I represent find it very difficult either to pay the instalments or to pay off the arrears due.  An important matter affecting our area is this question with regard to mussels.  This has been going on for years, and we have been agitating for a revision of the whole system.  I think it is up to our Government to regard this as a national question.  It is a matter that requires negotiation as between our Government and the British Government.  It is not a question of experiments or of one area against another area.  It is a question calling for direct negotiation so that some arrangement may be arrived at with the British medical authorities under which they will <Col N="1627" /> recognise the certificate of the Sea Fisheries Association.  We have suggested various methods of dealing with that problem, but perhaps the Minister could arrange that something definite would be done through the High Commissioner in London whereby, with the help of the British medical authorities, a scheme of co-operation might be devised in regard to the export of mussels from this country.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised with regard to the cost.  I have already suggested to the Sea Fisheries Association that the principle that should be adopted for the erection of these tanks was to have them in the districts where the industry is important to the people concerned.  In Cromane, part of the area in County Kerry that I represent, the people there are altogether dependent for at least six months of the year on this mussel industry.  Approximately, 100 families are dependent on the livelihood that is to be gained from it.  As far as they are concerned, it is of vital importance that this sterilisation system should be got under way.  At the same time, I must say that I realise the Minister has done everything in his power, and that the Department is co-operating with a view to getting over the difficulty experienced there.  As I said before, this question has now reached the stage when it is one of national importance.  Several areas are concerned. The British medical authorities are not acting as a united body in regard to it, and different opinions are held in different centres.  Different areas are controlled by different medical authorities.  In view of those difficulties, the question is one for negotiation between the two Governments. Eventually I think that is how the matter will have to be dealt with.  While I say that, I think the Department should also take steps with a view to developing a trade with France and Belgium.  Perhaps if inquiries were made something could be done in the matter of the export of mussels to those countries.  I mention that to the Minister especially in view of the fact that he proposes to introduce legislation at an early date in regard to the inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> The question of the inland fisheries is a very important one.  I refer to it now because I see an item in the Estimates making provision for a certain sum of money for boards of conservators.  I think they are doing very little, if anything at all, in the way of protective duty.  So far as the rivers in the area that I come from are concerned, the amount of protective duty that is being done is nil.  I think that these boards of conservators are more or less glorified institutions and are of no use.  The money that is voted to them is not productive of any results.  It is an admitted fact that the protection of the spawning fish in the inland rivers has failed.  Our only hope now with regard to the inland fisheries lies in the new Bill which the Minister proposes to bring forward.  I am sure it will be of great advantage both to the owners and fishermen concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker has raised some interesting issues on this Vote.  I propose to deal first with his concluding remarks.  Did I understand him correctly to say that the spawning beds have not been protected in the inland rivers?  If that is so, I wish to join issue with him on that, because I think that his remarks amount to an undeserved reflection on the Civic Guards and the bailiffs employed by the boards of conservators. Anybody who knows anything about the protection of our rivers must be well aware that in recent years the protection of them shows a marked improvement.  Those who remember the conditions that prevailed 20, 30 and 40 years ago as regards poaching, must be well aware that at the present day poaching, in the main, has disappeared, all due to the activities of the bailiffs appointed by the conservators and of the Civic Guards.  Therefore what the Deputy said was, in my opinion, a slander on those people. We have got a new issue&mdash;this much-discussed tank.  I thought it had passed out of public memory altogether, but it has been revived to-night by Deputy Flynn as a national question.  This, I suppose, is another new issue for the general election to placate the public down in Kerry. That is another good weapon to use <Col N="1629" /> against the I.R.A. in Kerry at the general election.  What is the use of talking about a disinfecting tank? The whole thing is a sham.  The Minister for Finance will say: &ldquo;Of course I will not sanction the money for this until the Minister for Agriculture gets a guarantee from the British Government that the fish which have been put into the tank will be admitted as a right into Great Britain.&rdquo;  Everybody knows that could not be done. The British Government could not do it.  Every local medical officer of health is supreme in his own area with regard to the protection of the members of the community for whom he is responsible. This is merely eyewash.  Let us blot it out as nonsense.</P>
      <P>It has been stated by some people that our fishing industry is dead, and by others that a huge sum of money should be voted and spent on our fisheries either to win or lose.  The reduction of £4,000 for the Sea Fisheries Association answers the whole case.  What is the cause of that?  That with international quotas everywhere fish cannot be sold except within the shores of the country in which they are landed.  Hence it becomes a Departmental and Governmental affair as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  There is no use in talking about spending money. Spending money is sheer waste until the Government take action to procure a market for the fish and we can export fish.  Have the Government done anything for the industry, and, if they have, what is it?  Why are our fishermen not fishing?  In Donegal fishermen are not fishing for the same reason that people are leaving the land, because it does not pay.  What is the use of buying boats from the Sea Fisheries Association and going to sea and bringing fish ashore when there is no market for them?  It would be all right, of course, if you voted public money to pay wages to these fishermen for fishing, and then dump the fish wherever you like.  Under the present conditions, to think of putting the industry on an economic basis is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position?  Last year <Col N="1630" /> Germany took 800,000 barrels of cured herrings from Great Britain.  I have said some rather rude things about the Germans and how they should be treated, and I am not ashamed to repeat them.  I do not wish to be offensive to the German people, but my way of treating a German would be this&mdash;stand on his toe and keep standing on it until he apologises. That is the only way to make him sit up.  A statement was published earlier in the year that a quota had been got for our fish in the German market. What quantity of fish has been taken by Germany?  What kind of herring are they taking&mdash;the winter or autumn or matje herring in May?  The quota is from April to June or July. That implies that if they are going to take any herring they are going to take the matje herring.  As a matter of fact, they do not want any matje herring in the German market&mdash;they want the large herring.  Therefore, the quota which we got is entirely useless.  That was a very loose bargain to make&mdash;in fact, it was no bargain at all.</P>
    <P>We are buying a lot of things from Germany.  We have been very good to the German nation and spend a lot of money in Germany.  Germany got one of the biggest contracts that this small State ever gave away in connection with hydraulic electrical development. They did not get any contract like that from the British Government, and England is a powerful industrial nation and has enormous contracts to give away.  I think the Germans should show us some consideration for what we have taken from them.  We are still buying large quantities of equipment for our electrical works in Germany, and we are buying lots of other things.  Because it suits Herr Hitler to get cheap fats now, he wants butter and fat cattle from us.  The German people have been rationed on fats since the middle of December last, and no German citizen can get more than four ounces of fats per week.  That is due to the national policy that Herr Hitler is pursuing.  Why should we be drawn at the tail of Herr Hitler?  Why should not the Minister for Agriculture and his advisers in this matter look after the interests of their citizens <Col N="1631" /> just as Herr Hitler is looking after the interests of his citizens?  Why did not the Minister demand, when these negotiations were going on, that which would suit the special and particular interests of our citizens?</P>
    <P>That is what Herr Hitler is doing in dealing with our Government.  If Herr Hitler is not prepared to meet us in that, there should be no business done with him.  Our cattle and butter can be sold elsewhere.  We have now a market elsewhere for all the cattle we have to sell.  Apparently, as far as the Minister is concerned, this whole question revolves round the German market.  What is coming out of it?  How many barrels of herrings have been sold to Germany this year?  Possibly, not more than ten barrels.  And that is an international trade agreement!</P>
    <P>Along the coast in my constituency there was at one time considerable white fishing, but that has gone, particularly around the peninsula of Inishowen.  Of course, Lough Foyle fishing has gone entirely.  On the western coast the people complain that the considerable white fishing that they had has gone.  There are reasons that I should like to mention, but as I might involve other questions, I shall not do so now.  They say that these French trawlers come right in and sweep away the white fishing.  I wish the Minister would look into that.  As a matter of fact, I was sent a copy of a memorandum that had been sent to the Department and I am sure, after what has been said, that the Department will look into the matter.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister for intervening at this stage of the debate.  I did not intend to speak, but some things were said by Deputies on the opposite benches to which I want to reply.  I listened to quotations that were read from the Official Debates of speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies when we were in opposition.  I was not a member of the House then, but I wish to endorse everything contained in these speeches.  They are just as apropos to-day as they were at that time. <Col N="1632" /> With regard to the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; I expressed my views about that boat last year.  I wish to repeat them now, and to go even further.  I know that only for the influence of the Civic Guards in several cases those on the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; would have let these poachers go.  In my opinion, there is some sinister influence behind the whole matter.  Where it rests I do not know.  A good many interesting things were said regarding the Sea Fisheries Association, and there were references to the deposits.  The Deputy who spoke about the deposit was at one time Minister for Fisheries and was, to a large extent, responsible for the formulation of the rules of that association when it was founded. A certain period of time was laid down within which it was possible to get boats without a deposit, and, when that period was up, payment of the deposit had to be enforced. The then Minister was responsible for that.  The committee of the association was worked by people with a certain outlook, and they supplied boats to people with a certain outlook, while parts of the coast were ignored or neglected.  I refer particularly to Galway and Mayo.  The views of the fishermen were also ignored at that time as to the size of the boats.  They were not consulted in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a passing reference to some other matters in which I am interested.  One of the things that has been recommended is that all the debts of the Department should be handed over to the Sea Fisheries Association. That association contained an element of good.  It did not contain much good, and I am quite satisfied that it was not adequate for the job.  In my opinion, it could not succeed owing to the interference of the Department of Fisheries.  That Department wants to hand over all the ugly jobs to the association, and, at the same time, wants to maintain its influence over the association.  The association is not getting the autonomy to which it is entitled.  Deputy Dillon and other Deputies stated that there should be a periodical wiping out of debts and a fresh start made.  A similar statement, I think, was made <Col N="1633" /> by two Fine Gael Deputies.  That suggestion explains certain developments in parts of the country in connection with the deposit.  It is quite easy in certain parts to get deposits on the boats, but no further payments are made.  Apparently the fishermen have been told that another revision of loans will be brought along periodically&mdash;to review them and wipe them out.  I think it is not fair of public men&mdash;particularly men who are prominent leaders of the Party&mdash;to make these statements in regard to loans, and to hold out to the fishermen the hope that there would be periodical revision of the loans.  It suggests to them that they can get their boats by paying the minimum and getting away with the rest.  In my opinion that proposal suggests an absence of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch stated that the present Government had removed the independence of the fishermen from the cognomen of the Minister.  The removal process began when he was Minister, and it was expressed by the formation of the association.  The formation of the Sea Fisheries Association was an admission of failure on the part of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  They did not want to be responsible for the fishing industry so they handed it over to a semi-Government co-operative society.  That society might have done a little more than it has done, but it was prevented from doing so from the beginning by the muddling interference of the Department. If the Minister had, on this question of loans, a full scrutiny made of the operations of the Revision of Loans Act, 1931, he would be very much surprised at some of the decisions that were made.  I invite him to have that scrutiny made.  I do not envy the Minister his job.  In my opinion, he has a hopeless task.  I do not like saying so&mdash;I do so reluctantly &mdash;but I consider that a large part of <Col N="1634" /> the fault rests with the Department over which he presides.</P>

      <P>A good deal of nonsense was repeated by certain Deputies, particularly about the German trade agreement.  One of the complaints of the Opposition was that Germany could select what she would take from us but that we could not select what we would take from Germany.  The opposite is the case.  In the German trade agreement the Germans must take a percentage of everything we have but, as far as we are concerned, we may buy what we like from them. That was not how it was put by Deputy Dillon, who was slavishly followed by Deputy McMenamin.  I thought Deputy McMenamin knew something about fisheries, but he went on to say that we could only export matje herrings to Germany.  On the other hand, Deputy Dillon asked if we could arrange for the export of other herrings to Germany because they were the only things that mattered. We had two Deputies sitting for constituencies in the same country, one entirely ignorant of the question and the other not much better, making different suggestions.  I do not think it possible to deal with many of the points which were raised now.</P>
