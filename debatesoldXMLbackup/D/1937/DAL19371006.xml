    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1922" hpid="Mr. Wm. O'Brien Mr. Wm. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wm. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether, in view of the peaceful state of the country, the Executive Council are prepared to extend an amnesty to all persons who have been convicted of political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy refers to persons who were convicted by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.</P>
      <P>There are at present 19 such persons in custody, including one who was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death, but whose sentence was commuted by the Executive Council to penal servitude for life.  Twelve others were convicted of crimes of violence such as attempted murder, shooting with intent to do grievous bodily harm, unlawful use of firearms, assault, kidnapping. Of the remaining six, four were convicted of the unlawful possession of firearms.  Two of the 19 prisoners were sentenced for membership of an unlawful association.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's duty to preserve the public peace and protect the lives and property of all the citizens. Where they are satisfied that the release of a prisoner would be consistent with that duty, they are, and always have been, fully prepared to give his case due consideration.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the fact that the Prices Tribunal have furnished to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a report with respect to charges for building materials?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has had that in his possession for two years, and will the Minister for Local Government be sufficiently inquisitive to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what is contained in that report, because I think he will find some striking allegations there?</P>

      <P>As regards part (a) of the question, I have received notification from every board of health that purchase schemes have been prepared under the Labourers Act, 1936, and the following boards of health have submitted schemes, viz., Cavan, Clare, Cork (North), Cork (South), Cork (West), Donegal, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laoighis, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary (North), Tipperary (South), Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.  As to (b), the submitted schemes are being examined in my Department.  Approval has not been given as yet to any scheme.  As to (c), <Col N="37" /> no cottages have been transferred to occupiers as the schemes have not come into force.  As to (d), the annuities appear to be based on 75 per cent. of the existing rents except in some abnormal cases which have been the subject of special recommendations by the boards of health.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has received a memorial from the parents of the children affected, in one case fatally, after preventive inoculation against diphtheria at Ring Irish College, County Waterford; and if, in view of the serious nature of this affair, he will order an official inquiry to determine responsibility for the occurrence, and to provide, if necessary, adequate compensation for the parents concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in accordance with the policy and recommendations of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, a number of children were given immunisation treatment at Ring Irish College, County Waterford, in November of last year; that some time afterwards 24 of those children showed signs of serious infection, which later proved to be tubercular in character; that one of the children died on 20th April last, and at the subsequent coroner's inquest it was disclosed that the serum with which they were injected contained living tubercle bacilli; and if he has received any representations from the parents of these children asking that the Department of Local Government and Public Health should actively interest itself in investigating the cause of the disaster that befell so many children as the result of treatment given them in accordance with the policy of the Department, and what steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware (1) that as a result <Col N="38" /> of an anti-diphtheritic immunisation carried out at Ring in November, 1936, one child has died and 23 children have been infected with tuberculosis; (2) whether he received a memorial dated 31st August, 1937, signed by the parents of the children who were affected by the anti-diphtheritic immunisation referred to, and, if so, what action has been taken in reference to such memorial, and in particular: (a) whether an inquiry has been held; (b) whether if no inquiry has been held it is intended to hold one; and (c) whether special precautions have been taken since the circumstances came to the knowledge of the Minister to direct attention to the dangers associated with such operations, and to secure proper precautions being taken against a repetition of the occurrence referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention was called to the findings of the coroner's jury that investigated the death of Siobhan Ní Cháonnthaolaidh at Scoil na Leanbh, Ring, County Waterford, on April 20th, 1937; whether he is aware the jury found as a fact that in her case death was due to toxemia and purpuric hæmorrhage resulting from tuberculosis infection occasioned by the inoculation of prophylactic supplied by an English firm of chemists; whether, arising out of this incident, he has been petitioned by the parents of 24 children similarly affected by toxemia to inquire into the matter and make reparation to them for the loss and suffering occasioned by their children, and the expense in which the parents were involved; and, if so, whether he will state what action he has taken or proposes to take in regard to the petition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions numbers 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts set out in the four foregoing questions are generally in accordance with the information obtained by my Department.  I met recently a deputation from the parents of the children and the position was very fully and frankly discussed.  That <Col N="39" /> such an occurrence should take place has been a matter of very great concern to me, but as I explained to the deputation I have no power to direct an inquiry into the matter as the inoculation of the children in Ring College did not form part of an official scheme of immunisation against diphtheria approved by my Department. The inoculation was carried out as a private arrangement with the authorities of the college, and I cannot intervene in regard to the treatment of private patients by a medical practitioner. I told the deputation, however, that I am prepared to consider any proposals for affording specialised treatment for the children that are submitted to me through local authorities. As far as practicable precautions have been taken to secure that no occurrence of a similar nature will take place.</P>
    <P>I feel the greatest sympathy for the parents of the child that died and the parents of the other children who have been caused such unnecessary suffering and I am anxious that everything possible should be done to hasten the recovery of the children who are still affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the President (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the Minister, having regard to the very valuable national work done by the college at Ring, whether it is a fact that the college authorities were in no way negligent and were in no way in fault in reference to this unfortunate occurrence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is perfectly true, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the President states, that the college authorities were in no way negligent; that they took every precaution in the usual way and that the medical officer who acted for them took the usual precautions to see that the work should not have the unfortunate results it had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister perfectly satisfied that conditions in the college are hygienic and that the college is in every way properly equipped so far as sanitary arrangements are concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no personal knowledge of the college for many years.  It is a good many years ago since I visited the college.  I understand that the college is now an entirely new place and quite different from what it was then.  I am satisfied from what I know of the college and from my personal knowledge of the headmaster and the staff that everything that is requisite from the point of view of securing proper sanitation and hygiene is well looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister correctly when I understood him to say that this immunisation did not arise out of a practice encouraged and approved of by his Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister again to read the answer with reference to part of this question.  I do not think I heard him correctly. Did he say that this practice of immunisation is not part of the practice of his Department or that it was not encouraged or inaugurated by the Local Government Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely different matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes I will reread the answer or part of the answer.  Here it is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" />&ldquo;That such an occurrence should take place has been a matter of very great concern to me, but, as I explained to the deputation, I have no power to direct an inquiry into the matter as the inoculation of the children in Ring College did not form part of an official scheme of immunisation against diphtheria approved by my Department.

The staff of inspectors has, however, been continuously increased since that time with the result that the percentage of inspections was between 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. in 1935 and 1936, and it is hoped that in the current year the percentage of inspections will show still further improvement.</P>

That body was informed that before granting or refusing a new manufacture licence, regard must be had to the provisions of Clause 6 of the Control of Manufactures Regulations, 1932, and that as the requirements of the country in the manufacture of biscuits were being provided for adequately by existing manufacturers, I was not prepared to grant a licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions relative to the case of John Lavelle (Ned).  The facts are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An undivided share of commonage on the Leslie Elliott estate, acquired by the Land Commission as untenanted land, was allotted to John Lavelle (Ned) on the 8th March, 1927, at a rent of £2, being 4¾ per cent. interest on £42, of which £7 represented the resale price of the land and £35 an advance for building purposes.  To supplement this advance a free grant not to exceed the sum of £75 was also sanctioned as building assistance. Following representations from the allottees that they held grazing rights over the commonage, the price of £7 apportioned on the shares of the commonage was reduced as from the date of allotment to a nominal price of 1/-, leaving Mr. Lavelle liable for a rent of £1 13s. 4d., equivalent to interest on the advance of £35 only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building materials to the value of £65 1s. 10d. were supplied to Mr. Lavelle from the Land Commission store at Achill Sound in 1928, and a cash payment of £14 18s. 2d. was made <Col N="65" /> to him in 1930, making a total expenditure of £80.  It is the practice of the Land Commission when advances and free grants are sanctioned for buildings to expend first the advance sanctioned and afterwards the Free Grant.  Mr. Lavelle has, therefore, received the equivalent of an advance of £35 and a free grant of £45.</P>
    <P>No payment whatever in respect of interest on the advance was made by Mr. Lavelle up to 1936 and a warrant was accordingly issued and the debt then due collected.</P>
    <P>The agreement for letting for temporary convenience originally executed, providing for the payment of a rent of £2, was signed by Mr. Lavelle in the presence of a Land Commission inspector.  The agreement for letting for temporary convenience, providing for the payment of the reduced rent of £1 13s. 4d., was signed by Mr. Lavelle on the 11th March, 1935, also in the presence of a Land Commission inspector.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice of the Land Commission unless requested to do so to supply copies of agreements to allottees.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have no evidence that the illness of Mrs. Lavelle was in any way due to the execution of the warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move, that this Bill be now read a second time.  During the discussion in the House of the Draft Constitution, which has lately been enacted by the people, Article 12, which deals with the office of President was fully debated, and the fundamental provisions relating to the office, that is to say, the qualification of a person to be President, the nomination of a candidate for election and the franchise and voting are all set out in the Article of the Constitution to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>This Bill, therefore, contains the provisions which are in the nature of rules for carrying the provisions of the Constitution into effect and for regulating the nomination of candidates and, where necessary, the taking of a poll. The procedure for the election of a President of Ireland, as outlined in the Constitution, is a new thing for which there is no analogy in present or former legislation; parts of that procedure closely resemble different parts of procedure in relation to other elections; but taken as a whole, it is a procedure for which no model exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is divided into three parts: Part I needs but little explanation. The Bill will come into operation immediately after the coming into operation of the Constitution.  The dates for the various stages of the election will be appointed by order of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  These dates must, however, be so fixed that the election will be completed in time to enable the President elected to enter upon his office not later than 180 days after the coming into operation of the Constitution. <Col N="94" /> In fixing dates, the possibility of the poll being countermanded under Section 32 must be taken into account and the date for the poll, if any, will be earlier than the last day for that reason.  The presidential returning officer will be appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  This provision follows existing precedents.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the nomination of candidates.  The Constitution requires a nomination to be made by not less than 20 members of the Oireachtas, or by the councils of four county or county borough councils.  With regard to nominations by members of the Oireachtas, it is provided that if a member of the Oireachtas signs two or more valid nomination papers, the first one received will alone be taken into account, and the other nomination paper or papers will be disregarded.</P>
    <P>A county or county borough council may resolve to nominate a named person to be a candidate at a presidential election.  Such a resolution cannot be passed before the Order appointing dates is made in respect of the election to which the resolution relates, and once a resolution is passed, it cannot be rescinded.  Before the resolution is passed by a council not less than three clear days' notice of the intention to propose the resolution must have been given to each person who was a member of the council at the time when such notice was given.  Local government law requires this interval between the giving of notice of a special meeting and the holding of a special meeting. The resolution of a council to nominate a person to be a candidate will be given effect to by means of a nomination paper sealed with the seal of the council.  The form of nomination paper appears as Form 2 in the Second Schedule to this Bill.  A nomination paper sent to the presidential returning officer under this Bill, which is regular and valid on its face will be conclusive evidence that the resolution mentioned in the nomination paper was duly proposed and passed on the date mentioned in the nomination <Col N="95" /> paper at a meeting properly convened and held of the council whose seal is affixed to the nomination paper.  If the presidential returning officer receives from the council of a county or county borough two or more nominations regular on their face and relating to the same election all such nomination papers will be invalid, and will be disregarded.  All nomination papers received by the presidential returning officer will be produced by him at 12 noon on the last day for receiving nominations, at the place appointed, and he will then and there rule on the nominations. This proceeding is described in the Bill as the ruling on nominations.</P>
    <P>The procedure at the ruling will be somewhat different from the procedure at the receiving of nominations at a Dáil election.  This election is to fill the highest office in the State, and the rules are designed to invest the returning officer with all the powers necessary to give finality to his rulings, and to prevent the nomination or the election of a candidate who is not under the Constitution and the law entitled to be nominated or elected.  Accordingly, it is provided that a candidate must attend the ruling on nominations either in person or by an authorised representative.  He must furnish all such information relevant to himself or any nomination paper purporting to nominate him as shall be reasonably required.  Every question relevant to the nomination of a candidate (including the eligibility of the candidate) will be open and may be raised by the returning officer or by any other person present and entitled to take part in the proceedings. The decision of the returning officer on any question connected with the nomination of a candidate will be final subject to reference to the judicial assessor.</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court, or some other judge appointed by him, will attend the ruling on nominations, and will sit and act as judicial assessor.  He may, on the application of the returning officer, <Col N="96" /> disallow the nomination of a candidate on the grounds that the candidate had not attended the ruling on nominations, that is to say, in person, or by an authorised representative, or that he had failed to furnish information respecting himself or his nomination.</P>
    <P>A candidate may withdraw from his candidature during the ruling on nominations, but the withdrawal must be by notice in writing signed and delivered by the candidate or his authorised representative to the returning officer during the ruling.  If only one person is declared to stand nominated, the returning officer will declare that person to be elected as President of Ireland.  If two or more persons are declared to stand nominated, the returning officer will adjourn the election for the purpose of taking a poll.  Provision is also made for the cancellation of the election, or the countermand of the poll if a candidate should die.  The election will be taken by secret ballot and the poll will be taken in every Dáil constituency as at a general election and according to the same procedure.</P>
    <P>I may here mention that there is no provision for challenging or trying the validity of a presidential election on account of alleged corrupt practices.  It seems proper to assume that the persons who will go forward as candidates will be persons of high moral standing who would not stoop to endeavouring to secure their election by dishonest means. Serious allegations of corrupt practices at a presidential election on such a scale as to affect the result of the election would be such a grave public scandal that it could not be left to an ordinary election tribunal, but would have to be dealt with specially by the Legislature in such solemn manner as the circumstances might suggest.  There is always, however, the possibility that some of a candidate's supporters might let their zeal outrun their discretion and might be guilty of conduct which should be made amenable to the criminal law; <Col N="97" /> accordingly the Bill incorporates such portions of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, as relate to corrupt practices by individuals other than a candidate and his agents.  The candidate will have an agent to assist him in the same manner as an agent assists a candidate at a Dáil election, and he will also have a local agent for each constituency. The local agents will appoint personation agents and agents to attend the counting of the votes.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the poll in each constituency, the ballot boxes will be collected and opened by the local returning officer, who will decide on the validity of the ballot papers.  He will then sort the papers according to first preferences and arrange the first preferences in parcels, and a certificate as to the name of the candidate and the number of first preferences will be endorsed on the packets.  This certificate will be shown to the agents. The parcels of first preferences with the certificates will then be sent to the presidential returning officer.  If the presidential returning officer is not satisfied that the certificate is accurate, he will be entitled to recount the number of ballot papers in each parcel, and make any alteration in the certificate as may be necessary by reason of such recount.</P>
    <P>The quota will be half the total number of valid votes plus one.  If there are only two candidates no further counting will be necessary. One candidate will have the quota, except in the most unlikely case of each candidate having the same number of votes.  In such a case, the returning officer will decide by lot to be taken as prescribed by the rules. If there are three or more candidates, and no candidate has a quota the presidential returning officer will eliminate the candidate with the lowest number of votes and transfer the papers according to second preferences. The agents of the candidates will be entitled to be present at the counting of votes by the presidential returning officer.  On completion of the counting of the votes the returning officer will send to the Taoiseach a <Col N="98" /> certificate stating the name of the candidate elected, the total number of votes given for each candidate and any transfer of votes made.  A copy of the certificate will be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>The documents sent to the presidential returning officer will be retained by him for six months and will then be destroyed.  No sealed packet of counterfoils may be opened and no counted ballot paper may at any time be inspected save under and in accordance with an order of the High Court, and no such order may be made unless the reason therefor is necessary and proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the House has decided to present the country with this ornament, I suppose this machinery must be provided.  Personally, I think that the machinery that is being provided for the election of a President is, in some of its details, at least very cumbersome, particularly in relation to the manner in which local authorities may select a candidate for the presidential office. In the first place, I do not think you could get any four county or county borough councils really to make up their minds that they are going to nominate somebody, and I am afraid that that is really put in as a sort of a blind, if you like, because I do not think it will be ever met.  With regard to Section 10, of course, this matter was raised originally on the debate on the Constitution and I do not propose to raise it in the same manner now and I am not endeavouring to do any such thing.  This section deals with giving the right of nomination to the ex-President.  My memory does not serve me very well with regard to the Constitution, and I have not got a copy of it by me at the moment, but I do not know whether it is stated there that an ex-President, who had been impeached by the House, would be deprived of the right of nominating himself again and thereby forcing a very costly contest on the country.  If it is not so stated, however, I think the Minister ought to provide some kind of machinery in this section which <Col N="99" /> would prevent that happening.  I think that can be done.</P>
      <P>I also think that, even though that section is in the Constitution, which gives the retiring President the right to nominate himself again, the very same reason that I have stated with regard to a President who might have been impeached might also apply to a President who had not been impeached but who might have become very unpopular and whom the people might not desire to have as President again. Yet, under this section, he would have the right to nominate himself, under his own hand, without any authority or any sanction either by county councils or members of the Dáil or members of the Seanad.  I think the Minister ought to see that some condition shall be imposed to deal with a case like this and that no man will have the right, of his own volition, without assistance or authority from somebody else, to force a contest of this type and this magnitude which would mean that a very disturbing matter was going to be put on the country. I do not think it is fair that such a contest should be forced on the country without having due regard to the way in which people should be nominated for it.  Personally, I do not think that the contest for a presidential election, as laid down by the machinery here, will be any improvement on the kind of election we had for Senators formerly because, after all, the people are not going to have much interest in this.  It is not very much their concern.  Their laws are made by the Dáil, reviewed by the Seanad, and so on, and as far as this ornament to the State is concerned he does not count much.  I think, however, that every safeguard that can be taken should be taken to see that no contest is unduly put on the country. Every safeguard of that kind that can be taken ought to be taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention in connection with this is Section 20. In one of the sections of the Bill it is set out that the returning officer for the constituencies for this election <Col N="100" /> will be the same returning officer as if it had been a Dáil election.  That being so, it is fair to assume that the county registrar, in most cases, will be the returning officer.  Now, we have set out here, in sub-section (2) of Section 20, that the Minister for Finance, if he thinks fit, before payment of the charges of any local returning officer, may refer the matter of the taxation of such account to a judge of the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the constituency, and that the Circuit Court judge may refer the matter to the county registrar to be determined by him.  I do not see any safeguard in that.  After all, if we are going to provide a safeguard, let it be a safeguard; let there be no humbug about it.  If we are going to have an inquiry down in a county held by a Circuit Court judge into the charges on the expenses of the county registrar, it is no safeguard, and it is not any use to the people of this country who have to pay taxes, to say that the matter is going to be referred to the county registrar himself.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think that this Bill, as before the House, has not got enough attention, and while, as I said before, we have made provision in the Constitution for the election of Uachtarán na h-Eireann, we must provide the machinery for it.  Consequently, we on this side of the House have no desire to oppose the machinery, but we want as far as possible to see that the machinery is in order, and we are particularly anxious to see that a contest shall not be forced upon this country unduly and that some nincompoop or another has not the right to nominate himself, without any sanction or condition from anyone, thereby forcing a contest on the country and putting the country to a lot of expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like to raise on this measure.  When this Dáil was first set up the view was expressed from practically all sections of the House that every step possible should be taken to prevent personation at elections, to ensure that every person entitled to vote would be able to exercise that right and that no person <Col N="101" /> would have more than one vote, and so on.  We need not go back on these things now, whether steps, as far as they could be taken according to law, were so taken.  As far as my information goes, there has been considerable departure from those early virtuous announcements from all Parties and there is no special effort, so far as this measure is concerned, to ensure any special precautions with regard to it.</P>
      <P>Now, in the recent elections in the City and County of Dublin a good many complaints have arisen regarding names that are on the Register that ought not to be on the Register, and, on the other hand, about names which ought to be on the Register and which are not returned.  So that, while we have in the Constitution, both in the past and in the intermediate Constitution, which we are told has now been sanctioned by the people, the giving of the same right to exercise the franchise, the fact is that the steps that have been taken, whether by the State in so far as it is concerned or by the voluntary work of individuals, have not made certain that persons who are entitled to vote are on the Register.  That is the first point I should like to raise; whether the Minister has considered, in connection with the present construction of the franchise lists, if some special effort might be made to ensure that persons entitled to vote would be on the Register, and secondly, that persons would not be registered on the Register of Electors a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second point that I should like to raise.  I was not in a position to hear the Minister very well when he spoke, as he spoke in a very low voice in introducing this measure and I could not follow him with regard to quite a number of explanations that he gave of the measure.  I take it, however, that he dealt in some manner with explanations as regards the authority and the exercise of the jurisdiction of the returning officer to reject certain nominations, or rather to reject a nomination paper if it had some imperfection in it.  From the measure as it is before us, I could not gather that <Col N="102" /> there is provision for the rejection of a nomination in the event of something being imperfect in the construction of the nomination paper.  Mention is made in the measure of the nomination by a county council or a county borough council of more than one candidate and that where that happens it would amount to disqualification. So far as the Bill is drawn, I think there is something in the case made by Deputy Brennan&mdash;that it is cumbersome.  I think a more direct method could have been arrived at for dealing with that situation&mdash;either that the first nomination from a council would stand and no other be received or, alternatively, that the responsible officer of the local authority would send only one nomination paper.</P>
    <P>It seems to me peculiar, if I have read the Bill correctly, or understood correctly what I could hear of the Minister's explanation, that the county council or the county borough council might possibly send up more than one name.  It seems to me rather difficult to imagine a situation of that sort occurring where you have as efficient and competent officials responsible for the despatch of business in local authorities as you have in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether the presidential returning officer, or whoever is the highest officer in connection with this measure, has the right to reject a nomination simply from an imperfection on its face.  If 20 or 25 members of the Dáil subscribe their names to a nomination paper and, perhaps, leave some particular line blank that ought to be filled up, would that enable the returning officer to reject that nomination?  Similarly, with regard to a local authority, would anything wrong on the face of the document itself mean that the nomination paper would be declared invalid?</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is a very small one.  The Minister has referred to the fact that there might be a dead-heat at an election for President.  It occurs in the course of this measure, as it occurs in the case of ordinary elections, that where a <Col N="103" /> person who is entitled to vote finds that his vote has been already cast by some other person, he takes an oath and is presented with a different coloured paper from the ordinary ballot paper.  These votes are never counted I believe except at an election petition.  Special mention is made here in more than one section, I think, as regards what is to happen in the case of a person applying for a ballot paper who finds that he has been already voted for.  His ballot paper is to be put into a separate compartment. I could not gather from the Bill, from the hasty examination I made of it, whether when all those votes come from the different constituencies, and amongst the ballot papers to be counted there may be some of these yellow papers, there is to be a general mixing up at headquarters, or whether each constituency will be kept separate so that, in the event of a tie in a particular constituency, a count might be made of the yellow papers.  I take it that, although each constituency will vote separately, a decision will not be taken in each constituency; that is, if there is a majority of 50 in one and 49 in another, it does not follow that these are level&mdash;there would be a majority of one as between the two.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as presented, I suppose follows out what has been adopted, or is said to have been adopted in the Constitution.  The Minister did not give us the figures of the votes on the Constitution either as regards the number of votes cast in favour of it, the number of votes cast against it, the number of invalid votes and the number of people who voted altogether on the Constitution.  If my recollection is correct, less than a majority of the votes cast were cast in favour of the Constitution.  I believe that in all but four constituencies the law which was enacted here was disobeyed and votes were counted which had &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; on them instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo;.  The Minister, I think, had charge of that particular measure and I am taking it that it is held in his Department and by the Executive Council that the Constitution is passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The next point I want to make is that we had the experience already in this country some 14 years ago of a country-wide constituency, when there were a number of candidates up for election as Senators.  There was not the same interest taken in that election as there were in the other ones, although there were quite a number of candidates.  In this case, I take it, that if there be a contest the contestants will require to have personation agents all over the country.  The cost of these arrangements will fall upon the candidate I presume.  Could the Minister give us the estimated cost of this particular election so far as the State is concerned?  I suppose that matter will come up on the Money Resolution, but if I am asking the question before the proper time, it will give the Minister notice of the raising of the question next week or the week after when the Money Resolution is being taken.  I presume it will cost much the same sum of money as a general election.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, (1) whether his Department has considered special steps to be taken to ensure a better register; (2) whether his Department has considered if the present law as it stands is sufficient to prevent personation; (3) whether in case of personation the present position could not be improved upon so that a person whose vote has been stolen will have the right to exercise the franchise and have his vote recorded rather than tucked away in a special compartment.  The last question is, whether in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this new returning officer regard will be had to the right of the persons nominated and facilities be afforded to them in the event of the instrument employed, that is the nomination paper, being wrong in any technical particular and that the rights of the individuals who are subscribing to the nomination will be safeguarded?</P>

      <P>When the Minister replies I will be glad if he will let us have a categorical answer to the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Leader of the Opposition directed his attention to the <Col N="105" /> fact that it was highly doubtful whether in fact or in law the Constitution had passed at all.  That is a matter which we all would like to have cleared up one way or another.  I do not know if the Minister's attention has been directed to the facts.  The method whereby the Constitution was to be enacted or rejected was set out in two documents: (1) the body of the Constitution itself, and (2) the Act of this House which provided the machinery whereunder the Referendum was to be taken.  In those two documents, one provision occurred which provided that no vote which had not upon its face a cross placed there by the voter was a valid vote.  As we all know who attended the general election count, there were thousands of votes polled in the Constitution Referendum where, instead of a cross, the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; appeared.  In view of the Constitution itself and the Act providing for the Referendum, it would appear that those votes should have been rejected as spoiled votes.  The legislation providing for the Referendum further required that, in order to pass, the Constitution must secure more than one-half of the total of the votes cast. The attention of the House is particularly directed to the fact that the expression was not &ldquo;more than one-half of the total valid vote cast,&rdquo; which is the expression used in the ordinary Electoral Acts.  The expression in this instance specifically referred to the total votes cast.  Any vote issued by the returning officer and placed in the ballot box&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying, a distinction has to be drawn between the law applying to ordinary elections and the law applying to this particular referendum.  I want the Minister to inquire or to consider whether all votes with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; written upon them, instead of a cross, should have been rejected.  If, as a result of that, it emerges that the number of valid votes for the Constitution is less than one-half of the total votes cast, what is our position enacting legislation here to provide for the discharge of functions under a Constitution that is not operating in the country at all? If the House will reflect on the matter for a moment Deputies will realise that you have to ascertain all the valid votes for the Constitution, that is all the votes marked with a cross opposite the word &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; to ascertain whether the Constitution passed or not.  Every spoiled vote is, in effect, a vote against the Constitution.  If the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; was written on a ballot paper that is a spoiled vote.  If the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; was written on a ballot paper it was similarly a spoiled vote, but under the law as fixed by the Referendum Act and the Constitution, although it is a spoiled vote, it operates as a vote against the Constitution.</P>

There may be an appropriate tribunal to deal with these questions but I think we can go too far in the matter of blindfolding ourselves when we are in the process of legislating.

      <P>I am rather puzzled to know why the whole atmosphere in the Bill is against the withdrawal of candidates.  That idea seems to run right through it. Once a person has become a candidate he must go through with the election. I can quite see the possibility of persons being nominated who, on wiser consideration, might be induced to withdraw even before the election reached that stage in which the returning officer would be checking up the validity of the nominations.  The next point to which I wish to call attention has reference to Clause 8, Section 1 (c), which provides that 25 members of the Oireachtas can nominate.  I am rather inclined to think that at that particular time there will be no Seanad in existence.  It may be possible that, with a definite time-table, you could have the Seanad elected, but inasmuch <Col N="108" /> as the President will nominate a certain number of members of the Seanad, it does not seem to me possible that the Seanad would be complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it or is it not a fact that the Seanad will be in existence and that nominations will be by members of the Oireachtas, that is, of the Seanad and of the Dáil, or is it the fact that in the first election nominations will be confined to members of the Dáil?  Then there is a rather curious provision in relation to nominations by local authorities.  It says that they must be nominated by a resolution which in the case of county boroughs that have a city manager is apparently a function reserved to the elected members of the House, as distinct from the city manager.  Then it goes on to say in sub-section (2) of Section 9 that no resolution proposing a candidate can be rescinded, that they must proceed with the nomination&mdash;in other words, that they &ldquo;shall nominate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be any machinery to enforce that &ldquo;shall.&rdquo; Then there is provision number 7 in the same section, which says that if a county or county borough does put in two valid nominations, both shall be cancelled.  In other words, as far as I can read the machinery at the moment, it provides for the nomination of candidates by, say, a county borough; it prevents the rescinding of that resolution when it is passed, and then the only machinery by which a council can get rid of a candidate they have already nominated is by nominating another. It seems to be peculiar machinery, and I should like to be sure I have not misread it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the clauses there is an instruction to the returning officer that he shall, in fact, inform every candidate that he has been properly nominated, but it goes on in Section 11, sub-section (3) to say that the obligation of the candidate to be present at this assessing of the validity of the nomination will not be voided by the fact that <Col N="109" /> he has not received such notification. It seems to me that the only official knowledge that a man can have that he is a candidate is that official notification. In other words a man would be in a position to say: &ldquo;I have no official knowledge that I am a candidate.  I have no official knowledge that I have any <i>locus standi</i> at all.&rdquo; That seems to me a small gap which might be filled. A point was raised by Deputy Cosgrave in relation to Section 14, where it says that it will be lawful&mdash;it does not say &ldquo;obligatory&rdquo;&mdash;for the returning officer, apparently at his complete discretion, to reject as invalid a nomination paper for some undefined incorrectness.  That leaves it entirely at his discretion, and without apparently any guidance as to the substance of the incorrectness which would involve invalidity.  It seems to me that there should be something put in that clause to say that it was an incorrectness of substance.</P>

      <P>On Section 9 I should like to have some information.

      <P>Might I, as a newcomer to this House, express an aspect of this Bill which I suggest should meet with the consideration of this House.  It is an aspect of the matter which the leader of the Opposition has already dealt with.  We have this Bill before the House now on its Second Reading, upon an admitted state of facts, when the Constitution has been enacted by this country, but in framing the rules for that Constitution I suggest that the serious consideration of this House should be directed to the fact that this is an important matter which will govern our future for a great many years to come, and that in the framing of those <Col N="110" /> rules regard should be had to the fact that a very large number of the population of this country, being electors of this country, did not cast their vote for or against that Constitution. Therefore I say that we here, the members of this House, no matter to what Party we belong, are here in the nature of trustees, if I may put it that way, for the whole population, and while I think this Bill is only regarded perhaps as the rules of the Constitution I suggest to the House that it is more important than the Constitution itself.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <P>It is evident that the House regards this Bill as a matter of machinery, in which there is not a great deal of substance that could be argued.  Therefore, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dillon sought to bring us back to a debate on the big issue which has already been settled. The Constitution is settled as far as the country can settle it.  In case Deputy Cosgrave or Deputy Dillon has any real doubt as to whether or not the Constitution has been passed, I would say it has.  It has been definitely and clearly passed and accepted by the people.  Having nothing to say on this Bill, they thought we should get back and discuss the Constitution issue again.  Well, I suppose we will hear a lot for many days to come on that same issue, but no Deputy in the House will be able to say that the Constitution has not been passed.  It has. I hope the Deputy is satisfied.  This Bill being largely a question of machinery, we will be happy to give consideration to any useful or practical suggestion that will improve it, tighten it up, show us any loop-holes, or places where the machinery could be made more useful and made to work more smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Register of <Col N="111" /> Voters, and the point that names are on that Register which should not be there, while names which should have been put on the Register were omitted, those questions arise every time an election is held.  They arise after every general election and every local election, and I really do not know that anything more can be done to improve the machinery.  I should be glad of any suggestion which anybody has in mind that would help us to improve the machinery for making the Register perfect.  It is not perfect.  It never was perfect.  I wonder if it ever will be?  I hope it will.  I had many complaints from people in my own constituency during the days of the general election.  Perhaps I thought they were going to vote for me.  They came into our committee rooms and pointed out that their names had been left off the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Too bad.  I could not do anything.  There is machinery provided in every local authority, and I think the whole House may take it that although there might be a case here and there where an individual had a bias in some way or another I think it is a rare thing to keep a person off the register deliberately. Slips do occur, but deliberately to keep a person off the register is a rare thing.  Likewise, people are left on the register who ought not to be there. There are also cases where one name might be on the list three or four times. Duplicates were not struck out when the proofs were being revised and, in the places where these three or four names were, where the repetition of one name occurred, other names should have appeared.  That kind of thing happens and I do not think, as long as we are human and possibly until the end of time, that we will ever make what anyone would regard as the perfect register.  I hope that we will get to that stage sometime, perhaps somebody will, but I do not think that in my lifetime I will ever see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any suggestion that anyone can make, although we may not be able to deal with it in this Bill we <Col N="112" /> will, however, note the suggestion and try to get it put into operation in connection with future electoral law so as to secure that registers in future will be more perfect than they have been in the past.  The returning officer under this Bill, the man who will act, will be a civil servant, who is experienced in these matters, who has acted in a similar capacity before and in whom the whole House, I am satisfied, will have implicit trust.  I take it that he, acting with a judge of the High Court, as his legal adviser and assessor, will take every precaution to see that no nomination paper is marked invalid unless, using his discretion&mdash;he will have discretion&mdash;there is something seriously wrong with such paper.</P>
    <P>I would not be surprised that the same procedure will be adopted that is adopted by the candidates and the Returning Officer in Dublin City, where there is a very experienced and a very wise Returning Officer.  I had experience oftentimes of having my nomination paper, whether for Parliamentary or municipal elections, submitted in advance to the Returning Officer, who would say in advance, unofficially, if it was valid or if there were any loopholes.  That has been done by me or by my agents over and over again.  I am sure the Returning Officer in this case will be available for consultation and advice by anybody wishing to fill up a nomination paper. At any rate, whoever is selected, he will always be a person of experience, prudence and wisdom, who will not act in an arbitrary way and who will not turn down a nomination paper merely because there was a figure left out or a comma was not put in the right place.</P>
    <P>As regards a question raised about an ex-President nominating himself, that is settled for us by the Constitution and we cannot go back on that issue in discussions on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, in addition to those that the Minister has not dealt with, namely, the question of personating agents.  It arises and gets increased importance in this way. The Minister may remember that we were frequently told that the occupant of this office was to be a non-political personage and that, as far as possible, even in the election itself, the whole thing would be raised above the level of sordid Party politics.  I observe the Minister solemnly nodding his head at this as if he believed it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think, unless there is some machinery provided by the State to prevent personation, that an ordinary individual can supply personating agents through the country?  A great deal of this Bill, the Minister has said, deals with certain machinery. You cannot have any attempt of an approach to the alleged ideal that you have in mind if you are to depend on the individual himself to look after that.  He will have to get a Party machine behind him to do it and then from the very start the election becomes political, and, as the President may be again a candidate, he must remain political during his period of office.  I suggest that some method of State machinery should be provided, and it is more necessary than in the case of an ordinary Dáil election. There should be some method of State machinery to prevent personation and also, perhaps, to get the people to take some interest in the election.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered a very important point raised by Deputy Pattison, namely, what will be the authority under this Bill of a commissioner who, in reality, as everybody knows, is a nominee of the Minister's own Department in certain counties.  I assert&mdash;and I hope I am not saying anything disrespectful when I do so&mdash;that the commissioner is not free from the influence of the Minister's Department and it would not be in keeping with democratic principles if the commissioner was to be allowed the same right as the county councils and the borough councils.  The position should be made very clear.  In my opinion, this power which it is proposed to give to county and borough councils should be removed altogether if the commissioner is to be put on the same footing as an existing county or borough council.  You have the commissioner system in operation in several counties and the position should be made clear in regard to these men who are the Minister's nominees.</P>

      <P>No, I did not say that.  My own idea as regards the costs is that they will be considerable. I do not know that this will be quite as costly as a general election, but I do believe it will be a considerable cost on the large electorate.  This is the first time such an election will have been held in this country and I have no estimate, but I know the cost will be considerable.  The Bill proposes to give certain elected local authorities the power to nominate. For local purposes the commissioners are regarded as local authorities and, <Col N="116" /> as the Bill stands, power to nominate would certainly be in the hands of commissioners.  A commissioner acting as a commissioner of a county council could join in nomination with other bodies.</P>

      <P>It may, perhaps, enable Deputies to understand more easily the scope and purpose of this measure if I preface my remarks on it by giving a brief history of prices investigation in this State.  From the very beginning of the State there have been, from <Col N="120" /> time to time, in fact, almost continuously, complaints of unduly high prices being charged for commodities of common consumption. There have been allegations of profiteering by traders and others and demands for investigation and control.  I think it is necessary to emphasise that point, in order that Deputies may approach the consideration of this measure in the proper atmosphere.  Legislation to provide for the control of prices is not made necessary by any purely temporary circumstance, or any particular policy in operation at any one time, and it would be a mistake for the House, and probably detrimental to the production of the best type of legislation, if Deputies were to consider this Bill as something occasioned by existing circumstances, or to deal with conditions which may arise in the near future. Complaints about undue prices have been in existence at all times, and the demand for legislation to establish machinery to control prices has existed from the first year in which this State came into existence.  As far back as October, 1922, a Commission on Prices was set up by resolution of the Dáil. To quote the terms of that resolution the commission was &ldquo;to inquire into and report on prices costs or profits at all or any of the stages in the production distribution or sale of the commodities,&rdquo; specified in the official report on the Cost of Living and on alcoholic and other beverages.  In proposing the motion to establish that commission the Minister for Industry and Commerce of that day, Mr. Joseph McGrath, referred to the widespread reports which were in circulation concerning profiteering.  To quote his words as they appear in volume I, column 833, of the Dáil Debates, he said: &ldquo;Profiteering, to my mind, is going on to a very large extent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission was established by the Dáil as a result of that motion, but it had no statutory powers to collect information in cases in which it was not voluntarily given, and, in consequence, the commission did very little useful work, although an elaborate arrangement of local committees was established in all important centres in the country.  The report of the commission, <Col N="121" /> which is available to Deputies in the Library of the Dáil, is of interest to-day only in so far as it bears on observations that have since been repeated by every tribunal or body set up to investigate prices: &ldquo;We regret to have to report that the consuming public, as distinct from the manufacturers and traders, have shown little interest in the activities of the commission, and have rendered very little help, notwithstanding repeated invitations.&rdquo; They pointed out that the attitude of the public was all the more regrettable because its investigations had been undertaken because of repeated public complaints as to prices.  The observations of the committee which I have quoted, and similar observations contained in the reports of subsequent tribunals of inquiry into prices, should be borne in mind by Deputies when considering the details of this measure, because our experience has made it clear that it is idle and futile to rely on active public co-operation to ensure the effectiveness of any system of prices control.  In 1923, following the publication of the report of the commission to which I have referred, the Government then in office determined to introduce legislation for the permanent control of prices.  It even got so far in the matter as to be able to announce on April 2nd, 1924, that a Bill for that purpose would be introduced in about a fortnight from that date.  The Bill never appeared however, but sometime later, as reported in volume 7, column 182 of the Dáil Debates, Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President, in explaining the non-appearance of the measure in relation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is not to say that he is not impressed by the gravity of the case and the necessity for the Bill and for putting up a measure which will meet the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No measure of any kind was, however, enacted, although public complaints concerning prices continued, and the subject-matter of these complaints was frequently debated in the House.  As a result of complaints and pressure applied in the Dáil, Deputy Cosgrave's Government decided to act again by way of the establishment of a <Col N="122" /> commission of inquiry, and in February, 1926, the Tribunal on Prices was set up &ldquo;to inquire into the retail price of articles of general consumption as a definite matter of urgent public importance,&rdquo; to quote the terms of the Dáil resolution.  That tribunal reported in October, 1927. Its report revealed that unduly high prices were being charged for many articles of food in different parts of the country.  On page two of their report the Prices Tribunal state: &ldquo;The outstanding impression left on our minds as a result of this inquiry is the need for continuous investigation and supervision.&rdquo;  In the report they elaborated proposals for the establishment of a permanent prices board. No action was taken upon their report by the Government then in office, although they were repeatedly pressed to do so in the Dáil, and although complaints about prices continued to exist.  It was not until the change of Government in 1932 that it fell to my lot to prepare and to introduce here the present Control of Prices Act. When introducing that Act I explained that the Government accepted the view that permanent machinery for the investigation of prices was required, that citizens were entitled to have a means whereby their legitimate complaints might be investigated and, if possible, remedied; and that it was, in any event, an essential measure, particularly in this country, at a time when industrial development was being promoted by restrictions of imports leading to a reduction of competition. I pointed out, however, the essential difference between the investigation and the publication of reports on prices and the actual enforcement of prices control.</P>
    <P>I expressed the hope, which has not, in the event, been fully realised, that the Prices Commission would be able to achieve its purpose without actual resort to price fixation, although power to fix maximum prices was taken, to be used in the last resort when persuasion and publicity had failed.  That Bill received a very mixed reception from the Dáil but it was not opposed.  In the Seanad, however, many amendments were inserted which lessened its effectiveness in <Col N="123" /> many respects, particularly in regard to the provisions dealing with the investigation of individual complaints by members of the public.  It became law, however, and since then the Prices Commission has operated.  I repeat that I have given that brief history of price-control legislation for the purpose of making clear that the need for it has existed and has been recognised to exist at all times by members of the public and by those charged with the responsibility of ensuring that public grievances in that regard were remedied.  I do not know the considerations which persuaded the previous Government to drop their declared intention to introduce such a permanent measure.  Possibly, the difficulty of framing the measure&mdash; a difficulty of which I am very well aware&mdash;had something to do with it. Most Deputies will, however, recognise that it is much better to establish some permanent body, charged with statutory functions and given the necessary powers to investigate prices and to require information on prices to be supplied to them, than that we should have periodic investigations by <i>ad hoc</i> committees or tribunals set up for the purpose of publishing reports only and without power to ensure that effective action is taken.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission which has operated since 1932 has completed investigations into the prices charged for a number of commodities.  It may, perhaps, be of interest to Deputies to give the list of commodities the prices of which have been investigated by the commission and to make some reference to the circumstances under which the investigations were considered necessary.</P>
    <P>The first investigation related to wheaten flour.  The next investigation related to wheaten meal and there were, then, investigations into the prices of bread, mineral hydrocarbon heavy oil, bodies used for omnibuses and goods vehicles, fresh fish and filleted fish&mdash;these two investigations were taken together&mdash;all materials and appliances used in the building of houses, furniture, mattresses and bolsters.  A further investigation into <Col N="124" /> the price of batch bread was undertaken last year and the commission is at present engaged in investigating the price of bacon.  As Deputies are aware, the existing law gives the Prices Commission power to investigate the price charged for a scheduled commodity when requested to do so by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by any other interested person. Two of the investigations to which I have referred&mdash;fresh fish and filleted fish&mdash;were undertaken at the request of a local authority in Dublin.  All the other investigations were undertaken by the commission at my request.  The scheduled commodities are set out in the Act and are&mdash;(1) any commodity used as food or drink by a man other than drugs or water; (2) any commodity used as clothing, material for clothing or fuel.  Power was given to the Executive Council to add to the schedule any commodity of common use.  That power was exercised to give the commission power to undertake an investigation into the price of furniture.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Act, the commission may endeavour to check profiteering, if they are satisfied that profiteering is taking place, by giving the public notice of prices which it considers reasonable and requiring the prices to be reduced to those figures within a specified time.  If that procedure fails, the commission can report the failure to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who can&mdash;in theory at least&mdash;fix a maximum retail or wholesale price.  On the one occasion on which the Prices Commission tried to secure a reduction in existing prices by means of the procedure under the Act&mdash;that is, in the case of bread&mdash; the persons concerned refused to comply with the request.  When the Prices Commission published their notice stating what they considered was a reasonable price and requesting the persons concerned to reduce their price to that figure, there was noncompliance with that request and a report was made to me.  In consequence of that report, I decided to exercise the powers given under the Act for the purpose of fixing a maximum price.  I found however, that the framing of the Act was <Col N="125" /> defective in many respects.  As Deputies will remember, before that power could be secured, fresh legislation dealing with bread only had to be enacted.  The maximum price for bread which is now operating is fixed under that special Act dealing with bread prices and not under the Act of 1932.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1932 also provided that complaints from individuals should be made to the authority set up by the Act&mdash;the Controller of Prices&mdash;who was given power to arrange for the investigation of such complaints by means of inspectors and, if he found that they were substantiated, either to refer the matter to the Prices Commission so that a full price investigation should be undertaken or, after compliance with the provisions of the Act, which are very elaborate and formal, proceed to fix a legal price by making a price certificate.  We have found, in practice, that the existing Act is defective in many ways.  Perhaps it will explain the reason for this measure and the nature of its various provisions if I indicate the main difficulties which arose in the operation of the 1932 Act.  I have mentioned some of them already but the case of bread is the outstanding one.  The commission found, when requested to investigate the price charged for that commodity, that no useful work could be done by them if they confined their activities to the narrow field covered by the requisition sent to them.  An investigation into the price of bread is of little value unless, at the same time, an examination can be made of the price of flour and the various ingredients of bread.  I have mentioned bread as an example but Deputies will understand that the same thing is true of practically any other commodity.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, therefore, we are giving the commission power when they receive a requisition, or themselves decide, and give notice of their intention, to investigate the price of a particular commodity, to extend the scope of their inquiry at any time they think it necessary to do so in order to enable them to arrive at useful results.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission occasionally <Col N="126" /> found it necessary, particularly in connection with the investigation of the prices of housing materials, to submit an <i>interim</i> report and to make recommendations therein with a view to immediate action being taken in relation to the prices of some commodities.</P>

      <P>What is to prevent their carrying on that double investigation <i>pari passu</i> into the price of bread and the price of flour?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely giving bread as an illustration.  I was not attempting to illustrate what actually happened.  The principal difficulty, in fact, in relation to the report the commission sent, as a result of their investigation of the price of bread, arose not out of their inability to extend the scope of their investigation, but out of their difficulty in securing an exact definition of the commodity, the price of which they were investigating; and, as a result, the second investigation which was undertaken only last year was confined to a particular kind of bread, namely, batch bread, and the legislation which was enacted deals with batch bread only. The first reference to the commission, however, was a reference to investigate the price of bread and their report had necessarily to deal with the whole question of bread prices, whereas, of course, the only immediate necessity for action arose in relation to the common type of bread used in every household, namely, batch bread, and in fact no powers to control the prices of fancy breads of any <Col N="127" /> kind have been taken.  In relation to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I should mention that when the commission commenced operations, it was in fact asked to investigate the prices of flour and bread at the same time.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the commission frequently found it desirable, following prices investigation, to recommend different prices for different varieties of a scheduled commodity and different prices for varying conditions of sale, but we were advised that the commission had no power under the existing Act to make such a recommendation, or the Minister to act upon such a recommendation, if it were made.  A more particular difficulty, and one which has a very direct relation to the bread investigation to which I have referred, was that the maximum price recommended by the Prices Commission in relation to a particular commodity might, on occasion, be rendered valueless by rapid market fluctuations in the prices of the constituents of the commodity.  The commission felt that in such cases it was essential that they should have power to recommend, not an absolute maximum price, but a sliding scale price which would have a direct relation to the prevailing prices of some other commodity.  In the case of bread, the maximum price fixed under this Bill is related to the prevailing price of flour.  The price of flour is itself not controlled, but machinery is established to ascertain from time to time the prevailing market price of flour and, on the basis of that ascertained price, the maximum price for bread is fixed.  The 1932 Act, however, did not give that power, namely, the power of relating the fixed price to the price of some other commodity. Under that Act, only one maximum price can be fixed under one Order, and if conditions change as a result of increased cost of constituent commodities, or for some other reason, a new investigation, a new report and a new order would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, however, certain investigations undertaken by the commission which convinced them that cases would arise in which not even a sliding scale maximum price would be the most <Col N="128" /> effective method of preventing undue prices being charged, and, consequently, the Bill now before the House provides for controlling profits by the fixation of a definite margin and regulating prices, not in relation to the actual charges made to the public, but by reference to the profits earned by the seller.</P>

      <P>We are leaving it as wide as possible and allowing the commission to decide the best precedure to be adopted in any particular case.  I think the commission will find that in operation they will have difficulty in applying that particular method of control, except to a very limited range of commodities.  As Deputies will have noticed, however, we are giving the commission certain powers wider than that in relation to commodities, the importation of which is subject to customs duty, or restrictions by quota orders or otherwise.  We are giving the commission power to recommend, if they consider that a necessary and desirable reduction of price cannot otherwise be secured, a reduction of the prevailing customs duty or a modification of the restrictions on import.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that there may be cases in which the only effective method of preventing undue prices being charged for such commodities will be along those lines, and it is the intention to act in that manner, if and when the commission reports that undue prices are being charged or that the only effective method of preventing it is by modifications of import restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also giving the commission power to give public notice of its intention to keep the prices of particular commodities under continuous investigation, and, in such circumstances, to obtain from persons engaged in the manufacture or sale of such commodities such information as the commission may think necessary in order to have a complete picture of the situation, and to report to the Minister as to the action which should be taken to deal with it.  The amendments inserted in the Seanad to the <Col N="129" /> part of the Bill dealing with the powers of the Controller in relation to the investigation of individual complaints, practically destroyed that part of the Bill.  They made the procedure for dealing with those complaints so elaborate and complicated that I do not blame any member of the public for not proceeding with his or her complaint when the procedure was brought to their notice.  Those amendments were inserted by the Seanad very largely on the plea that they were necessary to protect the interests of legitimate traders.  I resisted them because I thought they were unwise, but the Seanad was in a position to have its way in the matter, and I am now proposing to delete most of them.  I think that Deputies who will read that part of the Bill will not consider that the powers that we are proposing to take are in any way too drastic.</P>
    <P>The alterations in the Bill are designed to make the whole procedure for the investigation of individual complaints less formal than it was, so that a verbal complaint can be investigated, or a complaint made otherwise than on the appropriate form, can receive the attention of the Controller, and the Controller can act forthwith in order to secure the information which will enable him to decide the course of action he should take.  He has alternative courses of action.  He can first bring the whole matter to the notice of the commission so that a general investigation into the price of the commodity the subject of the complaint may be made; or he can act in relation to an individual trader or manufacturer who is guilty of an overcharge, secure the repayment of the overcharge, and in certain circumstances punishment for the person responsible for it by means of publication of the circumstances of the case.  We are, of course, also giving the commission power to initiate investigations on their own behalf without necessarily waiting for a reference from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or a request from a member of the public.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission, as Deputies are aware, was set up as a voluntary <Col N="130" /> body, the members of which gave their services voluntarily, and the work of the commission called for a considerable sacrifice of time on their part. After the experience of a year or so it was found necessary to provide that the chairman of the body would receive some remuneration on a part-time basis, but I think the time has come when a change must be made in the nature of the body itself.  I do not think it is fair for the State to rely on the voluntary assistance of individuals for conducting investigations of this kind, however large and competent a staff of public servants may be put at their disposal.  We are proposing, therefore, in the Bill to reduce the size of the commission. The original commission under the 1932 Act consisted of not less than five persons.  We are proposing that the new commission may be limited to three persons, and it is the intention that these persons will be remunerated, but whether on a whole-time or a part-time basis I cannot say yet.  The intention is that they will be remunerated for the services they render.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention in the 1932 Act was to set up a representative body, and, consequently, there were various provisions inserted to provide that one of the persons appointed would be representative of agricultural interests, and I think there was a provision that two members should be women and certain other provisions of that kind.  We are now getting away from the idea of a representative body&mdash;that is, a body which would reflect in itself various interests in the community, and are setting up instead an investigating body of persons who will be selected because of their competency for that particular type of work, and who will be directly charged with the responsibility not merely of carrying out individual investigations as they arise, but in doing the continuous work which we now anticipate will be done by this commission: this keeping of prices under review and <Col N="131" /> reporting thereon periodically or as occasion may arise to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A number of other changes are proposed in the measure with which I need not deal now.  Reference can be made to them during the Committee Stage discussion.</P>
      <P>The Bill is being submitted to the Dáil on the assumption that the need for price control legislation is recognised, and that there is a general desire that whatever machinery we may set up for that purpose will be fully effective.  It is only during the past five years that we in this country have had actual experience, in other than war-time circumstances, of price-control machinery in practice. Deputies who have studied this matter will have noticed that in other countries, although the demand for such legislation has been fairly consistent, legislation has not been enacted except in few cases.  I cannot say, as a result of my own inquiries, whether the legislation in those countries which have thought fit to enact it has been fully effective or not, but most Governments have apparently been deterred from attempting permanent price control at all by the inherent difficulties of the problem: the difficulty of providing machinery which would be able to act effectively and speedily to prevent any undue rise in prices.  In the neighbouring country, although Royal Commissions have from time to time examined the matter and made recommendations, no such legislation has been attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, therefore, not available for us the same fund of experience in other countries which we can sometimes call upon in relation to other classes of legislation.  We have got to follow the road indicated by our own judgment in this matter.  We made a start in 1932, and I have no apology whatever to offer if the Prices Commission which was established in consequence of the 1932 legislation has not been considered fully effective. It was as effective as it could have been in all the circumstances.  It was, as I have stated, always recognised that effective machinery would be difficult to devise, and the course that <Col N="132" /> we took was, I think, the only practical course open to us: that is to say, we set up the best machinery we could devise, allowed it to operate and learned by experience what changes were necessary to make it really sound.  This Bill, which I am now proposing to the Dáil, may or may not be the last attempt at price control legislation in this generation, but it represents the sum total of our experience to date, and I believe that it will justify itself by results.  I therefore recommend the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The Minister finished his speech by saying that he had no apology to offer for introducing this measure.  When a man makes a statement of that kind it is generally taken as an admission that he has done something which it is very hard to defend.  It is the common phrase used by those who make mistakes.  In connection with this Bill, there are a few things in relation to it on which I would like to congratulate the Minister. The first is the form in which he has introduced it.  It is really an amending Bill.  The greater portion of the older Bill has been reproduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the great advantage of Deputies and the House, the Minister has avoided, in this measure, the rather difficult procedure of legislation by reference.  There is another matter on which I again congratulate him.  Last June, when this Bill was printed, the public&mdash;and, of course, the Minister is not responsible &mdash;were rather inclined to be misled into the idea that an entirely new Bill was being introduced and that some entirely new step was being taken that would deal effectively with the question of prices.  It was fortunate for the Minister&mdash;I do not say that he would do such a thing deliberately&mdash; that that impression was created during the election campaign, when one of the main issues before the electors was the question of prices and the intolerable way in which the people were being fleeced.  It was useful that such an accident should occur, such a coincidence in time, as the production <Col N="133" /> of an apparently new Bill&mdash;which was really an old Bill, with a few amendments that I will deal with subsequently. And we had, in an organ that, I think, the Minister would not say would misrepresent him, or that, anyhow, would not misrepresent the Government, such headings as &ldquo;New Bill to control Prices,&rdquo;&ldquo;Commission to Go.&rdquo;&ldquo;Body with Wider Powers to be Set Up&rdquo;&mdash;all in flaring headlines. Then the public would read through these provisions, and the public, which is generally short-minded, not being interested in technical details, would be struck with the enormous and drastic powers that are now being assumed by the Minister, quite oblivious of the fact that most of the enormous and drastic powers set out are powers that the Minister has had for the last five years.  That was a good impression&mdash;I mean, it was a good accident for the Minister that that impression should be created for the Minister at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What you have is the old Bill with some additional powers added.  Now, the Minister, for instance, dealt with the fact that he was scrapping the unpaid commissioners: that he recognised that representative people who knew different aspects of the subject were not the people that would deal with this thing.  What he wanted was the official, the expert&mdash;of course, he cannot be an expert in everything&mdash; but the trained official mind or at least a mind that could be trained by the official mind&mdash;remarkably like the old Tariff Commission.  It is a great conversion to see the Minister harking back, not merely in this respect, but in other respects as well, to the procedure of the Tariff Commission and to the necessity of investigations such as the Tariff Commission could initiate and could carry through.  He was satisfied five years ago that he had the machinery to deal with profiteering. It took him five years to find out that he had not.  He started off, in his own words, by saying: &ldquo;I will give you a brief history.&rdquo;  I wonder did the House notice that the history abruptly stopped at 1932 and that he finished the very instructive five years between 1932 and 1937 with the phrase: &ldquo;The commission was set up and operated.&rdquo;<Col N="134" /> Then he began to deal with the provisions of the Bill.  Now, what the Minister might have attempted to justify, in the light of his experience &mdash;because he admits that he has not other countries on whose experience he can fall back&mdash;was the keeping on of a commission that has done so very little.  He does not blame them for having done so very little, and I am not blaming them, but it would have been better if he had attempted to justify the keeping on of a commission that has done so very little instead of proceeding to an elaboration of the existing system.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember that certain questions were put before him, when this Bill was discussed five years ago, on the matter of profiteering. The Minister was asked, did profiteering exist and on what scale; how far did, in fact, traders merit the charge that was made against them that they were charging undue prices for commodities that they sold and that manufacturers were guilty of similar conduct. The answer of the Minister was that he did not know, but here at least he was setting up machinery that would tell him and, apparently, would tell the public.  Now, he has had that machinery for five years.  Has the House, has the public, has the Minister got much information from that elaborate machinery, of the efficiency of which he was so confident five years ago?  He, then, could not give the information&mdash;in fact, he said that it was one of the main functions of this commission to provide that information, and I suggest that the public is as much without that information to-day as it was then.  There is this difference, however&mdash;that there is a great deal more vigorous and louder outcry to-day about the prices of commodities than there was in 1932.</P>
    <P>The Minister may remember that the Act of 1932, when it was a Bill, was described by one responsible Deputy as a humbug.  Excuse me&mdash; there were two Deputies.  It was described by another Deputy as a fraud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was so described.  Is the Minister responsible or irresponsible enough to say that these epithets were not justified? What is the whole history of the commission, and what is the whole history of the Minister's administration of it, except a justification of that particular description?  There were two possible lines of development at that time: either an intolerable interference with the ordinary trading life of the community, or else to let the Bill be there as window-dressing, but merely as that.  It is rather cynical, the whole setting up of that Bill and its whole operation, so far as the consuming public were concerned.  I should like to know what advantage the public has got out of five years of this legislation. The most important question that was discussed was the question of flour, and we see the mess into which that has got.  The other matter in connection with which they got a certain amount of fame for themselves was in connection with a pair of boots or a pair of shoes that they found had been overcharged, I think, by 5/-.  That is the work of the commission to a large extent, so far as the public is concerned.  I will admit that they have sent in five annual reports and that they have investigated certain things, but what have they done as regards the control of prices?  I am not blaming the members of the commission. I think the Minister himself almost recognised&mdash;almost confessed, in the concluding portion of his speech, by way of an apology, if not for himself, certainly for the commission&mdash; that they were set an impossible task. Therefore, I am certainly not criticising these citizens of this State, men and women who gave their services voluntarily to this State in this rather futile work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am dealing with the members of the commission, I see they are being cut down to three.  There was a provision in the original Act that of the five members two would be women. That now disappears.  I wonder whether the Minister is so satisfied with the statement as regards the status of women made in Geneva that he thinks it necessary to do nothing <Col N="136" /> here and leaves it out.  There are certain things left out and that is one of them.  It is rather interesting when you compare the two Bills.  A woman might be able to bring as regards prices a point of view that a man might not.  It is rather a pity, even from what I might call the gesture point of view&mdash;the Minister is very keen on making gestures&mdash;that he should cut out that particular provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister enumerated the things done.  What does the public know about them, barring the pair of shoes and the question of bread and flour? There again we have an extraordinary situation.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate if I would be right if I said that some of the changes in this Bill are meant to make general much the same provisions as those sections of the Bread Act to which he referred. I think that would be a correct description.  Look at what happens. You have a commission investigating the price of bread and you have a Bread Act.  In the month of June, or perhaps it was May&mdash;I cannot say for the moment which, but I know it was during the election campaign&mdash; there was again the happy situation that the Minister thought he was justified in cutting down the maximum price of bread.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

It was stated: &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has received a report dated 28th July, 1937.&rdquo;  That commission found that the price of bread must go up because of the world price of wheat.  Were the Minister and his advisers in the dark as regards the investigations of the commission that they left that fact out of account?  It was again a rather lucky <Col N="137" /> thing for the Minister that in the midst of the election campaign he could say: &ldquo;Down goes the price of bread.&rdquo; Many of us risked the prophesy that when the election was over it would go up, and it did.  Of course, that is one of those happy accidents the Minister always brings about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an obvious misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the juggling with bread was a pretty effective misrepresentation.  It struck me as rather amusing that at one time the Minister had in the words &ldquo;the commission will report as soon as may be.&rdquo; That is one of the things, at all events, which he learned from experience, because in the new Bill he leaves out &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;  What can we expect from the new commission?  We see the result of the excellent machinery the Minister set up five years ago.  Every member of the House and every member of the public can make up his mind as to what the public got out of that in the way of benefit. As if they were not marching slow enough, he is not going to put on them the work of the Tariff Commission.  I congratulate the Minister on his conversion to the point of view that one of the things that ought to be investigated is precisely the effect of these tariffs on the price of commodities, but I do not think it will accelerate the work of the commission.  There is a body there capable of doing that&mdash; experts who could have been set to the doing of it for the last five years. Furthermore, they are to report to the Minister.  What is the good of the commission reporting to the Minister, who holds that one effect of the tariffs is that everything is cheaper and better as a result of these tariffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I ask the question I put about information.  The Minister rode off in 1932 with the fact that he had no information, because he had not the machinery to get it.  He has had that machinery for five years now.  When bringing in this as an entirely new Bill we would expect that he would give the information to the House as to the extent to which individuals in this <Col N="138" /> State, be they manufacturers or traders, are actually profiteering.  I am rather doubtful about anything good coming out of these increased powers.  I am convinced that a great deal of the increased cost of living or heavy cost of living that the public has to bear is largely due to the policy of the Government.  There used to be complaints&mdash;and I do not think anybody could be more eloquent or fluent than the Minister in announcing these complaints&mdash;about the slowness of the old Tariff Commission.  Then, as I said, this commission was not going slow enough.  He determines to add to it duties, a large portion of which should be the duties of the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <P>I put a couple of questions to the Minister in order to clarify my mind dealing with certain portions of this Bill.  I cannot say that the answers met the questions I raised.  I would ask the Minister, between this and the next stage, to see could he give definite answers as to what exactly were the powers that were lacking and that he now gets, apart from certain tariffed goods and matters of that kind.  He gives power to this commission to investigate whether a desirable reduction in prices should not be brought about by a modification of the tariffs.  I think that is a correct description of what the Minister said&mdash;in fact, almost word for word.  Desirable from what point of view?  What factors are to be taken into account&mdash;the cost of production here or the capacity of the consumer to pay?  Which of these things must the commission take into account in considering whether reduction is desirable by a modification of tariffs?</P>
    <P>This Bill, of course, like many another Bill from the Minister, like the Act that it is repealing, in its main essentials is an effort at face-saving; an effort to put on somebody else the responsibility that is actually on the shoulders of the Government. The Minister tries to get out of a great deal of the trouble by putting it on the defunct Seanad.  I do not think anybody will think that that is an effective method of doing it.  It was possible to pay the members up <Col N="139" /> to the present.  I suggest that it is clear on the face of the Bill that in that respect this Bill gives the Minister no more power than the existing Act.  He saves two salaries, of course, but considering the large issues at stake, I am rather surprised that that has made the Fianna Fáil Party hesitate for a number of years before replacing the volunteer members of the commission by paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>These are the principal points that I had meant to bring to the attention of the House.  I do not think, so far as relief of the public is concerned, that this Bill will be very much more effective than the existing Bill.  Its operation may be a little bit slower. I doubt if the Minister's optimistic prophecy will be a bit more fulfilled in the present case than in the last case. The Bill, practically, except for a few changes which are desirable, is really a repetition of the existing Act in many respects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Beyond the fact that this Bill is probably a little more lengthy than the previous Act, and that the phraseology of the Bill has undergone some slight changes as compared with the 1932 Act, I cannot discover any great change in the whole method of approach to the control of prices as envisaged in this Bill.  I think that the Bill when it becomes an Act will be found to be as great an illusion to the public as the 1932 Act has been.  For the past five years that Act has been in operation.  Now we get from the Minister a kind of swan song for the Act in which he declares that we have learned something from experience of the past five years under the present Act.  But the public paid very dearly for that experience which the Minister has gained.  The public has had to live in a situation in which the commission was investigating while prices were rising.  Of course, the Minister said that we have got some experience of the operation of the Act in the last five years.  A question was addressed to the Minister to-day by Deputy Davin in which he asked the total number of references to the Prices Commission in regard to which <Col N="140" /> the holding of a public inquiry was considered necessary.  The Minister stated that the total number of such cases was 13, that the commission had completed their investigations into 11 and had presented reports to him on these 11 cases so investigated.  He further stated that nine of these reports had been released for publication and that two, presumably, have not been released for publication. Will the Minister tell us what two have not been released for publication? If he got these two reports, what is the reason for their not being released for publication?</P>
      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health asking him if he could say what was the estimated increase in the price of building materials between 1932 and the present day and the Minister charged with the responsibility for housing in this country said he did not know what the estimated increase was. But the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a report from the Prices Tribunal on the question of building materials.  I think the Minister must have had it for nearly two years, but he has not had time to whisper something into the ear of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to give him some idea of the drift upwards.</P>

I asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to state the estimated percentage increase in the cost of building materials between 1932 and the present date.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has in his possession a report on the cost of building materials and he will not release it.  Why?  What is the purpose of suppressing that report?  What other report is being suppressed and what is the reason for doing it?  We saw a share issue the other day by a firm engaged in the production of <Col N="141" /> building materials and the shares were subscribed 12 times over in a couple of hours.  The Minister has a report in his possession from this tribunal on the question of the cost of building materials and we cannot get it out of the Minister.  The Minister is reluctant to disclose it while a firm engaged in the production of building materials can get their capital subscribed 12 times over in two hours. We learn by experience, the Minister says.  We ought to know from the Minister why these two reports have not been issued, why the public are not being given the information contained in these reports and what is the inside reason for suppressing them.</P>

      <P>We have had this Act in operation for five years and, so far as one can judge, it does not appear that the officer responsible for conducting investigations has spent very much time in conducting investigations. There may have been private investigations; there may have been non-public investigations but, so far as the public are concerned, there is no evidence that there has been any real effort to conduct investigations by the officer responsible for the effective administration of this Act. There have been very few Orders made reducing the prices of commodities. I think that so far as retail prices are concerned, there was only one Order made.  That was on the eve of the recent election, when an Order was made reducing the price of one pair of boots to some outraged customer, and that was blazoned forth in the Press.</P>

What I said was that the Controller of Prices made an inquiry at the request of some outraged customer, and as a result of that inquiry he discovered that this particular customer was overcharged by 5/-, just on the eve of the recent election.  He directed that the customer should get back that amount. That was blazoned forth as an example of the magnificently efficient way in which the Tribunal functions.</P>

      <P>Five shillings after five years, spread over 3,000,000 people! Five shillings on one pair of boots scattered amongst 3,000,000 of people. The members of the commission investigated the price of flour, and they told the Minister that the millers were making £150,000 per year more than was a reasonable profit.  If the commission devoted all the time, the consideration and the care to the examination of this matter that the Minister states, presumably they were qualified to express an opinion on the matter after investigation.  The commission told the Minister that the millers were making £150,000 a year more than was a reasonable profit, and the Minister has done nothing in regard to that.  Although he was made aware of the fact that this amount of money was raked out of the pockets of the consumers of bread and flour, nothing has been done to remedy that situation.  Of course in this Bill the very same defects that were in the previous Act are being perpetuated. The commission will investigate and will report to the Minister.  If the report is of a kind which the Minister does not want published, it will not be published.  When it says that some persons are making £150,000 a year more than they should be allowed to make, the Minister will do nothing, and the situation will drag on in the same delightful way as at present for those who are pocketing the £150,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this Bill is a desperately poor contribution to a situation where the cost of living is rising rapidly. The best evidence of that fact can be <Col N="143" /> found in the Irish Trade Journal published by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am quoting now from the September issue, which was in circulation within the past two days.  Here are the official figures presented by the Department.  They show that the cost-of-living index figure in Mid-February, 1933, was 151, July, 1914, being taken at the base figure of 100.  The index figure had risen from 151 in 1933 to 167 in February, 1937, an increase of 16 points.  In Mid-May, 1933, the index figure was 148, and in Mid-May, 1937, it was 167, 19 points higher.  In Mid-August, 1933, it was 149.  In Mid-August, 1937, it was 171, 22 points higher.  That is the last month for which the figures are available.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which the cost of living is rapidly increasing, as reported by the Department, the Minister offers us an anæmic Bill of this kind, which, in my opinion, will do nothing whatever to relieve the situation of rising prices.  However, figures expressed in a percentage of that kind often do not give Deputies an opportunity of judging the real situation, and it might be better, therefore, to quote some other figures related to the actual prices of commodities. Those figures were furnished to me by the Minister in this House on 10th March, 1937, as reported at column 1401.  I asked the Minister to relate the prices of certain commodities at mid-February in each year from 1933 to 1937, and in his official reply he gave me the figures for Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I asked for the figures for two other places, Tullamore and Naas, but the Minister was not in a position to supply the information from those towns.</P>

      <P>Volume 65, column 1401. Those figures prove conclusively that during the past five years there has been a very substantial upward tendency in the cost of living in this country.  A Bill of this kind is now introduced, having been circulated on the eve of the last election, with the object of controlling prices.  I venture to say that anybody who pins his faith to this Bill is going to discover that it will be just as cruel an illusion as the present Prices Act, and that it will do nothing whatever&mdash;because of the manner in which it is drafted&mdash;to deal with a situation in which prices are rising rapidly.  You have in this country at the present time a flour and bread situation which ought to bestir the Government into taking action in the matter.  The Prices Tribunal appointed by the Minister has told him that the millers are making £150,000 a year more than they ought to be allowed to make, and in view of the fact that bread is now 1/- for a four lb loaf here while it is only 8d. in Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because the Deputy has read it all that he is not satisfied that there is any valid reason why the price of bread here should be so high compared with the price of bread in Great Britain or the Six Counties.  Various efforts have been made to give some explanation as to why bread and flour prices are so dear here.  Apparently all that is going to happen under this Bill in respect of flour and bread will be that the Minister will not do anything in connection with what the millers are raking off from the industry and if anybody complains at a future date he will have another inquiry and the inquiry will go on for months.  If it is suggested to him that he should do something about the matter and that the millers are making abnormal profits, the Minister will simply do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have arrived at a situation where prices are rising so rapidly as to constitute an attack on the standard of living of those who are in receipt of fixed incomes.  Tea prices have gone up, bacon has reached famine prices, although the producers of pigs are not getting anything like a decent return for their produce.  I wonder has the Minister any proposals for dealing with a situation of that kind, apart <Col N="148" /> from the rather harmless ones contained in this Bill?  If there is one industry that ought to be controlled in the national interests, and that lends itself to that, it is the flour industry.  If a case can be made for the establishment of a corporation such as we have in regard to sugar beet, then there are as many, if not more, reasons for doing the same in respect of the flour-milling industry.</P>
    <P>It has been shown that there is a wide disparity of prices, that the miller is raking off £150,000 more than he ought to get; it has been shown that prices here are higher than in Great Britain, and, in a situation of that kind, surely the Minister ought to apply his energy in order to seek an effective remedy by bringing that industry under public control.  Similarly in respect of tea, every individual trader is allowed to buy it where he likes and from whom he likes.  The Minister ought to give some consideration to the idea of the State buying tea in the best markets at the cheapest rate, or creating an agency for that purpose, so as to enable the community to get the benefit of large scale buying of tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time the community is bearing the whole loss, all because of a disinclination on the part of the Minister to remedy the existing situation.  Tea is higher here than in Great Britain, bread is higher, bacon is higher, flour is higher and so also is a whole range of other commodities. If the Minister will only read the journal published by his own Department, and if he has any respect for the figures published therein, he will see perfectly well that that journal provides conclusive evidence that the cost of commodities in this country is much higher.</P>

The commission will make more investigations, they will spend months examining accounts, hearing evidence and presenting reports to the Minister. The awkward ones will be suppressed. In the meantime, the cost of living will increase rapidly and the Minister will <Col N="150" /> tell the people that he has no power under the legislation to do the radical things he is asked to do.  What happened under previous measures of this character?  You had a Control of Prices Act working for the last five years.

      <P>The bacon and flour-milling situation is one that ought to be grappled with immediately.  In a situation like this millers ought not to be allowed to get away with the profits which they have been getting away with, according to the report of the Minister's own tribunal.  The flour industry is one which lends itself admirably to public control, and it ought to be controlled in the public interest so as to give the public bread and flour at the cheapest price.  You are not getting bread and flour at a price to-day which would be possible if the industry were regulated in the interests of the consumers, not of the millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of the increase in the cost of living is having a very serious effect on those tied down to static incomes.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced in 1933.  Certain rates of benefit were provided in that Act.  When it was introduced the index figure was 149. Now the index figure is 170, so that the increase in the cost of living in the meantime has had the effect of drastically reducing the purchasing power of the rates of benefit provided in the 1933 Act. <Col N="151" /> Similarly, in respect of static old age pensions, the increased cost of living has caused a reduction in the purchasing power of that type of income.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they ought to be substantially higher than they are to-day.  What I am mainly directing attention to at this stage is the Minister's apparent unwillingness to grapple effectively with the problem of rising prices here, and I say that those rising prices are having the effect of reducing the purchasing power of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment assistance benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's unwillingness to deal with the present situation of rapidly rising prices is doing it; his keeping these people upon a static income is having the effect of reducing the purchasing power of that small income.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, let the Minister be sensible.  I am saying to the Minister that his permitting an unchecked rise in the cost of living is equivalent to permitting a reduction in the purchasing power of those persons who are tied down to static incomes.  That is the effect of his action.  Is not that the merest commonsense? To-day 10/- will buy less than it bought in 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that it is very unwise for him to start arguing that old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and other pensions should fluctuate with the cost of living.</P>

    <Col N="152" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that I know this subject just as thoroughly as he does.  I know that old age pensions are less now than when they were first granted at the time of the British administration, and I know that the old age pensioners never got the benefit that they should have got because of the rise in the cost of living.  Compared with 1909, the old age pensioners in 1937 are suffering all the time and they will suffer more because of the rise in the cost of living.  As for the Unemployment Assistance Act which the Minister himself introduced, we have the example of a family of persons tied down to 12/6 a week.  In a town with a population of less than 7,000, a man, his wife and five children are in receipt of 12/6 a week.  That is what that family got when the cost-of-living figure was 149, and that family is expected to live on it now when the cost-of-living figure is 170.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>He is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of cutting into logic-chopping of that kind? The fact is that when a man has no other income but that 12/6 a week he is living on it.  Whether the Minister intended that he should live on it or not, that man's income of 12/6 a week is now substantially reduced because of the increase in the cost of living. The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot welcome a rise in prices, or, if he does welcome a rise in prices, then these people should be enabled to meet it.  In the case I have mentioned they are not enabled to meet it.  In that way great hardship is imposed upon them.  Is the Minister telling the public that this Bill is not going to do anything to improve the situation?  In my opinion, time will prove whether I am correct or not.  This Bill will operate in the same way as the previous Bill&mdash;plenty of investigation and a substantial rise in the cost of living.  That is all that the Minister is doing under this Bill.</P>

Speaking on the Second Stage of the Control of Prices Bill on the 20th October, 1932, as reported in column 187, volume 44, No. 1, Deputy Norton said: &ldquo;With Deputy Murphy, who has already spoken for the Labour Party, I welcome this Bill.&rdquo;  I ventured to say, as reported in column 198, volume 44: &ldquo;Before the Ministers disappear I just want to say a word about this Bill.

Yes, the greatest piece of fraud that ever was produced in this country, and remember it was largely produced for the purpose of whitewashing the Labour Party because at that time they were helping the Government Party to increase the cost of the people's living.  I remember warning the Labour Party that the things they were helping the Government to do then were going to place an intolerable burden upon the backs of the consuming public.  I warned them that the Bill of 1932, which was introduced to fool them, was going to have no effect whatever on the cost of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not listen then, and now you are complaining that the cost of living has gone too high for the people and that that Act has no effect at all.  The Minister has told us that he is learning by experience a great many things.  I was tempted to interject: &ldquo;Yes, you have learned a great many things that the people of Ireland knew years ago, but you have learned these things at the expense of the Irish people.&rdquo;  The Labour Party is learning them at the expense of the <Col N="154" /> people.  They are learning them at the expense of the consuming public. What can a Prices Commission set up under this Bill do?  We are going through exactly the same performance and the same smokescreen and fraud in 1937 as we went through in 1932.  All the Prices Commission can tell you is that the price of everything is going up.  If you ask them why it is that the price of everything is going up, the only honest answer is&mdash;&ldquo;because the manufacturers in this country are expected and advised by Deputy Dowdall to take all the advantage they can of the tariffs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking in January, 1935, at a meeting of the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce, Deputy Dowdall said: &ldquo;With regard to the statement that people were taking advantage of tariffs I can only say that it is only human nature to do so, and personally I would avail of them to make as much profit as I could.&rdquo;  That is Deputy Dowdall's public statement of his attitude and it is the attitude of every member of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to tariffs.  The Deputy was chosen as a candidate by the Fianna Fáil Party and he was returned by the Fianna Fáil Party on that gospel&mdash; that you have got a tariff and that you are to avail of that tariff to make as much profit as you can.  You are finding a great many of these tariffs 100 per cent. and 75 per cent.  Deputy Dowdall fixes us with notice that if he gets a 70 per cent. tariff he is going to raise the cost of the article he is producing under that tariff by 70 per cent. He is going to raise the price as high as he can raise it within the tariff walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Prices Commission is going to reduce the cost of living, while Deputy Dowdall has fixed the Minister and his supporters with notice that they will take the fullest advantage of any tariff they put up. If the Minister puts 100 per cent. tariff on an article is not that an invitation to increase the price as close to 100 per cent. as it is practicable to do? And it must be said that Deputy Dowdall is not an ungrateful man, because speaking on the 1st August, 1932, in the Grand Parade in the City <Col N="155" /> of Cork the Deputy said: &ldquo;Firms who have got tariffs and who are waxing fat on them (he was under no illusions as to how the boys were doing it) got more and more money than they ever expected&rdquo; and he said, without putting a tooth in it, that they were &ldquo;damned swine if they did not back the Government that was giving them those tariffs.&rdquo;  Deputy Dowdall afterwards expressed regret for having referred to any people as swine.  But the spoken words stand.  Deputy Dowdall is a prominent industrialist of high standing, and he knows what is going on in industrial circles.  On his authority we are informed that under the tariff policy the industrialists were waxing fat, waxing so fat that he could not believe that any of them would be so ungrateful as not to back up the Government for all they were worth; just to show that they liked getting fat, even at the expense of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>We are going to have a Prices Commission. We are all plain people here.  Is there any man in this country who requires a Prices Commission to tell him that the price of flannelette has gone up; that the price of flour has gone up; that the price of sugar has gone up; that the price of housing has gone up; that the price of shoes, and the price of bacon has gone up? Does anyone want a Commission to tell him that?  The price of flannelette has gone up because a tariff of 33? was put on by the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  They jointly voted for that tariff in this House, with the result that when a working man's wife goes in to buy 3½ yards of flannelette to make a nightdress she pays on an average 10½d. tax on her purchase.  That is the plain, simple fact and it is the truth. That 10½d. could be used by that woman to buy milk for the children, that they are not getting, because she has to buy an article on which there is a tariff of 33? per cent.  Take the price of flour. People are yowling about the price of bread.  The price of bread is controlled by the price of flour, and the price of flour is controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  Every step that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for <Col N="156" /> Agriculture took to raise the price of flour was done with the aid of and with the exhortation of the Labour Party.  They backed them in raising the price.</P>

      <P>Every rational man in this country realises that you cannot have revolutions every Monday morning. In a democratic country the only way you can get acceptance of the law is to secure a full understanding of any question and when a scheme is in operation you have to allow it to go on operating until people come to your view and say it is uneconomic and bad.  Until you can get them to do that, there is no use taking them by the throat and forcing them to do something they do not understand.  I stand on that.  If you are going to raise the cost of flour there is no use in going down to the cross-roads and yowling about the cost of bread.  If you are going to take bread out of the children's mouths, take it out and boast about it.  Do not take the bread out of their mouths with the right hand and chastise the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the left hand.  I warned Ministers that if <Col N="157" /> they raised the price of bread, by getting a subsidy for the wheat scheme out of the bread consumers instead of out of the Exchequer, the result would be to take bread out of the children's mouths.  I say that if the wheat scheme is to be carried on every penny required to maintain it must be taken from the general taxpayer and not from the consumers of bread.  I said that from the beginning.  That is the policy of our Party.  It was never the policy of Fianna Fáil except for the first year.  Labour helped them to change.</P>

      <P>It would be very substantial. The Minister need not try that.  I have forgotten more about the price of bread than he ever knew. The price of bread at present, as to 1½d. on the 4 lb. loaf, is higher here because flour in this country is dearer, compared with Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get plenty of time to answer.  There will be a Committee Stage, when we will go into these matters in greater detail. I will go as far as I think it desirable to go now.  The price of flour in this country is from 10/- to 12/- a sack higher than in Great Britain.  As near as you can go, 7/6 a sack means 1d. on the 4 lb. loaf.  If flour is 10/- higher here than in Great Britain, the cost of flour is responsible for 1½d. of the 3d. difference which at present exists between the price of bread here and in Great Britain.</P>

I do not say that I am familiar with all the details of the milling industry, because I am not.  It is a very close borough. There are comparatively few millers in this country.  It is a highly technical business.  All I know is that the price of flour is 10/- or 12/- higher than in Great Britain, and that increase is partly due&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is ridiculous.  We must not have question and answer. The Deputy can intervene later.  I think he will find we are on the one ground with regard to the milling industry. The point I want to drive home is that, whether the responsibility rests upon the millers or on the grain growers, ultimately the responsibility rests upon Ministers, because the wheat scheme is not inconsistent with a reasonable price for bread.  If the wheat scheme was operated on a subsidy paid out of the Exchequer, the cost of the wheat scheme would fall on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsidy on wheat. If the subsidy was paid by the Exchequer, the cost of bread would not be affected at all.  It is not being paid by the Exchequer, but is being paid out of bread that has to go into the <Col N="159" /> children's mouths.  An agricultural wage of 24/- a week has been fixed. The 4-lb. loaf to-day costs 1/-. Imagine a man with four children going home to his family on Saturday night and the yield of his week's work is 2 dozen of bread.  Out of that wage he has to pay rent, fuel, clothes, and feed the family.  At the present standard of the cost of living, that man's total earnings for the week would be 2 dozen of bread.  It is almost incredible that in the fifteenth year of this country's independence our people could be reduced to such a level.  Look at sugar.  In the last Budget the Government took a substantial sum off sugar.  How many people realise that at present, with sugar ? a stone retail, about 2/6 of that amount is due to the expense of extracting sugar from beet?  Every penny of that is being paid by the consumer.  Here, again, I say that the cost of that product is entirely due to the Government. The fact that the consumers of sugar have to pay that price is due to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Nonsense.  The Minister chops logic <i>ad infinitum</i> and that, with the more gullible of his own supporters, always goes down.  They want to swallow it.  They had tied themselves to President de Valera's tail and they have got to stay tied or die. They are, therefore, prepared to swallow any absurdity the Minister for Industry and Commerce launches in this House.  But other people do not believe that sort of &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;  The price of sugar is, at least, 2/6 per stone dearer&mdash;perhaps it is more&mdash;as the result of our desire to extract it from beet.  That is £1 a cwt. or £20 a ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the price of bacon.  The price of bacon at the present time is from 3d. to 4d. per lb. dearer than it ought to be, because the Government is using the money of the Irish consumer <Col N="160" /> to subsidise the exports of Irish bacon to Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it dearer than in Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Much.  In 1934, seven lbs. of long, clear bacon cost 6/5. To-day it costs 8/9, or 4/8 per stone more.  Suppose that money were going into the pockets of the farmer as increased income, a defence could be made for it.  You might produce some compensating advantage to other sections of the community, but the fact is that it is going into the pockets of the British people as a bounty on our exports of bacon to Great Britain. That bounty is made necessary by the fact that this country is engaged in an economic war with Great Britain.  The Minister does not deny what I have said.  Nobody denies it.  But what is the use of setting up a Prices Commission to tell us that?  We all know it. It can be remedied overnight if the Government want to do it.  They know the reason for the high prices as well as anybody else.  They have given us full and fair notice that they have no intention of remedying these things. They are going to look for reasons for high costs that do not exist and, when they have failed to find them, they will come back in triumph and, like the crowd who looked at the naked Chinese emperor, they will say: &ldquo;There are no high costs.&rdquo;  When Deputy Norton, like the honest little boy, gets up and says that the emperor has no clothes on at all, when he tells the Minister that, his inquiries notwithstanding, the cost of living is high, the Minister will shout him down and say that the high costs do not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, a man earning 12/- a week goes home with two dozen of bread to face his family.  I am no philanthropist.  I do not profess to be a charitable man at all.  My principal anxiety is that when I see a hardworking man&mdash;a man who has done a harder week's work than I have done&mdash; starving with his family, I am quite unable to enjoy the goods the Lord has given me.  For my own peace of mind, I want to see these men with a reasonable standard of living, which they have not got now.  It should be intolerable to any decent man to go to <Col N="161" /> a comfortable home, to sit before a good fire or enjoy a decent meal with the knowledge that there are thousands of families struggling to exist on 24/- a week.  No Christian family can exist upon that wage, and that is the standard wage fixed by the Government for people who work upon the land.</P>

      <P>It is not, but it is affected by this Bill.  What was 24/- five years ago is reduced by what the Government has been doing to the value of 15/-.  The Minister philosophically says that that does not come under this Bill.  The Minister does not have to worry.  He passes the laws and expects miracles to happen.  The laws are passed, but no miracles happen, and the people sink lower and lower into misery and destitution. When people start to talk about the cost of living, they concentrate on foodstuffs.  But you cannot dress a family in bacon, nor can you cover a child's nakedness with butter.  An essential element of the cost of living is the cost of clothes, the cost of fuel, rent and rates.  Remember, a farm labourer who lives in an agricultural labourer's cottage has to pay rates. They are rising and rising fast.  Remember, he has to buy clothes for his children.  Will anybody have the temerity to deny that the cost of clothing has gone up enormously in the last two or three years?  Will anybody deny that the cost of boots has gone up 2/- or 3/- a pair within the past 12 months?  Why?  Is it not largely as a result of the Minister's policy?  You have got to face the fact that if you want industrial development behind a sky-high tariff system, you cannot escape from two things&mdash; one is immediate and the other is remote.  The first is that the standard of living of the people will fall because the cost of everything is going to get dearer and the income of the people will not rise as fast as the prices.  The other is that, ultimately, if you have a sky-high tariff system, you will get Socialism, because, sooner or later, the argument of Deputy O'Brien will <Col N="162" /> prevail.  Deputy O'Brien is a Socialist and proud of it.  His argument is that, if you are going to have a sky-high tariff system, why let a small group of shareholders in companies pluck the public?  If the community is to be plucked, he says, let the community pluck itself.  Can you answer him?  Is there any answer to him?  If we are going to provide 100 per cent. tariffs behind which the community is to be plucked, why should half-a-dozen people on the quays or down the country do the plucking?  Why should we not all have a share in it?  If a handful of feathers are to be taken out of my tail, why should I not get, at least, one feather?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question.  If it is the policy of the Government that a handful of feathers should be plucked out of my plumage every time I make a purchase, surely I am entitled to one feather out of the handful.  At present, five or six small groups of capitalists do all the plucking and get all the feathers and the unfortunate consumer watches his stock of feathers steadily dwindling.  As his covering gets thinner, he shivers more and more while his standard of living falls.</P>
      <P>In that situation, there is no answer to Deputy O'Brien's argument, and I want to resist Deputy O'Brien's argument because I am not a Socialist and I think Socialism is the ultimate disaster that can be brought upon this country, but so certainly as we are standing here, if the present Government's economic policy continues, Socialism is the inevitable and logical conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have Deputy Norton here to-day saying: &ldquo;If you are going to allow the consuming public to be plucked by the flour millers, abolish the flour mills and socialise the industry.&rdquo;  How can you answer it?  If you are going to facilitate the millers to plunder the public, how can you challenge his claim that if the plundering is to be done the community should do it?  I see no answer.  If the individual <i>entrepreneur</i> operating under a capitalist system <Col N="163" /> cannot give good value in competition with other competitors, he has no reason for existence, and the capitalists and industrialists of this country who speak with Deputy Dowdall's voice and who say: &ldquo;They should take advantage of the tariffs; it is only human nature to do so and, personally, they would avail of them to make as much profit as they could&rdquo; are cutting their own throats, because you may do that for a certain time, but if you go on doing it indefinitely, you are going to force an unwilling people to resort to Socialism which will be the supreme disaster for this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day&mdash;he has gone now and I find it hard to tax him with gross inaccuracy&mdash;thought to shake off his shoulders the responsibility for making the initial bread price Order. As a matter of fact, the Minister was indisposed at the time, and the first bread price Order was made by the acting Minister, Mr. Derrig.  When that first price Order was made, the price of bread was not related to the price of flour.  There was a flat price Order made with regard to bread.  It was in the second price Order, founded upon the Prices Commission's report, that the price of bread was related to the price of flour and that is the Order that is operating at present; but it is noteworthy that the actual price of flour has nothing to do with the price of bread, but that it is the price which the Minister says should be the price of flour that affects the price of bread. Very frequently, the price which the Minister says should be the price of flour is not within 4/- of the actual price of flour.  At the present time, the Minister says that the price of flour is 51/- a sack.  The actual price is nearer 54/6.  That is what the millers are getting for it.</P>
    <P>We are going to have three Prices Commissioners set up&mdash;in fact, we are going to have the old Tariff Commission of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government re-established.  We all remember how, in 1932, that commission was swept aside as an archaic and undesirable absurdity.  It is now being resurrected. They have learned by experience that it was the best kind of machinery and the boys are all to be taught now to cheer loudly at the <Col N="164" /> Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis about the lovely new Prices Commission and they will all be blandly ignorant of the fact that they are, in fact, cheering the old Cumann na nGaedheal Tariff Commission about which they got apoplectic at the street corners five years ago. What is going to happen to the members of this commission if they have not got the same kind of security of tenure that a High Court judge has?  If they are honest men and competent men, they have to come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and tell him &ldquo;Any profiteering or any undue cost of goods is due to your tariff policy and you must bring the tariffs down to a reasonable level or the profiteering will go on.&rdquo;  Do you imagine that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to sit down under his own civil servants telling him that he is an ass?  Not at all.  They will be given clearly to understand that they have either to strike the same note as the Minister, or quit.  Remember that we have cases in the Government service of not very long ago when highly respected civil servants were ignominiously kicked out because a Minister did not like the way they were going on, although he could bring no charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That example is before us, and if the members of <Col N="165" /> the Prices Commission are not prepared to strike the same note as the Minister, they may get as short shrift as that distinguished public servant got.  Yet we are told that that commission is going truthfully to report on the cost of living in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to Mr. Edward McCarron, the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The Minister interrupted Deputy Norton to say that the cost of food had not increased in this country as much as it had in Great Britain; but he did not go on to add that the disproportionate increase in the price of bacon, sugar, butter and bread was offset by the fall in the price of meat resulting from the destruction of our market for live stock in Great Britain.  Is that something to be proud of?  Is it something to be proud of that an inflated cost of living at one end of the scale is more than offset by the ruin of our own people and the forcing of our own people to sell the produce of their land at bankrupt prices because their market has been destroyed, at the other?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is proud of that and the poor, miserable Minister for Agriculture is flapping his hands in futile futility in Upper Merrion Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Prices Commission is the same old fraud with a new ribbon tied in its hair, and this new ribbon is the right to advise the Minister that if he does not lower the tariffs or increase the import quotas, there is no other effective way of stopping profiteering.  We told him that in 1932.  The Labour Party, fortunately, in the intervening five years, have learned by experience what we tried to teach by advice in 1932.  I wonder if, even now, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will listen to the joint representations of this Party and the Labour Party as to the urgent necessity for reducing the cost of living? If he will, let him and his friends open their eyes to this fact, that there is only one way effectively to control prices in this country, or in any other <Col N="166" /> country, and that is to allow a reasonable measure of competition to obtain.</P>
    <P>I have a last word to say and I make no apology for saying it.  This Bill is supposed to be the Government's policy for bringing down the cost of living, for abolishing profiteering. It is going to fail and it raises altogether <i>ab initio</i> the whole question of the economic policy this country is going to pursue.  We have to make up our minds whether the present limitless tariff system is going to go on.  If it is, and if the quota system is to be combined with it, there will be no reduction in the cost of living. There will be in this country eventually Socialism and there will be in the world inevitable war.  I am comparing now our method with the Government's method of controlling prices. Our method is a reasonable measure of competition and their method is a Prices Commission to report to the Minister.  I went recently, with some of my colleagues in this House, to the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Paris.</P>

      <P>I suggest to Deputy Kelly, who has had a little more experience, to take care of him for a few moments.  The Deputy seems to imagine that he has strayed into a nursery.  Perhaps he has a rattle in his pocket.  At the Inter-Parliamentary Conference, I listened to representatives from other countries, and eventually I challenged all those Deputies and Senators there assembled to say a word, any of them, in defence of tariffs, and there was not a single Deputy or Senator from any parliament in the whole world who dared to get up in that assembly and say a word in defence of tariffs.  Every delegation, from every parliament from the four corners of the earth, got up and declared that tariffs had brought them only disaster after disaster, and that their sole desire was <Col N="167" /> to see the restoration of a greater measure of free trade throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misinformed.  I invited any Senator or Deputy to get up and speak one word in defence of tariffs, and there was not one amongst them who would do it. On the contrary, there was one matter about which absolute unanimity was secured amongst all the delegations, and that was a resolute calling for greater freedom of trade amongst the nations of the earth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter on which I propose to speak, but what I to say is that the delegations at the Inter-Parliamentary Union are not required, unless they desire to do so, to give vocal expression to their views. However, I am not going to render an account to the House in connection with the delegation from this State to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, but the fact is on record that no single delegation there, and no single individual, got up to defend tariffs.  I am telling the House precisely what I did at the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference, and in doing so I am perhaps more honest than most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because a great many of the Continental representatives who were there wept tears in their desire to get free trade, but when they went back to their respective countries they agitated violently for tariffs because they happened to have a £10 note invested in some industry in the backwoods of Czechoslovakia or the highlands of Roumania, just as we wax eloquent about international co-operation in Geneva, but when we arrive back here we carry on the grand old war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the international point of view, <Col N="168" /> and from the internal point of view, a revision of the tariff policy in this country is absolutely vital.  I say to the Labour Party, that no matter what price-fixing Bill is brought in, no Prices Commission is effectively going to control prices in this country.  They cannot do it because the wool can be pulled over their eyes every time.  The one thing that operates in the continual control of prices night and day, week in and week out, month in and month out and year in and year out is competition. No merchant will charge more for his goods than his competitors charge, and if you have only two merchants competing you are going to get goods sold at the lowest possible penny that they can be produced and distributed at.  So true is that, that if you allow competition to operate unrestricted, it will operate to drive prices too low, because competitors will get so eager to cut prices down that they will start to trench on the minimum wage standards that ought to obtain in their factories and shops.</P>
    <P>I say that our objective should be to get the maximum of competition combined with a legally regulated and accepted standard of living for the wage-earners in industry or trade. Having got that, and having laid down that the wage-earner must not get less than a certain sum for his work, you can then say to the industrialists or the shopkeepers or distributors: &ldquo;Go ahead now, and after you have charged those expenses to your business, make as much profit as you can in open competition.&rdquo;  Having established that system within our own shores, our object should be, if prices are to be effectively kept down, to extend such arrangements beyond our own shores, because, remember, the smaller the group of shopkeepers or manufacturers you have, the greater is the danger of rings being formed.  While the workman gets a fair wage and good conditions, the ring proceeds to exploit the consuming public, to jack up prices until the consuming public rebels and takes a substitute.  The consuming public will prefer to buy the substitute rather than pay the inflated prices that the small group forming the ring are asking <Col N="169" /> for their products.  If you try to extend the principle of unrestricted free trade throughout the world at the present time, you are immediately face to face with dumping from countries which have no set minimum standards for their work people.  That means that they would be competing with our manufacturers who are compelled to maintain the minimum standards which the Dáil by its legislation has considered right and proper for our work people.  A way to get round that is, I suggest, by adopting the policy of the Oslo group of nations, a policy which has had a great success. Go to the International Labour Office and say: &ldquo;Take this group of industries in so many countries and fix a minimum standard of wages and conditions for that group to apply to all those countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Invite the International Labour Office to come here and say: &ldquo;There is a standard; will you get six other countries to conform to it?  Because, if you can do that, we are prepared to enter into free trade relations with them.  We do not trust their Governments any more than we are asking their Governments to trust us, but we can trust the International Labour Office, and ask it to force us in our country to maintain those standards and at the same time force five other countries to maintain the same standards in their countries. With those standards maintained we want free trade, and we want free trade in order that competition may operate to prevent our industrialists exploiting our community or the industrialists of the other five countries exploiting theirs.  There is a last precaution that we want you to take.  We are prepared not to put up tariffs against those other countries provided they do not employ inverted tariffs against us, and by inverted tariffs we mean export bounties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States at the present time say that, if any Government gives an export bounty on anything exported to the United States, they will put on a tariff equal to whatever that bounty may be.  We should take care to say <Col N="170" /> to those countries that if they put an export bounty on anything they send here that we will put a tariff on it equal to the amount of the export bounty, because an export bounty is an inverted tariff.  If you do what I have outlined you will get an effective machine which will prevent the formation of rings.  You will prevent attempts at debasing the standard of living of the people, and you will secure at the same time to the consuming public reasonable value for the money they pay out.</P>
    <P>I state without fear of contradiction that that is the only scheme that will secure these three things.  No other scheme that can be devised will do it. If you are to go on setting up Prices Commissions from now until doomsday you will not get what I want, because those Prices Commissions will be sidetracked and fooled.  The scheme that I have outlined will get what I have told you, and get it without any kind of interference by the State except in so far as States insist on the maintenance of reasonable labour conditions under the direction of the International Labour Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister interrupted Deputy Norton and said to him: &ldquo;How are you going to control prices if you do not like the contents of this Bill?&rdquo;  I think there is force in that challenge. I have outlined the way we would do it, the way we think it ought to be done, and I say that our way will work and that it will secure for our people a higher standard of living, a sound, solid, continuous industrial development and, at the same time, will protect our consumers.  I say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce's way is going to fail in all three particulars. I say that his industrial policy is resulting in slave conditions for many of the workers, in the employment of young people in preference to grown-ups, in the exploitation of the consuming public on an unheard-of and unprecedented scale, and I say that the Government policy has produced only one general all-over-the-country fixed wage, and that is a wage of 24/- a week for agricultural workers. I say that that is one of the greatest scandals and public shames to which this country has ever been submitted <Col N="171" /> in its history.  Just imagine that the first agricultural wage fixed by an Irish Government, for the world to behold, is 24 &ldquo;bob&rdquo; a week.  It must be the lowest wage fixed by any civilised Government in the world&mdash;certainly by any Christian Government in the world.  There may be lower rates of wages fixed in the East&mdash;if there are, I do not know of them&mdash;but certainly it is the lowest wage that any Christian, democratic country in the world would dare to fix; and that is the first gesture that we made in the fixing of working conditions and wages for our own people.  Is it not appalling that that should be the result of five years of Fianna Fáil's economic policy?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a fraud, just as the Bill that was introduced five years ago was a fraud.  The last Bill was a plain, homely fraud.  This Bill is done up in frills and furbelows; but the frills and furbelows of this Bill will perish in the next five years and we will see it is the same silly and futile fraud as was the Bill of 1932.  There is, happily, an alternative which would achieve all that this Oireachtas wants it to achieve, and I can only hope that the people of this country will afford those who are prepared to put that into operation an opportunity to do so soon.</P>

I am not repeating a private conversation.  I would apologise to the House and to Deputy Dillon if I were repeating a private conversation, and I would ask the Deputy to explain what he means by suggesting that I am repeating a private conversation.  Delegates were there from all parts of the world&mdash;or at least a limited number of them just before luncheon&mdash;listening to him, and there are three or four in the House&mdash; I see that there are five now&mdash;who were listening to it.

      <P>Deputy Dillon has accused the Labour Party&mdash;and it is true&mdash;with having welcomed the introduction of the forerunner to this Bill in 1932.  We certainly did, because we hoped and believed that an honest attempt would be made to administer the measure which we were supporting at that time.  We have criticised the administration of that Act many times since it was introduced, and we have raised many questions in connection with the control of prices and the failure of the Ministry to use the powers which we helped to give them by our votes in this House in 1932.</P>

      <P>In what way?  We accused the Minister, and I accuse him now, of having refused to carry out the report submitted to him by the Prices Commission in connection with the profiteering which was proved to have been carried out at a certain period by the flour millers of this country.  The report was presented to him by the Prices Commission, and I presume that it was a unanimous report.  That report was presented after evidence had been taken on oath from the millers and other people <Col N="174" /> interested in the matter; and after the evidence had been carefully examined by the members of the commission they finally reported that the millers were making £150,000 per year profit in excess of what the commission regarded as a reasonable profit. Does the Minister deny that he received such a report?</P>

      <P>Assuming such a position exists now, or will exist in the future, or that a future report could be justified, is the Minister now satisfied that he has power under the Bill to deal with a situation of that kind, and if he has, will he have the courage to face up to it and deal with it in the interests of the community?  No small body of people in this country like the flour millers have a right to rob the community in the way the Prices Commission have suggested they are doing.  I do not care if I am called a Socialist by Deputy Dillon or anybody else; I prefer the socialism which stands for the control of a key industry like flour milling rather than to allow a small number of individuals to rob the community.</P>

If it can be proved, as it has apparently been proved in this case, that the flour millers have been taking advantage of that situation, it is the duty of the Minister under this Bill, or some other powers which he will take with the leave of the majority of the House, to face up to that situation, and, if necessary, take control of a key industry of that kind.</P>

      <P>I think the community have to be protected.  The Minister suggested in a cross-talk with Deputy Norton that wages here had some bearing upon the increased price of flour compared with the price paid in Great Britain.  Would the Minister say what additional employment the flour millers of this country, who have got a monopoly here, have provided in their flour mills since they got the monopoly and what is the percentage increase which they have given to their workers as compared with the increased price of flour and see what the workers got out of it?</P>

      <P>The Minister was trying to prevent Deputy Norton from saying things that he did not like.  That is what I understood to be the meaning of the interruption at one period. Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan criticised, and they are rightly entitled to criticise, the control of prices policy supposed to be carried out by the Government.  While they criticised in a very effective way on many occasions the administration of the existing Act, they refused to put any alternative for the purpose of controlling prices or preventing profiteering.  The solution of this whole problem, in the opinion of Deputy Dillon, is free trade.  What he seeks is fair competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the Fine Gael Party, so far as I know, supported the policy of limited protection.  If we are going to give protection to industrialists to establish industries that <Col N="178" /> can be established in this country, we must have some machinery either under a Bill of this kind or some more effective machinery to control the prices of the articles which they manufacture and sell.  That applies to the clothing trade.  I agree that there is profiteering, and, I understand, a considerable amount of profiteering going on in the clothing industry.  The Minister should know more about that than Deputy Dillon, who is supposed to know more than anybody in this House about everything.  Deputy Dillon says he knows more than anybody in the House about flour.</P>

      <P>He suggested that he knew more than the Minister about flour milling, but he is afraid to face his flour-milling friends by saying that he is in favour of control of prices.  I was present at an election meeting in 1932 in a town in my constituency when a very prominent man in the flour-milling industry presided at what was then a Cumann na nGaedheal election platform.  In this town, where he was giving a fair share of employment to workers&mdash;and he is a good employer, I admit&mdash;he said that if the Cosgrave Party was defeated in the election he would have to sit down and very carefully and calmly, after the result had been announced, consider whether he would not close down his flour mills. I invite the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Dillon in particular, to find out where that famous flour miller was in the last general election in that constituency.  He would not dream, I understand, of being seen near a Fine Gael platform.  He had found other friends in the Fianna Fáil Party, because they had given him this protection which enabled him to make higher profits under this protection scheme for the flour millers than Fine Gael ever did or would ever dream of doing.  He would not go out and be seen near a Fine Gael platform during the last election.  If I am correctly informed, and I have not very bad information, he gave a decent subscription to the Party to whom he gave his vote at the last election.</P>

The Minister in his speech wanted to make it appear that there is no unusual increase in the cost of living as compared with the cost of living across the Border or in Great Britain.  Is he aware that the price of bacon here&mdash;not first-class bacon either &mdash;is 1/8¼ per lb. as compared with ? in Great Britain and Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of cheese here is something like ¼ as compared with 10d. in Northern Ireland and Great Britain?  Would the Minister admit that there is profiteering here in the prices charged for vegetables to the poor of Dublin and the other big cities?  Cabbage has been sold to my own knowledge in parts of the City of Dublin in the past few weeks at the rate of 6d. per head.  Will the Minister find out what the farmers of County Dublin are getting for that in the market?  It would not require the services of very many people to supply information of that kind to the Minister.  I wonder would he even go so far as to say that the farmers were getting a penny per head for cabbage while the consumers in the city are being charged 6d. per head? Is there anything like profiteering carried on in that instance?  If the Minister knows anything&mdash;and he knows a fair share; he will not admit all he knows&mdash;he knows that profiteering has been carried on on a huge scale in this country, particularly in the cities and in the provincial towns. <Col N="180" /> Although he has certain powers which he could have used effectively if he liked, he has not used these powers to eliminate profiteering wherever it is apparent.  If he is going to use this Bill in the same way as he used the previous Act, I agree with Deputy Dillon that this Bill is a farce.  The last Act was entitled to be called a farce because it was administered in a farcical manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  So far as I am personally concerned, so long as you get the best men that can be found in the country, I do not care how high their salaries may be because if they do their duty they will save for the people a thousand times more than the amount of their salaries.  I happen to have the acquaintance of the individual who has been acting as part-time chairman. I regret that he has not been acting in a full-time capacity because I am sure that if the commission had had the <Col N="181" /> advantage of his wonderful experience and brains in a full-time capacity, the activities of the commission would have been much more fruitful during the past five years.  I hope the Minister will search the country, from one end to the other, to find the ablest and the brainiest men that can be found and I hope he will advise the Minister for Finance to pay them good salaries for doing the work that requires to be done and done as quickly as it can be got in hands.</P>
      <P>Whatever we may think about the activities of the Prices Commission with the limited powers at their disposal and with the limited time which they had to devote to this work, I have no hope whatever that prices are going to be controlled or that profiteering will be eliminated by the policy advocated by Deputy Dillon in this House. Deputy Dillon as I say, even though he knows he is expressing views that are not in agreement with the views of members of his Party, will continue as long as he can, to advocate free trade and to ignore the world-wide fact that every country is trying to carry on and survive under a policy of protection and tariffs.  If Deputy Dillon would come to the House with information that those big countries were prepared to go back to a policy of limited free trade, one might be inclined to sit down seriously to consider the consequences of a policy of that kind, but with the world in the condition in which we now find it, there is no alternative to protecting ourselves against the dumping of commodities&mdash;articles that can be dumped here and in other small countries under a free trade policy.  If, however, we are to assist in maintaining existing industries under a policy of protection, and if we are going to give protection to the capitalist who is prepared to put his money into industry, it is the duty of every man to see that the tariffs are not availed of for the purpose of fleecing the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a personal explanation on a statement which has been quoted against me on two or three occasions by Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan.  These Deputies have referred to a statement which I made on a certain occasion at a meeting <Col N="182" /> in Cork, of the Chamber of Commerce there.  What they have said is partly true, but they do not quote the whole of the statement which I made, and I should like it to go down now definitely on the records so that I shall not be misrepresented in the same manner in future.  What I said on that occasion was in reply to a statement by the President of the Chamber of Commerce that he hoped that the manufacturers would not take advantage of the tariffs to charge excessive prices or to give inferior quality.  I simply said in reply to that that he was expressing only a pious hope, that that was all it was, and that, human nature being what it was, people would like to make as much as they could, would try to make as much as they could, and that I, in their position, would probably do the same.  As a matter of fact, we have not done so.  We could have done so to a much greater extent than we have.  However, I added&mdash;and this is the point I wish to be borne in mind&mdash; that competition would settle that. Deputy Dillon, towards the end of his own speech, referred to competition as one of the remedies for profiteering.  I said on that occasion that competition would settle that without any Government regulations or legislation.  That was not quoted either by Deputy Dillon or by Deputy McGilligan on previous occasions, and they put a wrong complexion altogether on what I stated.  There was another report of a statement by me which Deputy Dillon repeated and in which it was alleged that I said that certain people who did not support the present Government were swine.  I sometimes do use rather bad language and probably I said something like that, but what I said really was that those industrialists who were taking advantage of Government legislation to make excessive profits and who do not support that Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Dillon assumes a whole lot of hypotheses and then tells us what is going <Col N="183" /> to happen.  He said that if there was going to be 100 per cent. tariff on certain commodities, we would soon arrive at Socialism in this country.  Nobody intends to put a tariff of 100 per cent. on anything, but it is the policy of this Government, as set forth at all the elections, to encourage the industrial arm of this country and anything that is necessary to make that policy effective will be done.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that one thing which the introduction of this Bill has brought about is the practical unanimity with which every speaker, so far, has admitted that the present prices need reducing.  So far, we have not had a Deputy on any side getting up and saying that the price of commodities is not too high.  The Minister in his opening speech, I suppose in order to get himself out of his present difficulty, referred a good deal to the past, and to what might have been done or ought to have been done or was intended to be done in the previous ten years.  Then, having departed from that, he said that they were the first to bring in any attempt to control prices; that in this country, except in war times, there was never any attempt made, previous to the advent of Fianna Fáil, to control prices.</P>

      <P>In regard to that, whether the Minister said it or not, I should like to say that, except in war time, no such prices ever existed in this country as were charged in the last five years, and the cause is not altogether the fault of the manufacturers or the retailers.  The Minister himself, in explaining the Bill, came to the kernel, the root cause of all that the people have been suffering through increased prices in the last five years. Elaborating the extra powers that should be given to the commission in this amending Bill, I was particularly struck by one sentence of the Minister when he said that one increased power to be given to them was power to recommend a diminution&mdash;I think that was the word&mdash;or certainly a variation of the duties on imports.</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks and believes it is necessary to give the commission powers to recommend a variation&mdash;I think he said a diminution&mdash;in the existing duties on imports.  In that one sentence he came to the root cause of the trouble.  It is the only sentence that is any use in this Bill, and the one thing that might be adopted as a solution of the present difficulty in which people find themselves on account of the big prices charged for commodities.  The Minister, in answering an interrupter a moment ago, said there was no duty on wheat.  He was correct but unfair&mdash;a man can be correct and unfair&mdash;when he said there was no duty on wheat.  Everybody knows there is no duty on wheat.  The Ministry, instead of paying the subsidy themselves, took it off the Exchequer and asked the millers to collect it.  Of course the millers are collecting it and charging it to the consumers.  The Minister was correct and unfair.</P>

      <P>If there was any good to be got out of a Control of Prices Bill we ought to have reaped some benefit out of the Bill of two or three years ago.  I do not say it could have created perfection in a month or two, or in a year or two, or even in three of four years, but we ought to have reaped some benefit.  If the Minister or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil can get up in this <Col N="186" /> House and convince me that the general public reaped one atom of benefit out of the Bill which we are amending, I will send the Minister a bouquet of roses and I will pay the postage on it.  I did not get up to delay the House by giving an elaboration of the increased cost of various articles, as Deputy Davin rightly did. I do not want to go over the ground which Deputy Davin has already covered.  He alluded to several items the cost of which is infinitely more here than it is in a neighbouring country, or in the neighbouring part of this country, which unfortunately at the present moment&mdash;or maybe fortunately for themselves&mdash;is not under the Fianna Fáil Government.  I was recently in the North, and I had an opportunity to compare the price of the common daily articles which I myself produce and which of necessity every unfortunate consumer in this country must buy.  I found that in every individual case the price was far below that which the unfortunate purchasers in this part of the State have to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the common articles which the people in this country have to buy.  There was not a thing which we eat or use in any way that was not cheaper up in the Black North than it is here in the free and glorious Free State.  I am glad that the Bill has had this benefit&mdash;that is what I rose to say&mdash; that it has drawn from almost every <Col N="187" /> Deputy who has spoken in this House an admission that some solution of the unfortunate position of the consumers in this country must be found. It is not going to be found in this Bill. Even if I rouse the ire of some Deputy like Deputy Davin, or some Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches, or the Deputy who is going to follow me, I will say that the one solution is on the lines of the admission by the Minister himself when he put into this Bill a clause empowering the commission to recommend a diminution of the import duties.  It is in the elaboration of that idea that you are going to find a solution.  I do not care if I am called a dyed-in-the-wool free trader as nearly a dyed-in-the-wool free trader as any Deputy in this House.  If any Deputy has realised the blessings and benefits of a high protective policy I give him all the glory he finds in it, but I for one&mdash;and I believe I am followed by the great bulk of the consumers in this country&mdash;believe that the import duties in this country are far too high, and that where they are too high, which is in numerous instances, advantage is taken by the manufacturers to reap the full benefit which the law gives them in regard to duty.  The price of nearly every article which is consumed or used in this State is far beyond what in reason it ought to be.  I am not going to deny that here and there in the State there may be a little profiteering.  There always has been some little profiteering, but if we are the over-shopped people in this State that the returns recently issued show us to be, if we have a shop for every 60 or 70 people, then surely there must exist enough retailers competing amongst themselves to keep down prices.</P>

      <P>If there is profiteering, a retailer could afford to sell lower than the rest.  If there is one honest trader in this country competing against his brethren and he sells at a reasonable profit, then, if other retailers are profiteering, he is going to collar their business, because the people will purchase from him.  I do not believe there is profiteering in this State to the extent that is reported.  Certainly it is not the root cause of the evils we are trying to cure.  Any attempt to legislate along that line is not going to cure the trouble.  If there is a cure to be found for this vile evil that the people are suffering from since the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government, it must be along the line of a diminution or a variation of the highly excessive duties that are charged on every commodity coming into this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot of charges made here to-night, particularly in connection with the price of flour and the price of bread.  The principal argument used by Deputy Dillon seems to be that our flour millers were profiteering, that everybody was profiteering, and if flour was imported from the foreigner the same as previously, everything would be right. Free trade.  I would like to take Deputies back to 1925, when the price of imported wheat was 12/- per cwt., or 30/- a barrel, just the same as the price of imported wheat to-day.  At that period our flour millers were working two and a half days a week and, if we take the report of the Tribunal on Prices for 1927, the price of flour at that time was 53/6.  That is what we were then paying John Bull for flour. We did not hear any noise about profiteering then; it is not profiteering when it is done across the water.  The price of bread at that time was 1/- per 4-lb. loaf, the same as it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that if we get back to that condition of things, if we throw our mill workers out on the roadside and let the mills work two or three days a week, the same as the Midleton Mills were working when we took over, or if they are allowed to close down altogether, the same as the Clondulane mills were, then, according to <Col N="189" /> Deputy Dillon, everything in the garden will be lovely.  I do not know whether there is profiteering in the price of wheat or flour.  On reading the commission's report, I find that they ascribe a difference of ½d. per 4-lb. loaf to the difference in wages and output between the bakers here in Dublin and in Belfast.  That is mentioned on page 28 of the tribunal's report for 1927.  The information I have got shows that an assistant baker in Cork City bakes 25 per cent. less and is paid 20 per cent. more than a foreman baker in the City of London.  I wonder whether that item will be referred to by Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton?  Facts are facts and sometimes they are rather stubborn things. I also learned that the ordinary workers in flour mills in Cork are paid from 4/- to 6/- a week more than those engaged on similar work in Liverpool. Perhaps Deputy Davin and Deputy Norton will inquire into those facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to home-grown wheat.  He is very fond of making a noise about home-grown wheat.  The price of imported wheat is 30/- and the Government guarantee the price of Irish wheat at 26/6.  The organised farmers in this country have succeeded in forcing that price up to 30/6, sixpence more than the imported article.  If the Irish farmer can get a market here worth between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000 a year for stuff that we previously bought from the foreigner, then he is entitled to it and there will be no apology from those benches for giving it to him, not even to Deputy Dillon.  Even some Deputies on the opposite benches think that these prices should be higher.  There are some Deputies over there who do not grow much wheat themselves, but they attend meetings and they say the farmers should have got more than 30/6.  These are the facts.  We have Deputy Dillon getting up here and making a general attack on everybody.  He goes back to 1932 and quotes or misquotes a speech made by Deputy Dowdall.  Apparently Deputy Dillon was not above following out the supposed advice that Deputy Dowdall is alleged to have given him.  Deputy Dillon spoke of pulling every feather out of the tail of the Labour Deputies a while ago. <Col N="190" /> On that matter and on all this profiteering business, I suggest that Deputy Dillon was not satisfied with pulling a feather out of the tail.  He took the whole of the tail in the profit-making business.  I have in my hand the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of last Saturday and, as regards prices, that paper tells me that the firm of Monica Duff and Company of Ballaghaderreen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, considering that Deputy Dillon made personal attacks on everybody else, he deserves it. Still and all we will let him go.  We must be generous.  When you compare the position and see where the default lies, where is the use of those people over there on the Fine Gael Benches shouting free trade arguments?  Let us take the actual position in regard to flour in 1926 and the position to-day. Take the number who are employed in our flour mills to-day and with that compare the position that obtained in 1926 and in 1932 in our flour mills.  It appears there is no question of profiteering so long as it is the foreigner who profiteers.  Then it does not matter.  But we have the figures of those prices, and I invite Deputies to read and compare them. Let them get the tribunal report of 1927.  Let them get the price of imported flour in 1926 and compare it with the price here, and see exactly where is the change.  The price of imported wheat at that time was the self-same as it is to-day.  The price of baker's flour at present is 53/6.  The price of baker's flour in 1927 was 53/6. So that, apparently, flour is costing the same when it is turned out by Irish millers as when it was turned out by foreigners.  The price of the 4-lb. loaf delivered then was 1/-.</P>

There is a temptation apparently in new industries to profiteer. It is undoubtedly a temptation that will take careful watching.  These matters will have to be watched.  I will just give one instance of that sort of thing.  A fortnight ago, at the South Cork Board of Assistance, we got three tenders for beef and mutton. We decided the prices were too high and that we would re-advertise.  We did re-advertise, and at the following meeting we had fresh tenders.  In the second tenders the price of beef was reduced by 11/- a cwt., and the price of mutton by 8/- a cwt.</P>

      <P>That is why I maintain that a Bill like this is absolutely necessary and it is a Bill that should be operated quickly.  The Bill before the House, in my opinion, is not harsh enough.  A Bill of this class should be worked with penalties.  It should be worked very tightly by penalties and there should be gaol sentences for gross profiteering.  This thing has got to be stopped and there must be no hesitation about stopping it.  We have had the dictum used here to-night that the whole cause of high prices is the fact that we are working our own industries.  That is a dictum that will not bear examination in view of the figures I have given here, figures that are borne out by the tribunal report. Portion of the higher price as compared with the cost in England is, apparently, due to the higher cost of labour.  The tribunal report of 1927 shows that there is a difference in the turnout of the bakers here as compared with Belfast of ½d. per 4 lb. loaf.  That is ½d. that should be reduced if the bakers here were paid the same wages as the bakers in Belfast.</P>

      <P>I do not believe in cutting down.  I believe in fair play. When we hear so much talk about the miserable wage paid here, we must certainly consider the statements like that contained in the tribunal report. Surely there is nothing that should prevent a baker in this part of Ireland from turning out as many loaves of bread as are turned out in every other part of the world.  We claim that Irishmen are as good workmen as anyone else, and what is wrong with them that it should cost ½d. more to <Col N="193" /> produce a 4lb. loaf?  That is what I want to know.  According to individual master bakers in Dublin, output varies from 13½ to 14 sacks per man per week in Dublin, while in Belfast it was from 20 to 24 sacks.  That is nearly double.</P>

That might be the reason so many Cork bakers are coming to Dublin, because they are better workers.  To my mind that is the explanation of the position.  With regard to flour, let us examine what occurred here.  Our charge against the Fine Gael Party, that was the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, is that they are not in earnest in regard to starting Irish industries, that they had no intention of starting Irish industries; that their anxiety was to kill whatever industries we had.  We had an old sinner and a young convert speaking this evening. Deputy Bennett is an old sinner in this matter, and an old Cumann na nGaedheal man, and the new convert is Deputy Dillon, both of them preaching the same thing.</P>

      <P>I maintain that our statements regarding the policy of the Opposition in the past have been fully borne out by their statement of policy here to-night, and the results of that policy.  In 1932 we found our flour mills closed down or nearly finished off.  Now we have got them in full working order, and working overtime.  The worst that can be said of them is that they are no bigger thieves than the English firms that were here before.  Granted that they are profiteering, that they are doing everything that has been stated, and robbing us right, left and centre, they are no bigger thieves than the English ones who were fleecing us before.  When the price of foreign wheat was 30/- a barrel they were charging 53/6 in Ireland for their flour. When I hear Deputies on the opposite benches speaking about the future of the industrial revival&mdash;God save us&mdash;I think it would be well if they were to gag Deputy Dillon or to transfer him from the Party, if they are going to continue to claim, that they stand for Irish industrial revival.  They should do the same thing with Deputy Bennett.  I am quite frank about it.  I am heartily of the same opinion as Deputy Dowdall, that the temptation to overcharge and to profiteer in industries is there, and that that is a position which must be watched.  It is also a position which should not prevent us getting our industries going, so as to get employment for our own people as against the policy of Deputy Dillon, that no matter a hang what was paid the foreigner, so long as it was foreign stuff, it was all right.  That was the policy preached by Deputy Dillon this evening.  While Deputy Dillon attacked profiteers, he went then and took shelter by saying that he did not <Col N="195" /> know the regulations when caught profiteering himself.</P>

      <P>They said that if they did not get a tariff they could not compete, as flour milling here was uneconomic. These are the facts.  I agree with Deputy Corish and with the Labour Party and with everyone else that this Bill is a necessity, as the people are being fleeced.  Is the Bill able to deal with the position?  That is the only question.  Why has the cost of living gone up?  Everyone knows the reason perfectly well.  It is because of the duties, the restrictions, the bounties, the subsidies, and all that kind of thing&mdash;because as far, as the policy of the Government is concerned, it has been a haphazard policy, one that was never thought out.  Deputy Corry and the Minister know that well.  Then, we have this smoke-screen presented to the House.  It is very easy to be misled by this Bill.  A controller is mentioned in a number of sections, but I cannot find his duties defined anywhere in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The commission has the right to make inquiry into the duties and restrictions and to report. From that, we might reasonably expect that something would be done and that there might be a reduction in the number of restrictions.  We might be lulled to sleep by that provision, but we find by Section 32 that the Minister is not to make a price Order or price restriction-of-profits order unless he has received from the <Col N="197" /> commission a recommendation to make such Order.  In making such Order, the Minister shall not be obliged to give effect to the terms, or any of them, of the recommendation.  We have a commission set up and we have a controller whose duties are not defined.  We have this expensive machinery and this smoke-screen, but, according to another provision in the Bill, the Minister need not publish any part of the commission's recommendation and need not act on anything the commission recommend.  He can make a price Order without regard to the findings of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not on the question of price.  You did not accept their recommendation with regard to the subsidising of certain mills.  After all we have heard from Deputy Corry and Deputy Dowdall, one would think that this Bill would reduce prices and control excessive profits.  The Minister, however, allows himself this way out.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to certain coincidences just before the election.  The Minister made an order reducing the price of bread at a time when the commission was finding that bread should be dearer because of the price of flour.  In Section 32, the Minister is giving himself liberty to determine that prices should come down if it suits the political situation. He can make, not an election promise, but an election order.  It is very interesting to hear Deputy Dowdall endeavour to explain away the words he used at the meeting of Cork Chamber of Commerce.  I hope everybody is convinced that he did not intend to make undue profits out of the tariffs, but I am afraid it would take a lot to convince us of that.  Deputy Corry is inclined to agree with Deputy Dowdall, although Deputy Dowdall told us nothing except that if certain people were making undue profits out of tariffs, they should at least contribute to the Government funds.</P>

I should like to help the Minister in connection with this matter, but I do not think we can devise machinery to deal with it.  Government policy is too much involved in restrictions, quotas, tariffs, bounties and subsidies, which have forced up the cost of living and forced down the standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Act of 1932 came rather as a shock to this House, considering the large number of tariffs imposed upon various new articles. Side by side with that Bill, however, was a Control of Prices Bill, which led certain Deputies to believe that there would be a reasonable measure of control over any increases of price.  I was not one of those who thought that prices would not advance with the tariffs.  I said at that time that the manufacturer would probably raise the price to the full amount of the tariff. I regret to say that that has happened and that the Control of Prices has not <Col N="199" /> had the effect which was anticipated. Year after year since then, every Finance Act has increased the duties on various articles.  No migrant, man or woman, who has gone from this country but has brought back the information that the cost of living in England is lower than it is in this country.  Therefore, we may assume that the Control of Prices Act did not provide an effective restriction on the manufacturers of this country who were inclined to yield, as Deputy Dowdall said, to temptation and to take undue advantage of the tariffs. That has happened.</P>
      <P>With regard to the flour mills alluded to by Deputy Corry, nobody would rejoice more than I at any increase of employment given by these mills. Unfortunately, they have not given the employment anticipated because the greater share of the profits has gone into the mill owners' pockets.  While a certain amount of employment may be given, there has not been that measure of employment as a result of the control of the milling industry that was anticipated.  This industry is operating in my constituency and we have it from the mill workers that the amount of employment given is most disappointing.  The answer as to whether the cost of living has increased or not was given by Deputy Corry who, I am sorry, is not here to bear out what I say.  He pointed out that the bakers bake 25 per cent. less and get 25 per cent. more and that the mill workers are paid 5/- a week more than the mill workers in Liverpool.  Is not that an effective answer to those who contend that the cost of living has not advanced?  It is a definite answer because every increase in the cost of living means an increase in the wages which have to be paid.  In fact, it is an absolute indication that wages must go up when the cost of living goes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>They have gone up as far as it is possible to force them and as far as it is possible for the people to bear.  The agricultural community are supposed to be the chief producers in this country, but the cost of almost every article connected with agriculture <Col N="200" /> has definitely gone up.  Agricultural machinery, manures, feeding stuffs, hardware of every description&mdash; all have gone up substantially and we have not received the price we have a right to expect and which the industry which is the chief source of production in this country should demand.</P>
      <P>There is one method whereby we can bring about a reduction and that is by having a competition in prices.  Whatever the faults of the cattle trade may be&mdash;I do not intend to go into that now&mdash;we were able to make a living by cattle, but we are not able to make a living by those crops which are supposed to be the special care of Government policy at present.  The price of wheat and the very limited output from the land mean that wheat growing is not a paying proposition.  The farmers in this country have accepted Government policy.  They are acting up to it and have done their best to carry it out, but, even with the bounty, the crop is not a paying crop.  Barley and oats pay much better and, therefore, I say that this Bill is a failure.  I regret to say that while promises were made with regard to the Prices Commission which gave us reason to expect that it would be an effective instrument in controlling prices, it has failed to carry out what was promised in the Control of Prices Act.  The Tariff Commission we had in the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was an effective instrument in deciding what tariff would be effected.  It might have had its faults, but there is no question as to its ability to safeguard the honest manufacturer who did his best and who, after expert advice had been secured, got a certain tariff.  It certainly shut out men who were not able to manufacture in this country and not able to compete with the prices in England.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill but I fear it will not be able to cope with the present situation. The allegation that we are free-traders has been flung across the House at us.  I would say that when our Party took over the reins of government here, they set on foot a tariff policy over which we are not in the least ashamed or afraid to stand.  I <Col N="201" /> remember 40 years ago when we were all united in the Irish Ireland movement, all that was asked of the people of this country was that they should give a preference to Irish manufacture. I may say that I always went further than that myself, but we must remember that there are people in this country to-day who, in the Government's view, are worth only 24/- a week.  How are those people going to buy commodities at their present prices?  Many unfortunate men in this country are in need of a pair of boots to-day.  I was over in the North of England during the last week in August and I made it my business to look around the shops there.  I saw a fine, solid pair of working boots with nails in them marked in a window at 12/11.  I suggest that the Labour Deputies in this House should find out what the price of those boots would be in this country.  I only regret that I did not buy that pair of boots, pay the tariff and show them in this House to let the people see what is happening in connection with some of the industries established here.</P>
      <P>I say that we have no apologies to offer for our policy in connection with Irish industry.  The late Government established the Tariff Commission and, when a manufacturer in this country wanted a tariff, he could put in an application to that commission, those who were opposed to it could make their objections and that commission&mdash; and I am sure nobody will deny it&mdash; reported impartially as to the effects which that tariff would have on the people.  Their duty was to find out what it was going to cost the people and what employment would be given as a result of it.  Will the Deputies on the Government Benches deny that at that time they said that tariffs would not increase the cost of living?  Are they of the same opinion to-day?  Will they deny that their own tariff policy is responsible in some measure for the present situation in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked Deputy Bennett if he was opposed to paying the increased price for wheat, but, as a matter of fact, according to Deputy Corry, there is no increased price for wheat in this <Col N="202" /> country because the price of foreign wheat is just as high.  There was a time when Fianna Fáil members were dishonest enough to use the argument that the price of Irish wheat was responsible for the increased price of flour, but to-day Deputy Corry has tried to throw responsibility for the increased price on the workers and bakers of Cork and Dublin.  He has done so, however, only to the extent of ½d. per 4lb. loaf.  Anyone reading the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday could see that the price of the 4 lb. loaf in London on that day was only 9d.; that in the North of Ireland it was 9½d.; and that in the Free State it was 1/-, and probably 1½ or 1/1 in some places, although some people might be too conscientious to charge according to the Government's fixed price.  I would ask Deputy Corry if it is not our duty to find out what is responsible&mdash;leaving the ½d. out of consideration&mdash;for the difference of 2½d. per 4 lb. loaf between the price of bread here and in London.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we were told that the Cumann na nGaedheal fund was subsidised by the foreign millers, but in this country to-day we have a gentleman ruling the flour industry, who, as Deputy Dillon pointed out one one occasion, was able to buy his wheat delivered at Liverpool at a certain price, and when he sent what he required to Limerick for delivery there charged 10/- extra. I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to reply to that.  I should be glad to hear that my statement is incorrect because I do not want to make incorrect statements in this House, or statements over which I would not be prepared to stand. Neither do I want to take any advantage of the present situation, but there is no doubt that things in this country have reached a terrible state.</P>
    <P>The people are being robbed right, left and centre, and those on the Government Benches know that as well as I do.  Deputy Dowdall, I am sure, is a very conscientious man and so am I, but when temptation is put before one, then, as Deputy Dowdall says, human nature is human nature. The Minister for Finance is also a <Col N="203" /> conscientious man, and I ask him what would he do if he were in the position of one of those manufacturers.  I think myself that it would be a tight fit and that the temptation would be too much.  What I maintain is that the Government should not put anybody in that position.  I am speaking for the poorer people in the country who have only very small allowances and are unable to meet the increased cost of living.  I welcome the Bill, and hope it will go some distance to meet the present situation though I have some doubts about that.  Still I am prepared to give it a fair chance.</P>

      <P>I feel honoured at being able to stand in an Irish Parliament to-day, and as a newcomer I ask this Assembly to consider this question of the high cost of living.  I come from a county which cannot claim to be an industrial county.  I come from the County Meath, which is noted for its agriculture, and I feel privileged at being able to speak here on this question of the high cost of living.  It is perhaps the most important question that we will be called upon to consider during this session of the Dáil.  We heard a great deal from Deputy Corry as to all that had been done by the Government in connection with industrial development.  To my mind this policy of industrial development has been brought too far altogether.  In my opinion, the only sound policy for this country is one of selective tariffs. The industrial policy of this Government is not, I hold, a sound one.  It has led to want and beggary amongst the people of my county.  To-day they are in the unhappy position that they are not able to have bacon for their dinner.  They have to eat dry bread, and that in the county that used to be one of the most prosperous in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot about the revival of the flour-milling industry.  I come from a county where we have nine derelict flour mills between the town of Trim and the town of Drogheda. You have one every three miles along the River Boyne.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce never came down there to re-start one of those mills.  The Minister will have the <Col N="204" /> privilege of opening a factory in the town of Trim next week.  I would invite him to take a walk along the River Boyne, starting at the town of Trim, so that he may see the beggary and the misery that prevail there. The factory which it is proposed to start there is, to my mind, one that is completely foreign to this country for the reason that it will not be using anything that is produced in this country.</P>
    <P>We were told that during the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, nothing was done for industrial development in this country.  I maintain that a real, solid foundation for industrial development was laid in those days.  It was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that started the first boot factory and the first boot factory in this country.  It was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government also that was responsible for putting into operation the Shannon Scheme, on which all the industrial concerns operating in the country to-day have to depend for their power.  Great and lasting foundations for the industrial development of the country were laid in those days.  I ask Deputies on all sides of the House seriously to consider the position in the country to-day. The only hope for the country is to make agriculture its strong right arm.  Just as the individual has two arms, one stronger than the other, so I hold that Ireland's strong arm, if she is to be prosperous and great, must be her agricultural arm.  If it is not, then the other arm must be weak, because this is an agricultural country and if agriculture is not prosperous we can have no hope of starting industries. We must look down to the earth and see what mineral wealth we have.  If you do that you will find that you have nothing but the bare soil out of which to make a living.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have gone far enough with this industrial craze.  As I have said, the only sound policy for this country is one of selective tariffs. In view of the present position, I think we might ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take a holiday for at least six months.  If he does not want to do that, I suggest <Col N="205" /> that he should take himself over to the Minister for Agriculture and try to help him out of the mess that he is in.  I would also suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he should have the golden keys with which he was presented during the last couple of years melted down and the proceeds given to the unfortunate people in the country who cannot get work.  I hope that what I have said will be clearly understood, because I am one of those who do not believe in mincing his words.  I say to the Labour Party that, in my opinion, they have taken an honest step to-day by coming over to this side into the front line trenches.  Now that they have come over, I hope they will take off their coats and undo some of the dirty work that they helped to do during the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>This has been the first set debate in the new Dáil, and I hope that it is not indicative of what is in store for us.  The debate arose on a Bill for the control of prices, but the majority of the speakers did not even refer to the Bill, and those who did certainly attempted no constructive criticism on it.  Instead, we had a rehash of their election speeches, and a patent manoeuvring for political position.  I suggest to Deputies that they can do their cross-roads oratory better at the cross-roads than in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that, when a measure of this kind is brought forward for consideration, they should give the House the benefit of their considered judgment of its provisions. In other words, that they should act here not so much as the members of a political party trying to secure kudos for that party, but as the representatives of the people in the Council of Deputies.  On that basis we would be able to make progress in the perfection of our legislation.  On any other basis we will achieve nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The Party opposite think that they have got me in a dilemma on this Bill. They think that I cannot but agree with them that the 1932 Act was ineffective without giving away the case for its amendment, but if I am in a dilemma I think that they are in one also.  My dilemma is more apparent than real, while theirs is more real than apparent, because they have got to avoid supporting the Bill, to avoid putting forward any suggestions that would make it more effective in operation, and at the same time keep themselves free to conduct this prices ramp on which they had been engaged for the past six months.  They have a rather difficult task before them.  Of course, we get wild statements such as we have had to-day from Deputy Dillon of the actual prices now being charged here and a comparison between them and the alleged prices operating on the other side, none of which will bear a moment's examination by anyone conversant with the facts.  Statements of that kind, while they may snatch a few votes at an election, are of no value to the House if the aim and purpose of Deputies is to secure that effective legislation is enacted here.</P>
    <P>The Bill may be capable of improvement. I am quite prepared to consider any suggestions for its improvement that Deputies may care to make. I submit that Deputies should get rid of this talk about profiteering and of urging that action should be taken to get rid of rising prices unless they are prepared to sit down and put forward some alternative method for dealing with this particular situation.  Mind you, this is not a Bill for dealing with rising prices, and Deputies opposite have spoken as if it were a Bill to deal with unfair prices.  Rising prices are not necessarily unfair.  They are often indicative of progress.  The rise in the price of agricultural produce that has taken place since 1934 is something that we deliberately set out to achieve, something that it was essential to secure as a basis for prosperity in this country.  Some of the Deputies who have spoken in criticism of this Bill in the House to-day will to-morrow be deploring the prices that the farmer gets for his milk, for his beet and for <Col N="207" /> his meat, and will be urging on the Government that prices should be increased.  You cannot increase prices at one end of the scale without doing it at the other.  The purpose of the Bill is to see that nobody, in any process of production or distribution, gets an unfair profit.  That is what we are legislating for, and it is for the purpose of achieving that that we ask the co-operation of Deputies opposite. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister agrees with me at the outset, but I am not so sure that we will find ourselves in agreement by the time I am finished.  The Minister, a few moments ago, gave a lecture to members of the House, and particularly to members on this side of the House, as to their duties when they came inside the doors of this Chamber. They were immediately to cast off their political Party cloaks and give their criticism with a view only to the national good, irrespective of what effect the views given here may have on Party politics.  That may have been suggested by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the purpose of trying to impress the many <Col N="208" /> new members we have in this new Parliament; but I am sure that most of the members of this House who were members of previous Dáils would smile that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of all members of this House, should talk in that strain.  If it conveyed anything at all to me, it conveyed that the Minister himself looks upon his Bill as a farce and a joke, and not to be taken seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no man in this House who has shown a more complete ignorance of the Standing Orders of this House than the Minister for Finance.  We heard the old story &mdash;accusations levelled against this side of the House of killing Irish industry. We heard attempts being made to justify the present prices, and the enormous increases in the cost of living in this country, on the grounds that it was necessary that prices should so increase in order that Irish industry should get an opportunity of developing. Those statements, of course, are not true, and I want to say here, clearly and emphatically, that so far as I am concerned, if Irish industry can only be built up in this country on profiteering and on so increasing the prices of the necessaries of life that the poor in this country are not able to get enough to eat, then I am against Irish industries.  Killing Irish industry!  Every tariff, every tax, every levy is attempted to be justified on the grounds that it is put on for the one purpose, and the one purpose only, of protecting Irish industry.  The men who are killing Irish industry in this country are the men sitting over <Col N="209" /> there, who pretend to put on taxes and levies for the purpose of helping Irish industry and at the same time are collecting £11,000,000 at the ports of this country.  If the tariffs and the taxes and the levies and the prohibitions were effective, the Minister for Finance would not be collecting the greater part of his revenue at the ports of the country.  The Minister knows that, and any member of this House who has given any thought whatever to the matter knows it quite well also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry says that all these things can be justified because we are giving employment to our own. Deputy Corry must have his head higher in the clouds even than some of us thought he had.  Giving employment to our own!  Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce would get some member of his staff to give Deputy Corry the figures of emigration of young Irishmen to Great Britain for the first six months of this year. Perhaps he would remind the Deputy that the result of the Government's policy and of the employment that is supposed to be given out of this great tillage policy of the Government has been that at the busiest period of the year in the tillage areas, notwithstanding the emigration, the unemployment figures are increasing at the rate of 1,000 per week.  Killing Irish industry!  The people who tell the truth, the people who have no more respect for an Irish profiteer than they have for an English profiteer, are the people who are supposed to be killing Irish industry.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us not very long ago that he would not be justified in increasing unemployment assistance by sixpence per week because the cost of living had not increased by that amount.  That statement was made in this House.  It is on the records of this House.  I do not believe there is another member of the Fianna Fáil Party that would dare to make that statement.  Has the Minister any knowledge, and I am sure he has&mdash;he must have&mdash;of the actual increases which have taken place?  Is it too much to say that there has been an increase, taking things all round and taking an average household in this <Col N="210" /> country, of at least 20 per cent. in the last four years?  That is, I think, putting it low.</P>
    <P>We may say what we like here, and we may talk around the subject, but the fact is that here to-day in this country bread is 25 per cent. dearer than it is across the water.  There is no doubt about that.  Will the Minister contend that flour is not substantially dearer here?  Will the Minister contend that bacon is not substantially dearer here? Will he contend, quality for quality, that both boots and clothes are not dearer here than on the other side?  Is it not a fact that every article, almost without exception, going into the ordinary household to-day is subject to some sort of a tax or tariff?  With regard to Deputy Davin and other members of the Labour Party, I must confess&mdash;and I do not say this in any carping spirit or with any intention whatever of trying to score a point&mdash; but I must confess that I find it difficult to understand their attitude, for the reason that the Deputy got up here and spoke to the effect that the Bill the Minister introduced to control prices and to prevent profiteering did not go far enough, while at the same time the Deputy and every member of the Party are prepared to go to the fullest extent to support by their votes and by their voice the policy that has brought about the huge increase in the cost of living.  You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot vote for the policy and then try to run away from the effects of that policy, and that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister telling us that prices are rising all over the world.  That may be so, but nobody in this House or outside this House is going to accept that they are rising to the same extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  If the Minister is not going to treat this matter seriously, I would prefer that he would keep his mouth shut.  The Government talk about killing Irish industry and they talk glibly about their desire to clear the slums of this country&mdash;to build houses and to build them at the lowest possible cost so that <Col N="211" /> they can be let at a rent which the slum-dwellers can afford to pay.  That is all talk.  Out of that necessity the Government immediately proceeds to raise revenue.  There is a tax of 5/- upon every ton of cement that goes into every house built in this country to take the people out of the slums.</P>
      <P>As to the cost of living, will the Minister or any other member of this House ask himself this: with the cost of living so high as it is at present, what is it going to be in the winter? Is it not a fact, so far as one can see, that bread is going to be dearer in the winter than it is to-day and that flour is going to be dearer?  Is it not a fact that coal is going to be from 4/- to 5/- per ton dearer after the 1st November when certain parts of the famous Coal-Cattle Pact come into operation?  Is it not a fact that prices are being regulated in such a way as to hurt the poor more than anybody else?  Is it not a fact that tea under 2/- per lb., which is purchased, in the main, by the very poor of our towns and cities, is being increased in price or being reduced in quality, and that tea over that price is not being affected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Deputies, who perhaps were not here at the time, to remember what happened.  We are told we are attacking the Government's wheat policy when talking about the price of flour.  Deputies must remember that when the Government embarked on the wheat policy at first the subsidy was paid out of the Central Exchequer. In other words, if the world price of wheat was 14/6 and if the home price was 24/6, the miller paid the 24/6 and he was paid 10/- out of the Central Exchequer for every barrel of wheat he bought.  The Government pushed on their wheat policy, and if they continued to pay the subsidy out of the Central Exchequer, direct taxation would have to be increased.  Therefore they changed it to indirect taxation. The position last year and this year is this: the Government fix a guaranteed price for wheat irrespective of what the world price is and the miller is given full power to get that increase, whatever it may be, out of the consumer of the flour and the <Col N="212" /> bread.  In that way the poor people are hit still harder, because it is well known that the poor people consume more bread and flour than people in better circumstances.</P>
    <P>These are the people who accuse us of trying to sabotage Irish industry. If one dares to open one's mouth, or to offer one word of criticism of any industry, whether it is being run on creditable lines or not, one is immediately accused of trying to sabotage that industry.  The Minister talks about fair criticism.  Does he consider that that sort of remark is fair? Deputies ought to get away from this cheap jibe of smashing Irish industry and trying to help John Bull.  Deputies on one side of the House have as much interest in this country, and as much love for it, as Deputies on the other side, and are just as anxious to see this country progress.  There is no use in talking about helping Irish industry by collecting £11,000,000 at the ports of the country.  You are not helping Irish industry by having a woman living in the slums of Dublin paying 2d. for a bottle of castor oil for a child which she used to get for a penny four years ago.  That is what is happening.  Every article, down to the smallest article purchased, has been increased in price. I go further and say this&mdash;and again I am going to be accused of sabotaging Irish industry&mdash;and I can get support for this statement from many men in this House who are the fathers of families, that if the actual cash prices of boots and shoes in this country are being kept down, the quality is not being kept up.  Deputies may not be inclined to agree with that at first blush, but if they ask the mother of a family what is her experience&mdash;and she is in a position to know better than anyone else&mdash;she will be able to tell them.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Davin, and I must confess that I found him more involved than usual.  I know the Deputy very well, and have no doubt of his honesty of purpose.  But the impression he left in my mind at the end of his speech was that the policy he wanted to see adopted was a policy that would give us high tariffs, indiscriminate tariffs, and indiscriminate levies without any increase in the cost <Col N="213" /> of the article.  The Deputy cannot have that.  The Deputy has been told before in this House that he is a member of the only Labour Party in the world that is in favour of tariffs, taxes, prohibitions and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the Deputy has been told that.  If Deputy Heron can disprove that statement we will be glad to hear from him.  I think there was an exception made about some part of Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find out that that sort of thing does not cut much ice in this House.  He is a bit new here.  If the Labour Party in Australia were in favour of tariffs, they had certain safeguards, as the Deputy ought to know, with regard to wages and other things.  The point I want to get at is that the Labour Party themselves, in common with the Government, have been responsible for bringing about a policy in this country the effects of which have been to reduce more effectively the actual wages of the wage-earners than any employer has succeeded in doing, at least for the last 20 years.  The Deputy smiles at that.  I should like to hear him saying that it is not true.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when replying to this debate, will, I have no doubt, resort to his old tactics.  His tactics will consist of this, that every statement from this side of the House is untrue. The Minister will tell the House that these taxes, levies, prohibitions and so on are fully justified and have proved themselves to the hilt.  The Minister will try to tell the House that, notwithstanding the fact that 28,000 people had to leave this country in the first six months of this year. The Minister will try to tell the House that these indiscriminate tariffs and levies are justified notwithstanding the fact that emigration, plus period orders and all the other obstacles which the Minister's Department can place in the way of the unemployed, have been unable to reduce in any way the effective unemployed in this country. The Minister knows that very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I have no intention whatever of going over the ground at any length. I have tried to put the position clearly and forcibly as I see it.  I know from personal experience that there are people in this country to-day who find this tremendous increase in the cost of living pressing upon them in a terrible way.  There are children in this country to-day who are not getting sufficient to eat.  There are parents in this country to-day who are finding it impossible to make the wages which they receive, if they are fortunate enough to be employed, fit into the ever-increasing cost of living.  Will the Minister ask himself what is the position to-day of the man who is one unemployment assistance, receiving the same rates, the very miserable rates, that were fixed four years ago? Will the Minister contend for one moment that the purchasing power of unemployment assistance, as fixed by him or by this House four years ago, is anything like what it was even then?  Will the Minister contend or will he attempt to disprove my statement that the cost of living is 20 to 25 per cent. greater in this country than it was four years ago?  I do not think he will.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister deny that whatever profiteers there are in this State to-day, the biggest profiteer is the Government itself?  Will the Minister deny that most of the £11,000,000 collected at the ports is taken out of the pockets of people who can ill afford it?  Will the Minister deny that the fact that the Minister for Finance can collect from £10,000,000 to £11,000,000 at our ports, in itself disproves most of the statements made in regard to the effectiveness and the success of their industrial policy?  Will he admit that actions taken by his colleagues and by himself have jeopardised Irish industry more than any statement made from this or any other side of this House, or, for that matter, any statement made outside this House? Will the Minister consider this finally, whether this policy of indiscriminate tariffs, followed, as it inevitably must be, as Deputy Dowdall has stated, by profiteering, is doing damage not only to Irish industry to-day, but doing very <Col N="215" /> definite damage to the future of Irish industry?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that he can go on piling tariffs and Orders indiscriminately on the shoulders of the people of this country to the extent of 50, 75 and 100 per cent., without any effective check to see that the people of this country are not fleeced?  Does the Minister contend that every man engaged in industry in this country is in it for the love of it?  Does the Minister contend that all industries in this country that are getting this protection are using that protection to improve that industry or to give more employment?  So far as I am concerned, the acid test of the value of any industry to this country is the improvement it will make in employment in this country, and unfortunately, so far as we can see, there has been no improvement in that respect.  With that statement, I formally propose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  Listening to the debate on the last Bill, and to the Minister's remarks at the beginning of Deputy Morrissey's speech, I was beginning to wonder if I were entirely wrong in assuming that there was anything like an increased cost of living because the Minister seems to have made up his mind that there has been no increase in the cost of living.  He is absolutely satisfied that anybody who talks about an increased cost of living is sabotaging Irish industry or making a cross-roads speech.  If the Minister had even looked at the daily papers, even though he may not receive deputations on the subject, he would see that public bodies all over the country&mdash; county councils, corporations, boards of health and of public assistance, mental hospital committees&mdash;are all shrieking about the increased cost of living and the increased burdens of the ratepayers, the increased burdens of having to carry on their institutions owing to the increased cost of living. The Minister would see that labour bodies and organisations are also shrieking out about the increased cost of living.  The Minister would see that the Gárda are demanding a restoration <Col N="216" /> of the cuts made in their salaries owing to the increased cost of living. The Minister would see that civil servants are asking to have the cost-of-living index figure changed because they say that, as at present computed, it does not present a true indication of the increase in the cost of living. They want more concessions in wages because of the increased cost of living. I am inclined to think that the people throughout the country who are running their own households, the people who are on public boards, the people who are members of charitable organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, who are appealing for more funds in order to meet their increased outgoings&mdash;these people are as likely to know, as the Minister or anybody else, whether there is an increase in the cost of living in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion sets forth that where the standard of living has been lowered, or where the cost of living has been increased through the operations of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on food stuffs and other necessaries of life, this House is of opinion that they should be removed.  The Minister apparently will deny that there is any difference between prices of foodstuffs here and prices elsewhere.  He will say that there is a greater proportion of an increase elsewhere.  I do not propose to go into details, but I know this much from English households and from households in the North of Ireland, of which I have personal experience, that there are very few ordinary articles, apart altogether from food stuffs, going into the ordinary house for which we are not paying more to-day than has to be paid in England or Northern Ireland.  When we think of the effect on the very poor of the present cost of living, and when we look into the figures which Deputy Hogan gave at Clare County Council &mdash;where he gave as the budget for a family of three a sum of 34/8½ per week&mdash;I ask the Minister if he still insists that there is no increase in the cost of living.  How is a family of five, six, seven or eight, where the father is earning only 15/- or £1 per week, or where in some cases he is <Col N="217" /> earning nothing at all&mdash;some weeks not working, not even drawing unemployment assistance, because he may be waiting for it&mdash;to exist under present conditions?  I should like to ask the Minister has he considered the position of these people?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Hogan's figures are correct, that it would take 34/8½ to provide for a family of three, how is a family of seven or eight to exist on 15/- or £1 per week, or even less?  If this Government is collecting £11,000,000 in taxes, somebody is paying these taxes.  It is the consumer who is paying these taxes.  If any of these taxes, levies or impositions are putting an extra shilling on a poor person which he cannot afford to pay, then I say such taxes, levies and impositions should be removed.  I say, further, that there are people in this country who do not come into the category of wage-earners at all.  Throughout the country there are thousands of small farmers who, in hard cash, are not earning very much in the week at all. These people have to make ends meet. They have to go into the small towns and pay more for their bread, for their flour, for their sugar, for their cups and saucers and for all their household utensils.  They have to pay much more for every article that comes into the house every week. Tariffs and levies are responsible for that increase in the cost of living, and the Minister knows it.  Every Deputy in this House, whether on these benches, the Independent Benches or the Government Benches, knows that tariffs, levies and impositions are responsible for the increased cost of living, and if any Deputy in this House votes against the motion, he is voting for a continuance of this increase in the cost of living, because he knows in his heart that this motion is correct.  He knows from his experience in his own house, if he is running a house, that the facts set out in this motion are correct.  If we are going to have any honesty here, if we are going to have any consideration for the poor people, if we are going to live up to those Christian democratic principles about which we hear so much, we should carry this motion.</P>

He has taken on himself the responsibility of proposing a motion which, however vague its terms or uncertain its meaning, at least is going to give rise to a debate upon important economic questions, probably the most important economic questions that this House will have to deal with during its existence.  Instead of dealing with those questions in a calm, deliberate and constructive manner, we got from him and from the seconder of the motion purely Party speeches, evidence merely of a desire to put the blame on the Government for existing conditions.

Here is the motion: &ldquo;That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.&rdquo;  Now, I suggest to the House, I suggest to the Leader of the Party opposite, that any Deputy proposing a motion of that kind should set out to show, first of all, that the standard of living of the community has been lowered; secondly, that it has been lowered by Government action, through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and that the situation is going to be improved from the point of view of the standard of living by the abolition of <Col N="219" /> those taxes, duties and like impositions. Deputy Morrissey did not address himself to any of these matters; neither did the seconder of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one thing that Deputy Morrissey did say to which I am going to refer.  He assumed that I was going to stand up forthwith for the purpose of alleging that every statement made by him was untrue.  Quite a number of them were, but I am going to set Deputy Morrissey an example in the course of this debate, and right now, by giving him my source of information in connection with every fact that I mention, so that Deputies can check its accuracy or disprove its truth if they wish.  I submit that that was the duty of Deputy Morrissey.  There is available to Deputies, as there is available to me, information upon all these matters.  In the current issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, which was sent free of charge to all Deputies, there is set out a whole series of tables and charts giving all the available information upon practically every economic activity of this State.  Why did Deputy Morrissey not refer to these? That is the information I have, and that information was also available to him.  If he wanted to make a case here for a complete revolutionary change of Government policy on the ground that the standard of living of the community is being lowered by the present policy, and will be raised by the change, he should at least have made reference to these tables in that volume of information which was made available to him, and based his case upon what he found there.  Perhaps he did. Perhaps he studied the tables.  Perhaps his speech was due to the fact that he could find nothing there that would support his contentions and justify his motion, but his ignoring of them is not going to prevent reference being made to them, because Deputies on this side of the House have as much right to speak on this debate as Deputies on the other side of the House, and, therefore, they may be sure that the facts are going to be made known.  That is the main concern of Deputies opposite &mdash;to hide the facts.  For months past they have been carrying on in the country the most dishonest campaign <Col N="220" /> ever undertaken here in relation to food prices and similar matters&mdash;most dishonest because it was based on a deliberate distortion of the facts, a campaign in which they were supported by the <i>Irish Independent</i> newspaper in a manner which in my opinion lowered to the mud the reputation of Irish journalism for decency.  We expect from newspapers at least some attempt to present the facts correctly.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the same matter in another way.  Let us turn to the motion.  Let us turn to the three questions arising on the motion, questions with which I submit that Deputy Morrissey and the seconder of the motion should have dealt.  Has the standard of living of the community been lowered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of living of this or any other community can be ascertained by reference to certain known facts.  What do we mean by the standard of living?  We mean the quantity of goods which the community consume, the amount of money that they save, the level of commercial activity and the volume of employment. When we talk about the standard of living of the community being raised, we mean that the people are consuming more goods, that they are saving more money, and when we talk about the standard being lowered we mean that they are consuming less, or saving less, or both.  Am I right in <Col N="221" /> that?  Will any Deputy in this House question that interpretation of the term &ldquo;standard of living&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Let us now turn to the facts, the facts that were available to Deputies opposite just as they were available to me, and to which they should have referred before attempting to initiate this debate in the House, from the point of view of Party tactics as well as in fulfilment of their obligations to the people who sent them here.  It is, I think, safe to assume, if the known sources of information make it clear that the people in this country are consuming more or saving more, that the standard of living is rising. If those sources of information reveal that the people are consuming less or saving less, then I will agree that the standard of living is disimproving. There are certain dutiable commodities as to the consumption of which accurate statistics are available.  Let us refer to those first.  They are beer, spirits, tobacco, and certain other articles.  In the current issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> there is set out in respect of each month since the beginning of 1934 the quantity of beer, spirits and tobacco withdrawn from bond for consumption in this country.</P>

      <P>In 1934 the average monthly consumption of beer here was 47,122 barrels.  In 1935 it was 50,210 barrels.  In 1936 it was 52,290 barrels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit at once that in relation to any single commodity there may be some set of circumstances to explain the rise or fall in consumption otherwise than by reference to the general position of the community; but if we find over all commodities a similar increase in consumption, then I submit that there is only one conclusion which we can come to.  In the case of spirits the monthly average consumption of spirits in these three years was:&mdash;1934, 49,750 <Col N="222" /> gallons; 1935, 50,690 gallons; 1936, 52,230 gallons.  People may buy beer and spirits to drown their sorrows, as somebody suggested, but they need income to do it, and if we find that not merely are they consuming more beer and spirits, but that the monthly average quantity of tobacco consumed here increased during those three years, what must our opinion be?  In the case of tobacco the consumption for the three years was as follows:&mdash;1934, 691,000 lb.; 1935, 705,000 lb.; 1936, 754,000 lb.</P>

      <P>Might I ask a question? The Minister will agree with me that, in the economic sense, anything that is purchased, let it be eaten or drunk, or let it be a piece of furniture, it enters into consumption.  The Minister agrees.  Now, the commodities he has mentioned, beer, spirits and tobacco, come under certain categories. The first two are luxuries, but tobacco is regarded as a necessity.</P>

I mention these articles rather than others because, in relation to them, we have got exact figures.  Beer, spirits and tobacco are kept in bond under Government control, and we know the exact quantity that is drawn out in any week or month for consumption, and we can give precise information which we cannot give in relation to such things as boots or shoes or clothes, or articles of that kind.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can give any explanation he likes.  I have already admitted that the figures relating to a single commodity or to groups of commodities may be explainable on some other basis than an improvement in the standard of living.  I have shown the increased general consumption of commodities here and, when I put them alongside all the other figures available, I submit that Deputy Morrissey will be forced to admit in his own mind, if he does not do it publicly, the force of the contention I make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not mentioned one article covered by the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much less easy, as Deputies know, to get up-to-date figures for non-dutiable industrial products, particularly in a time like the present of intense development when, in order to stimulate production, restrictions, sometimes harsh, are placed on certain imports.  At all events, all the available information indicates no decline in consumption, and if Deputies seek to base their case for a complete change of Government policy on the ground that there is such a decrease of consumption, they have to prove it.  As I say, all the available evidence is in the contrary direction.  We have, therefore, no evidence of a diminution in the consumption of goods.  The evidence I have given shows that there was an increase in consumption; but I am prepared merely to take it that that evidence sustains the view that there has been no decline in consumption and if, outside that, we find that our people's savings are increasing, then I submit that the contention in the first line of this motion&mdash;that there has been a lowering of the standard <Col N="224" /> of living&mdash;must be rejected as nonproven.</P>
      <P>Again, in relation to the savings of the people, we have exact figures. The Post Office Savings Bank is the main source of the people's savings, although there are others.  The weekly average amount deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank, less the amount withdrawn in each week during the three years was as follows:&mdash;1934, £11,460; 1935, £11,520; 1936, £17,120. I know it might be contended, as it was on one occasion, that the increase in the balance due to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank could be explained by reference to some transfer of preference from the Savings Bank to Savings Certificates, or in some such way.  Lest that might occur to anybody here, I propose to give the combined figure representing the weekly average amount deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank, less withdrawals, plus the amount paid for Savings Certificates, less payments. Here are the figures:&mdash;1934, £10,080; 1935, £13,600; 1936, £18,770.  That represents the Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates.  There is no evidence of a reduction in the standard of living there.  Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary.  There is evidence that our people are saving more.  That increase in savings was recorded in each month of this year up to June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In July there was no increase recorded, but that was to be expected, having regard to the prolonged building strike, which necessitated some depositors realising on their savings in order to maintain themselves.  Deputy Davin refers to the ordinary banks.  Let us turn to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the debits in the commercial banks' ordinary account and, for convenience sake, I am going to give average figures during the last three years.  They are as follows:&mdash;1934, £1,490,000; 1935, <Col N="225" /> £1,530,000; 1936, £1,620,000.  The figures I have given so far show, I think, clearly that there is no evidence to support the view that our people are consuming less in goods.  All the available evidence shows that they are consuming more.  There is no evidence that they are saving less.  The available evidence is that they are saving more.  If, side by side with that evidence, we have from other sources undeniable proof of increased commercial activity, then I think we must conclude, whether it suits our Party policies or not, that the contention at the beginning of this motion is wrong and that, in fact, there has been no lowering of the standard of living of the people of this State.  If you ask any text-book economist what is the most reliable index of commercial activity he will refer you to the bank clearance of notes, bills and cheques. As the total of the daily clearance of notes, bills and cheques increases, it is assumed that commercial activity is also increasing, and as that total diminishes, it is assumed that trade is stagnant, and that is a reasonable assumption.  The weekly average of the Dublin bank clearances, bills, notes and cheques in the last three years were:&mdash;1934, £5,160,000; 1935, £5,280,000; 1936, £5,570,000.  Other sources of information as to the volume of commercial activity are also available. In the ordinary text-books one finds references not only to these bank clearances, bills, notes and cheques, but also to the volume of traffic over the railways.  The average weekly railway receipts in the Free State in the past three years were:&mdash;1934, £79,230; 1935, £83,530; 1936, £85,500.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get that point cleared.  These figures are available by reason of the fact that traffic was diverted from the roads to the railways.  We can get figures for that.  The average number of passengers carried by road transport in 1934 was 7,780,000.  I will leave out 1935, because the figures that year were influenced by the Dublin Tramways strike, which lasted three or four months.  In 1936 the average number of passengers carried by road transport was 7,830,000.  Not merely had we got an increase in traffic over the railways, but at the same time there was an increase in traffic over the roads.</P>

The number registered in this year as unemployed is less in every single week than it was in the corresponding week last year, the maximum decrease in unemployment being 50,178 for the week ended 22nd February and the minimum being 5,671 for a week in July.

      <P>Deputy Byrne had said that the diminution was explainable by emigration.  Undoubtedly so, but we are giving tangible evidence of a substantial increase in the number of people in employment.  Then there is another explanation which should occur to Deputies also.  There are more people in employment each week this year than each week last year.  In 1936 there were more people employed <Col N="228" /> than in 1935, and in 1935 there were more people employed than in 1934.

      <P>I am not now going to deal with the question whether existing conditions are satisfactory. Nobody has ever accused me of being satisfied with existing conditions.  But if we are to make a serious effort to improve them, we must start on a basis of facts.  We must know where we are.  We must know the size of the problem and the effectiveness of the various measures taken to deal with it.  If we are not going to be misled by wild and reckless statements by the Fine Gael Party, and, occasionally, by the Labour Party, we must know all about this problem.  If we are to face this problem in the right way we must know all about it.</P>

      <P>We are prepared any time to discuss that.  It is a question of ways and means.  Deputy Morrissey quoted me as saying that I would not be justified in increasing unemployment assistance by 6d. a week.  I never made such a statement.  I did say here at one time that 6d. would be a greater contribution to the increase in the cost of living than had taken place in the cost of living at that time.</P>

      <P>In relation to unemployment assistance rates, the consideration in mind when fixing them was not the cost of living. We never suggested, and do not suggest now, that it is possible for an unemployed man to maintain himself indefinitely, with no other income except unemployment assistance, on the rates scheduled in the Unemployment Assistance Act.  We never believed that, and never suggested it.  When determining what these rates were to be, we took the cost-of-living index figure into account and the resources of the State.  We brought into that fund every penny we could get by increased taxation &mdash;and even then the increased taxation had to be forced through the Dáil against the combined opposition of other Deputies.</P>
      <P>By means of our majority, and against the opposition of Deputy Morrissey and his colleagues, we succeeded in getting one and half millions of money in new taxation from the people of this State for the financing of that service.  We did not feel it was possible to get more.  The only thing that limited the unemployment assistance provided by the Act was the fact that we could not get more, because there was a limit beyond which taxation could be put without destroying the evil.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with the nature of the employment.  I am destroying the contention that there were fewer people employed, that there were more unemployed, and that the standard of living of our people was lowered.  There is the evidence.  I may be told that the Director of Statistics faked these figures to make a case for the Government.  Why deny facts? Does the Party opposite think that they will frame a policy on the basis of a misconception of the facts?  Surely not.  If they are going to deal with this problem properly, to help the Government charged with responsibility to abolish unemployment, to raise the standard of living and to end destitution and poverty, they must start from that basis.  They cannot do it on the basis of wild propaganda.  I say that my job here should not be an educational job, to educate Deputies on the facts so that they will be useful members of the House.</P>

      <P>The number of people who registered at unemployment exchanges as being available for work each week this year was on the average 20,000 less than last year.  The number of persons in respect of whom unemployment insurance contributions were paid, persons who got insurable work, had increased.  The number of persons who claimed unemployment insurance benefit, taking the monthly average in 1934, was 20,560; in 1935, 18,410, and in 1936, 16,040.  I give these figures with certain hesitation because, in relation to the number of claims for unemployment completely opposite causes might produce the same results. By themselves they prove nothing but, in relation to the other facts, I submit that they prove conclusively that the unemployment position here is not disimproving.  I will put it no higher than that.  The number of persons receiving home assistance on the last Saturday of each month in the last three years was: 1934, 108,000; 1935, 86,000, and 1936, 80,000.  All that shows that there is no truth in the contention made in the motion, that the standard of living had been reduced.  Deputies can form their own conclusions as to <Col N="231" /> whether it proves that the standard of living has been increased.  I will not argue that now.  I shall be satisfied with contending that the figures prove that the statements made in the motion moved by Deputy Morrissey are not true, and that there has been no lowering of the standard of living of this community.  The motion goes further and states that not merely has there been a lowering of the standard of living of the community but that it is the result of Government action &ldquo;through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not contest, and no one would be so foolish as to contest that the cost of living has increased since 1934.  It has definitely.  In 1932 and 1933 the cost of living fell.  The fall stopped in 1934, and since then there has been quite a substantial rise. The motion, however, contends that the rise in the cost of living is due to Government action.  This Government commenced action in March, 1932, and if any evidence is to be produced in support of the contention in the motion, it must be evidence that since 1932 the cost of living has increased in comparison with the period before 1932.  I noticed that in the debate on the other Bill Deputies opposite when talking about the cost of living stopped at 1934 &ldquo;on the road back.&rdquo;  It is true they could make the case that there has been, on the basis of a comparison of the figures for this year with 1934, but when they set out to show that the increased cost of living is due to the policy of this Government, then their comparison must be over the whole period that this Government was in office, as against the period before it was elected.  Between the year 1931, which was the last year of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and the year 1936, the last year for which we have the complete figures, there was no increase shown in the cost-of-living index.  The index figures for one year are the same as for the other.  It is true that comparison masks the considerable <Col N="232" /> fall and recovery in the intervening period, because between 1931 and 1934 there was a fall, and between 1934 and 1936 there was a recovery.</P>
      <P>But in 1936 the cost of living here was not higher than in 1931 when a different Government policy was in operation.  One year as against another is a false comparison, because exceptional circumstances might operate one year to raise or depress the cost of living, and it might be only temporary and would not be repeated in subsequent years.  Therefore, I think it is a much fairer comparison to take the average for five years before the change of Government and the average for five years afterwards.  The average figure of the cost of living prior to 1932 was 163 and for the five years since 1932, 155.</P>
      <P>In view of these figures I submit it is difficult to contend that Government policy alone has been responsible for increasing the cost of living.  That is the contention in the motion.  I am not denying that an increase in the cost of living has taken place.  I am not denying that Government policy was in part responsible for it.  The truth was, that Government policy was in part designed to produce that increase in the cost of various commodities, the prices of which are taken into account in the cost-of-living index figures, but I say it is utterly false and misleading to endeavour to create in the minds of Deputies the idea that Government policy alone was responsible for an increase in the cost of living.  The cost of living is rising, but to the knowledge of Deputies who moved the motion, and of the Leaders of the Party on the opposite benches who framed it, it is rising in every country in the world, and in some is rising, in proportion, more rapidly than here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the figures for the various countries.  In the Trade Supplement of the London <i>Economist</i> for September 5th, 1937, statistics are available. Deputies can purchase copies of that publication.  These show that the cost of living all over the world fell rapidly until 1933.  Deputies know that.  They know, in fact, that what was called an economic blizzard, a world crisis, was <Col N="233" /> occasioned by that fall in prices, and that world conferences were called by the great States in an effort to get international agreement to raise prices.</P>
    <P>It was not until prices began to rise again that the world began to recover from the depression and that commercial activity, was renewed.  Between 1933 and 1936, the cost of living in this country rose by 5.9 per cent.  That is the increase which has taken place in the cost-of-living index in this country between 1933 and 1936.  In the United Kingdom, it rose during the same period by 5 per cent.&mdash;a slightly smaller increase but, nevertheless, very similar.  In the U.S.A., during the same period, the cost of living rose by 13.2 per cent.; in Germany by 5.5 per cent., in Australia by 5.6 per cent., in Canada by 5 per cent., and in New Zealand by 7 per cent.  I could give you the figure for France but it would be misleading.  It shows a much higher increase but the currency fluctuations had a lot to do with it.  The accuracy of these figures cannot be contested.  Deputies will, I assume, take it from me that the London <i>Economist</i> is not a Fianna Fáil organ and that its figures are not prepared for the purpose of making Fianna Fáil propaganda.  The rise in the cost of living here between the period when the slump ended until this date was no greater than in other countries.  I might, perhaps, have obtained figures for countries the economic conditions of which are somewhat more similar to our own than the highly industrialised countries for which figures are given in the <i>Economist</i> but I was not able to procure those figures in time.</P>
    <P>The cost of living rose more rapidly this year than last year but, again, that increase has been reflected in every country as well as our own. Between a month in 1936 and a month in 1937&mdash;in the case of the Free State, August, and in the case of Great Britain, July&mdash;the cost-of-living index rose here by 6.9 per cent., and in the United Kingdom by 6.2 per cent.  Again, the advantage was slightly in favour of the United Kingdom, but factors are operating to inflate our cost-of-living index here that do not operate there. <Col N="234" /> A much fairer picture will be obtained by taking, not the cost-of-living index for all items, but the index figures for food items alone.  Before I deal with that matter, I want you to bear in mind the terms of Deputy Morrissey's motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action.</P>
    <P>Between 1931-2&mdash;the last year during which Cumann na nGaedheal were in office and before this Government came into office&mdash;and the present year, 1936-7, the index for food prices in the Irish Free State rose by 5.1 per cent.  Over the same period, the food prices index for the United Kingdom rose by 7.5 per cent.  Deputies opposite laughed when I said that the increase in food prices here was proportionately less than in Great Britain in that period.  These are the figures. Let them work them out for themselves. Let them apply to the British Board of Trade for the information which they can supply.  I did not do that.  I took my information out of published documents&mdash;documents which are available to Deputies as well as to me, the Board of Trade journals and the <i>Economist</i> supplement.  These figures show that the rise in the cost of living of which Deputies complain has taken place everywhere and could not be avoided in this country.</P>
    <P>A rise in the cost of living does not necessarily involve a decrease in the standard of living.  If there is an increase in income corresponding to the increase in the cost of living, the standard of living remains unchanged. We, in this country, have no index for wages and, consequently, I cannot give you a precise figure, but I think it is well known that the trend of wages in practically every occupation in recent years has been definitely upwards.  In all the big industries which employ adult male workers&mdash;the great majority of the adult male workers of the country&mdash;the increase recorded in wages is considerably greater, proportionately, than the increase which has been recorded in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with that now.  Between May, 1933, and May, 1937, the index of farm produce prices rose by 28.3 per cent.  That is a substantially higher increase than was shown in the cost-of-living index. In 1937, therefore, having regard to the substantial increase which took place in agricultural prices as compared with the much smaller increase in the cost of commodities, the position of our farmers was much better, despite&mdash;or perhaps because of&mdash;the increase in prices of which Deputies are complaining.</P>
      <P>We need not stop at that.  We can turn otherwise than to direct statistics of that kind for information as to the accuracy of the contention made in this motion.  I want Deputies to remember what it is.  They have contended that the standard of living of our people has been reduced by Government action.  The evidence I have adduced, so far, shows&mdash;conclusively, to my mind&mdash;that, in fact, there has been no diminution in the standard of living at all and that, in so far as the cost of living has increased, it has not increased here more, proportionately, than in any other country.  I am sure that even Deputy Dillon would not suggest that Government policy here has influenced conditions in the United Kingdom, Germany, the U.S.A., Australia, Canada or New Zealand.</P>

      <P>Let us deal with the question that arises most directly from this motion and ask if the actual retail prices of commodities which could be regarded as necessaries of life have been increased by reason of the operation of taxes, levies, duties and so forth and, if so, what those commodities are.  Let us also see what the consequence would be of the removal of these taxes, levies, duties and the like.  Let us start with beef and mutton.  The national average retail price of beef and mutton, as ascertained <Col N="236" /> by my Department four times a year for the purpose of supplying to the appropriate authority the information on which the cost-of-living index is based, was this year less than it was on the corresponding date of 1931.  Again, I am deliberately selecting 1931 for the purpose of this comparison because the contention in the motion is that any increase in the cost of living that may have taken place in relation to the standard of living of our people was due to certain taxes, levies, imposts and the like. These taxes, levies and imposts began to operate in 1932.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the only fair comparison is between the conditions now existing and those existing in 1931.  So far as beef and mutton are concerned, therefore, there has been no increase in price.  On the contrary, the national average retail price is lower now than it was in 1931.  It is lower in the Saorstát than it was in Great Britain, because the British also produce this national average retail price for the purpose of preparing their own cost-of-living figures.  I think that disposes of beef and mutton as one necessary of life, as one item of food, the price of which must be taken into account in any calculation of this sort or any investigation such as Deputy Morrissey has asked the Dáil to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bacon has been mentioned here this evening.  It is quite true that the price of bacon here at the moment is from 16 to 20 per cent. higher than in 1931, and I am not going to deny that that increase is, in the main, due to the operation of Government policy. Government policy was designed to effect that increase.  It endeavoured to effect the increase in order to secure that a better return would be obtained by the producers of the primary product, and in that we have succeeded. I find that there is a certain difficulty perhaps in speaking at undue length upon the question of bacon prices, because they are being investigated at the moment by the Prices Commission, but there are certain facts worth noting in relation to them.  I have heard Deputies opposite frequently talk about the price of bacon here compared with Great Britain, and I <Col N="237" /> refer them in this connection to another source of reliable information &mdash;a paper called <i>The Grocer</i>, which is published in Great Britain&mdash;in which they will find set out the retail prices of bacon.  It is a common device with Deputies opposite to compare the prices of the cheapest cuts in Great Britain with the prices of the dearest cuts in the Irish Free State, and to show that the price is against us, but if you take one class of bacon against another, it will be found that the retail price here at the moment is not higher and, in respect of many cuts is lower, than in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can tell me whatever he likes.  I am pointing out that the price of bacon in this country since 1931 has risen proportionately less than in Great Britain, and that the price here at the moment for many classes of bacon is less than in Great Britain.  I am pointing out that, at the same time, the farmers of this country are getting substantially higher prices for pigs and, furthermore, that there has been reserved for them, and them only, a market which in 1931 was valued at almost £500,000 and that justifies our policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey must not have discussed this motion with his colleagues at all because none of them seems to agree with him.  Does <Col N="241" /> Deputy Gorey want the taxes off bacon?  He does.  Does Deputy Dillon think the price of eggs is too low? He does.  Deputy Bennett complained here that the price of butter was too low, and Deputy Brasier is agitating for an increase in the price of wheat to 36/- a barrel.  Which of the Deputies supports the motion, except the seconder, and does he?</P>

      <P>Two members of that Party are prepared to stand over the motion in full.  The rest of them all have mental reservations.  The price of butter here at present is 7 per cent. higher than in 1931.  We have here to-day Deputies representing Limerick and the adjacent counties in the Fine Gael interest putting forward for the consideration of this House, as the first motion moved by their Party, a proposal to reduce the price of butter.  They complain that the price is too high; that the measures taken to increase the price of butter to the creameries should be abolished; and that the tax on imported butter should be removed so <Col N="242" /> that foreign butter can be imported. That is the first motion moved by Fine Gael in this House.  Are these members for the creamery counties to spend the rest of their lives explaining to their constituents why that motion appeared here, because they secured election upon a public promise given by them that if their Party secured a majority the price of milk to the farmers was going to be increased by a ½d. a gallon?  Am I right in saying that the whole election programme of the Fine Gael Party in these counties was an increase in the price of milk by a ½d. a gallon?  Will they tell me how they could increase the price of milk and at the same time abolish the levy on butter and abolish the import duty on butter?</P>
