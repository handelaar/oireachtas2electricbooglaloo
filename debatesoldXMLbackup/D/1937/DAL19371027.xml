      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether a scheme for the erection of a number of labourers' cottages at Finglas Bridge, Finglas, County Dublin, was submitted to him by the County Dublin Board of Public Health whether the scheme was sanctioned by him; whether 16 or 17 acres of land were acquired by the board of health for the purpose of erecting these cottages, and whether he is in a position to state why the scheme has been held up for a period of two years.</P>

      <P>On the 5th October, 1935, I confirmed a compulsory purchase order submitted by the Dublin Board of Public Health for the acquisition of 16 acres and 9 perches of land at Finglas on which it was proposed to erect 40 cottages.  No plans for these cottages were submitted to the Department.  The board appear to have deferred consideration of the scheme pending arrangements being made with the Corporation of Dublin for a supply of water to Finglas, and final consideration of a proposal to acquire an additional ten acres adjoining the site they were authorised to acquire.  In January, 1937, they submitted lay-out plans for the development of the entire area. The additional land has not yet been acquired.  Amended plans for the development of the site and the erection of 158 cottages were submitted to the Department on the 17th September, and are ready for my approval as soon as arrangements for the acquisition of the additional ten acres are completed.</P>

      <P>The board of health and the Land Commission entered into negotiations for the purchase of certain lands at Ferbane, and on 7th May, 1936, no objection was raised by me to the purchase on the assumption that the lands were suitable as sites for the erection of labourers' cottages thereon.  After tenders had been accepted for the erection of houses on the lands the question of the suitability of the sites was raised at meetings of the board of health.  The matter of obtaining a suitable alternative site has been engaging the attention of the board. It is understood the board will have the question before them again next week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he received any objection to the proposals of the commissioner administering the affairs of Westmeath Board of Health in regard to the erection of labourers' cottages in the vicinity of Kinnegad; whether it has been brought to his attention that the site selected for the erection of the cottages in question is situated more than a mile from the village of Kinnegad, and from schools, church, etc.; whether he is aware that the soil is unsuitable for tillage purposes, and that the site is flooded and swampy in the winter months; whether he is aware that there are several suitable sites available convenient to the village of Kinnegad which could be secured for the erection of these cottages; whether, in fact, he has acknowledged the communications <Col N="578" /> addressed to him in which the objections of the prospective tenants were set out; and, if so, whether he has intimated his intention to refuse the sanction of the site, and, if not, whether he will have the whole matter of the acquisition of this site inquired into before his sanction is given for its acquisition.</P>

      <P>On the 29th ultimo and 14th instant I received objections to the acquisition by the commissioner of a site for the erection of labourers' cottages.  These objections were on the ground that the site was unsuitable and too far from the village of Kinnegad.  I have no information that the soil is unsuitable for tillage or that the site is flooded and swampy during the winter months.  I am not aware that there are several suitable sites convenient to Kinnegad which could be secured. The objections received were duly acknowledged. The acquisition of the site was sanctioned on the 12th January last, that is eight months before the first objection was made to me.  The acceptance of a tender for the erection of cottages on the site was sanctioned in July last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, having regard to the trouble and inconvenience experienced by parents in cases of incomplete registration of births, particularly when such registration is effected by certain hospitals, he will alter paragraph 93 of the appropriate regulations so as to provide for the insertion of Christian names at any time subsequent to the original registration, provided that the request for such insertion is accompanied by a certificate of baptism or a suitable declaration on the part of a parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Christian name of a child whose birth has been registered before it has received a name in baptism, can be inserted in the birth register within 12 months after the date of registration on production <Col N="579" /> to the registrar of a certificate of baptism and on payment of a fee of 1/-.  This provision is not only a regulation, it is a statutory enactment contained in Section 8 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1880.</P>
      <P>The period of 12 months appears to give ample opportunity for the insertion of the Christian name in an entry of birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, the position in this matter is that in a number of cases where children are born in Dublin maternity hospitals, and particularly in one hospital, the practice is that the registrations are carried out by a nurse who frequently only gives the surname and does not hand in the Christian name of the child.  The result is that the parents only become aware of this when the child reaches an age when it requires a birth certificate for examination purposes.  The purpose of my question is to see whether the Minister would consider this matter, if evidence is given to him to show that a good deal of trouble arises out of the prevailing practice, by extending the period beyond the 12 months, because as a rule it is after 12 or 14 years that the difficulty I have referred to comes to the knowledge of parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the water supply at Finglas, County Dublin, is inadequate and generally unsatisfactory, and if he will state what steps he proposes taking to obtain a decent water supply for Finglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the need for an improved water supply for Finglas.  Some time ago my Department made representations to the Dublin Corporation as to the feasibility of a supply being obtained from the city mains and an arrangement was subsequently reached between the corporation and the board of health to supply a certain specified <Col N="581" /> quantity of water for this area.  The responsibility for preparing a scheme for the distribution of the water in Finglas is one for the Dublin Board of Health.  The board were pressed to expedite the submission of such a scheme.  Plans were submitted on the 1st July last.  They were returned by my Department on the 28th July with recommendations for certain amendments of the documents.  Since that date the board of health have been repeatedly urged to expedite the submission of amended documents but so far these documents have not been received.  The supply from the city mains will be limited to 20,000 gallons a day, and this quantity will have to suffice until the Poulaphouca scheme is in operation.</P>

    <P>It should be observed that these prices are ascertained in connection with the quarterly compilation of Cost of Living figures, for which purpose it is necessary only that the <i>national</i> average prices should correctly indicate the general trend.  The average prices shown in the statementfor Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Drogheda, and Tralee, which are based in all cases upon few quotations, must be regarded merely as approximations, and not necessarily for the same qualities of goods in the different towns.</P>
    <P>Only one or two quotations are available for each specified commodity for Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock (Co. Dublin), Tullamore and Naas, and consequently average prices cannot be furnished.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, I should like to know if he has seen a copy of the petition that was presented by practically all the residents of Anglesea Road to the Tramways Company in reference to this nuisance, and did he ascertain that buses at the rate of one per minute pass along that road between 12 o'clock, midnight, and one o'clock in the morning?

      <P>Well, presumably, the Minister has seen a copy of the letter in which they make that case.  I am quoting from the second paragraph, which says: &ldquo;The route over which the omnibuses referred to run is one authorised by the Department of Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;  Consequently, it would appear that the Minister has jurisdiction to prevent an excessive number of buses running there between midnight and one o'clock in the morning over that particular route.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will refer to the reply given on 19th May last to a similar question by Deputy Doyle he will see that the Government has decided in principle to accept the recommendation in paragraph 209 of the Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Service (1932-1935) to have an actuarial investigation made into the existing scheme of superannuation benefits applicable to the Civil Service generally before any important variations are considered.  To that reply I am not in a position to add anything except perhaps to state that definite arrangements have now been made to have the investigation carried out.</P>

    <P>Transport.&mdash;(1) The President.  Prior to the year 1925 an official Lancia car with uniformed drivers was provided for the President of the Executive Council.  Since then, however, transport for the President of the Executive Council has not been provided exclusively out of public funds, but an annual allowance, intended to cover all expenses (except wages and uniforms of chauffeurs) incurred by him in using his private car for official purposes has been granted.  As from 11th allowa3crate of £500 per annum was fixed, but in the year 1926-27 this was reduced to £350 at which figure it has remained.  There is also provision in the Vote for the Department of the President for uniforms of chauffeurs, but since January, 1932, no expenditure has been incurred under this head.</P>
    <P>Prior to March, 1934, two members of the Defence Forces acted as guard-chauffeurs for the President of the Executive Council.  Since that date, the duty has been assigned to two members of the Gardá Síochána whose present pay amounts to £418 8s. 11d. per annum, in addition to which they receive the normal rent and other allowances to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>(2) Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, Transport <i>per se</i> is not provided for Ministers.  Since July, 1927, however, following the assassination of the then Minister for Justice, cars and guards have been provided for the protection and conveyance of Ministers.  At first this duty was undertaken by the Army authorities, but in March, 1934, it was transferred to the Gárda Síochána. The cost of the service varies in each particular case, according to the degree of precaution which the Gárda authorities consider necessary, as for instance when in addition to the driver-guard, an escort is detailed to follow and attend the person protected. Normally, however, the allover cost, which includes £319 approximately for pay and allowances of the members of the Gárda Síochána <Col N="600" /> allotted to the combined protection and driving duties, may be taken as approximately £600 per annum per person.  I might mention that when circumstances seemed to require it such protective measures have also been extended, since 1932, to certain former members of the Executive Council after they had left office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that owing to the explosion of a mine which was washed ashore at Granghill, Inver, Erris, County Mayo, the landing pier and slip were seriously damaged, that <Col N="605" /> the pier and slip are now in a dangerous condition, and that the inhabitants, who depend for a livelihood mainly on fishing, are suffering serious inconvenience, and whether it is his intention to have the pier and slip restored to their former condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is realised that the execution of repair works on this slipway is desirable.  I may say that this mine came ashore many years ago.  A grant from Government funds has already been made available for this purpose and the county council have also agreed to make a contribution. For some time past the Commissioners of Public Works have been in communication with the county council with a view to securing agreement as to the method of execution of the works, and as to their subsequent maintenance.  When these arrangements have been completed the works will be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question in connection with this motion, regarding procedure.  I think there should be some formal official determination in this matter.  A Committee of Public Accounts was appointed by the last Dáil, of which I was the chairman.  I urged that Committee of Public Accounts to meet formally and adjourn because I foresaw that the general election would interrupt our deliberations, and that we would not have time to report.  The committee would not adjourn, and we brought a number of public officials before us, took a great deal of evidence, and spent a great deal of time.  Then, of course, the general election came upon us and the committee was discharged, and now we are going to set up a new committee. What is the duty of the new Public Accounts Committee?  Can they summon the same witnesses before them, or are they entitled to accept the evidence which was already given? This difficulty arises, and it is something that should be determined by the House.  There will be new members on this committee who were not on the last committee.  Certain of the members of the old committee were defeated at the general election.  Is it right for a new member, coming on to the new committee, to accept the evidence that was tendered before the old committee?  He has not heard the evidence, or he has not taken part in the questioning of the officials.  He is quite entitled to say: &ldquo;I will not take that evidence; I want to go through all the evidence again.&rdquo;  I think we should have some guidance in this matter, or some idea as to what the wishes of the House in general are in regard to that matter.</P>

There is one occasion, once every 12 months, on which the matter can be raised, and no other&mdash;the occasion of the resolution to appoint the committee. I think we ought to determine hereafter that where it is perfectly clear that that Committee of Public Accounts cannot finish its work owing to the imminence of a general election that committee should meet formally &mdash;it is required by Statute to be appointed&mdash;and adjourn until after the general election.  I make that point now because I want to establish a precedent in order to avoid the wasting of public officials' time.  The committee ought to have adjourned over the general election, and this difficulty would never have arisen.  I want to have the sense of the House secured to that view, in order to ensure that if this happens again the Public Accounts Committee will adjourn until after the general election, so that the new Public Accounts Committee can examine officials and do its work in an orderly way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Article 18 of the Constitution provides that Seanad Eireann shall consist of 60 members, of whom 11 shall be nominated by the Taoiseach, and 49 shall be elected members.  Of the elected members it is provided that:</P>
      <P>(1.)  Three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland,</P>
      <P>(2.)  Three by the University of Dublin, and</P>
      <P>(3.)  43 shall be elected from panels of candidates.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the franchise and the machinery for the holding of elections of University members.  The election of panel members is being dealt with in a separate Bill.  The Constitution further requires that these elections shall be according to the principles of proportional representation and by secret postal ballot.</P>
      <P>Part II of this Bill deals with the question of franchise and registration of electors.  The franchise proposed in Section 7 of the Bill is that which has applied to universities in the Electoral Act, 1923.  In the former Constitution university members were returned to Dáil Eireann, and the university franchise was a Dáil franchise.  In accordance with the Constitution, the Electorcal Act provided that a person could be registered once only and in only one constituency.  Thus a person who was a university elector had to choose whether he would be registered as a university elector or in respect of his residence qualification in a local area.  The university franchise is now no longer a Dáil franchise, and a qualified person can be registered in the university registers and at the same time be registered as a Dáil elector.  The Bill requires an annual register of electors to be prepared by each university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 63, Clause 3, of the Constitution requires that the first assembly of Seanad Eireann shall take place <Col N="621" /> not later than 180 days after the coming into operation of this Constitution. The necessity for holding an election within a limited time has to be taken into account with regard to registration of electors.  There would not be a sufficient interval of time before the Seanad is to assemble to prepare a fresh register of electors and hold an election on that register.  A register of university electors came into force, in accordance with the Electoral Act, on the 1st June, 1937, at the same time as the local constituency registers.  Any person who was registered in the university register was, in accordance with special provisions, registered in the local register with a distinguishing mark to denote that he was a university elector.  At the last general election those marks were disregarded, since at that time the university registers had ceased to have effect as Dáil registers.  For the purposes of the first election of university members of Seanad Eireann it is proposed to revive the university registers which came into force on the 1st June, 1937, and to keep those registers in force until 1st June, 1938.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the holding of elections of university members including by-elections.  These elections will be conducted in the same manner and according to the like procedure as elections have hitherto been conducted.  Part IV of the Bill contains special provisions with regard to candidates elected in different capacities. A person elected as a member by the two universities must declare, within one month after the first meeting of the Seanad, which constituency he will represent.  If he does not so declare, he will be deemed to represent the constituency in which he received the greatest number of first preferences. If a person is elected as a panel member and as a university member, he must similarly declare the capacity in which he will sit in the Seanad. If he does not so declare, he will be deemed to be a university member.  A member of Seanad Eireann, while retaining his seat, may not be a candidate at a university by-election.  The expression &ldquo;Seanad by-election&rdquo; in Section 30 is defined in Section 1 to <Col N="622" /> mean an election to fill the place of a university member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, said this register was in existence; it had been kept alive after the elimination of university representation from the Dáil.  Now, the register was kept alive so as to provide for the possibility of a vacancy occurring in university representation in the last Dáil.  The register which was in existence, and which presumably is the one to which the Minister now refers, was a register of persons who had elected not to vote in the constituency in which they lived.  I take it from that, that those university electors who desired to vote in the constituency in which they lived were not registered on the university franchise.  Consequently, the register which is now in existence would be a limited register of university voters.  I wonder if the Minister can give the House any information on that point, as to whether that is so, and if any proposals have been under consideration for adding to the list of names that are already on the register those who had accepted the choice of being registered in their own constituencies and voting there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one section of this Bill which, I think, is mainly a machinery Bill, there is a reference to some evidence being <i>prima facie.</i>  I cannot now remember the section, and the note I have on the paper appears to refer to a different section; but it appeared to me that there was rather a weakness in the clause as it was drawn.  I may find it later on.  There is one other point that struck me in connection with this <i>prima facie</i> statement. As I see it, the returning officer, or whoever is responsible, sends out ballot papers and, when the ballot papers are received, somebody's name is put to the slip of paper that is handed in by the postman and there the responsibility of the Post Office begins and ends, once they have the receipt for the paper.  Now, it does not follow that the voter gets his ballot paper.  At one election information was conveyed to me that in a certain institution those papers were <Col N="623" /> duly signed for, but the persons for whom they were intended never got them and the votes were personated.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been before the House for two or three weeks and when I read it first it struck me there was that weakness in it and that danger of personation.  For example, in the case of a registered letter, whoever is at the door receiving it marks the slip.  It is not incumbent upon the person to whom the postal packet is addressed to put his signature to it.  Although it is a fortnight or three weeks since I read the Bill, it struck me that the same principle ran through this particular measure.  If so, it might possibly be rectified so that whenever a ballot paper is sent by post the postman or the Post Office could refuse to accept any signature except that of the person to whom the ballot paper is addressed.</P>

He may not know about that until the next day and he has no opportunity of withdrawing, because he has only one hour.</P>

      <P>I suppose we have got to have a Seanad, but I would like to point out one thing to the Minister. I think it is in Part II of the Bill where reference is made to people entitled to vote and it is set out there that they will include every person who has received a degree other than <Col N="624" /> an honorary degree in the National University of Ireland.  As we have become so very national in this country recently, is it not incumbent on the Minister to ensure that only citizens of this country should have a vote in electing this great body to be known as the Seanad?  I think that according to this measure we would be in the unique position of having a Chinaman or a Turk, perhaps, electing this great body to be known as the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has raised a point with regard to ballot papers that will be sent out in the post.  I think it would also lead to an extreme difficulty if we are going to have non-nationals in China entitled to vote, because there would have to be a considerable extension of time.  It is a matter that should be seriously considered by the Minister whether he is going to give non-nationals a vote in this election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, to a certain extent, some substance in what Deputy Cosgrave said about the present register on which it is proposed to hold the first Seanad election for university representation being a limited register.  I think it is only to a small extent a limited register, because, so far as I know, while there are persons all over the country, I do not know in how many counties, who did elect to remain on the local register for Dáil purposes, the vast majority of persons entitled to be on the University register chose to be electors on that register.  I cannot give the exact number; I do not know exactly how many persons entitled to be on the university register did elect to remain on the local voting lists, but the number, I gather, is not great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got the figures for the last six years from the registrars of the Universities and these figures show that since 1932-1933 there has been a steady increase every year in the number of persons whose names were added to the University registers.  In 1932-1933 the total number on the National University register was 4,655. By 1937-1938 the total number in the National University register had increased to 6,640, that is to say 2,000 have been added in these five years. <Col N="625" /> A very large percentage&mdash;not the entire&mdash;of the total number of persons entitled to claim to be on that register have so claimed.  I am sure there are people who are entitled to claim and do not claim to be on but who are on the local registers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say exactly but probably a close examination of the register would show that a small percentage on the register are not resident in the country.  There are large numbers of graduates of the Dublin University who are entitled to be on the register but many of these live in distant parts of the world.  They do not claim to be put on the register and are not there.  The same applies also to a certain extent to the National University. Numbers of graduates on the register and who are entitled to vote are unable to vote because they could not get the ballot papers in time owing to the distant parts of the world in which they reside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the point I raised here in the course of this debate I have now found the article.  It is in the Second Schedule to the Bill, paragraph 30 and reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The production by the returning officer of a ballot paper purporting to have been used at any election and of a counterfoil marked with the same printed number and having a number marked thereon in writing shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person who voted by such ballot paper was the person whose number on the register of electors was the same as the number so marked on such counterfoil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to what I told the Minister about one institution where <Col N="626" /> the postman did not give these ballot papers to the person for whom they were intended, there is clearly a great weakness there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but in the previous elections arrangements for delivering the ballot papers did not specify that they should be sent by registered post.  We propose by this Bill to send the ballot papers by registered post and in that way we hope to get over the difficulty that has been mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference in one section to a ballot paper that does not bear the official mark.  I suppose the Minister is aware of certain votes being disallowed because the ballot paper did not bear the official mark.  Deputy Brennan had an amendment making it part of the duty of the senior officer of the Gárda to see that the returning officer would have the assistance of the Gárda in this matter so that a person who is perfectly entitled to vote would not because of the absence of the official mark on his ballot paper have his vote disregarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much intimate experience of running elections except in the City of Dublin. There I think it is known to all of us who are associated with this electoral work in Dublin that usually over a long number of years the same persons, persons of experience in the work, are employed by the returning officers.  I understand that when new persons are being employed for this work they are drilled and given a lecture on the necessity and importance of the various functions they must perform including the duty of seeing that every ballot paper is properly stamped, so that the person receiving that ballot paper and voting on it would not be deprived of his vote owing to the failure of the presiding officer to do his duty efficiently.  I cannot think of any other arrangement than the one at present in existence that could be adopted.  I do not think that it would be a wise arrangement to have the Gárda or the police officer superintending the presiding officer.  I think the returning officers in every constituency <Col N="627" /> would object to anybody but themselves having authority over their officials.  Generally speaking I think the returning officers employ competent presiding officers.  Occasionally one does meet with a person who does not do his duty properly.  When there is a lack of proper knowledge on the part of the presiding officer and when that is brought to the attention of the returning officer, such a presiding officer would not be appointed again.  One or two people or more may have been deprived of a vote but I do not see how we can get over a difficulty of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this motion last week, I was <Col N="628" /> pointing out the injustice meted out to certain special services in the Army because of adherence to the principle of pension on the basis of rank and service only.  I do not think that any Deputy would take exception to a pension based on the two elements of rank and service if every officer and every soldier holding equal rank got equal pay or anything approximating to equal pay.  Every Deputy will agree that where the pay for a similar rank varies by as much as 100 per cent. nothing but a grave injustice can be done by attempting to pension everybody on the same basis of rank and service.  In fact, I would suggest that a close perusal of this particular scheme would make clear that what I am saying was recognised and admitted by the Minister and his advisers but, unfortunately&mdash;as is quite clear&mdash;recognised too late.  That belated recognition of the injustice done to officers in the special services is evidenced by the introduction of a 20 per cent. added pension.  You do not remove an injustice by reducing it by 20 percent. and the addition of that 20 per cent. to the pensions of certain classes of officers is merely an attempt to reduce the injustice by 20 per cent. If there is an injustice there, is not the obvious thing to reduce the injustice by 100 per cent. and not by 20 per cent.?  In every service of this State and of every other State, persons are pensioned on the basis of their pay.  No other form of pension matters one hoot to anybody.  All over the world people are pensioned on the basis of pay and, if you depart from that standard, you might as well pension the members of the Army according to their height or might.  Certain people would benefit; others would be very unjustly treated, but you would have a standard to which to adhere.  In the same way, a standard has been adopted in this case and, when you apply it, it does justice in certain cases and very grave injustice in others.  Meeting the injustice to the extent of 20 per cent. is not doing what officers and men would expect the Minister to do.  He, in particular, has got to think for all &mdash;not just for those who are closest <Col N="629" /> to his office.  Is there any evidence in that document that there was any fair thinking for all the officers, including those at a distance from the Minister's office?  Is there any evidence in that document that any consideration was given to the soldier on duty outside who had not the Minister's ear?  When we come to the portion of the scheme dealing with soldiers we shall find that this adherence to rank and not to pay as the basis for pension carries the same injustice when applied to the soldier as it does when applied to certain officers.  The Minister admits that fact when he adds 20 per cent. in cases where there is a difference of 100 per cent. in the pay.  He adds 20 per cent. to the pension of the man who has twice as high pay as the other in order to reduce the injustice. I want to fix that in the minds of Deputies, and I should like to be appealing to people who were not rigidly bound to vote for things whether they approve of them or not. In certain sections of the House, at least, that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The backbone of this scheme is that an officer&mdash;I am dealing only with officers now&mdash;will be pensioned on the basis of rank.  Let us see the effect of the application of that to different services in the Army.  The pay of a regimental officer is&mdash;I am giving maximum pay and maximum pension in each case&mdash;£328 per annum in the case of a captain.  The pay of certain special service officers of the rank of captain is £328 in one case and £730 in the other.  In the case of a commandant&mdash;the next rank&mdash;the pay of the regimental officer is £438 and the pay of the special service officer is £857 per annum.  Again, we have a two-to-one difference.  In the case of a major, the regimental rate is £511 and the special service rate £1,000.  Again, a variation of 100 per cent.  The attempt to pension these two sets of officers on a common basis and then add 20 per cent. to remedy the injustice is a shirking of the responsibility on the part of the person on top to see that every man under him is pensioned according to his pay.  The pip on an officer's shoulder strap does not matter the day after he leaves the Army. <Col N="630" /> These symbols may count when he is in barracks.  When he leaves the Army, what matters is whether his pension is in proportion to his pay or not.  The world will judge the justice of a pension scheme not by application of the pip standard but by the relation of the pension to the pay standard. That 20 per cent. was introduced as an afterthought to reduce an injustice and, for the same reason but with less consideration, an alternative scheme of pension was introduced.  Officers in the army medical service, if they so select, may be pensioned, instead of on this basis, on the basis of one-sixtieth of a year's pay for each year's service. Why that departure from the whole basis of the scheme?  Why was that alternative pension system introduced? Has it ever been heard of before&mdash;two pension schemes and the individual given his choice?  The reason that was introduced is that the Minister&mdash;I pay him this tribute&mdash;felt that a grave injustice was being done and an alternative scheme was thrown in&mdash;unfortunately, without any consideration.</P>
    <P>Probably, somebody said that that was the Civil Service scale&mdash;one-sixtieth of a year's pay for each year's service.  I do not say that it is a good scale&mdash;we are not discussing that now.  But I say it is essentially the type of scale that can do the very smallest bit of justice only on the understanding it is a service that people join young and leave old.  In the Civil Service, people can join at 18 years and serve up to 60 or 65.</P>
    <P>If there is any service to which that standard is inapplicable, it is a service which people join late in life and must leave comparatively early in life.  The fact that these men have to be qualified professional men before they enter the Army means straightaway that they can only enter late in life, and the fact that they are condemned by the necessities of the situation to junior rank within that Army means early departure from the Army.  One-sixtieth of a year's pay for each year's service is the most unjust scale in the whole world, except when applied to a service where many years' service is guaranteed. Late in and early out&mdash;one-sixtieth <Col N="631" /> is a hollow sham.  It is offering nothing, and if it eases the Minister's conscience, I should not like to be walking around with his conscience.  That is merely thrown in as a debating argument, as another leg for the Minister to stand on in defence of a very faulty document and very foul proposals; but if the Minister was supplied with as many legs as a caterpillar, he would not be able to stand over this document as a just and reasonable document when applied to the special service of the Army.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that, these men being professional men, there is a possibility of their supplementing their pensions when they have left the Army after a lifetime of service in harness, that they might be able to pick up a pound or a guinea here or there.  Is that the Minister's business? Is that the business of the Department of Defence?  If an officer or a man can supplement a meagre pension so as to have a little modest comfort in his home, is that the latest argument in this State for clipping the pension of an officer or soldier?  If the Minister would only look a little further afield into other countries, he would see that instead of that mean mentality, there is in every headquarters a man whose business it is to try to improve the circumstances of ex-soldiers and ex-officers.  I am merely anticipating that that argument may be put forward.  I hope it will not.  I would be ashamed of the Department of Defence and ashamed of this State, if a Minister of State would justify the reducing of pensions because an individual might supplement his pension by earning a few shillings.</P>
    <P>So much for the officers.  We come now to the men, to the N.C.O.s and the soldiers, another group far away from the Minister's office, and men with very different rates of pay, with variations as great as those I have pointed out in the case of the officers, but men of equal rank because of the fact that they were tradesmen, mechanics or especially proficient as clerks, who worked, studied and passed hard examinations and got certificates.  You have again in the case of men variations in pay by as much as 3/- and 4/- <Col N="632" /> a day, but the sacred symbol of rank and service applies again.  Here again in the case of pensions, we have no attention paid to the fact that private soldiers draw very different rates of pay and they are all to be pensioned, not on the pay basis, but on the rank and service basis.  They are all to go out with a flat rate pension of 2/- a day, whether they are paid 2/6 or 6/-. Is the Minister or anybody else prepared to meet a group of those men who drew specially high rates of pay because of proficiency, or because of a trade or special employment, a month after they leave the Army and say to them: &ldquo;Sorry; you are only getting 24 pennies a day because it was rank and service and not pay that counted with us and because rank and service was the thing we adhered to, you and your family can subsist on 24 pennies a day, less than you would get on the dole?&rdquo;  Are you going to have those people saying that there is justice in a rigid adherence to the rank and service element and in absolutely turning our backs on any relationship between pension and pay?  It is trampling on the spirit that conceived pension originally.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction of certain pensions, I suppose the same argument that applies to professional men will apply to these particularly proficient soldiers&mdash;the mechanics, the tradesmen and others&mdash;that because of their particular proficiency, of their particular trade, they will be able to supplement their pensions in civilian life when their service life is over. Is there any justification for the introduction of a means test?  Those pensions are not things gratuitously given in the common sense of the word. They are pensions earned by long, hard, and loyal service, and neither the Minister nor anybody else has the right to reduce them because the individual, be he officer or soldier, may have a remote chance of supplementing his pension by earning money in addition, after his 20, 25 or 30 years of service in the Army.  In certain respects, we hold up our heads as an example to others.  In respect of this particular scheme, I should be sorry to see anybody following the example being set by the Department of <Col N="633" /> Defence.  Nobody who reads this scheme in its application to anybody, officer, or soldier, drawing a rate higher than the normal rate for that rank, can stand over it and nobody who reads this thing closely, and understands it fully, can claim that justice is being done to all the sections and all the individuals in the Army.</P>
    <P>I understand that a pension scheme for the Army is more or less urgently required and I am sorry to hold it up, either by talking or by voting, but that should not be used as a lever to put through this House a regulation that is drastically unjust to very many people in the Army.  The necessities or the demands of some should not be used to do an injustice for all time to others.  Except some assurance can be given that this particular scheme will be revised, by giving full, careful and sympathetic consideration to those who are harshly hit by the application of the rank and service element, then I urge every Deputy to speak and vote against a measure that contains the injustices that this measure contains at the moment.  It may be put through because of urgency.  It will not be put through because of the amount of justice that is in it.  I am not arguing that the rates are too high in any case.  My argument from beginning to end is that the rates are too low in certain cases.  If this document is studied in conjunction with the rates of pay of other people in various ranks there will be no necessity to argue at all.  I suggest that if it had been studied fully before it was introduced it would never have been introduced here.  It may go through without the Minister's assurance, but if it does go through without the assurance I ask for it will be only because the small voice of justice is dimmed and obscured by the crack of the Party Whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of these regulations which I would like to bring under the special notice of the Minister.  In part of this document provision is being made for pensions which, if things in the Army are to remain as they have been for many years, mean that people will <Col N="634" /> never qualify to draw these pensions. As the Minister is aware the basis of recruitment for the Army is short-term service.  For a long time it has been short-term service in the Army, so that there is little use in providing a pension for a soldier at the end of 20 years, if he is only recruited for a period of three years.  There might be an excuse for that basis of recruitment at a time when the Army consisted exclusively of a regular Army; when it might be necessary to increase the rates and the strength from time to time.  The present policy, presumably, of the Government in relation to the Army is that the main Army is to consist of a voluntary force, and that the regular Army should be used mainly for instructional and maintenance purposes. That being the case, it would seem to me that the time has arrived&mdash;if it did not arrive long since&mdash;when the scandal of bringing men into the Army and keeping them for three, seven, or ten years, and then throwing them on to the labour market when, possibly, they are almost incapable of any other kind of work&mdash; even if such work could be provided for them&mdash;should cease.  The time has now arrived, when you have a small regular Army for instructional and maintenance purposes, when soldiers might be given a career in the Army and might be retained in it long enough to qualify for the pension which is laid down in the regulations. In regard to the provision for officers in the regulations, Deputy O'Higgins has drawn attention to the question of not relating pension to pay.  I should like to stress the fact that this defect is not peculiar to the commissioned ranks.  In the Army you have blacksmiths, mechanics, drivers, and tradesmen of various kinds, and it seems to me that they should receive pensions in proportion to their pay, and in proportion to the services they rendered in the Army.  In regard to officers, there is a provision which lays it down that they must qualify for the pension of the rank on which they retire by five years' service in the rank.  In normal circumstances, there might be a case for <Col N="635" /> that provision but, in the peculiar circumstances of the Army here, I do not think that case exists.  It is known to all Deputies that men in the Army here were, when it was established, roughly of the same age, with the result that promotion was practically stagnant.  You have junior officers who have as long service as men who are senior officers, and I think the Minister will admit that amongst these junior officers there are men of as much ability and efficiency as the senior officers, due to the fact that there were not sufficient openings in the higher ranks for all in the Army.  In these most peculiar circumstances there is a strong case for allowing pensions to relate to the rank held by an officer at the time of retirement without the five years' qualifying period.  I should like if the Minister could give the House some indication that, when making provision for pensions for soldiers after 20 years' service, he is also going to make some provision to enable these soldiers to have 20 years' service in order to qualify for pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what has been said in connection with special services.  One point occurred to me in connection with the list of special services that are referred to. Section 13 (4) mentions a number of special services for which officers will get certain consideration on retirement. Very rightly these include the Army Medical Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Legal Branch, the Army School of Music, the Army Signal Corps, the Ordnance Services and</P>
      <P>(ii) &ldquo;who possess professional or technical qualifications appropriate to the branch of the forces in which he is serving and</P>
      <P>(iii)  who is either in receipt of a special rate of pay in excess of the normal rate of pay for an officer of his rank or is at the date of his retirement and was for not less than five years immediately preceding that date in receipt of additional pay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not quite clear to me what type <Col N="636" /> of person is referred to.  I wonder why the provision stops after mentioning the Army School of Music, the Army Signal Corps, and the Ordnance Services.  There are other branches of the Army the officers in charge of which have to have highly specialised knowledge.  For instance, I think officers in the Equitation School who have brought such great honour to the country from the different horse shows at which they competed throughout the world, should be included for their special services, just as well as any of the non-professional services.  As to the question of relating the pension to the rank, I endorse everything that was said by Deputy O'Higgins.  It would be far more appropriate that the pension should be related to the pay that the man or the officer was in receipt of prior to retirement rather than to the rank he held.  Otherwise, this provision will cause grave hardship in many cases.  I do not think there is any precedent for anything of the kind in any of the other services of the State.  For instance, in the Civil Service pensions are calculated on 1/60th for each year of service, so that when the ordinary civil servant retires, assuming that he has served 40 years, he is given a pension equal to two-thirds of the salary that he was in receipt of.  In that case there is no big drop between what was his ordinary income and the sum that he receives as pension.  There is no such provision in this scheme.</P>
    <P>May I say, in passing, that this scheme is welcomed by everyone in the House.  At least it makes some provision for those in the Army when they retire.  It is a scheme that we have long been waiting for.  It is long overdue, and I may say it was overdue long before the Minister came into office.  I am quite prepared to admit that.  The scheme, as I have said, is long overdue.  But, while I say that, I think that it should have been given greater consideration so that some of the glaring injustices that appear in it could have been remedied before it was brought before the House.  The difficulty of dealing with this scheme is that no provision is made for amending it here.  All we can hope for is <Col N="637" /> that the Minister will give a promise to introduce amendments to it at some future date.  My interpretation of the scheme is that at the moment we have to take it or leave it as it stands.</P>
    <P>There is one branch of the non-commissioned service that, I think, deserves consideration from the Minister, and that is the branch dealing with the military police.  They are in a very peculiar position.  I think that since about 1926 every soldier who has been taken into the military police has been given the acting rank of corporal, and the pay of that rank. I understand that there is no such thing now as a private in the military police.  They all have the acting rank of corporal.  The reason for that, I understand, is that it was thought this acting rank would give them more authority in dealing with the ordinary private soldier who committed any misdemeanour.  I understand that those men have been in receipt of the pay appropriate to the corporal's rank. That has been going on, I understand, for a number of years.  I think some provision should be made to deal with their case in the pension scheme, or, better still, that they should be confirmed in the rank of corporal: that, when an ordinary private soldier is taken into the military police, he should be confirmed in the rank of corporal, and that the pay of that rank would automatically follow.</P>
    <P>I heartily agree with what Deputy Heron said in connection with the qualifying period of five years in a particular rank before on becomes entitled to the pension of that rank. I do not think there is any such provision in the case of civil servants.  In the Civil Service the period I think is three years.  If a man holds a particular rank in the Civil Service before he retires, then his pension is calculated on the salary appropriate to that rank.  This period of five years, in view of the conditions in which officers serve in our Army, will I think cause many injustices.  The efficient officers have long enough to wait&mdash; they will have to wait, perhaps, too long&mdash;before they can hope to get promotion to higher ranks than they hold at the moment because of the fact that all those who are senior to them <Col N="638" /> are young men, possibly about the same age as themselves.  Take the case of a man who has 18 or 20 year's service.  Let us say that after 20 year's service he is promoted to the next highest rank four years prior to his retirement.  In such a case, I think it would be extremely unjust that his pension should be calculated on the salary set out for the lower rank.  That is all I have to say so far as the pensions are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one clause in the scheme itself which I dislike very much.  Sub-section (1) of Section 40 provides:</P>
    <P>If any pensioner is, during the continuance of his pension, convicted of a crime or offence by a court of competent jurisdiction in Saorstát Eireann and is sentenced by that court for that crime or offence to imprisonment for any term exceeding three months...</P>
    <P>he shall lose his pension.  I have no objection to that.  It is the ordinary common provision which we are used to.  But sub-section (2) of the same section provides:</P>
    <P>If any pensioner is, during the continuance of his pension, guilty, in the opinion of the Minister, of disgraceful conduct, the Minister may, if he is of opinion that the circumstances of the case warrant his doing so, terminate such pension or suspend the payment of it for such period as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not like that.  It is an invitation to a Minister who might be inclined to be a bit of a busybody, to go and look into the private lives of men after their retirement.  I do not suggest that the present Minister would do that, and I take it it will be a long time before he will have any pensioners to deal with.  But one can conceive that some person occupying the position of Minister might take extraordinary views on what was or what was not disgraceful conduct.  We have all read of the very peculiar case that occurred in the Minister's constituency quite recently.  Certain person up there thought it was disgraceful conduct for a certain person to kiss a girl.  Well, I think most Deputies will agree that soldiers the world over have a little way with girls.  Whether or not they <Col N="639" /> lose that on retirement I do not know. But if, for instance, you had a Minister who thought as a certain vigilance committee did in the County Louth, you might have an unfortunate pensioner losing his pension for a peccadillo of that kind.</P>
    <P>That is only one aspect of it.  There is this other aspect, that it is an invitation to a Minister to interfere, for instance, with the activities of ex-officers and ex-soldiers in the political sphere after they have retired from the Army.  The Minister might think that their acting in a particular way, or their taking a prominent part in a political party which was opposed to his own, was a disgraceful matter.  If you had such a Minister, this sub-section would provide him with power to stop the pension of a particular ex-soldier or ex-officer who had been reported to him for engaging in such activities.</P>
    <P>I think there is no excuse for a provision of that kind in the scheme.  I think it is quite sufficient to provide that a person will lose his pension if sentenced for any crime by a competent court.  I do not think the Minister should be placed in the position of being a censor of the conduct of retired officers and men.  I am perfectly certain that the present Minister does not ambition in the least being placed in that position.  I do not think for one moment that he would be likely to abuse the power, but there is that possibility.  You must provide very often for the unexpected in cases of this kind, and therefore I think the Minister should move to wipe out this particular sub-section from the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasPatrickDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the scheme, but I have listened to the speeches of Deputy Heron and of Deputy Lynch.  Deputy Lynch seems to think that it is a matter of quite common practice, and perfectly correct, that an ex-officer or ex-soldier who commits some misdemeanour and is sentenced to three months' imprisonment by a competent court should have his pension stopped.  I do not agree with that at all.  I think it is quite wrong.  After all, the pension has been granted for services rendered. The man has earned his pension, and <Col N="640" /> in my opinion it should not be taken from him.  Suppose Deputy Lynch's view were to be accepted, what would happen?  Let us suppose that the ex-officer or ex-soldier who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for some offence is a married man with a wife and family.  The pension is not given to him to spend it all on himself. It is intended for the upkeep of his wife and family, and it is they who are going to suffer if it is taken away from him.  That is a provision that, in my opinion, should not be in the scheme, and I appeal to the Minister to delete it.</P>

      <P>One section that has given Deputy Finian Lynch and Deputy Dowdall some qualms of conscience is a section that is in nearly all the Pensions Bills.  It goes back to the 1923 Bill. I must say that there is something to be said for Deputy Dowdall's point of view, that a pension, once granted, belongs to the man concerned and that it should never be taken away from him no matter how he behaves; but you have, in all the pensions legislation, one clause stating that, if a pensioner is sentenced by a court to a certain term of imprisonment, his pension will be quashed. You have also in the 1923 Act a clause to the effect that if a pensioner behaved in a disgraceful manner the Minister had power to withdraw his pension. If an amendment were to be made in regard to that policy, which I call a policy of threat held over the pensioners' heads, it would have to be amended in a lot of other respects as well as in respect of this pensions scheme.  I expect that the idea behind the holding of a threat of this kind over a pensioner's head was that, if he was going to give the State trouble and force the State to put him in jail, the State were not going to pay him for carrying on in that way.  With regard to the disgraceful conduct clause, however, <Col N="641" /> as far as I can remember, there has not been any case of putting it into operation.  There was a certain number of cases of pensions being withdrawn for imprisonment, or pending imprisonment, that were afterwards restored, but I do not know of any case where Clause 2, relating to disgraceful conduct, was ever put into operation.  It is just a threat held over pensioners' heads, and whether that was responsible for making them behave or not, I cannot say, but at least I am not aware of any case where a pension was withdrawn where the prisoner was not sentenced by a court.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said, in the beginning of his speech on the last day, that generally speaking this pensions scheme was satisfactory.  He excepted, however, the provision that was made for the medical services.  I think, myself, that the whole scheme is satisfactory and, as Deputy O'Higgins must be aware, it is more satisfactory to the lower scales of both the commissioned and non-commissioned ranks than certain other schemes.  I am convinced, myself, that 20 per cent. additional pensions for medical services is quite sufficient.  Twenty per cent. is a big increase for a medical man with the rank of captain over that of the pay of, say, a captain of infantry.  I was not responsible for fixing the scales of pay originally, but I must say this: that if I got more money from the Minister for Finance to improve this retired pay scheme, it is not to the medical services that it would go.  I think that 20 per cent. additional on their pensions is quite a reasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we have made a difference between the special services and the other corps of the Army, in that we have given certain of the special services the option of taking their pension after 20 years' service&mdash;the pension that is normally reached after 20 years' service&mdash;or of going on 1-60th of their pay per year of service. Anyone examining the question will see that there are certain of the special service officers who can carry on to a very much greater age in the Army than, say, an infantry or artillery captain, who has to be very <Col N="642" /> active, and provision is made for the special services, where officers may continue beyond the 20 or 25 years which would be normal for infantry or artillery officers, that they have the option of taking the ordinary pension, plus 20 per cent. or whatever the percentage may be, or going on this basis of drawing 1-60th of their pay per year of service.  I think that is quite a fair way of approaching the matter. If a man carries on beyond the ordinary 20 or 25 years in the Army, he has the option of taking 1-60th of his pay per year of service.</P>

      <P>Well, we have not that at the moment.  We are discussing this scheme in the absence of a regulation that has to be brought in fixing the retiring ages for the various ranks and so on, but in arriving at these retiring ages everything will have to be taken into account, such as the corps, the circumstances under which the present officers entered the Army, and the circumstances under which future officers will be likely to join.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that the case of a private soldier, who is a tradesman and who has been carrying out his trade in the Army, is analogous to the position of officers who are being specially treated for special services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are certain highly trained officers and men in the Army who give better services in the Army than other men because of their special training and special skill, and the retiring age for them will be different from what I call the active elements of the Army, such as the infantry and artillery, who have to be active all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister missed my point.  My point is that the private soldier gets no recognition in the amount of his pension for his special skill as a tradesman.  He gets special proficiency pay because of his special training or skill, but he gets no recognition of that proficiency or skill in the fixing of his pension.</P>

      <P>Well, up to this moment, officers and men of the Army had to think of the future and how they would provide for themselves, and this particular scheme is certainly and addition to the expectations they had a couple of years ago.  I am not saying that it is an over-generous scheme, but it is certainly and addition to their expectations, as I have said.  My advice to both officers and men in the Army would be to try to do something out of their ordinary pay to provide for their future requirements in addition to this pension.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Heron as to short-time service, I agree that, normally, if a man joins the Army and remains in for a certain number of years and gets accustomed to that type of life, he should not be thrown out.  You have a system of selecting the men who are suitable for long-term service by recruiting for the reserve.  We recruit for the A reserve a man who has served two years and, either at his own option or on the recommendation of his senior officer, leaves at the end of that time.  He continues in the reserve for ten years and during these ten years he gets a <Col N="644" /> bounty every year.  Sometimes the option is given of extending the service for three years after the two years have expired.  Normally, if a man's service is extended I think that he should continue for the 21 years. But the system of recruiting originally into the Army is not for 21 years' service. It is not in any other Army that I know of.  It is for two years in the regular Army and ten years in the reserve.  From the number who offer themselves for that type of service are selected the men who are willing to go on for long-term service.</P>
      <P>Deputies O'Higgins, Lynch and Heron referred to another point&mdash; that it should not be required of an officer that he should be five years in a particular rank before he will get the pension relating to that rank.  As a matter of fact, normally if a man retires after 20 years' service he may only be one year in the rank in order to qualify for the pension of that rank. It is only where a man is compulsorily retired before reaching 20 years' service, or where he retires voluntarily, that he must have had five years' service in the rank before he will get the pension of that rank.  That requirement is put in so that a man might not be put up for promotion immediately before his retirement and then go out on retired pay.  But, normally, a man will only have to serve one year in the rank in order to get the pension of that rank upon retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete reference No. 2.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, this is a duty imposed for the purpose of facilitating the introduction of the firm of Salts into the production of worsted yarns in Ireland.  The history surrounding this problem does not begin to-day or yesterday.  It goes back some time. Prior to the establishment of this State we had in the country a very good industry for the manufacture of woollen textiles, but it was common knowledge, amongst all of us handling woollen textiles, that the designs of the cloths produced by Irish woollen manufacturers were somewhat old-fashioned and, though they were eminently suited for certain branches of the trade, they made by no means a universal appeal. We were embarrassed in our export trade because with the rapidly-changing designs which became the fashion after the war, our manufacturers did not seem to be able to compete.  In that situation they approached the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the previous Government and made representations that if they got a modest tariff, which would encourage them to try to capture the greater part of the Irish market for woollen textiles, they would feel justified in embarking on capital expenditure by bringing in foreign experts in design and by purchasing better spinning and finishing machinery, so as to compete with the most up-to-date mills in the world. That application was considered by the previous Government and a modest tariff, I think of 15 per cent., was granted to the woollen manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say at this juncture that I am speaking without any consultation with the woollen manufacturers at all, so that in some details my version of the facts may be slightly inaccurate, <Col N="647" /> because I have no brief in the matter from the woollen manufacturers themselves. I speak merely as one who is familiar with the trade for the last 15 years as a distributor of woollen textiles.</P>
    <P>As a result of a modest tariff, immense progress was made in the Irish woollen textile business, and I think it is true to say that in 1932 the Irish woollen mills could have competed with the Scotch and English mills if there was no tariff at all.  They were producing cloths of quite as good design and quite as good finish as anything that could be got anywhere in Scotland or England.  They were not then able&mdash;and in my judgment they are not now able&mdash;to produce an indigo serge or a black serge with as fine a finish as you could get in Great Britain, but for all fancy suitings the Irish mills were more than a match for any competition from any part of the world, and that efficiency derived almost entirely from the modest degree of protection that they got from the Cumann na nGaedheal Government of the day.  Now, I want to emphasise the words &ldquo;the modest degree of protection&rdquo;, because they had only a comparatively low duty, and if they had not worked themselves up to a high pitch of efficiency the Scotch cloths and the English cloths would have come in over the tariff barrier, and would have been widely sold in this country.  The knowledge that the tariff was so low spurred on the Irish millers to make that extra endeavour which made them produce a cloth not 15 per cent. inferior to the British cloth, not 10 per cent. inferior to the British cloth, but eventually, in my judgment, 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. better than any English cloth which has been offered.</P>
    <P>That was the situation when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  Then everybody started clamouring for tariffs.  The Minister was exhorting everybody to go in for a fine whole-hog tariff, and this fly was cast over the Irish woollen textile manufacturers.  They resisted it for some time, but then, with the rest of the industrialists of this country, they fell for the Minister's bait, and they <Col N="648" /> took a very prohibitive tariff.  Under that prohibitive tariff they expanded largely in the production of navy serges and black serges, in which in my judgment, they have never attained the efficiency of the British mills.  They were going along quite cheerfully, raising their prices and generally having a gala time behind the high tariff wall, when they were informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they must now start producing shoddy, that is, low grade woollen cloth, manufactured largely from what is known in the trade as woollen waste, for cheap ready-made clothes.  The ready-made clothing industry had been stimulated in this country.  The trade which used to be done in Leeds and Belfast had been established here, and they wanted supplies of this cloth called shoddy. The Irish mills, I think very wisely, said: &ldquo;No.  We do not want to go into the shoddy business at all.  We have built up a reputation for the top quality woollen textile.  Our name on any piece of goods is a guarantee that that piece of cloth is as good as it possibly can be.  Now, if we go into the shoddy business, and our name becomes associated with shoddy in the minds of the buying public, it is going to do our fine cloths a much greater injury than any profit which we could make in the shoddy trade would recoup us for.&rdquo;  They shied away from the whole proposal.</P>
    <P>I understand that protracted negotiations went on, and in the heel of the hunt the Minister said: &ldquo;Very well; I must bring in a firm who will make this shoddy cloth in Ireland.&rdquo;  The woollen manufacturers said: &ldquo;Very well.  We agree to that.  We do not object, on this condition: We have spent large sums of money on developing this business, and we do not want you to bring in a firm from England to compete with us in this particular trade of which we are past masters.  We can produce anything you want in the high grade business.  Do not deliberately bring in another firm under your protection to compete with us.&rdquo;  I understand the Minister said that he would confine the new firm to the manufacture of the low-grade cloth which the old-established Irish firm did not wish <Col N="649" /> to touch.  Accordingly, after negotiations, the firm of Pepper Lee and Company was introduced and set up in this country, and they were to manufacture shoddy.  They were not manufacturing shoddy for very long when they started to manufacture woollen cloth as well.  There was a great fluttering in the dovecots.  The old manufacturers were amazed that these new-comers were allowed to compete with them.  Representations, I believe, were made to the Minister; the Minister, I believe, gave the old-established manufacturers very little satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The next chapter in the story is that the Minister announced that now the Irish woollen textile manufacturers must buy their yarns from an Irish firm.  They said that there was no Irish firm to supply them.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I am going to bring in Messrs.  Salts (Saltaire) of Great Britain, who will manufacture these yarns for you.&rdquo;  The Irish manufacturers said: &ldquo;This is absurd. We deal with as many as 60 different firms for the different classes of yarn we require if we are to go on producing the very finest woollen textiles that can be produced in the world. No one firm or no one mill could supply us with the various qualities and classes of yarn which we must have if we are to turn out the best quality woollen textiles.&rdquo;  These remonstrances, I understand, were ignored.  They were told they would have to deal with Salts (Saltaire) and like it; if they did not like it they could lump it.  There was then a flotation of Messrs. Salts (Saltaire), about the financial success of which I do not know.  I suspect that the Industrial Credit Company was left with a fair share of capital, and Salts (Saltaire) arrived.</P>
    <P>What was the astonishment of all to discover that Salts (Saltaire) had floated their capital in this market, had induced the Government agents, the Industrial Credit Company, to underwrite the issue and take up part of it; that Salts (Saltaire) had bought up Pepper Lee and Company; that Pepper Lee and Company is now the property of Salts (Saltaire), or at least that they control it; that the old-established <Col N="650" /> Irish woollen mills are now obliged to compete with Pepper Lee and Company in the woollen textile business, and while competing with Pepper Lee they have to buy their yarns from Pepper Lee and Company, because Pepper Lee and Company and Salts (Saltaire) are the same firm. Pepper Lee and Company manufacture yarn and convert that yarn into cloth, but the old-established Irish industrialists must buy their yarn from Pepper Lee or Salts (Saltaire) and convert that yarn into woollen textiles, and then try to compete with Pepper Lee.  Well, naturally, the old-established Irish firms feel they have a bit of grievance.  Now, I take the view that most industrialists are well able to look after their own business, and I am not going to break my heart over any of them individually.  But the Irish woollen industry is an industry which owes nothing to this Government. It was a prosperous exporting industry before Fianna Fáil was ever heard of.  It had contributed substantially to the national exports.  It had assisted in maintaining the balance of trade.  It had provided good employment and had reflected great credit on the Irish industry wherever its products went all over the world.</P>
    <P>I consider it to be a most deplorable thing that the inept and incompetent floundering of the Minister for Industry and Commerce should strike this industry a most injurious blow at a very critical time.  The world is recovering. We may look forward, I think, with confidence, to a steady increase of prosperity all over the world for the next ten or 15 years.  This country should get its share, and no industry in this country is better equipped to get its share of that increased purchasing power all over the world than is the Irish woollen textile industry. At this critical stage of its career it is going to get a body blow from our own Government.  I think that would be a crime, not only against a body of enterprising men&mdash;a crime against a body of men who, after all, did build up their business before it became the fashion to insist on having a 75 per cent. tariff before you would venture a penny in Irish industry, a body of men who invested all they had in an Irish <Col N="651" /> industry and built it up by their initiative and courage&mdash;but it is also a terrific crime against the State.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, urge the Minister very strongly to reconsider the proposals which lie behind the imposition of this duty and (1) to see that our Irish mills have made available to them whatever worsted yarns they require or whatever woollen yarns they require in order to maintain the present high standard of their product and (2) to insist, if Messrs. Pepper Lee &amp; Company came in here with an undertaking, explicit or implied, that they would confine themselves to the shoddy branch of the trade, that they should stick to the shoddy branch of the trade.  I have no objection if a body of Irishmen choose to set up a new mill and go into the manufacture of textiles&mdash;the more competition the better&mdash;but I do object to the Government bringing in under their patronage and special protection a firm that never would have come in but that it was brought in by the Government, in order unfairly to compete with existing Irish industries.</P>
    <P>I allege that the Minister is responsible for such a situation and it is his duty to remedy it.  I say further that if the financial relationship which at present exists between Pepper Lee and Company and Salts (Saltaire) continues, it is not fair to require the Irish industrialists to buy any substantial part of their raw materials from Salts (Saltaire).  Either Salts (Saltaire) or Pepper Lee and Company must become independent of each other or else the Government has no right to force existing Irish textile manufacturers into dealing with Salts (Saltaire).  These are clear and explicit points and I invite the Minister to give us his version of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon commenced his remarks by saying that his information might in some respects be inaccurate.  Perhaps his modesty got the better of him at that stage.  I do not think he got a single fact right, either in respect of the historical matters with which he commenced his observations or the points of more immediate importance bearing on the amendment.  I do not propose to go <Col N="652" /> back into the past.  I merely will say this, that in 1932 a change took place, to which the Deputy did not refer, and that is that we commenced in that year to manufacture our own requirements of ready-made clothing.  Previous to that year a comparatively small quantity of worsted and woollen cloths were imported here, as such, but there was a huge quantity of worsted and woollen cloths imported as ready-made clothes, manufactured into such abroad.</P>
      <P>When we developed our own ready-made clothing industry and cut out imports of these commodities, the requirements of this country in the matter of cloth increased tremendously. If the Deputy will study the trade and shipping statistics he will find that last year and the previous year the quantity of woollens and worsteds imported was considerably greater than before the new industrial policy began.  It has always been our intention to manufacture not merely the clothes, but also the cloths, and not merely the cloths but also the yarns, and we have been proceeding with the fulfilment of that intention.  In order, however, to get the cloths made here it was obvious a considerable extension of our woollen industry would be necessary.</P>
      <P>The woollen industry of this country had fallen upon lean times.  I do not think that any woollen manufacturer will agree that they were in the very prosperous condition that Deputy Dillon described in 1931 or 1932.  They had an export trade of some dimensions, a trade which was, to some extent, interfered with by the tariff imposed by Great Britain on woollen cloth exported from this country, but it still exists and has, in fact, been growing in recent years.  They had a very much smaller trade in this country than they have at the moment, but even now they are not supplying a fraction of our requirements of cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy will study the most recent volume of trade and shipping statistics he will find that in the first nine months of this year our imports exceeded 5,000,000 square yards.  If we are going to get that cloth made here, there has to be a considerable expansion of production in the existing mills and the establishment of a number of new mills.  The existing mills have been constructed and <Col N="653" /> equipped to supply certain classes of cloth.  As the Deputy mentioned, some of the woollen manufacturers are opposed on grounds of policy to manufacturing more than one class of cloth.  Consequently, the production here of classes of cloth not previously made here is going to involve the establishment of new plants of probably a different character from that of the older plants which the woollen manufacturers here have operated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to shoddy.  In fact, there is no shoddy being made here.  Shoddy is a commodity which is required by the people of this country. It enables them to get a certain type of apparel of not very high wearing quality but of better appearance in the minds of the purchasers of it than other garments within their purchasing power, and the ready-made clothing industry is to a large extent built up on the shoddy or low-priced cloths, and the ready-made clothing industry is an important one.  From the point of view of employment it is even more important than the woollen industry and it is part of the duty of the Government to ensure that the industry will be able to get the raw materials in this country. Therefore, we have been exploring the possibility of making shoddy cloths. We have not succeeded, but I hope we will succeed at some stage.  It is a difficult industry to establish, because it requires a high capital investment and it also requires great skill on the part of those undertaking it.</P>
    <P>I may say that Pepper Lee and Company were never invited and there was never a suggestion that this firm which the Deputy referred to was invited to undertake the manufacture of shoddy cloths.  It was encouraged by us to undertake, and is beginning to produce, certain classes of women's dress materials and men's clothing, materials of a lighter weight than the existing manufacturers produce.  I doubt if even the activities of Pepper Lee will be sufficient to meet the whole of our requirements in the class of cloth in which they are engaged and which the existing manufacturers <Col N="654" /> were not producing except to a very limited extent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said that the woollen manufacturers were amazed to find that this firm was going to compete with them.  I do not think it can be an amazing matter to the woollen manufacturers at all.  Even if it were, I cannot understand the amazement which the Deputy attributes to the woollen manufacturers, because this is essentially a Saorstát firm and two-thirds of its voting property is held by Saorstát nationals.  This firm is entitled, under the law, to manufacture in this country anything from a needle to a battleship.  There is no power in the Government to prevent the firm giving effect to its intention to engage in the production of these dress cloths which previously were entirely imported, which are still being imported and which will continue to be imported until this firm has increased its production.  There is no direct bearing on this by the subject matter of the Deputy's amendment which relates to woollen and worsted yarns and to certain classes of woollens and worsted yarns that have been produced here already. Indeed, these yarns had been produced for a number of years but in previous years there was a very considerable import of the yarns required by the hosiery factories and the woollen and worsted mills.</P>
    <P>According to our general policy we have been endeavouring to interest people in this country in the manufacture of these yarns.  It was with the advent of this company to Tullamore that the question came to be considered by the Government.  On very many occasions since 1932 I and the officers of my Department have had discussions with individual woollen manufacturers and other parties who are interested in the establishment here of a plant for the production of these yarns.  We were assured by some of these people that it was not an economic proposition, but we persisted in our efforts, and a company was formed to establish a plant here.  It is quite true that there is some association between that company and the Pepper Lee Company. But I have again to say that it is a <Col N="655" /> national undertaking and it is entitled to engage in the manufacture of these yarns.  It is entitled to engage in the manufacture of these yarns even if the Government wished to prevent them. This is an important industry which we have been trying for a number of years to develop, and I am very glad that our efforts have been successful.  It is proved now beyond all question that this industry is capable of being established here upon an economic basis.  In any event it is going to produce and sell these woollen and worsted yarns at the same price as that at which they have been sold in Great Britain.  If we can get the factory here to work at the same cost as similar factories are being operated in Great Britain, we can regard it as reasonably efficient and economic.  It may well be that there will be some fluctuations in labour costs here.  It may be that some considerations affecting the selling price here which do not operate in Great Britain may arise here, but subject to the conditions being the same, the price here will be the same.  There will be no difficulty in regard to woollen manufacturers and others getting these yarns in adequate quantities and at the same price as that at which they are getting them in England.  If there is any difficulty at all in procuring the particular classes here, that difficulty will be met by importation.</P>
    <P>The factory is now being constructed. It is estimated that it will be 18 months from the start of production here before full production will be reached. At that stage it is estimated that some 700 people will be employed in the production of these yarns in Tullamore. That is a matter of very considerable importance to that district, and the establishment of the factory there will be of considerable advantage to the town.  I do not think we should jeopardise that possibility by some purely theoretical objections.  We have got from the company a binding undertaking that its products will be sold to all manufacturers on the same terms, and that no one manufacturer will have an advantage in price over another.  I can give the House an assurance, so far as I am concerned, that if that undertaking is not carried out, the protection <Col N="656" /> given to the industry will be removed. But I and my Department have no reason to believe that that assurance will not be carried out.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this factory is not going to interfere in any way with the development of our woollen mills. We wish to see that the export trade which our woollen mills are doing will be maintained.  That export trade has been showing some tendency recently to increase in consequence of developments in markets to which they had not previously exported their goods.  In any event the establishment of the yarns plant at Tullamore will not interfere with that development.  There is a market available for them the size of which is represented by the figures I quote.  For the first nine months of this year the imports of these yarns were 5,000,000 square yards.  Last year these imports were, for the whole year, 7,000,000 square yards.  These are all a class of cloth which the woollen manufacturers here do not produce, but they also include cloths which they can produce.</P>
    <P>The Deputy represented the woollen manufacturers as having been seduced by me into accepting protection.  I would like to take this opportunity of dealing with the representations made to me that the woollen manufacturers have not got enough protection.  We have an import duty upon these cloths. Now in addition to the import duty there are various restrictions imposed under the Control of Manufacturers Act.  Certain quantities of cloth of different values are allowed in under licence during the course of the year. The representations I am getting from the woollen manufacturers are that we are letting in too much cloth and that we should more seriously restrict the imports so as to compel the ready-made clothing people to get their requirements supplied to them from the Irish mills.  From the day that I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I must say that there is no question which caused me personally more trouble than the question of reconciling the conflicting interests of the clothing manufacturers with the conflicting interests of the woollen manufacturers. We have had many consultations with the representatives of both parties, <Col N="657" /> and we have had general consultations with other Departments as to what should be the reasonable measure of protection for the woollen companies. The woollen manufacturers think we should impose more restrictions on imports.  I am told that certain mills are in a precarious position and may have to cease operations unless a greater volume of business is secured for them.  That may or may not be the case, but I want to point out that the market which we have made available in this country in consequence of our restrictions on imports represents a larger production than anything they ever achieved.  If they fill that market they will have reached a new record in total production.  In these circumstances it is difficult to say how it can be contended that the volume of imports is detrimental to the interests of the woollen manufacturers or how it is jeopardising in any way the outlook of the woollen mills.  Some of the woollen mills may disappear.  A great many of them are old and have inefficient equipment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they cannot be expected to get their best results unless modernised.  Some of the more enterprising companies&mdash;I am sure it is not necessary to name them, because Deputies become familiar with their names every time they buy a suit&mdash; have taken full advantage of the position created by Government policy and have extended their production enormously, developing into new lines and installing the most up-to-date equipment to enable them to produce efficiently and sell at the lowest price compatible with a reasonable profit. I think the Government will have done its duty if it secures the possibility of progressive development to the woollen manufacturers.  We have done that, although it has been frequently represented to us by clothing manufacturers that we have left them short of supplies. It has been represented to us that, particularly in connection with the women's dress end of the trade, some concerns have been obliged to <Col N="658" /> close down because of their inability to get the cloth they required.  It is, undoubtedly, true that, in the production of dress materials, we were lacking. In consequence of the methods of operation under the Control of Imports Act, it was not always possible to distinguish between one class of cloth and another, and, when a person had a licence given him to import cloth because of the need for dress materials, he might well use that licence to import worsteds or serges which he could have got equally well from the Irish mills.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We endeavoured to deal with that situation by the new powers we got under an amendment of the Control of Imports Act and also by altering the method of control&mdash;by having, instead of one quota order, two quota orders.  We have now separate quotas for cloth under 2/- and for cloth over 2/- per yard.  In fact, the licences issued under the second quota order may not be used for cloth over 3/6 per yard.  There is, therefore, a closer attempt to regulate imports in accordance with our needs, while securing for the clothing manufacturers the cloths they must get to keep going.  We are in that way providing an ever-increasing market for the woollen manufacturers.  We are doing all we can to secure progressive development of the two industries simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are getting, in relation to this particular group, to the third stage of development&mdash;the production of the yarns used by the mills.  We can get these materials manufactured on an economic basis, and I think this firm at Tullamore is a satisfactory firm to be entrusted with that work.  I think they will do well and that a lot of the fears voiced by the woollen and hosiery manufacturers will completely disappear. Perhaps at a later stage we shall consider the making of these yarns from Irish wool.  Then we may have Deputy Dillon voicing a complaint on behalf of Salts (Saltaire) that some limitation is being placed on <Col N="659" /> their liberty and that they are not being allowed to buy their wool where they like.  When we have got to that stage we shall have completed the job. We may never get to that stage, but we can get to the stage of producing the yarns.  That is what this duty is intended to secure, and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>These words were spoken and that is what the Minister means.  This duty is a deliberate death-warrant for some of our old Irish mills for the purpose of making room for Pepper Lee and the likes of them.  Any fly-by-night from Czechoslovakia, Great Britain or Yugoslavia <Col N="660" /> can come here, provided he has got a name you cannot get your mouth round, and he will be nurtured and cherished by this Government, to the detriment and the ultimate destruction of people who were engaged in industry in this country before de Valera was heard of.  We are asked to pass sentence of death on these old industries which are worth more to this country than all the new industries, established by gentlemen with unpronounceable names, put together.</P>
      <P>We are told that some ready-made clothing manufacturers complained, particularly, that they could not get materials for ladies' clothes.  I should like to have a list of the manufacturers of ladies' clothes in this country. I should like to get their names and I should like the Minister to try to pronounce them.  He would choke before he would get through the list. These gentlemen are to come in here and condemn our well-established industries to destruction because they cannot get supplies of cloth to make ladies' clothes.  Let me now be put on record as saying publicly that, as between the woollen textile industry and the women's clothing industry, the women's clothing industry does not count for a snap of the fingers.  It is a machine-run, fly-by-night business which will never get any hold in this country.  Of its nature, it could never prosper in this country because the market here is far too small to sustain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If you have no clothing industry here, to whom are the woollen mills going to sell their cloth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not one of these mills makes a yard of cloth for the women's ready-made clothing trade.  Pepper Lee is brought in, on his own admission, to engage in that industry.  The women's clothing trade is, as everybody knows, a fashion trade.  Women's clothes change with the season.  What they were wearing in 1930 could not possibly be sold in 1932.  I know&mdash; because I am selling the clothes.  If the stock I bought in 1935 is on my shelf to-day, I may write it out of stock and give it away; it is no good. <Col N="661" /> The women's clothes which were on my shelf in 1932 can be given away in 1934.  You could not sell them. Nobody would buy them.  Any man &mdash;much less a perceptive woman&mdash;who looked at a woman's coat of 1932 being worn in 1935 would simply laugh.  He could not conceive of a woman wearing it, from the fashion point of view. It is a rapidly-changing trade for which you must have an immense market so that the goods will pass quickly into consumption and you will be able to clear your shelves so as to make room for new stock.  The same is true of the materials that go into these garments and you can never establish a satisfactory industry for the supply of cloth suitable for manufacture into women's ready-made clothes.  It is ridiculous to jeopardise the whole woollen textile business to try to secure that.  Of course the Irish woollen textile business was mainly designed for the manufacture of cloth to be used in making men's clothes. It is a very valuable industry, and it is one of the only industries in which we were able to build up a substantial export trade in the face of world competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that when Salts (Saltaire) are established in Tullamore, this firm will have the same costings, etc., as in England, and will give an undertaking to that effect. But he goes on to say that certain circumstances may result in making it impossible for the Irish woollen textile manufacturers to get their yarns at the same price as that at which they used to get them from Great Britain. How, in the name of heaven, can we maintain an export trade in woollen textiles if you are going to increase the price of all the yarns which the woollen textile manufacturers have to use in their manufacturing?  You have got to make up your minds to this: Are you going to destroy the export trade which our Irish woollen mills have?  If you are, I warn you that the words used by the Minister: &ldquo;Some of the old mills may have to go,&rdquo; will come true much sooner than you people anticipate.  You will ruin most of the old mills in this country if you destroy their export trade, and it is ludicrous for the Minister to suggest <Col N="662" /> that he has anything to offer them in the home market to compensate them for the loss of that external trade.</P>
    <P>We are to get guarantees from Salts (Saltaire) that they will not charge any more for their goods.  Did we not get guarantees from the Westport Thread Company that they would not increase their prices, and they were not three weeks in this country until they were charging more for sewing cotton and all the threads they were selling to manufacturers?  I now allege that the Westport Thread Company is charging the manufacturers of this country over 74/- per dozen lbs. for thread which they have to use and which could be got in Great Britain at present for 56/-, and I say that conclusive proof of that is at present in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I say that the two threads were sent to Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to deal with that firm except to say that the Minister is in possession of certain facts, and those facts include the submission of samples of thread, because the Minister is going to say that the quality was better although the price was higher.  I now want to point out that the Minister is in possession of evidence as to a test conducted to prove the quality of the two samples of thread.  It was proved satisfactorily that the English sample of 56/- was better quality than the other, although the other was over 74/-.  That illustrates the value of such <Col N="663" /> guarantees.  Of course, the Minister is in this cleft stick: what can he do to the Westport company?  If he goes to them and says, &ldquo;You must fulfil your guarantee,&rdquo; they will say, &ldquo;We will not; what are you going to do about it?&rdquo;  The Minister will then say, &ldquo;I am going to close your mill.&rdquo;  But he dare not close their mill.  They would eat him.  President de Valera depends for a large part of his support on West Mayo, and if the Minister dared close the mill in Westport there would be an outcry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to draw an analogy between Westport and Tullamore. I say that the reason the Minister cannot enforce the Tullamore guarantee is that if, when that factory is operating, he went to enforce his agreement, the only method he has for doing so is to close the factory or, as he says himself, take off the protection, which means closing the factory. He dare not do it and he will not dare to do it once the factory is established there.  The Minister may reply: &ldquo;I will dare.&rdquo;  I say: &ldquo;I dare you to do it in Westport now.&rdquo;  He admits that he got a similar guarantee in that case and that the guarantee has been reneged.  I sympathise with him, but it would be politically impossible for him to do it, and he will not do it. Those guarantees are not worth the paper they are written on because they are quite unenforceable.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the woollen trade in 1931 had a certain export trade.  A certain export trade!  Apart from agricultural produce, I think our exports of woollen goods was one of the largest industrial exports we had in 1931.</P>

      <P>I suppose one would include Guinness's in industrial exports and that, of course, is infinitely greater, but the woollen export was one of our best industrial exports, and it was an export that was growing. In 1931, there was a time of universal world depression, and even at that time of universal world depression, we were able to get our stuff in to the tune of 500,000 square yards. At that time of catastrophic depression, when world trade had dropped to about 36 per cent. of what it was before the depression, we were still sending that quantity out.  Now the world is booming up and at that moment we are going to paralyse and strangle this export business.  The moment when our adverse trade balance is shooting up to the sky is the moment we pick to harass and balk this export business which, until the economic war started, stood in need of no export bounty and no assistance at all from the Government. Is it not absolutely suicidal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat that I am not here as the champion of any individual woollen manufacturer.  They are able to look after themselves.  I am here fighting for the employment of craftsmen who have been in the woollen mills all their lives long.  Some of the finest craftsmen we have are men who work in the Irish woollen mills and I am fighting for an industry that stood on its own legs, made its own way and brought credit to the country.  I am fighting for a visible export of which this country stands at present in the most urgent need.  I say that these craftsmen will be unemployed when certain of the old mills have to go. Their craftsmen will go with them. I say that if this scheme is continued Pepper, Lee and Co. will eventually dominate the woollen textile business of this country and I say that in order to suit Salts (Saltaire), we are going to strike a deadly blow at the Irish woollen textile industry from which it may never recover.  God knows why the Minister wants to do it.  Heaven alone knows how his Party can possibly follow him into the lobby to do it, because I suppose they will. I would, however, say this last word: <Col N="665" /> for heaven's sake, remember that you can run riot for a long time and trust to God that those who come after you will clean up the mess, but there are certain types of damage, and if you do them now, nobody will be able to repair them and no combination of people will be able to repair them. Do not destroy this old-established industry in the hope that something else will come out of the hat to take its place.  If you destroy this industry, there will be nothing comparable in value to take its place.  It is one of the few old-established native crafts of this country, and there are very few.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister most strongly to take whatever steps may be necessary to mend his hand in this matter and to restrict Salts (Saltaire), if necessary, to the manufacture of knitting yarns and compensate the knitting-yarn industries existing at present. No matter what you let Salts (Saltaire) do, they are going to do damage, but I think it would be easier, reasonably, to compensate Messrs. O'Mahony and Company who are the principal established knitting yarn manufacturers here, than to compensate the entire woollen textile industry.  I should be long sorry to see Salts (Saltaire) take the place of Messrs.  O'Mahony in Irish textile manufacture, but if I have to choose between two evils, I choose the lesser.  It would be possible to find the money requisite to compensate Messrs. O'Mahony for destroying their business.  This proposal is going to destroy somebody's business and I would sooner destroy the lesser than the greater.  Best of all, review the whole position, and tell Salts (Saltaire) that they cannot come, that the dominant interests of the country demand that the old sources of supply should still be available.  That is really what ought to be done.  It is not too late yet.  It should be done now.  If you go on with this plan you are going to bring chaos into the textile industry and, in the long run, some of the old mills will have to go.  When we come to identifying the old mills we will then find that they are gone, and that Pepper Lee are supplying all our needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who represents a <Col N="666" /> constituency which has within it over 41 per cent. of the total wool manufactured in the Free State, I should like to deal with some of Deputy Dillon's arguments.  The Deputy told us that the woollen manufacturers were flourishing before 1932.  While that may be so, the fact remains that they are employing three times as many hands in my constituency now as in 1932.  Messrs. O'Mahony of the Blarney Mills have three times as many employed now as in 1932, and other woollen manufacturers are in the same position.  It is now close on two years since I took up this question of imported yarn.  I took it up then on the application of the workers.  They pointed out to me that far more yarn was being imported than previously, and that instead of expanding the yarn trade side, as they were expanding their business generally, the manufacturers were depending altogether on imported yarn.  I attended three meetings of the woollen manufacturers of the county held in Cork and I pointed to these imports.  I said that someone would start to manufacture yarns here, and that I considered as they were the people definitely interested, it was their duty to do so.  I also stated that I wanted to see the industry started in my constituency, and that I was prepared to help on that account.  Some of them assured me that if there was a tariff on yarns they would expand that side of the business, that they would, as in the past, go back to the spinning of their own yarn.  Others took up the line that they could not afford to do so.  The result was that they did not start.  If they were not prepared to do so and continued to import yarn worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, which was manufactured by foreigners, while the work could be done here by Irish labour, and some of the unemployed, about which Deputy Dillon wept salt tears from time to time, given work, in my opinion we were doing a good day's work in taking this step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Salts (Saltaire) were not invited here until the present woollen manufacturers had had an opportunity of starting.  I vouch for that.  If they were not prepared to start it was their own look out.  We are endeavouring <Col N="667" /> by every means in our power to find employment for our people.  According to the Minister's statement there is employment for 700 people here in the yarn-spinning industry.  If there is employment for 700 people, and if in the past that employment went to foreigners, it is our duty to keep that employment at home.  It was my duty, if I could, to get the industry for my constituency.  I interviewed those in the business and asked them to do their part and, if they did not, that is their look out.  Deputy Dillon is not concerned about them.  He pretends to weep because some firm in Tullamore is going to produce yarns.  Deputy Dillon is weeping for the manufacturers that use the yarn.  But that is not his trouble.  His trouble is that people across the water are going to be deprived of the opportunity of sending yarn worth from £100,000 to £200,000 here.  That is the only thing that has troubled Deputy Dillon as long as I know him in this House.  Day after day and week after week the Deputy talks about the poor woollen manufacturers and about the poor people who have to get bread.  But that is not Deputy Dillon's trouble.  His trouble is that foreigners are being deprived of a market for yarn worth nearly £200,000, and for the 700 Englishmen who produce yarn for the Irish natives, as I heard them described by a gentleman belonging to Deputy Dillon's profession, at a recent housing enquiry.</P>
    <P>In regard to Pepper, Lee the story is different.  It is a story that I should like the Minister seriously to consider. I have read the whole story told by the woollen manufacturers since the case of Pepper, Lee was first considered by the Minister, and I say there was a distinct understanding that they were not going to go into the manufacture of cloths that were already being manufactured by woollen manufacturers here.  That was definite.  Therefore, if Pepper, Lee start to produce cloths that are at present manufactured here, or that were manufactured here in the past, they are committing a breach of the agreement and should be prevented from doing so.  I hold that Pepper, Lee came here on a distinct understanding that they would not produce cloths <Col N="668" /> that were being produced by existing woollen manufacturers.  They came on that understanding.  That is what I read into the statement of the Minister and the Department.  If that definite understanding is being departed from, I say that Pepper, Lee should be prevented from doing so. There is undoubtedly scope for Pepper Lee in the manufacture of these cloths here in view of the imports of cloth. These imports came in camouflaged as cloths not produced here and they were put into competition with Irish cloths.  I tell the Minister that it is impossible for the Customs officials, no matter how they watch imports, to prevent large quantities of such cloths being imported under licences or under quota, free of duty, to go into competition with cloths produced here.  For that reason I welcome Pepper, Lee coming here to produce cloths that were previously brought in in that way, but I decidedly object to Pepper, Lee coming in, after giving a definite undertaking that they would not produce cloths that are already being manufactured here, and then departing from that undertaking.  That is a very definite objection.  I say that the woollen manufacturers have a definite grievance if that is going to be allowed to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked a lot about yarn.  Deputy Dillon's concern in this is all a yarn.  Since I have known him as a member of this House his sole concern is not for the Irish manufacturer. I have never seen him show any concern for the Irish manufacturer, whether the miller or the woollen manufacturer.  The Deputy's one concern is that we are now going to produce here yarn that we have been importing from the foreigner, and that 700 Englishmen are going to be deprived of employment.  That is Deputy Dillon's trouble: that he will no longer be able to stand up here in the House and say that there are so many unemployed on the dole in Tullamore.  He is not very much troubled with the woollen manufacturers in this matter. He started off by telling us about the happy time that the woollen manufacturers were having and of the profits they were getting out of the tariffs. He then went on to object because the <Col N="669" /> woollen manufacturers will in future have to buy the yarn produced in this country or else go back to the position which they were in before, of making their own yarn.  I know that the majority of the woollen manufacturers in Cork are enterprising enough to go ahead and make all their own yarn.</P>
    <P>This matter of the setting up of a yarn-spinning industry is perhaps one on which some members of the House may not be fully informed, but, as I said before, more than two years have passed since I called at least three meetings of the woollen manufacturers in Cork and pointed out to them that this market was there: that those imports were coming in, that somebody would start, and that, in my opinion, it was up to them to make a start.  I further pointed out to them that if they did not take advantage of the position that existed it would be their own look out.  I for one would prefer to see them buying the yarn from Salts (Saltaire) in Tullamore than importing it from outside, as they are doing at present, and thereby help to keep 700 people in employment in Tullamore.  Deputy Dillon, of course, would be delighted to be able to point out to us that those 700 people had to go to England to look for employment. They will not now have to go to England to look for employment or to Kirkintilloch to pick potatoes.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister contented himself with saying that this matter could be discussed on the Committee Stage.  For the information of those members of the House who were not here at the time of the passing of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, I may say that at the present moment or at any time&mdash;even during a general election, as happened this year&mdash;the Executive Council can summon a meeting and impose duties, tariffs, or anything else that they like in connection with the importation of goods. This particular duty that we are now considering was imposed on the 11th June, and since that date a company has been floated.  The name of it is Salts (Saltaire).  I recollect seeing a copy of its prospectus, and, if my recollection is not at fault, while there <Col N="670" /> are a number of Irish directors on it, I do not think that one of them had any contact whatever with this particular line of business.  As well as I recollect, they were not in the woollen business at all.  With regard to the position of some industries in the constituency that has returned me, I know that there is grave apprehension amongst those who put their money into business before any duties were imposed in this country in order to help industry.  They are very much concerned with this particular tariff that we are dealing with because they were themselves considering and were, I believe, in contact with the Minister concerning the establishment of a factory to manufacture yarn.</P>
      <P>It would be well for members of the House, and particularly for those who were not in the last Dáil, to realise what the position is that we are presented with.  The Executive Council puts a tariff on certain yarn.  A number of people come together and decide to float a company.  I forget what the capital of this company is, but as well as I recollect it is something about £200,000.  Does the Minister disagree with that figure?</P>

      <P>The Executive Council meets in June and fixes this tariff. Parliament is summoned to discuss this on the 25th October and is presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Quite a number of the members of the Party opposite might, if it had not been for the circumstances that I have outlined, have asked for the postponement of this.  The speech that we have just listened to, when stripped of all its nonsense, was one in favour of the firm of Pepper Lee.  I may say that I had never heard of it until I heard Deputy Dillon refer to it, but Deputy Corry seems to be concerned about it.  My information, for what it is worth is, that Salts (Saltaire) have bought out or acquired the property or rights of Messrs.  Pepper Lee.  I do not know whether that is true or not.</P>

      <P>If they have control of it, it scarcely matters whom it belongs to.  Deputy Corry, however, raised a very nice point, and that is where we stand with regard to all these guarantees of one sort and another.  To tell members of this Dáil that if the price or other conditions that they have got are not strictly adhered to the tariff will be withdrawn, is a class of undertaking that I do not put any reliance on.  One may vary the conditions that have been imposed to the extent of 5, 10 or 15 per cent., but you would have to reach a very big point before the Minister would come in here and ask the Dáil to reduce the 33? per cent. tariff that has been imposed here by, let us say, half that or even more.</P>
      <P>This is very bad business in every sense of the word.  The Dáil is being jumped, and, while there might have been an excuse for it in the special circumstances in which the Imposition of Duties Bill was introduced, there is no excuse for it in this case.  The Minister certainly treated the House with supreme contempt when, on the Second Reading of the Bill, he said that any matters members wanted to raise could be raised on the Committee Stage.  We are presented with this measure and a Schedule.  I wonder if the new members of the House have got all these orders?  I think they are entitled to an explanation as to what this means.  In the normal course, before an Imposition of Duties Bill would come into operation the Minister for Finance, when introducing it, would be expected to give a most detailed explanation.  There would not have been any previous commitments on the part of the Government in connection with the factory to be established.  We are told that there is employment for 700 people in Tullamore. We always get a rosy picture. Assume that the number is 700; if this is going to endanger the employment of other people in Cork, Dublin, Athlone, or in any other part of the country, it is no great asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot ignore one thing, and that is that woollen manufacturers, I suppose, have at the present moment a tariff, and so have hosiery manufacturers&mdash;but <Col N="672" /> they have a tariff based upon the fact that they can import goods of the quality and price that they know and that, so far as the consumer is concerned, there is a certain possible increase in the price.  It is negligible in connection with some of the articles that are produced, but now this particular prospectus in question has on its face the fact that they have a 33? per cent. tariff.  You can draw your own conclusions from that.  To my mind, the most dangerous item in this proposition is whether or not those engaged in the manufacture either of hosiery or woollens are going to get the quality of goods to which they are accustomed, and it has been put to me that those returns, however explanatory they may be in certain respects, may go down on the particular description of certain yarns, and that it is quite possible that there is a complete mistake in connection with two different sorts of yarns that have been imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to deal with the method of putting on this tariff on the yarns.  I am more interested in the question of Pepper Lee and what they are doing to compete with other manufacturers in this country who&mdash; some of them&mdash;have been engaged in the industry for, perhaps, a hundred odd years.  The industry itself, certainly, has been in the hands of Irish people in this country for hundreds of years.  Under what terms Pepper Lee came in here and what were the conditions of the concession they got, I do not know, but it seems to me that they did get a concession and I am given to understand by the people in the trade that Pepper Lee are now about to compete with them in manufacturing the cloths we have been in the habit of getting from Irish manufacturers up to the present.</P>

      <P>I think it is not quite right for the Minister or for the Government to empower, or to give an opportunity to, a better equipped firm, such as Pepper Lee undoubtedly is bound to be, to compete with Irish manufacturers who have already supplied the trade and supplied it very well.  Certainly, these firms will have <Col N="673" /> a very hard time to make ends meet in that case.  I have been in communication with the Minister in this connection for quite some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;perhaps with not as much satisfaction as we would like to get; but the point I want to make is that the woollen manufacturers already established in the Free State, apart from Pepper Lee, are capable of supplying the total requirements of the particular class of cloth, whether worsted or woollens, that we have in our suits in this country, and that if that is so there is no reason whatever why Pepper Lee should be allowed to come in here, with their more efficient machinery, to compete with the trade here.  Then, there is also the question of employment.  I understand that, in the case of Pepper Lee, with their more efficient machinery, they can employ one girl to six looms, whereas in most Irish firms we have to employ one girl to one loom.  We know that the object of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is to provide employment. Well, if it is a case of one girl to six looms as against six girls to six looms, you are certainly not assisting employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any criticism of the Government in this matter at all.  They are animated by the best intentions and they want to do the best they can for the Irish people, but Pepper Lee have come in here and got a certain concession to make certain cloths.  As I have stated already, the trade in itself is quite sufficiently capable of supplying all the ordinary cloths we want, but we are not able to supply the ladies' tissues or light cloths for ladies' dresses.  Now, there are three or four million yards of that material required in the year.  The ordinary manufacturers who have been catering for men's wear have no objection at all to the Pepper Lee people being allowed to do all they can in that line of light cloths for ladies' dresses, and I would appeal to the Minister, in view of the fact that Pepper Lee have got some sort of concession, to try to induce <Col N="674" /> Pepper Lee to stick to the production of ladies' tissues or cloths and to leave the rest to the ordinary manufacturers who have been manufacturing woollens already.  At present I understand that the latter are only employed to the extent of 60 per cent., and that it is likely to be less.  They will certainly be employed to a much lesser extent if Pepper Lee are allowed to compete with them.  In fact, there is no doubt that several of them will go to the wall. I do not think that that is a state of affairs that the Minister or anybody else can view with equanimity.  I would appeal strongly, therefore, to the Minister to ask Pepper Lee to confine themselves to ladies' tissues for which there is a market which cannot be supplied here.  If the Minister will do that, the woollen manufacturers will be satisfied, and so shall I.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister a question in regard to the yarns.  I would not intervene except for the speech made by Deputy Corry, but I think that Deputy Corry is under a misconception in that respect.  The Minister must be aware that most of the yarns that entered into your Irish tweeds and so on were imported from Belgium and France.  That was a very unhappy state of affairs, and, like Deputy Corry, I also endeavoured to induce many of the mills to spin their own yarns, but I was informed that there were a lot of difficulties in the way.  I do not want to take up too much time on this matter, but I should like to ask the Minister whether or not it is a fact that a certain well-established firm operating in Cork City &mdash;a firm that is very well known in this country and outside it&mdash;offered to undertake the manufacture of yarns in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in his speech, was rather skilful in dealing with this matter, and said that I had treated the Dáil with contempt when this Bill was before the House on Second Reading when I said that I regarded the Second Stage as a mere formality and suggested that these matters should be raised on the Committee Stage.  I adhere to that.  I think that it is much better that the various items covered by the Schedule of this Bill should be discussed in Committee separately, and, in saying that, there was no desire on my part to treat the Dáil with contempt.  I think it is obvious that these matters would be much better discussed in Committee.  I do not say that it is a point in support of my contention that it gives Deputies the right to speak more than once.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Dillon has spoken more than twice on this matter, and I should like to bet my bottom dollar that we will hear from him again, and again, and yet again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also said that the House was being jumped.  I am not sure what he meant by that, but he tried to imply that we were presenting the House with a <i>fait accompli</i> and that the House had no alternative but to accept it.  That is not the position. The Dáil in its wisdom decided to give the Government certain powers which the Government considered necessary for the implementation of their industrial policy, including power to impose duties by Order, subject to subsequent satification.  The Dáil is not bound to this or any other duty.  It is at complete liberty to reject the Bill or to adopt Deputy Dillon's amendment if it is prepared to take the consequences. <Col N="676" /> So far as the Dáil is concerned, there is no commitment, and any interested industry in this country will have no legitimate reason for seeking redress if the Dáil decides by a majority vote to reject the Government's proposal and repeal this duty. So much for what Deputy Cosgrave said.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about Pepper Lee and Company.  It is not quite relevant to this particular amendment of Deputy Dillon, but it is just as well to clear it up.  It is quite obvious that Deputy Dowdall has been misinformed by some people in this connection, and I am anxious particularly that he should have the facts right.  I have no expectation of being able to get Deputy Dillon to see the facts right.  Deputy Dowdall is a reasonable man, and when he sees a reasonable case he accepts it.  There is a market in this country for dress materials, light-weight cloths, used in ladies' dresses and for men's suitings. These cloths have not been made by existing woollen manufacturers except to a small extent.  There are various alternative courses open to us.  We can continue to import these cloths. That is a policy which does not appeal to me and, I am sure, does not appeal to woollen manufacturers.  We can do what, I think, some woollen manufacturers would like us to do, and that is to say to the general body of the public: &ldquo;You are not going to get the cloth you want; you are going to be compelled to use the cloth we are prepared to give.&rdquo;  I do not think that is a reasonable attitude, and I am not prepared to support it.  We can endeavour to get the cloths made here. We would much prefer to see these cloths made by the older established woollen manufacturing firms here.  We have been trying for five years to get them to extend their production on these lines.  How long should we wait before trying to interest new concerns in the possibility of the market for them?  Anyway, we got a proposition from Pepper Lee and Company. They are a British firm, but they proposed to associate themselves with a company to be formed here&mdash;a company which would comply in every way with the requirements of the law here, <Col N="677" /> and which would be entitled, and is entitled, to operate here without a licence in any industry.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Corry and Deputy Dowdall that various things should be done to prevent Pepper Lee and Company from doing something or another.  I have no power to prevent them from doing anything.  So far as the law is concerned, they are a Saorstát company and are entitled to enjoy all the advantages of any Saorstát company operating here.  It is quite true that that particular company were encouraged and facilitated to establish a factory at Portlaoighise on the understanding that they were going to concentrate on the production of these dress materials and light-weight cloths.  That is what they are doing. I do not know from what source the rumours that the company are going into other lines of production may have originated, but, so far as I know, there is no truth in them.  The firm have equipped themselves with a type of machinery only capable of being efficiently used for the production of these light-weight cloths, and they are proceeding with their intention of doing so.  They are working on a two-shift system, subject to certain conditions, which they have accepted, as to the hours of work and the employment of men as weavers in preference to women.  They have a number of women employed at present who were trained in Bradford, and the arrangement with the firm permits of the continued employment of these women, but subsequent recruitment of weavers will be from men only.  That is so far as Pepper Lee and Company are concerned. I am anxióus to get that point cleared up.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, it will be necessary to get a number of other new firms established in this industry if the full requirements of woollen and worsted cloths of all kinds are going to be produced here.  I would much prefer to see the existing woollen manufacturers getting ahead and doing it.  I have pleaded with them and begged and bullied them.  I have offered them all forms of inducement, including the inducement of guaranteed loans, to get them to do it.  But only <Col N="678" /> some responded.  Deputy Dillon quoted me as saying that some old woollen mills will have to close down.  Not merely did I say nothing of the kind, but the whole tenor of my remarks was to try to emphasise that the opposite is the case.  Some woollen mills may close down, but none have to do it. Surely everything I said here when I spoke previously was directed to pointing out that there is available in this country a market for woollen cloths which is not being supplied and which mills should be encouraged in supplying. The Government is possessed of adequate powers&mdash;powers in respect of the imposition of tariffs, power under the Control of Imports Act&mdash;to limit the quantity of cloth brought in, and these powers will be used progressively as production in the Irish mills increases.  But we must ensure that there is an adequate supply of cloth for the clothing factories.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke contemptuously about these clothing factories.  He had no justification for that.  He referred to the factories engaged in women's clothing as of no importance.  They produced goods last year to the value of £320,000, and in the production of these goods they used a greater quantity of woollen cloth than the Irish woollen manufacturers ever exported. It is ridiculous to talk of that industry as being of no importance.  In the clothing trade there are more people employed than there ever will be employed in the woollen industry.  I am not trying to assess the relative importance of one industry as against another.  I must have regard to both. But I must ensure that these clothing factories are not compelled to close by lack of cloth.  I am going to ensure that.  Subject to that, I am prepared to give every possible advantage to the woollen manufacturers.  I do expect to get from woollen manufacturers a bigger effort to meet the requirements of that market.  Some of them have done it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corry talked about Cork.  There is a mill in Deputy Cosgrave's constituency, in Blarney, which has progressed astonishingly under the position created by Government policy.  I heard a <Col N="679" /> Labour Deputy laugh to-day when someone referred to the possibility of some areas where there was nobody unemployed.  It is true in respect of that area.  That mill not merely employs all the people in the immediate vicinity, but has to run a special bus service from Cork to get the workers it requires.  It may be that that mill had some particular advantage, but, personally, I think it had the advantage of enterprising management, and that that is why it has been able to make such very rapid and considerable progress when other mills apparently made no progress at all.  It may be that that is not the whole explanation. But I do say this: that it is not the obligation of the Government to see that every woollen mill in production here at any time continues in production. We are only bound to help those who help themselves.  It is our duty to see that a full production of woollen cloth necessary for our requirements is effected.  But we want to see that effected by efficiently-run concerns, efficiently equipped, and able to produce that cloth at the lowest economic price.  Any woollen manufacturers who are prepared to accept these terms will get the fullest co-operation the Government can give them.</P>
    <P>I am prepared at once to admit the possibility that, in our efforts to adjust the situation as between woollen manufacturers and clothing manufacturers, we may err at one period to the detriment of the woollen manufacturers, just as at other periods we previously erred to the detriment of the clothing manufacturers, because some of them were compelled to stop production, and we had hastily to make additional quota orders to enable them to import the cloth they required.  I am prepared to admit the possibility of error, but we have tried to avoid that error as best we could.  We got a representative committee from both industries, sitting in joint conference, and with them tried to hammer out a programme for the regulation of imports in such a way as would secure a supply for the requirements of the clothing trade and at the same time allow the progressive development of the woollen <Col N="680" /> industry.  I think we have succeeded in doing so, but it is not possible to let the situation stand, because it has got to be kept under constant review, so that from time to time imports may be regulated so as to permit of the maximum possible development in the woollen industry.</P>
    <P>At the same-time, I am forced to recognise the fact that there are a number of woollen mills in the country which are only in part-production at the present time.  I do not know what the adequate explanation of that is, because side by side with that obvious failure on the part of some mills to use their full productive capacity, we have the clothing mills clamouring for cloth. Possibly the clothing companies want a different class of cloth from that which these mills are capable of producing, but, whatever the explanation, it is for the parties concerned through their representative organisations to try and hammer out a solution, and I assure them that any solution upon which they agree will be gladly accepted by me.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I desire to refer.  Deputy Dillon referred to guarantees being of no value.  These guarantees relate to the price to be charged by some company which is given the benefit of a protective duty.  I disagree with that entirely.  I will admit that there have been cases in my experience where it was necessary to draw the attention of companies to the guarantees they had given and to take various measures in order to make these guarantees effective, but, on the whole, it has been our experience that these guarantees have been not merely effective but that very many firms have done much better in that respect than they undertook to do.  That is true of the Westport Company.  I do not want to enter in detail into the price of thread, but I say that, in respect of the great bulk of the thread produced at Westport, they have done better than they undertook to do, that is, to charge a price ex-factory at Westport which would be equal to the price ex-factory at Leicester.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find out that pulling my leg is a difficult operation.  This duty, however, relates to worsted and wollen yarns and the other matters which have been introduced were somewhat extraneous to it.  It is utterly ridiculous to suggest that we are in any way jeopardising the future of the woollen trade or the future of our export trade in wollens by getting yarns produced here.  I think it is true to say that the reputation of Irish woollen cloth abroad was built up when we were producing all our own yarns.  There is probably no woollen mill in the country which is not at present producing woollen yarns or worsted yarns to some extent, but we are importing a great deal of manufactured yarn.  They were imported last year to the value of some £600,000. We want to get these yarns made here. The production of them is going to give employment to several hundred people at Tullamore.  That is worth attempting, particularly when we can get them manufactured under these conditions, that subject to labour costs being the same here as in Great Britain, the price will be the same and also that there will be complete equality of treatment as between one woollen mill and another.  It is upon these conditions that we agreed to impose the tariff.  It is upon these conditions that I ask the Dáil to pass this Bill, and I assure Deputies that if these conditions are not observed, then we shall give them an opportunity of reviewing their action.  I have not the slightest reason to believe that these conditions will not be observed.  The net result of this development will be the creation of a new enterprise which will be of considerable benefit to a part of the country where employment is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Anthony's question, there is nothing to prevent any <Col N="682" /> Irish company engaging in this industry.  There is, however, in that connection, a consideration which I ask the Dáil to bear in mind.  This company, which has now built the factory at Tullamore, put their proposition to my Department, and I told them that apart from these other conditions as regards price, quality and supply, I wanted an understanding as to where they were going to put their plant.  I have not the slightest doubt that if that company were left a free choice their factory would not be at Tullamore.  It would quite possibly be at Dublin.  As Deputies are aware, it is the policy of the Government to encourage industrial enterprise in rural towns in the country.  Ultimately, we succeeded in inducing this particular company to agree to establishing their plant at Tullamore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I shall be allowed to proceed without these <i>sotto voce</i> interruptions.  If, however, Deputies approve of that policy I want them to bear in mind that it involves certain consequences.  It is the policy of the Government to promote the decentralisation of industry.  If the people of the country do not want that policy, they can end it.  It is in their power to do so, but if they do want that policy, and I think they do, they have got to recognise that certain consequences follow from it.  One of the consequences is this: If we succeed in inducing a company to establish a new industry in some such town as Tullamore or Westport, or any other rural part of Ireland, then we must not at the same time encourage or give special facilities to another company, established to compete with it, subsequent to the establishment of the first company, and proposing to locate its factory at a more convenient centre for distribution such as Dublin or Cork.  We do not do that.  So far as this industry is concerned or any other industry in respect of which there is no Reserved Commodity Order in operation&mdash;so far as I can remember there is only one that applies to&mdash;any <Col N="683" /> Saorstát company can engage in it. I am sure that that is altogether desirable. We may at some future time have to reconsider the question of whether it may not be necessary to introduce new legislation in that regard but at the moment any Saorstát company can engage in any industry they wish.  What, however, I say is this: Where an industry has been established in some rural area as a result of conforming to Government policy or where existing industries in any trade are capable between them of supplying all the requirements of this country, I am not going to encourage the giving of any special facilities to a new concern to come into these industries, but at the same time I am not going to put any impediment in their way so long as the law remains as it is at present.  That applies in respect of this woollen and worsted yarn industry as it applies to any other.  Any Saorstát firm can get into it, but they cannot expect and will not get from me either encouragement or special facilities to do so.  There is only one thing further that it is necessary to say: We were told that as a result of the blind and stupid mismanagement of the Government&mdash;I think that was the phrase&mdash;we had destroyed the export industry of the Saorstát woollen mills.  I have got here the figures for 1936, and I see that we exported in that year 427,870 square yards of worsted and woollen tissues.  That is a fairly considerable export from an industry destroyed by Government mismanagement.</P>

      <P>But the Minister did not go on to give the figures for 1929.  As a matter of fact, nobody made the allegation to which the Minister referred. The Minister now announces that there was an export of 400 odd thousands of square yards of woollen and worsted tissues.  He did not go on to tell us that in 1929 we exported 1,000,000 square yards.  Does the Minister deny that?</P>

      <P>But here are the facts. In 1929 we exported 997,576 square yards of woollen tissues, and that is the export to which the Minister referred a few moments ago as being trivial.  In fact he said, if my memory serves me aright, that just prior to the entry of his Government our total export of woollen tissues was 500,000 square yards.  World depression, I admit, had hit that industry as well as every other industry, but in the last year before the depression we exported 1,000,000 square yards of woollen tissues.  We now export 400 odd thousand square yards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wants to leave the question of exports?  That is all right.  I am not surprised that he wants to leave them.  He has halved them.  I have no doubt that he will further halve them in the course of a few years.  I now want to refer briefly&mdash;it is scarcely worth referring to, but I mention it for the purpose of the record&mdash;to Deputy Corry's statement that the employment in the woollen mills of Ireland had been increased threefold since Fianna Fáil came into office.  That kind of insane observation gets currency unless it is immediately contradicted, so I refer the Deputy to the employment figures on page 173 of the September, 1937, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i> He will find there that the total number of persons employed in the woollen and worsted industry in 1936 was 3,157.  If the Deputy is prepared to maintain that only 1,000 were employed in 1931, he is a braver man than I take him to be.</P>

      <P>The Chair may have misunderstood me.  I said that the President came before the House and said: &ldquo;I want powers to impose emergency tariffs to meet any assault made on this country by the British Government putting on tariffs.&rdquo;  I say that that Act has since been used, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce says is now being used, to implement the Government's economic policy.  I say that the Act was never intended for that purpose, and I say that the President of the Executive Council asked for the powers in order to arm him against an economic assault by the British Government. Those are the historical facts.  If I may not draw the conclusions that those facts manifestly represent, I bow to your ruling.  I content myself with stating the facts, and letting those who read interpret them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that there was no commitment in connection with the imposition of those tariffs.  It is all very well to say that. Here is a public issue of capital by Salts (Saltaire) Ltd., to which large sums of money have gone.  Contracts have been entered into&mdash;contracts set out in the terms of the prospectus of the parent English company&mdash;which cannot be broken.  Large sums of money have already been spent&mdash;largely Irish capital.  It is all very well to say there are no commitments.  There are as many commitments as a Government can enter into, and if this duty were to be rejected now, all the money spent under the prospectus would be lost. The Minister engaged in protracted negotiations and clamped that down on us.  We are going to be faced with the same thing in regard to the Athlone textile business.  There is a huge structure being put up there, and the tariffs and duties will be introduced, and probably quotas, which this House will be asked to adopt afterwards in order to keep that establishment in existence.  Very heavy commitments have been entered into by the Government, and these would have to be repudiated, and I think the promoters would have to be compensated if this House determined to reject this tariff <Col N="688" /> because, after all, we cannot expect everyone to realise what we know, that our Minister for Industry and Commerce is an irresponsible person.  We have got to act on the assumption that he is a responsible person who will honour his word.  Rotten as I think a great deal of his policy is, so long as he remains Minister his word will be honoured and his bargains carried out. I know quite well that our views of these matters do not correspond with his, but we would certainly consider ourselves bound in honour to compensate or deliver the goods under any contract entered into by Deputy Lemass acting as Minister for Industry and Commerce of Saorstát Eireann. That disposes of the commitments question.</P>
      <P>Now, let me come to the question of ladies' dress cloths.  I warn the Minister and the Government, and anybody who knows anything of the textile or the ready-made clothing trade will tell them the same thing, that you cannot produce ladies' dress cloths in this country for the reason that you have not the market to consume the variety of goods necessary in order adequately to supply the demand. Women's clothes, of their very nature, must have very different weaves, colours, patterns and fabrics and you cannot produce them in this country. I suppose at the present moment a competent dress manufacturer would be using from 50 to 100 different qualities and patterns of cloth.  What individual factory operating here can produce that variety?  And remember, each of those patterns and each of those qualities has to be dyed in from six to twelve different colours.  What individual factory here can carry that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it seriously proposed to set up two or three factories to manufacture ladies' dress materials?  The thing is grotesque, and what is going to happen is that we are going to have Pepper Lee making a very limited range of cloths, and if you do not like these you will have to pay a prohibitive tariff on the others you bring in, a tariff that will bring the Exchequer a considerable revenue, and then Pepper Lee will demand a quota, which they will get, and we will be further restricted <Col N="689" /> in the variety of cloths we have to offer the public, which ultimately reduces the standard of living, raises the cost of clothes for the people, and creates an entirely unsatisfactory situation, without giving any proportionate return in the way of employment or an increase of national wealth.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the Minister says he has no power to stop a firm like Pepper Lee; under the law they can come in if they want to and do as they please.  Was that his view in reference to Marsh's when Marsh's were going to set up a biscuit factory in Clones?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having sought to defend his character in regard to Pepper Lee by saying that he could not stop them even if he wanted to, the Minister then sought to mollify Deputy Dowdall, who let two or three tom-cats out of the bag, and he was terrified that the Deputy would let another tom-cat out.  He tried to mollify Deputy Dowdall, and he told the House that, even if he wanted to, he could not prevent Pepper Lee; he had not the power to do so under the law.  Whether he has the power or not, all I know is that when another factory wanted to come in here and start making biscuits&mdash; and they were in exactly the same situation as Pepper Lee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We will prevent non-nationals coming in; we will give you no concessions in the way of importing machinery; we will give you no guarantee with regard to distributing your goods in the country, and, generally, we will give you such a hot time that you will be very sorry you ever came in.&rdquo;  They do not tell factories that under the law they do not propose <Col N="690" /> to let them in, but they fix them in such a position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is too old a dog on the road to let the Minister know too much.  There are ways and means of giving people backhand slaps afterwards that can be used, and I do not propose to afford the Minister opportunities for so doing.  The Minister knows well that if Pepper Lee were not encouraged and welcomed and assured of every facility by his Department, they could not set up here.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the Minister invited them, brought them in here, and established them here, and they would not be here if he did not send for them.  The Minister informed the House that he was against this firm coming here, that it was only after long negotiations that he dissuaded this firm of Salts (Saltaire) setting up in Dublin and it was only after a desperate struggle that he got them down to Tullamore.</P>

That name, honourably and favourably known in Irish commercial circles, is not unassociated with Tullamore. One can picture the two Tullamore men standing on the outskirts of the town shouting, &ldquo;Not here, Mr. Minister; anywhere in Ireland but Tullamore,&rdquo; and the Minister battling his way into Tullamore to put up the factory there, for lofty social reasons.  Does the Minister expect anyone to stomach that?</P>

      <P>These distinguished gentlemen were not consulted and had no word in the matter: that is what we are supposed to believe.  I do not blame them for getting a factory for their own home town.  If they did not have a share of the plunder, sómebody else would.  It was better, perhaps, that a Tullamore man should have it than some fly-by-night from CzechoSlovakia who would collar all the boodle and then hook it out of the country.  At least Williams and Egan would be here all the time.  They are welcome to get their share of whatever is going.  They are as good Irish business men as there are in the country.  But let not the Minister pretend that he had to battle his way into Tullamore in order to confer this favour on that town because his heart was full of sorrow for the unemployed there.  He was brought in there through the influence of Messrs. Williams and Egan&mdash;and more power to their elbow.  I think this is one of the most iniquitous departures on the part of the Minister.  I do not say that he is doing it <i>mala fide,</i> because he is an incompetent person; the sad part of it is that we have to suffer for his incompetency.  I say that a good many business men will suffer by reason of the Minister's action, and the State will suffer in so far as the adverse trade balance, already at an alarming figure, will be largely increased.</P>

The Minister said he did not know where I got my information. Well, I can tell him that Pepper Lee sent over samples of cloths from Bradford, and these samples they hawked about Cork looking for business, and <Col N="692" /> they sold to one house 25 pieces.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I definitely support the Minister in his attitude towards the Tullamore spinning factory.  It is about time that the weaving establishments in this country were supplied with yarns made in this country.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon has done any good service to the woollen industry by attacking the Tullamore woollen spinning industry.  Let us suppose that we had an outbreak of war to-morrow, or in the near future. Everybody who remembers the world war will recall the high price we had to pay for cloth as a result of thread imported.  That will give us an idea of what the position would be in the event of another war starting.  In other words, with the Tullamore spinning plant working, we would have the raw material for this industry and would not depend on outside sources for our supplies of yarns for dress materials and other woollen goods.  It would then be possible to get cloth at reasonable instead of impossible prices as was the case in the great war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I desire to draw the attention of the Minister, and that is that the wholesale clothing firms have a stranglehold on the woollen industry at the present time.  They control the Irish market. If they refuse to buy the products of <Col N="693" /> Irish mills, that would mean that over 50 per cent. of the production of these mills would remain unsold.  Let us remember that for every one yard of woollen and worsted cloth made in this country we import two yards.  The woollen industry is one of the oldest in this country.  It comes next in importance to the flour industry.  It is one that should be fostered, because it is basic.</P>
    <P>A circular was sent out recently from the Department of Industry.  At the back of that circular was the idea that we should concentrate more on industries the raw materials of which we have ourselves.  The woollen industry is one where the raw materials are at its door; in no other industry is the raw material so easily available as it is in the case of the woollen industry.  I do not wish to discuss this matter elaborately or at any great length, because I was not aware that it was coming on just now, and I am quite unprepared to go into it in detail. There is, however, one suggestion I have to make.  At the present time in the Department of Industry and Commerce there is not a solitary official who knows anything about textiles. In that Department there is no one who has any special training in the textile industry.  Now, across in England, if any legislation is to be introduced in connection with the textiles in Lancashire or elsewhere, the people interested in the industry there are the first to be consulted. The British Government consult, not only these, but the people at the head of the textile colleges, of which there are 35 in England; also the professors attached to the textile departments in the different universities, such as Leeds and Manchester.  Here we have not even a textile college nor a textile chair in any of our universities.  In fact, the whole side of the textile education has been sadly neglected. When the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce wish to get into touch with textile matters they have nobody to fall back upon.  I suggest that when any legislation is proposed to be introduced here, especially legislation dealing with the woollen, cotton or linen industry, that the woollen and cotton manufacturers <Col N="694" /> and the few linen manufacturers we have should be consulted.  I do not think it is right, without any consultation with the people in these industries, that an official should prepare or introduce legislation on a subject about which he knows nothing and involving a sum of £600,000, which figure represents the value of textiles imported into the Irish Free State annually.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the discussion this evening has turned on the old versus the new.  To my mind, since the present Government came into power there is one thing, at all events, on which they have been consistent, and that is their view that one new industry is worth half a dozen old ones.  I am connected with an old-established industry.  My own firm will be celebrating its half-century next year, and practically every commodity we use is restricted by the Government in some way or another. This particular duty which we are discussing now affects us only in a small way, but it does affect us.  We have not been able to secure a licence for the material that we require, even though that material is not manufactured in this country.  Yet so far the Minister has not granted us a licence. I am still presuming that Reference No. 5 of the Schedule to this Bill is meant seriously.  Here, though, as I have said, we have been established for nearly 50 years, we receive practically no consideration at all from the Department of Industry and Commerce in any of our requirements, whereas, as Deputy Dillon has said, people can come from all over the Continent of Europe and secure from the Minister every facility they require to set up a factory.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to remove from the section the Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order which places a duty on certain dolls.  I have put down that amendment in order to give publicity to the complaint of a merchant dealing in these commodities.</P>
      <P>I think the House should know that this complaint is not being sprung upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for a copy of the letter making the complaint was sent to his Department some days ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it has.  They complain that a duty of 50 per cent. has been put on dolls over the value of 9d. and that this duty has been put on nominally to protect the business of the Irish doll factory in Tralee. This firm, whose letter I hold in my hand, say they can produce German samples against the sample submitted by the Tralee factory showing the price of each article, and that even with the 50 per cent. duty added, the Tralee article cannot compare for value with the German imported article.  That is a matter of opinion. It is, of course, the common experience of many people similarly circumstanced that an Irish article though comparable from the point of view of price where there is an immense tariff, is frequently not comparable from the point of view of value; but this complaint goes further.  It says that the dolls offered by the Tralee factory are identical with the dolls imported from Germany before this prohibitive duty was put on, and the identity is so close that this firm ventures to allege to the Department of Industry and Commerce that the dolls which it is pretended are being made in Tralee are in fact being imported in bits from Germany, sewn together in Tralee, labelled &ldquo;Irish manufacture,&rdquo; and packed in cardboard boxes of continental manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doll which is assembled in Tralee from imported parts is offered to the consuming public at 57/- per dozen.  The same doll assembled in Germany is offered to the consuming public at 18/6 per dozen.  Really, for the industry of sewing legs on dolls, 40/- a dozen is rather an excessive subsidy.  Surely the amount of remunerative employment that could be provided for unemployed persons sewing limbs on to dolls cannot justify a tariff of that size.  This merchant says that all the other dolls produced by the firm in Tralee are increased in price in the proportion of the comparison I have just given.  The 18/6 doll is increased in price 200 per cent. by the Tralee factory, and this merchant says that every other doll produced <Col N="698" /> in Tralee is increased by approximately a similar percentage.</P>
    <P>I must say that when I read this complaint &mdash; and it is very explicit &mdash; I cannot see why the merchant does not import the dolls from Germany and pay the 60 per cent. duty on 18/6, if his complaint is true, and that leads me to suspect the validity of the suggestion that the 18/6 article is identical with the 57/- article.  Nevertheless, I must say that from my knowledge of the firm that makes this allegation &mdash; and I think the Minister will confirm me in this &mdash; they are reliable people and not people who make reckless charges.  They are people, I think, who have the greatest possible admiration for the Minister's industrial policy.  They have written to him complimentary letters, have subscribed to his Party funds and were induced to make this specific complaint because the Minister for Finance wrote asking them for a subscription to his Party funds, and they said: &ldquo;We have kept you afloat for a long time and we have reached the limit of our patience &mdash; not a farthing more will we give you because you have played havoc with us and with the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next complaint these people make is that when they required supplies of a certain type of doll, they wrote to Irish Dolls (Utilities), Limited, the Tralee firm, and were informed that none of these dolls could be supplied until next year. Whereas the only time they sell these dolls is Christmas time, there was no use in getting supplies in February which could only be sold in December. This gentleman points out that once he got this notice from Tralee, he was obliged to order a consignment of dolls from the Continent, and is now informed that there is no provision in this Order for admitting the dolls duty free and he wants to know why should not such a provision be put in. I think that a reasonable representation. Possibly he is mistaken in that. The doll order does contain a licensing provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does not the Minister <Col N="699" /> put in a licensing provision?  That is the burden of his complaint.  He sent it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to Seán MacEntee, Esquire, at Fianna Fáil headquarters, 13 Upper Mount Street, Dublin, for fear there would be any mistake about it.  However, I must add this to his complaint that he is making a great mistake if he thinks he is the only person who has to pay duty on goods he is importing because they cannot be got in this country, because every woman, as I have often said, who buys herself a flannelette nightshirt has to do the same thing.  There are four qualities of flannelette manufactured by the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose they could be, but the fact is that this is merely one item where the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act is used, not for the purpose of protecting an existing industry, but for the purpose of raising revenue.  The truth of it is that the Exchequer balance is running a little low; there are certain projects in view, and when the Minister consults Finance about them, Finance says: &ldquo;If you could knock a few thousand out of this proposition for us before domestic supplies become available, slap on a tariff now.  We dare not raise direct taxation any further or introduce a supplementary Budget to replenish the Exchequer, but if you can give us a windfall by putting on emergency duties, we should be very glad if you would.&rdquo;  And so these duties go on and the merchant from whom I had this letter will have to pay duty on the doll, not because the Minister is protecting a domestic industry, but because the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, wants revenue and is prepared to knock a little revenue even out of a 6d. doll when he cannot get it anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I think it is a silly thing to do, because it gives rise to unnecessary irritation and annoyance to people trying to do business. I know that the Minister does not concern himself whether the commercial community is inconvenienced or not &mdash; but he ought.  The imposition of a duty on any article makes its delivery through the customs extremely difficult and tedious, quite apart from the extra cost involved.  This is a case in which two things should be done, (1) a licensing provision should be inserted and general notice given all merchants that until supplies of these goods are available in Saorstát Eireann they would be entitled to import free of duty as much of these articles as they imported the previous year and, (2) a careful inquiry should be made into the question whether the Tralee factory is importing from Poland parts of cheap German dolls and charging excessive prices for the service of sewing them together.  I can reconcile the details of this complaint with the probable facts, but I am satisfied from the character of the complainant that there is some foundation for complaint, and I think the Minister ought to investigate it before we pass this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to intervene to explain the circumstances that have arisen in relation to this particular industry.  It was established at Tralee by a local group acting in conjunction with a local technical vocational committee.  The capital was supplied locally, and the enterprise was got going with a fairly considerable amount of enthusiasm.  On the face of it it was the type of industry that one would like to encourage, and I gave them any facilities within my power, and any encouragement they required to go ahead.  They commenced operations on the production of a class of toys and extended to dolls.  I am sorry to say that up to date they have not made good.  I think there is some ground for the complaint of the trader, <Col N="701" /> although some particular allegations he made in that particular letter were found on investigation to be without foundation.  I have a certain hesitation in speaking about the matter, because I have, in fact, thought it necessary to notify this particular firm that unless there is an immediate improvement in the quality and volume of their productions, the question of withdrawing the protection afforded them will have to be considered.  I do not think the matter is particularly urgent, even though Deputy Dillon has adverted to the close proximity of Christmas.  All the traders were stocked for the Xmas trade before the duty was imposed, and very few of these articles have been imported since.  In fact, not many orders have been given to the Tralee factory.  The explanation, I think, will be obvious, that this season's stocks are in.  It is of next season's we are thinking.  I do not think they are going to make good.  If they do not, the situation will have to be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other possibilities, and, in particular, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that Gaeltacht Industries are establishing a factory at Belmullet for the manufacture of dolls and soft toys generally.  They have trained a number of girls who are now competent to commence production. They intend to do so in the course of a few weeks.  The existence of the Belmullet factory is dependent on this duty.  The quality of the goods produced is good, and samples that were produced there, when shown to traders, passed as being excellent.  But there is much more to be done for the development of the industry of manufacturing dolls and toys generally.  The Tralee concern may get over their difficulty and make good.  They have been a long time trying, but seem to have difficulty. I am anxious to keep the duty on for the present, first, because its removal would effect very little purpose, except, perhaps, to embarrass some traders.  If we were going to remove the duty, I think we would have to give notice and endeavour to do so in such a manner that one trader would not have an undue advantage over another.  It may be necessary to do as we did when other duties were removed in some cases by providing for repayment of any duty <Col N="702" /> charged on stocks not disposed of.  I do not think this will affect the situation this year.  We can review the situation at the slack season, and if there is no immediate prospect of adequate production at reasonable prices, in time for next season, the duty will have to come off, or be modified in some form, to prevent duty being charged on goods that cannot be had within the country.  I admit that there is an immediate difficulty in relation to the industry.  I explained what it is.  I think we should keep the duty in force for the time being, and I assure the House that unless there is an improvement, there will be another Order in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to Reference No. 6, dealing with coloured tiles.  These tiles are used for curbs, slab panels and tile surrounds in building operations.  The Government started by imposing a duty of 50 per cent. on imported slab panels.  Everybody agrees that that resulted in those requiring these articles making them up here.  Then a firm started to make some of the tiles on which a duty of 50 per cent. was imposed.  Those who make up these tiles here have to face a duty of 15/6 per ton on the luminous cement used in the manufacture of panels and surrounds.  That is a very considerable handicap.  I have no doubt the Minister will say: &ldquo;Yes, but we have a licensing provision in force, and those who should get licences to <Col N="703" /> import these tiles are getting them.&rdquo; I agree that that is the present situation. But these matters go through a progressive series, and at first, as at present, everything in this industry is quite easy.  The contracts that you have entered into you are allowed to finish up.  Wall tiles which are not covered by this provision are exempt, and you can get your ordinary requirements.</P>
      <P>These things, as I have said, go through a progressive series, and a little bit later, according to experience in other lines, manufacturers will come along to the Minister's Department and say: &ldquo;Well, we are now making a range of 20 colours and we do not think there ought to be any more licences issued for the importation of these goods.&rdquo;  Now, reviewing that, what is the position?  These slab panels are in competition with the metal chimneypieces that are either manufactured here in the cheaper grades or brought in in others.  I think the Minister should not handicap an industry which has been made up on the spot, and that certainly has a greater future before it than the ordinary metal chimneypiece which is at present being manufactured. What is the future for these tile manufacturers, and of the people who make up these panels? There are about 20 different colours issued.  There are none of the cheap high-glazed quality tiles going to be manufactured any more, and a duller glaze will have to be substituted at a greatly increased price.  The position will be that a person who before had a selection of tiles from probably 20 different manufacturers on the other side, and all making 50 different and more colours, will be brought down to a range of the 20 colours manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said with regard to the clause for the ready-made clothing.  He said that he was not going to compel the people here to take what they did not want.  I wish he could see his way to make that pronouncement to the average consumer in this country with regard to a whole lot of things that are at present being manufactured here, because there is no doubt that a very serious situation is arising.  The average manufacturer <Col N="704" /> here, when he starts, has to look at the whole range of goods which had been previously imported.  The manufacturer has yet to be born who can manufacture the range of goods which come into this country, on the present volume of trade, at anything like the prices at which they are imported. What does he do?  He very wisely, because he could not do anything else, cuts down the range of samples to possibly 10 per cent. or 5 per cent. of the samples or qualities or colours previously available.  There is a sort of tradition that any stuff which is really and genuinely required outside that range ought to be imported free, but it does not work out like that.  The manufacturer says: &ldquo;Well, now I am making something like that, and really consumers' requirements are most unreasonable.  They ought to be made take the stuff that I manufacture.&rdquo; What does the consumer do when he is faced with that?  He has the solution in his own hands, and I am sorry to say that he is adopting the solution which I suppose a lot of us do when faced with that position.  He has got either to pay an enormously increased price in consequence of the 100 per cent. duty on something that is brought in, or, if he belongs to the humbler class of the community, he finds that the cheap mass-produced article has been done away with altogether.  He is left, therefore, to pay a higher price for an article which is possibly not even as good, and which may be inferior.  That is reducing enormously the volume of business which is being done in this country.  We have cups that will not remain on the saucers and jugs that pour out of the lids concurrently with the spout.  That, of course, brings about a concurrent reduction in the quality of the table linen which is used, because if the tea is poured over a cloth every time there is a meal, then something will have to be got that will last longer than the linen tablecloth.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that there ought to be some method, or some standard, for arriving at what are the reasonable requirements of the consumers of this country, because I am sorry to say that in a great many instances they get little or no consideration. Their reasonable requirements ought to be catered for by the <Col N="705" /> Irish manufacturer.  In a number of cases he is catering for 33? per cent. or, at the outside, 50 per cent. of the people.  That means that there is another 50 per cent. left either to do without the goods they want or to bring them in and pay a duty of 100 per cent. on them.  The Minister must be perfectly well aware that that problem is not confined to the ready-made women's clothing.</P>

I hope the Minister will try to deal with the general aspect of that very real problem which arises in connection with practically all the Irish manufacturers who require either taste or colour or various other matters in which a great deal of discrimination has to be exercised, because I am very much afraid that the tendency of the Irish manufacturer is to cut the range of samples far below what is required by the country and then to scream at the mere idea of anything being allowed in outside his own line of manufacture.</P>

      <P>I recognise the importance of variety in relation to a number of articles, but I think we must <Col N="706" /> reconcile ourselves to the fact that if we set out to make goods for ourselves here, we cannot possibly have the same variety of these goods as we had when we had all the countries of the world to pick from.  That is one of the prices we have got to pay for industrialisation here, and I have frequently referred to that before.  I agree, however, that we should endeavour to secure the widest possible variety consistent with economic production here, and we have on various occasions taken up the question of an extension of variety with various firms&mdash;not always with beneficial results, but often with beneficial results.  The same thing applies in relation to these glazed tiles.  We will not have the same variety of designs and colours, shades and shadings, that we had in the past when we could select from the production of a very large number of manufacturers and a very large number of countries.  We will have to be satisfied with a much smaller number of designs and colours, but I think we will be able to manage with these, and I think there will be still available a sufficient variety of designs and colours to enable the average individual to exercise an amount of discrimination. Views will differ as to what constitutes a sufficient variety, but in any event we should try to get, in relation to these particular articles as in relation to any other articles, the maximum number of varieties of which efficient production will permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tiles are being produced in Cork by the Carrigaline Company. They are producing the type of tiles referred to, and in the course of a year or so they will commence the production of wall tiles.  At present, wall tiles and white tiles are being admitted under licence.  We could not exempt white tiles from the scope of the duty, because, apparently, it is not very easy to say what is white.  I mean to say that it is not easy to say where white stops and cream begins.  Consequently a general exclusion of white tiles from the scope of the duty might be used to secure a successful duty-free importation of white tiles which, in fact, were coloured.  Therefore, we made the duty generally applicable to that class of tile.  The tiles produced <Col N="707" /> in Cork have been shown to a number of people interested in these matters, and they have all spoken very highly of their quality, and the price for these tiles is similar to that charged by British manufacturers for the same class of tile.  The only point to be dealt with is Deputy Dockrell's point to the effect that in the future there will be a lesser variety.  That, however, is inevitable, and I do not think it is possible to avoid it.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to amend the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933-36, by providing for the exclusion of wheat, the flour derived from which is used in the manufacture of biscuits, in calculating, for the purposes of the said Acts, the quantity of wheat milled at mills licensed under the said Acts, and to amend Section 30 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost will be negligible. The Bill has two purposes: One is to grant certain facilities in the matter of milling quotas and the requirement to use Irish wheat by any miller who engages in the production <Col N="709" /> of flour used by biscuit manufacturers, and the only other purpose is to rectify an omission made in a previous Bill, namely, to give power to recover a debt due to the Minister for over-milling.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When a miller over-mills &mdash; that is, when he mills more wheat than his permit allows of &mdash; he becomes indebted to the Minister for certain amounts which are set out in the Bill.  As I explained on the Committee Stage, the Act of 1933 provided that where a debt became due to the Minister because of over-milling, the Minister could recover the amount due as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.  That particular section was deleted and amended in the Act of 1934, but through an oversight that provision was omitted, and we are taking advantage of this Bill to rectify the omission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To facilitate the manufacture of biscuit flour.  Biscuit flour is flour made from a very special type of wheat.  It is the view of the biscuit manufacturers here that it cannot be made successfully from Irish wheat. Up to the present we have been satisfied to allow the flour required for biscuit manufacture to be imported.  In fact, the only flour imported at present is flour for biscuit manufacturers. We have, however, discussed the matter with biscuit manufacturers and millers on a number of occasions, and, as a result of these discussions, we are now providing in this Bill that if any miller brings in the special wheat from which the flour must be made and mills it here, that wheat will not count against him, either in respect of his total quota or his obligation to use Irish wheat.  That is the sum total of the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The biscuit manufacturers are accustomed to getting cortain flour for manufacturing biscuits. It is a highly specialised business, and I suppose the Minister heard of that. Unless the quality of the flour is exactly what they have been accustomed to getting, there is danger that the quality of the biscuits may not be the same.  There is a big export business done in biscuits.  While we can insist on our own people consuming biscuits of the quality manufactured from whatever class of flour we please, in world competition it is a different business.  I suppose the Minister has heard that very slight variations affect the quality and the purchase of these biscuits?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for payments in respect of destruction of or injuries to property (No. 15 of 1923; No. 19 of 1926; No. 35 of 1933; No. 18 of 1937, Section 17; and otherwise).</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for a token sum of £10 is rendered necessary on account of Section 17 of the Finance Act of this year, which empowers the Minister for Finance, when he thinks proper, to pay in money, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, any compensation, or other sum, which he is required, or authorised by the Compensation (Damage to Property) Acts, to pay by the issue of securities.  The object of the section is to enable compensation awards to be discharged in cash, instead of partly in cash and partly in stock, as has hitherto been the case. The original Vote for property losses compensation for the current year would not cover the payment in cash which previously fell to be made in stock, and, therefore, this supplementary token Estimate is necessary It is not anticipated that the total payments which will fall in the course of the present year will exceed £1,550, and as against that there are anticipated savings on other sub-heads of £1,490, which reduces the amount required to a net sum of £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say in respect of this if it has reference to particular payments or portion of certain awards; that is to say, has somebody been awarded £1,200, in respect of which the Minister will issue stock for £1,000 and cash for £200, or is it a series of persons getting in all £1,500 in cash, who otherwise would have got stock?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of it, naturally, is to wipe out these two compensation stocks.  The amount of the original 5 per cent. compensation stock which might fall to be issued would be about £3,500.  It is not thought advisable to continue to issue stock when such a small amount remains to be issued.  In regard to the 1933 stock, it only carries interest at 3½ per cent.  Of the total amount that has been issued from time to time &mdash; about £40,000 &mdash; 50 per cent. or more has been redeemed, and it is anticipated that, by the exercise of the powers which are given to us under the Finance Act, 1937, all that will be redeemed in the course of this year or next.  We wish, in fact, to wipe out the whole of the compensation stock altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am anxious to get from the Minister is whether or not, in respect of an Act of Parliament that we passed in which we stated that compensation would be paid in stock at a certain price, there is any disadvantage to a person who is entitled to get compensation under that Act in respect of the cash payment; because, however desirable it may be to wipe out stock, if we give a certain right under an Act of Parliament it does not seem fair now to alter it.  If, on the other hand, one partically equals the other, it is all right.  Under the 1923 Act, the compensation stock, if I am not mistaken, was a 5 per cent. stock.  If, under the Act of 1923, a case was only being settled now, the person might be entitled to some extra compensation by reason of the lapse of time.  The Vote says: &ldquo;damage to or loss of property, between 24th April, 1916, and 12th May, 1923, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts, 1923 to 1933.&rdquo;  If a person were entitled under the 1923 Act to 5 per cent. compensation stock it ought not to be changed now.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten the House on the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that point is relevant.  The House has already decided in the Finance Act, 1937, to empower the Minister to do <Col N="713" /> this.  This is only asking the House to make the necessary financial provision to enable the Minister to exercise the powers which the House has already conferred upon him.  I do not want to enter into the merits of any particular case, but there are cases where special provisions were made to prevent the forfeiture of the compensation granted by reason of the fact that the person to whom the compensation was granted did not take any steps whatever to fulfil the conditions of the original compensation award.</P>
      <P>I do not think any person in that category could possibly feel any grievance, if the Minister were to exercise the power which the House has already, by Section 17 of the Finance Act, conferred upon him and which the House, in conferring it, intended the Minister to exercise.</P>

We are asked to vote this sum of money and the House is perfectly entitled to know whether or not the case made for it is one which corresponds to some previous decision taken by another Dáil.  Surely the Minister is not going to make the case that if he were empowered under an Act of the last Dáil to do a certain thing, conditional on his getting money from this Dáil, that this Dáil is bound to give it to him?

    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is clear from the face of it this Supplementary Estimate makes provision for a special grant to the National Theatre Society Limited, to defray portion of the cost of certain structural alterations to the Abbey Theatre.  I met a deputation of the directors of that society in January last who informed me that the Dublin Corporation had served them with notice to carry out such structural alterations in the Abbey Theatre as were necessary to comply with the by-laws relating to public safety.  They asked for a Government grant to meet the cost, which they estimated at £3,500, the deputation pointing out that if the theatre were called upon to bear the expenditure of this amount, its continuance would be imperilled.  I had to agree that that was likely in view of the fact that there had been losses on the working of the Abbey Theatre for many years.  For instance they lost £1,206 in 1932-33, £1,531 in 1933-34, £2,523 in 1934-35, £3,020 in 1935-36 and £17 in 1936-37.  I felt that in view of the high standing of the theatre, the valuable work which it has done for Irish drama, and the place which it occupies in our cultural life, it was but right to approach the Dáil for authority to make a special grant of 80 per cent. of the cost of the alterations subject to a maximum payment to the society of £2,800.  The society will be required to furnish a copy of the specification, together with a copy of the accepted <Col N="715" /> tender.  The payment of the special grant will be made on production of the receipt of the contractor who carries out the work, or, if desired, in instalments as the work proceeds.  The special grant of £1,000, provided for in the original Estimate, will be paid as usual.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Commissioner of Valuation (Substitute) Bill, 1937&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to remedy a defect in the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) (Amendment) Act, 1860, which, although it provided power to appoint a commissioner of valuation, did so in such restricted form that an appointment could be made only on the death, resignation or removal of the existing commissioner of valuation.  The present commissioner of valuation having become seriously ill early this year, an immediate difficulty arose as to how the statutory duties imposed on the commissioner were to be fulfilled within the statutory times.  Normally, the next senior officer would have <Col N="717" /> taken on the duties of the commissioner, but he would have had no statutory authority for discharging the statutory functions required to be performed by the Commissioner.  His actions, therefore, although they might in every other respect fulfil all the requirements, would be technically illegal.  The legal advice which I received on the problem was to the effect that any appointment of a substitute would not be in strict accordance with the statutory provision, and it was recommended that legislation should be introduced at the very earliest opportunity to legalise the temporary appointment which, in the absence of the commissioner, it was essential to make.  The present Bill gives effect to those recommendations, and also provides against a similar difficulty in future.  In conclusion, I am happy to be able to say that the commissioner of valuation has now completely recovered, and is back in his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this Bill is purely to provide against a similar contingency arising in future?  No difficulty will arise in regard to the security of a civil servant's employment?  Could a situation arise in the light of this Bill which would enable some future Minister to say: &ldquo;The commissioner of valuation is so ill that I propose to appoint a substitute, and get that substitute to discharge the statutory functions of the commissioner of valuation&rdquo;?  The reason I ask the question is that usually when you find that there are statutory restrictions on the appointment of a second commissioner, or on the termination of a judge's tenure, there was probably some good reason for those restrictions when they were first introduced. Very frequently the long practice of the restriction so completely abates the abuse which it was first directed against that we forget what that abuse was, and yet that abuse might manifest itself in ten, 20, or 30 years' time, when a Minister for Finance might avail of this Bill to appoint a substitute commissioner of valuation to make some return that he wanted made and which the existing commissioner had refused to make.  I really do not know enough about the functions of a commissioner of valuation <Col N="718" /> to say whether or not such a probability exists, but I should be glad to know if the Minister has considered that aspect of the question, and whether he is satisfied that it is best to have a permanent enactment dealing with a contingency which has arisen, or whether it might not be better to wait until the contingency arose again and have an <i>ad hoc</i> Act of Parliament to deal with the specific case rather than with the problem in general.</P>

      <P>I have considered the aspect of the matter which the Deputy has put before me, and I do not think there is any probability that a Minister would abuse the powers which this Act gives him in the manner that the Deputy has suggested, because the commissioner of valuation is a person who is in frequent contact with the public by reason of the statutory duties which he performs.  I think if the public felt that, in order to do something in a surreptitious way, the Minister had appointed temporarily another person to discharge the duties of the commissioner of valuation, they would speedily communicate with their representatives here in the House, and I am perfectly certain that the matter would be raised here in the House, when of course the whole question of the circumstances in which this substitute was appointed would naturally have to be discussed.  It is clear from the Bill that the Minister has to be satisfied that the commissioner is temporarily unable, owing to physical or mental ill-health, or absence from Saorstát Eireann, or any other cause, to discharge the duties of his office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is a general omnibus clause, but remember that the emphasis is laid on the words &ldquo;physical or mental ill-health or absence from Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  I assume that, even if the general public did not feel aggrieved in this matter, the commissioner himself would feel aggrieved.  I take it he would have the right to go to the court, and call on the Minister to show the court what reasons satisfied him that the commissioner <Col N="719" /> was temporarily unable, owing to physical or mental ill-health, to discharge those duties, and I take it the court would be slow to concede that the Minister was, within the terms of this Act, properly satisfied in a case of the sort to which the Deputy referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister for Finance, because, in concluding on last Wednesday night, I asked leave of the House to approach this question of the cost of living from a somewhat different angle from that from which the proposer and seconder touched upon it.  I regard the rise in the cost of living not as a primary evil in itself exclusively, although it does bear heavily on the people as explained by the proposer and seconder, but as the symptom of a general development which is going, in my judgement, to culminate in national bankruptcy.  I foresee that we are travelling the road of Newfoundland, and I fear if we postpone our criticism too long a time will come when a Minister for Finance can, with certain justice, say to us: &ldquo;You should not speak now, because a word may precipitate a catastrophe, and, therefore, we have to stand together to try to rescue the national credit.&rdquo;  We should have to consider that representation. No such immediate catastrophe threatens now, and, therefore, it is open to any Deputy in the House to speak very freely of the dangers which he sees ahead, because there is yet ample time to guard against them, and to prevent the ultimate advent of the disaster which I apprehend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> I do not want to repeat what I said on Wednesday night, but for the purpose of my argument I must briefly recapitulate the ground over which I was travelling.  Newfoundland has in its fishing industry something exactly analogous to what we have in our agricultural industry.  In the cause of national self-sufficiency, Newfoundland grossly neglected its fishing industry and concentrated, by the erection of tariff barriers, on the establishment of what they thought were new and valuable industries.  To cut a long story short, after five or six years of activities of that kind, their finances got into such a hopeless state of confusion, owing to the adverse trade balance getting out of control, that they were obliged to turn to the British Government and ask them to send out three Treasury officials to put them upon their feet.  They did not do that until the poorer people of Newfoundland had been reduced to a state of destitution which beggars description. There was poverty and misery and even starvation amongst the poorer classes of the community, and rebellion threatened.</P>
    <P>It was no indignity for Newfoundland to turn back to her mother country and ask her to come to her aid in an hour of stress, and Great Britain did, and she is now taking Newfoundland out of the consequences of her follies.  We cannot do that.  We have been arguing for 750 years that we are a mother country&mdash;and we are.  We have been arguing that we are an older civilisation, with a greater pride than ever Great Britain had.  I suppose that is true, and then it would not be open to us, if we got ourselves into financial deep water, to turn to Great Britain and ask her to take over our affairs and rescue us from the consequences of our own follies.  We would have to do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that if this situation which is developing here is allowed to reach its climax, no individual and no combination of Parties will be able to get the country back on its feet.  For that reason I consider it to be vitally important to recognise the rise in the cost of living for what <Col N="722" /> it truly is.  It is not exclusively the direct result of the Government's tariff policy.  It is part of the result, but, in addition to being part of the result of the Government's tariff policy, it is a symptom of a general economic crisis which is being precipitated by the Government's general economic policy.  You have to bear in mind that at the present time a situation exists in which a very distinguished Irishman, speaking in London last week, can say in public that we owe a debt of gratitude to England for the care which England has given to Ireland's exiled children. You have to remember that we are living in a time when a distinguished Irishman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same context that distinguished man mentioned the deep anxiety he and those in responsible positions like his felt for the temporal and spiritual welfare of the thousands of boys and girls who had fled from this country to Great Britain in search of work in the last couple of years. He said that stories which gave rise to great anxiety were coming home, and what we wanted to hear was the truth, so that if the rumours were unfounded we might discount them, and if they were true we might take such emergency measures as would be <Col N="723" /> necessary to correct whatever evil had accrued.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that that exodus of boys and girls from this country has delayed the otherwise inevitable consequence of the Government's economic policy.  If all these boys and girls were back in Ireland, unemployed, looking for work, and consequently poor and destitute, we might be face to face with a very serious situation indeed.  But here the ordinary explosion that follows on the sufferings of the poor in times of financial crisis is greatly damped down by the fact that in our country those afflicted, instead of reacting in a violent revolution, pack their modest belongings in a bundle and go to England, emigrate.</P>
      <P>That brings me to one of the factors in the situation which is among the most menacing.  The ordinary conditions of international trade provide for immobility of labour and capital and for high mobility of the goods produced by the nation.  In other words, if we contemplate a mid-European country, a man does not leave Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia to go anywhere else without very grave reason.  To him, going abroad means going to a place the language of which he does not understand, the customs of which are strange, and where life is unhappy and miserable compared to his own. So far as we are concerned, our people speak English, our peoples' parents have been familiar with Great Britain, and our young people do not find Great Britain very strange at all.  Further, the Yugoslavian or the Czechoslovakian, or even the Swiss, unlike our people, is confronted with emigration restrictions.  Our people, in so far as they emigrate to Great Britain or to any member of the Commonwealth of Nations, have no emigration restrictions to overcome and so they move freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of capital, ordinarily capital in a country does not migrate easily.  Take any small country, again looking to Eastern Europe.  The Yugoslavian will not invest ordinarily in British or even Dutch securities.  He will invest in the securities he knows well by personal experience or by the familiarity of hearing that his neighbours <Col N="724" /> have invested in them in the past.  For us in Ireland it always has been the custom to invest largely in British securities, and even in times of stress to bring our money to Britain for safety.  One of the reasons why this country was so well off when Fianna Fáil came into power was because our people had invested 90 per cent. of their savings in British securities and Britain was the only country that continued to pay its debts to date, with the result that our war savings were intact.  But while we have to thank Providence for that, we have also to remember that the proximity of England and our confidence in the security of funds invested there constitute a permanent strong band on the capital of the country.</P>
    <P>Now goods which ought to be mobile, which ought to travel freely abroad in the channels of international trade are being stopped at every point, principally because, in the hope of getting alternative markets, we threw away the British market to which we had free access.  The alternative markets have not turned up.  We have no alternative markets and we have lost the markets we had.  The result is that it is only by giving bounties and assistance of every kind that we can sell in the English markets the products we have for sale.  So that our essential basis of international trade is reversed and we are in a vulnerable position if not in a weakened financial position in this country.  Now what is the situation?  We are confronted at the present time with a rise in the cost of living which everyone admits.  But we are confronted also with a falling population.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from labour and capital I want to make this point &mdash; that all national wealth depends on the interaction of our capital and labour. Capital and labour is the sole source of national income.  If all labour and all capital left this country there would be no national capital at all.  And the readiness with which capital and labour may leave this land may precipitate a situation in which we have no goods to sell and no national income at all.  I shall return to that in a moment.  Our population has been falling during the last five years <Col N="725" /> of Fianna Fáil government in this country.  For years we were habitually told by Ministers that the population was rising and that the Government's economic policy was absorbing the increase in population.</P>
    <P>The fact, however, was that in 1936 we discovered that, instead of an increase, there had been an appreciable decline in the previous decade. Nor is that tendency yet arrested, because the Registrar-General's report published on the 22nd of September, 1936, shows that the population fell by a further 21,000 in the year ended June, 1937.  We are, therefore, face to face with the situation of a declining population.  Let us examine what that means.  That not only means that the production capacity of the country is being reduced, but also that the burden of the existing debt is really growing heavier, looked at from the <i>per capita</i> angle.  A smaller number of people are going to be asked to repay debts borrowed by a larger number of people.  But that continues and it shows every sign of continuing.  One can realise with what we are faced. We are faced with the prospect of a steeply rising dead-weight debt, because we have a policy of high social services operated by borrowed money.  We have such social services as housing, sewerage and other requirements of that kind.  We have a steeply rising prospect of a dead-weight burden; we have a declining population; both factors will operate to increase our <i>per capita</i> burden debt in the years to come.  And with the departure of the people and the very probable dissipation of our capital earning capacity our population is going to decline.  The Minister opens his eyes.  When we appreciate the depreciation in our capital assets for the future let us examine that.  How many Deputies of this House advert to the facts of the reality of the adverse trade balance?  These facts are astonishing and they are extremely alarming, examined at the same time as the figures for our net sterling assets in the banks.  The picture of one is confirmed by the picture of the other.  Let me remind the Deputies that in 1930 our adverse balance of trade was £11,000,000.  In that year <Col N="726" /> our total trade was about £110,000,000. I think, if I had time, I could put my finger on a speech made that time by the Minister for Finance in which he said that an adverse trade balance of £11,000,000 on a total trade of £110,000,000 spelled early and certain national bankruptcy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am sure.  I remember reading the Minister's speech at the time with great admiration and his thunders were to be heard through the land &mdash; that the situation was positively disturbing and that, when you viewed it in the light of the staggering burden of £21,000,000 taxation per annum that the people were called upon to pay, your blood ran cold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put my finger on it.  To-day we have a taxation burden in the neighbourhood of £36,000,000 and our adverse trade balance is £20,000,000 on a total trade of £65,000,000.  Remember the figures &mdash;£20,000,000 on a total trade of about £65,000,000.  In fact, it is true to say that in the last four years the adverse trade balance of this country represents 93 per cent. of our total domestic exports.  Our adverse trade balance in the last four years amounts to £75,000,000 and our total exports amount to about £80,000,000.  That is to say, within the last four years we bought and paid for £75,000,000 of goods over and above our total exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simplest Deputy in this House knows that if one buys things one has got to pay for them, and if you have got to pay for them you have got to pay for them with something.  When France has a big adverse trade balance she pays for it with her accumulated gold &mdash; through the central bank &mdash; so long as she remains on the gold standard. In this country, the nearest approximation to the gold barometer in the central bank are the net external assets held by the joint stock banks.  I emphasise the joint stock banks because, to arrive at that figure, one must take into account the two figures which appear in the quarterly <Col N="727" /> return of the Currency Commission &mdash; the gross external assets less the external liabilities.  I want to direct the attention of Deputies to the figures taken for the whole September quarter of the last few years.  In 1932 the net external assets amounted to £86,000,000; in 1933 they amounted to £85,000,000; in 1934 to £76,000,000. Many Deputies will be shocked at that figure, but they may discount about four-fifths of that decrease of £10,000,000 because a great part of that was &ldquo;hot money,&rdquo; money that had come here for safety during the instability of the dollar in America, and £8,000,000 of that currency of &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; left the country, leaving us with external assets of £2,000,000 less during these years. As I say, in 1934 the net total assets were £76,000,000; in 1935 they were £75,000,000; in 1936, £71,969,000, and in 1937 the net external assets were £71,000,000 at the end of the April-June quarter.</P>
    <P>I venture to prophesy that when the October issue of the Currency Commission return is published, it will be discovered that we have lost approximately another million pounds in the last quarter.  The net external assets of the joint stock banks are fading away, and remember that in proportion as they fade they affect not only the existing wealth of the country, but they gravely affect the true balance of trade, because, having disposed of the real and visible balance of trade, and having shown that we have imported £75,000,000 of stuff more than we exported, we must turn to what are known as invisible exports in order to get a true picture of the nation's finances.  The invisible exports represent the payments that are coming into this country in respect of emigrants' remittances, interest on capital invested abroad, pensions paid by foreign governments to Irish residents, Sweepstake receipts, and some other minor items.  The interest coming into this country in respect of investments held abroad substantially, though not entirely, consists of the income from the external assets held by the joint stock banks.  As they decline, so does the interest payable on them into this <Col N="728" /> country decline, and so does that item in the invisible exports decline at the same time.  Remember that the annual adverse trade balance is financed by out invisible exports, and that if our invisible exports are not sufficient to bridge the gap between our ordinary exports and our ordinary imports, then we have to go to our savings and take enough out of the national savings to bridge the gap that remains.  That is what we are doing at the present time, and, in financing our international trade out of the net external assets of the joint stock banks, we are getting into a vicious circle, because, as we take out of our external assets to meet our external debts, so we reduce that item of our invisible exports represented by the interest which Irish citizens derive from investments held in Great Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Emigrants' remittances &mdash; the money that used to be sent home by children who went to America &mdash; are going to decline in the future.  Any of us who have any experience of what that represented in the past know well that, for the first ten years after an emigrant went from the West of Ireland to America, he usually continued to send home money to his parents.  After ten or 12 years he married, settled down, and stopped sending money home.  By that time, however, a younger brother or other member of the family had gone out to America, and when the senior member stopped sending money home the junior member commenced to send it, so that there was a continuous stream of money in unabated volume coming into this country.  Since 1931 there has been no emigration to America, and the last emigrants who went in 1929 are now beginning to marry and settle down.  They are stopping their remittances, with the result that in another four or five years there will be practically no emigrants' remittances coming to Ireland.  That is going to mean a substantial reduction of the invisible exports of this country.</P>
    <P>I have touched on the decline of income derived from interest on capital invested abroad.  That is going to be accentuated not only by decline in net external assets but also by this factor: there were left in this country <Col N="729" /> a lot of people belonging largely to the old landlord class and that type &mdash; people who had a natural affection for Ireland.  They were content to live their lives here, and though they had a pretty rough time for the last 20 or 30 years, they still lived here and liked to stay here.  If they got money or land bonds under the earlier Land Acts, or if they got British securities which yielded them an income in lieu of their land, they spent that income here.  But they sent their children to English schools and universities, and that rising generation has most of its contacts with Great Britain.  The cost of living is rising here.  These old people are moving out or dying off. England offers security, a lower cost of living, many amenities that this country cannot offer, and the children are continually saying to their parents, &ldquo;Why do you not come over to England, where we can see you often, and not stay stuck in Ireland, where none of us can ever go?&rdquo;  The tendency is for these people to move out.  That is going to be the tendency &mdash; to move out or die and leave their property to children now resident in England or the Colonies.</P>
    <P>The income from these investments is going to leave the country and is going seriously to affect in the years to come the invisible exports of this country. Then we come to pensions.  The pensions paid by the British Government to those who served them in various capacities, now that they are retired, are a very substantial sum.  A great many of these people lived in this country and spent their money here.  Any pension item is a diminishing quantity.  The older pensioners are dying off.  The new pensioners are not going to live in Ireland, and that item tends to decrease.</P>
    <P>Then there are the Sweepstakes. Few people realise what an extraordinary contribution to the adjustment of the balance of trade was made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he sponsored the Sweepstake legislation in this House.  That has become a great source of wealth to this country.  It would be difficult to assess, with any pretence to accuracy, what the Sweepstake is worth every year as an invisible export to this country, but it <Col N="730" /> is a very substantial sum.  Inevitably, the tendency over ten, 12 or 30 years &mdash;we are talking in economic periods, if I may use the term &mdash; will be for the Sweepstake to decline.  Its novelty will be wearing off.  Rival institutions will be growing up.  No doubt, it will maintain a certain measure of its popularity, but it cannot expect to have the same hold which it had in the first years of its existence.  Prudent provision should be made for the deterioration of that item of our invisible exports.  That means that the resources with which we used to bridge the gap between our imports and exports are becoming more attenuated with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the other side of the picture.  If we have got invisible exports, we have also got invisible imports.  It is extremely difficult to assess these, but you have to view this problem with as great detachment as you can.  You have got to remember that, if the economic policy of the Government has wrought havoc all through the land, it has done one thing &mdash; at an appalling cost.  It has abolished one item of our invisible imports which did exist before Fianna Fáil came into office &mdash; the land annuities.  We used to pay annually to the British Debt Commissioners about £3,000,000.  A great deal of that probably came back to this country in the payment of land bonds, but a lot of it went to stockholders in Great Britain.  So far as it went to Great Britain, it did represent an invisible import and, to a certain extent, offset the invisible exports we had at that time.  It is true that that invisible import no longer continues, but we have got to remember that, with present Government policy, the items of visible imports will tend to rise and further aggravate the visible trade balance.  If we are to go on with the vigorous policy of erecting factories here, we shall be importing the raw materials for these factories.  If we are to have an increasing industrial population, we shall have an increased demand from that industrial population for consumer's goods imported from abroad.  As their income rises, the tendency will be for them to seek consumer-goods which ordinarily would be imported.  Even the maddest <Col N="731" /> member of the Fianna Fáil Party now realises that the suggestion of absolute economic self-sufficiency is a pure chimera.  As the industrial population increases and as the kind of wants that an urban industrial population have grow, they will operate to increase our visible imports of consumer-goods.  At the same time as those forces are operating, you have a steady and immense increase in the public debt. The Minister for Finance, when he gives us a review of the public debt, says that it is very necessary to ascertain the true dead weight debt and not to be deceived by the gross figures of national debt, without taking careful account of the national assets which should be set against it; but the ascertainment of the true value of the national assets is extremely difficult and, in my judgement, the Minister for Finance is attaching to our national assets a grotesquely inflated value.</P>
    <P>I am glad to think that the Minister will deal with the case I submit and will have an opportunity of going into these matters.  I say that the dead-weight national debt has been immensely increased, and what many people forget is that when we talk of national debt we sometimes think only of governmental debt.  There is all the time an additional immense debt growing up in this country &mdash; the debt of the local authority, which is a public debt as well.  I recently asked the Roscommon Board of Health how much money we had borrowed in the last four years, and they told me £250,000.  In addition to that, we have all the borrowings of the county council and the asylum committee.  That is a very substantial sum, but not a penny too much if the country was strong and booming, because we got good value for most of the money we spent. It was largely spent on housing, and, of course, 60 per cent. of that £250,000 can be thrown back on the Exchequer for housing loans.  It was largely spent on housing, but a great deal of it was spent on sewerage and enterprises of that kind, for the repayment of which the Government accepts responsibility for a much smaller share. That one item, however, gives an idea <Col N="732" /> of the rate at which the public debt is increasing.</P>
    <P>Roscommon Board of Health is a tiny public authority.  If you investigate the Dublin Corporation's borrowings, the Cork Corporation's borrowings, and the other big municipalities' borrowings &mdash; the larger county councils like Cork and those who have a very large area under their control &mdash; and add all their borrowings to the total burden of debt, where will you get? In my opinion, to a most alarming position.  The position is only alarming in so far as our earning capacity as a nation seems to be declining.  If we were earning plenty, if the national income was steadily rising as it was up to 1929, we might have spent without hesitation and without anxiety, but it is not.  It is declining.  If the national income was declining in the presence of a world slump, I think we might have spent, and spent courageously and without hesitation, saying perfectly truly: &ldquo;We saved when there was a boom on to provide against a rainy day.  Here is the rainy day.  Let us check in now on the good credit we have built up in the time of plenty.&rdquo;  But what are the facts?  In this country we are borrowing on an unprecedented scale, while we ourselves are experiencing an intense depression in the midst of a world boom.  Every other country in the world is booming in an unparalleled way and riding high, wide and handsome on a magnificent wave of prosperity, and particularly so Great Britain, with whom we have the closest contact in the world.</P>
    <P>This country is still in the throes of a deep depression, and we sometimes ask ourselves: are we ever going to get out of it?  If we are sinking deeper and deeper into debt while the world is on the up-grade in a boom, what on earth will we be doing when we start accompanying the world down on the other side?  Every hen-roost will have been robbed, every nest-egg cooked and eaten, and every ounce of credit we have stretched to the limit, with a long slump waiting for us which we ought to be levelling out by expenditure on our credit accumulated during those years of universal prosperity. We are not doing it, and we <Col N="733" /> are not going to receive the results of our failure to do it for some years to come, but it is ghastly and wild irresponsibility not to take steps to meet that situation.  What are the appropriate steps?  Are they to stop spending?  Not at all.  If you do that, you are only making the situation ten times worse.  The way to do it is to get back the earning power of our community, and you can do that over-night if the country will only face it, and without any difficulty.  I shall be glad to hear the Minister telling us what is his reaction to the steady decline in the Exchequer balance. The Exchequer balance a year ago was over £2,000,000.  It is about £900,000 now, and remember that the Exchequer balance is declining in a period of unprecedentedly high taxation, the highest taxation known in this country since Brian Boru won the Battle of Clontarf.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the Exchequer balance is showing an ominous tendency to decline and our liability for public expenditure shows no inclination to contract at all. I prophesy that the Minister will have to borrow before the end of 12 months. Does the Minister deny that?  I suggest that he will have to borrow before the end of 12 months, and I say that, unless the economic condition of this country is in better trim, he will not get sixpence.  I want him to get whatever money is necessary to carry out the essential reforms upon which all Parties in this House are agreed, <Col N="734" /> and I want him to get that money on as advantageous terms as any other Government in Europe.  Let him remember that when his predecessor in office was in charge of the Irish Exchequer, after certain unfortunate occurrences had been disposed of in the early days, he was always able to borrow on a level with any Government practically in the world.</P>

A number of Deputies feel, when anyone gets up to speak about national finances, that he is championing the capitalists, the rich and the profiteers.  Can I persuade Deputies to realise this simple fact that in the event of the national finances of this country becoming bashed, the one section of the community that will not suffer is the rich? <Col N="735" /> They will simply transfer their money to London, pack their bags, walk on to the mail boat, and bid us farewell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The land belongs to the people.  We put the people on the land, bought it out, and gave the landlords negotiable securities instead of the land.  We have anchored the people to the land.  Deputy Larkin gives me the cue.  I want to point out that fifty years ago we had every wealthy man in this country tied by a chain to it.  As Deputy Larkin stated, he could not take the land with him.  In the last forty years we have wiped out every landlord.  With the Land Act of 1931 we dispossessed the last of the landlords, paid them with our money and anchored the tenant farmers of Ireland to the land. Now, as Deputy Larkin so aptly puts it, if the national finances collapsed, having liberated with our money every man and woman of wealth, they can, overnight, leave the land that used to anchor them to this country, but our own people have got to stay. Mind you, there are some stupid, wooden-headed people in this country who think that that was a clever thing to do from the economic point of view. Of course, from the social point of view, all of us are proud to be the sons of leaders of the Land League. But remember this, in putting our own people on the land, and anchoring them to it, we took a terrible risk. We banked absolutely on the capacity of the Irish people to run this country better than the British people could run it.  Are we doing it?  Remember that when the British people taxed us to the tune of £12,000,000 yearly, we initiated a suit against them to recover £200,000,000 on the grounds of over-taxation. The British are not gone 20 years and now we are levying £36,000,000 on three-quarters of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy keep quiet.  He is not at the zoo.  I want Deputies to realise that if this country goes burst, it is the poor will suffer.  Remember Deputy Larkin's point, the small farmers cannot get out of the country.  The big men can.  The poor man, who is depending on the social services to keep the wolf from the door, will wake up one day to find that the National Exchequer cannot finance him any longer.  The devaluation of the currency, which must ensue if the decline in the net assets were to continue, would operate to raise the cost of living on the very poor, and would precipitate a catastrophic situation on the shoulders of all.  The first and the worst disasters of a financial crisis would fall on them.  I do not pretend to be a philanthropist, and I do not pretend to view with detachment the destruction of my own resources.  I love my property as much as any other Deputy, but I say honestly that the greatest menace of a financial crisis is not the loss that people of property would suffer.  They can survive, they can carry on, and save something from the wreck, but hundreds of decent people would suffer while the crisis was in progress, and while attempts were being made to set the balance right, they would suffer hunger, misery and destitution. What appals me is that everyone of us does not take an object lesson before what happened in Newfoundland happens here.  In Newfoundland the poor were starving, and there was real hunger and destitution in the homes of thousands of hard-working people.  Surely to God we do not want the same thing to happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the rise in the cost of living is a red light to all, to bring us back to our senses.  It is the red light warning us not to stray from the paths of liberal reform into the back waters of reaction.  Far from it.  The red light is warning us that unless we take precautions now, the liberal and decent tendencies of all Deputies, who want to see housing and reasonable amenities for the less fortunate sections of the community, will be rendered nugatory by the absence of the means to put these good intentions into effect.  Looking across <Col N="737" /> Europe to-day one sees a prospect &mdash; I do not think I am too optimistic in the forecast &mdash; of 20 years of peace, prosperity and progress.  For the last six months we have been living amidst &ldquo;alarums and excursions.&rdquo;  We have seen the forces of Moscow doing all they could to upset the peace of Europe and to precipitate pandemonium in the world.  I think these forces have been at last definitely circumvented and that we may look forward at least to established peace for 20 years; to 20 years of prosperity and progress.  Is this country to have no share in it?  Politicians may bank on this country submitting to a world of comparative prosperity and progress without taking any part in it.  If they think that, they are making a terrible mistake.  They make this worst of all mistakes, that while their intentions are not going to be defeated by revolution, by ignorance, or by people rising up to assert their right to the good things of the world, it is going to result in the flower of our people flying out of the country, and it is going to leave it, at the end of five or ten years, a broken and a deluded land.</P>
    <P>At the present time those who live in the country know that 90 per cent. of the active, dignified, hard-working fellows have gone; have cleared out, and that we are left, very largely, with the fellows who are not so well off; with young fellows who are not above getting the dole, if they can get it, and with married men who cannot go because they have family responsibilities which make it essential for them to stay at home.  That tendency is going to grow and grow.  Up to this I have seen very few families leaving. though I have seen some young married men put the key in the lock and take their wives and two or three children to England.  They cleared out and let the land &ldquo;go hang.&rdquo;  I want this House to realise that the present tendency to depend on philanthropic means is going to become comparatively common.  Naturally, young married men who do not wish to be on outdoor relief, on the dole, or on any form of eleemosynary relief will simply turn the key in the lock of <Col N="738" /> the door and take their families to England, where they can earn a living. I should be long sorry to see civil disturbance in this country, or anything directed towards upsetting democratic institutions, but I should be much more sorry to see this country wither under a native Government. There is no way out of the dilemma except to restore the national industry.</P>
    <P>I am not asking this House to attempt to pull down the standard of our social services to the level of our diminishing income.  It would be a confession of failure and disaster if we had to do it.  What I am asking the House to do now is to take the necessary steps to build up our national income to the level of whatever demands ample social services may make upon the public purse.  It is still possible to do it.  Our credit is still all right, and if we take correct measures together we can build up this country and repair much of the damage that has been done in the last five years.  Two years from now, unless urgent steps are taken to repair the situation, it will not be in the power of that Government or of that Government with this Party to build up the national finances.  It will be a question of desperate economies, coincidental with humiliating appeals to neighbouring countries for trade concessions to save us before we perish. God forbid that we in this country should be reduced to such straits.  No one knows the truth of what I am saying better than the Minister for Finance, and I suggest to him that, for the sake of his own supporters, he ought to utter some words of warning to them in connection with the things it may be necessary to do in the immediate future.  At the Ard-Fheis of the Party I observed that he was impatient with much of the codology that went on there.  I think he should have the moral courage to face up to the responsibilities of the high position that he occupies, and show that he is fit to start on the necessary road to reform, to convince his colleagues in the Executive Council that all the codology about the economic war must be abandoned, and that steps must be taken now to restore the national economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> That can be done in one night.  There is a formula which can save faces on all sides and over-night restore the earning capacity of our people and thus eliminate the rise in the cost of living and all the other evils that are complained of in this motion.  If the Minister and his colleagues will go to the British Government to-morrow, to the only market where we can raise money to bring down that cost of living, and say to the British Government, &ldquo;We do not ask you to accept the truth of our contention in this dispute, nor must you ask us to accept the truth of your contention in this dispute.  Therefore, leaving both cases intact, neither side abandoning the attitude that it has taken up, let us acknowledge that there is money between us and that this has got to be settled sooner or later by the sensible method of compromise&rdquo;.  On that basis a settlement can be arrived at, and hundreds of thousands of people in this country can be relieved from the unbearable burdens they are at present suffering.  On that basis the financial structure of this country can be got back to a solid foundation, but unless that is done there will be no use doing it in two years' time.  That is the catastrophe.</P>
    <P>There is the temptation to say that the people should learn the lesson, whether it be political or economic, out to the bitter end, but there are limits.  It would be wrong for us, even for the political kudos which admittedly we are getting out of the present situation, to try to goad the Government into hurting the country more in order the more to vindicate ourselves.  We want no political kudos out of this, and we would be glad, even at this eleventh hour, if the Government would settle the economic war on the most advantageous terms and get for themselves all the political kudos of settling.  That is vital for the salvation and the economic structure of this country, and it is because the economic structure of this country is crashing that we have the clamours about the rise in the cost of living. That rise is merely a symptom of the larger national disease.</P>
    <P>The remedy is in the hands of the <Col N="740" /> people responsible for the national finances, and they alone can save us. Somebody has got to do it sooner or later.  The sooner it is done the less damage there will be to undo.  The present Government, having secured a verdict at the last election, can do it now.  I urge them to do it, and if they do not do it then I urge them to get out and make way for somebody who will.  Our people have the right to enjoy in our country a share of the world prosperity that is rising up around us.  They are not getting it. They are being left in the dirt, the mud, the poverty and the misery that they are experiencing at the present time.  It is wrong and immoral for any Government so to treat the people for whom they are responsible.  We are entitled to a share of the material things of this world.  They are there for the taking if the Government will let our people take them.  I want for our people a share of the prosperity that is sweeping over the world at the present time, and I think the people mean to get it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, having finished his long speech, we begin to see why it was that this motion was put down.  When we saw it on the Order Paper a lot of us wondered what could be the cause of so revolutionary a proposal, particularly in view of the promises that the Party opposite made during the recent general election, that they would continue the policy of protection and State support for agriculture and industry as it prevailed under the Government that was still in office. The earlier part of the Deputy's speech was by implication a definite repudiation of the motion, and it seems evident from that fact that he cannot vote for it: that the real purpose of putting down the motion was to afford an opportunity to Deputy Dillon to make another of his morbid speeches &mdash; full of sound and fury and of woeful prophecies as to the future of this country.  It was a speech which the Deputy has made scores of times during the past five years, and which it is extremely doubtful if he believes in the substance of it himself!  I asked him the last time he made such a speech how it was that of all the people who are interested in the financial <Col N="741" /> soundness of this country, in the economic safety of this country, he could not quote even one of them to support his prophecies of incipient bankruptcy and evil.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Deputy this evening, I thought that he was trying to give the impression that he believed in what he was saying, and that he would quote something in favour of his thesis.  He did not do so.  I suggest to him that there is the strongest possible proof of the economic soundness of this country in this fact: that for the past three years you have had a number of the ablest men in the country &mdash; bankers, professors, businessmen and a couple of foreign experts&mdash;raking this country upside down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Deputy think that the varied interests working on this problem during the past three years, and seeing what is happening &mdash; that is, supposing the Deputy is correct &mdash; seeing those signs of coming bankruptcy, seeing production going down, seeing external assets decreasing, seeing the adverse balance growing, and all the rest of it: does he think that the results of that examination would not be revealed on the stock exchange?  Of <Col N="742" /> course it would.  It could not help being revealed.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon speaks about this wonderful wave of prosperity over the world, I wonder does he really believe it?  I wonder is he serious when he talks in that way? France is a great country, one of the wealthiest in the world.  Does Deputy Dillon hold that that country is increasing in prosperity? Has he not read in recent weeks about a serious decrease in production there and how prices and wages are chasing each other in a frantic race?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was remarking that Deputy Dillon had said that the only protection he was out for was protection against the invasion of goods produced under inferior conditions of labour.  Apparently, however, he does not realise the absurdity of talking in that strain and at the same time advocating that we should rely on Canada for our wheat supplies.  Does he realise that up to two years ago the farm labourer in Canada was very glad indeed to be employed merely for his board and lodging?  And we all know that lodging there means sleeping on a bare floor.  Does the Deputy realise, when talking so severely about the minimum wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board, that the present payment of a farm labourer in many parts of Canada is little more, if anything more, than the payment of a farm labourer in this country? Perhaps the Deputy listened to the wireless two or three Sundays ago and heard a very great agricultural authority, Mr. G.S. Street, talking about conditions in Canada.</P>

      <P>Very well, Mr. A.G. Street.  At any rate, he is a great agricultural authority.  Let me give just one or two quotations from that statement.  I think it may serve one or two purposes.  It may enable Deputy Dillon to see under what conditions that wheat that he is so anxious to use in this country is produced, and it might enable him to realise the shocking uncertainty of any country that would rely on places like Manitoba or Western Canada for its daily bread.  In the course of his statement, Mr. Street said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I saw districts where there was no keep for cattle and horses, no <Col N="746" /> green, and precious little hope.  I met men who had sown but not reaped a crop for nine successive seasons.  I was told that in a land which memory peopled with sturdy independent folk who worked hard and happily, to-day one in seven were on relief.  And I heard the Premier of Manitoba assure a women's institute convention that he would see to it that no one in his province should go hungry this summer.  That sort of thing in Manitoba, the one-time granary of the world!&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Mr. Street then goes on to refer to districts which had not been dried out so badly, and he states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The farming here was in much better case, but here again I was forced to admit that the effect of man's farming during the past quarter-century had been to reduce the yield per acre considerably, and to import many weeds and pests. Now, when rain does come, rust often takes its toll of the crop; many fields were either yellow with wild mustard or foul with tumbling weed and wild oats; and in many cases hideous grasshoppers by the million have to be killed by poison, or they strip thousands of acres.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If that is what it does in Manitoba, God knows what it may do in County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is hoping <Col N="747" /> that there will be a bad yield continuously from wheat and that the bankruptcy he sees coming will surely come. That is the impression the Deputy has left on everybody who listened to his speech this evening.  The lecturer goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The spring has gone from the people.  They are so worn and tired of the hopeless struggle.  They are too old ever to come again.  To anyone who knew them twenty-odd years ago, when they were young and enthusiastic, when the West was a land of glamour and success, and when every year was a better year, the change is horrible to witness. Hope is fast dwindling, and the longing for a financial miracle to enable them to flee a country which has defeated them increases daily.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one of the countries that is booming.  That is a country which has increased its exports very considerably for the past three years or so.  But at the same time, there are a million people on relief in Canada.  And the Deputy calls that a boom; a boom because there is a demand for certain minerals that Canada has almost a monopoly of; a boom because she was the only country which had a carryover of wheat.  The principal point is that that is the country, according to Deputy Dillon, which we are to rely upon for our daily bread in future; and that is the country which, he says, produces its goods under reasonable conditions and from which we should, of course, be at liberty to import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was very sad on the question of emigration this evening. He seems to deplore emigration a great deal.  Everybody deplores emigration. But I recall a speech by Deputy Dillon within the last three or four years in which he ennobled emigration, in which he talked about the great advantage it had been to us to have our people scattered all over the globe, and in which he implied, at least, that he would be the last to curb the desire of the people to go out through the world and try their fortunes in other countries.  If the Deputy means to convey the truth in his speech, why does he continue to assert that emigration is due to the bad conditions in <Col N="748" /> this country?  Would he agree to this proposition?  Suppose we started to inflate here and raised a loan of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 for public works, would we not get back a lot of these people?  Would we not get these back and a great many more?  Would we not, if we could keep it up for several years, add very considerably to our population?  Is not that what England is doing when she is borrowing £80,000,000 per year and spending it upon armaments?  Surely he does not call that prosperity?  Does he think that the position created by that, the high wages and abundance of employment, is a natural one; and does he propose to test conditions here by the fact that that artificial prosperity attracts a number of our people? Surely everything need not be exploited? Emigration is a very regrettable thing, but why exploit it merely for Party purposes?</P>
    <P>It may well be that a position is near at hand in England&mdash;many of the best authorities in England consider it is so &mdash; when all that labour, particularly in relation to the heavy industries, will have to be curtailed.  It may well be that, so far from losing our population, we may have to cater for very many thousands of people who will come back here and have to live in this country in future.  I hope it may be so.  At all events, it certainly cannot be called a reflection on conditions in this country when people are attracted by the conditions created by an artificial situation in England; where there is deliberate inflation, where there is an expenditure of borrowed money and false prosperity. The Deputy, of course, grudges cheap food to John Bull.  I thought he grudged nothing to him.  It was always the case that John Bull got very cheap food.  Of course, the Deputy claims that the economic war was responsible for John Bull getting cheap food.  It is rather singular that in the recent elections in Australia the very same cry was raised by the Party in opposition to the Government &mdash; that they were taxing the people to provide cheap food for John Bull.  There is no economic war between Australia and England, and Australia ought to be so prosperous, in view of the <Col N="749" /> Deputy's description, that there should be no complaint from anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy never admitted that the rise in the cost of living was a world problem.  He dealt with it as if it were purely a phenomenon of this country.  Does he forget that only last week there was a by-election in London, and that the victorious candidate claimed his election was a protest against the rise in the cost of living?  Does he know that at the recent Labour Party Conference in England a great deal of time was occupied with discussions on the position created by the rise in the cost of living?  Does he not know that there is a rising cost of living in New Zea-land, where a Labour Government has been attempting to create a paradise, and that it is alleged by many that the benefits which have come through the social policy of the Labour Government in power have been largely absorbed by soaring prices?  I need not tell him that in France they have perhaps the worst price situation in the world.  In the United States there is a similar situation of rising prices and consequent adjustments of wages. Even in Germany, where one would think it would be easy to stabilise things, it is alleged that an order for a fixed price is followed at once by a deterioration in quality.  I know of no country that has not got this problem to face.  It is a very serious problem and I am quite sure it will not be solved by the proposal on the Order Paper. It is worth noting what happened in Sweden, a country with an economy somewhat like this country, where it is alleged the greatest prosperity in the world prevails at present, when they were faced with a very bad situation some five years ago.  The depression had lasted longer there than in other countries, and conditions were extremely grave.  The Deputy may be interested to hear what steps were taken to restore agriculture to something like prosperity.  Their policy bears very much on the question before the House at present.  The Deputy may have to be reminded that <Col N="750" /> this motion proposes the abolition of all levies, bounties and similar impositions. Yet in a country which has attained tremendous prosperity in a very quick time, the things that they did were, almost word for word, identical with the things done in this country for the same purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might listen for a moment.  Will the Deputy recognise this arrangement as somewhat similar to our system: &ldquo;A promise by the Government to buy each summer all Swedish wheat and rye at a fixed price, and a regulation of the percentage of foreign cereals which flour mills may use with home-grown cereals&rdquo;?  That is closely akin to our system, is it not?  Would the Deputy recognise this as being also similar to our system: &ldquo;The regulation of the milk and butter market includes a tax on all milk sold directly to the consumer. The wholesale price of butter sold for Swedish consumption is fixed at 2.30 kroner, or about 2/7 a lb.  The proceeds of the taxes are used chiefly to pay the exporters of butter the difference between the domestic and export prices&rdquo;?  It is very remarkable that Sweden should have found much the same system as ours necessary in relation to its dairy farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, if the Deputy lived in Sweden he would have to put up with this: &ldquo;A sugar monopoly regulates the importation of sugar, the result being an increase in home production. The importation and sale of maize is restricted also, so as to favour an extended use of Swedish cereals for hog and poultry feeding.&rdquo;  Yet the Deputy thinks that the system here is madness, that all these bounties, levies and like impositions should be removed forthwith, and that if they are removed we shall have nothing but one long period of prosperity.  Was the Deputy <Col N="751" /> serious for a moment, and, if so, why did he repudiate the motion by promising to agree to continue the wheat levy?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has also a cure in respect to the bacon position. If there be free trade in bacon, we shall have bacon at some 4d. per lb. less than the price at which it is sold at present!  At present it sells at the English price.  A theory propounded with great force again and again by the late Deputy Hogan &mdash; and it was generally accepted in this House&mdash;was that the export price of any article of which we have an export surplus is the price that will also prevail here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very good at introducing red herrings.  The theory is much simpler than that.  He held that when we had a surplus of any product to export, the price we got for that surplus regulated the home price of the product.  Now Deputy Dillon comes along and corrects him to the extent of about 25 per cent.  He says that there should be a difference of 4d. per lb. in the price of bacon.  Does the Deputy recall that when the Minister for Agriculture was introducing his Estimate last spring, he told the House that the difference between the price obtained by our exporters and the price obtained in England &mdash; after the payment of the tariff&mdash;only amounted to £60,000?  £60,000 spread over the exports <Col N="752" /> of bacon from this country would not even mean ¼d. per lb.  The Deputy ought to look into that question again because if he claims to be an authority on bacon &mdash; and he should be an authority on bacon &mdash; he ought not make a blunder of that kind.</P>
      <P>I hazard the guess with regard to this motion that although Deputy McGilligan's name is to it, he never saw it and had nothing to do with it. He neither drafted nor inspired it. It is also quite evident from the very shallow speech of Deputy Morrissey, a speech in which he did not explain the motion and in which he did not show for a moment that he realised what was conveyed in it, that he did not inspire it or have anything to do with its drafting.  The motion came from Deputy Dillon and probably represents the philosophy of Deputy Dillon, so far as he has a philosophy. If it were to be taken seriously, suppose the House were to consider it seriously.  I wonder how many Deputies would vote for it?  The interruptions when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was making his speech showed that one set of Opposition Deputies certainly do not want it to apply to butter.  They do not want a natural price for butter in view of the conditions that have prevailed for the last four or five years.  They do not want to go back and tell their constituents: &ldquo;We have taken the chance of voting for a motion that may result in your selling your butter in the British market at 65/- per cwt. and getting no assistance from the State in that position.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon himself, for instance, does not think the price of eggs too high.  He does not approve of getting no assistance for that industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>It was shown by other Deputies that their constituents are very much attached to the growing of wheat, that they have found good results accruing from it and that they are not prepared to give it up merely because they have had one bad season. It must be remembered that even in the hey-day of our cattle trade there <Col N="753" /> were periods when thousands and thousands of cattle died from disease, and there was no help for it.  There was a period during the reign of the last Government when there was an epidemic of fluke.  During that period there were many people who would have preferred a field of wheat to a herd of cattle.  There were also periods of foot and mouth disease in this country when the cattle farmers were not over-happy in their position.  It is inevitable that agriculture will always have to face periods of that kind, periods of disappointment and loss, and it would not be a tribute to our farmers to say that, because they have to endure a season of that kind, they are going to abandon a crop which the <Col N="754" /> bulk of them believe to be a desirable crop, a crop that is suitable for this country and one that they should be encouraged to grow.  I do not for a moment believe that is the position, and I am quite sure the House will not pass this motion.  It has no merit.  It is a purely rhetorical proposal, and has nothing in it to commend it to the House.  I hope it will be rejected.</P>
