      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Mr. Davin)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the nature of the report on the insanitary condition of Kilcormac, made to the Offaly Board of Health by the county medical officer; whether he is aware of the number of deaths due to infectious diseases reported from Kilcormac district in each of the last three years; whether he is aware that there is neither a sewerage system nor water supply in the town of Kilcormac, and if he will state whether it is his intention to take any action in regard to the neglected condition of this district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not aware of the nature of the report referred to in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part, the deaths due to infectious diseases in the Kilcormac dispensary district are not classified separately by the Registrar General, but the number of cases of infectious disease notified from that district in each of the last three years for which the information is available are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;1933&mdash;Nil.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;1934&mdash;Typhoid fever, 1;</P>
      <P>Diphtheria, 2;</P>
      <P>Encephalitis Lethargica, 1.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;1935&mdash;Diphtheria or suspected diphtheria, 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the latter part of the question, it is understood that the water supply for this district is derived from three pumps, and that there are <Col N="168" /> a few built drains for sewerage and surface water.</P>
    <P>The question of the improvement of the water supply and sewerage system is one primarily for the Offaly Board of Health and Public Assistance acting on the advice of the county medical officer of health, who has been asked to draw up a list of the necessary sanitary works for the county health district in order of urgency.</P>

Eight prosecutions have been instituted under the Moneylenders Acts since the passing of the Moneylenders Act, 1933.  In three cases convictions were secured and in the remaining five cases the Probation of Offenders Act was applied.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will modify the regulations governing unemployment assistance to meet the cases of fishermen in Kinsale and such centres who work on the share system and who, because they are &ldquo;employed&rdquo; once they enter a boat, are debarred from assistance; and whether seeing that their catches have been very low, scarcely exceeding a few shillings per man so far in the present season, he will take immediate steps to meet these cases of hardship.</P>

Persons employed as fishermen and remunerated by a fixed share of the catch are not therefore unemployed, and unemployment assistance cannot be paid to them whilst they are so employed.  I do not propose to introduce legislation altering this position.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that farmers supplying milk to creameries operated by the Dairy Disposals Company are unable to get advances for the purchase of seeds and manures.

These advances are repayable during the ensuing period when milk is plentiful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if it is a fact that notices to quit were served on Edward Duggan, Hugginstown, Knocktopher, County Kilkenny; James Holden, Hugginstown, <Col N="172" /> Knocktopher, County Kilkenny; John Hudson, Newmarket, Knocktopher, County Kilkenny; Michael Cody, Castlemorris, Knocktopher, County Kilkenny, and Mrs. P. Whelan, Castlemorris, Knocktopher, County Kilkenny; whether he is aware that the persons concerned are industrious workers to whom small allotments of three acres were given by the Land Commission on the division of the Castlemorris estate in 1926; whether he is aware that the persons concerned have paid all Land Commission charges due out of their holdings, and whether he will state the grounds on which notices to quit have been served on them, and whether it is the present policy of the Land Commission to evict these people from their homes, and if so, with what object in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons in question are allottees on the De Montmorency estate, and were put into possession of their allotments under temporary convenience lettings on the 6th January, 1927.  On investigation at various times, the Land Commission ascertained that the allottees were not working the lands allotted to them in a satisfactory manner, and, as there was no improvement shown after their attention had been called to the matter, and after they had been warned of the consequences of their neglect, the Land Commission decided to take up the parcels of land for redistribution. Accordingly, notices terminating the lettings on the 1st May next were issued to the allottees on the 8th January last.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, in view of the fact that the parcel of land in each case amounts only to three acres, might I ask what does the Minister mean by saying that the allottees were not working the lands in a satisfactory way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a generally accepted standard as to how land of that kind should be worked.  There has been constant inspection of these lands, and since these notices to quit were served, one of the allottees has shown marked improvement in his way of working the land, and as a consequence the notice in that case was withdrawn. <Col N="173" /> In the other cases the allottees have continued to neglect their allotments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to indicate what the standard it.  When land is neglected like that, it is quite obvious that the people who have it should not be left in possession, and they have not been left in possession.  I do not propose to tell the House what the standard is.  Everybody knows the way these lands ought to be used.</P>

      <P>The wording as it stands means that if there were gratuities, income of any kind, from more than one source coming into the individual making the claim, the half-crown that is allowed would be allowed on every item of such gratuities coming from different sources.  The proposal is to take all income, gratuities or otherwise, coming into the claimant together, and allow the half-crown on the total amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why, if you have a person in your employment, and she becomes a widow, you will not be permitted to give her some allowance?  Do you not think, by reason of the fact that the woman is a widow and in poor circumstances, that <Col N="175" /> she should be entitled to the full amount in the ordinary way, apart from any gratuity that a person in whose employment she had been might make her?  Such a person would give the money for services rendered.  At least, that is what the employer does, and I think it is rather unfair that that should be taken into account in estimating her income.  Of course I understand the law is that way, but I think the Minister ought to consider whether it would not be advisable to drop that in the case of needy people.  Of course if a person has a considerable income it is a different matter.  I submit the State should have nothing to do with the payment made by the late employer of a widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course all these claims are examined and the claimant is subject to a means test.  It is only necessitous widows who will come within the ambit of the Act.  It should not be for the Government to decide what form of income a claimant has, whether it be from an employer, from invested funds, or how the income may be derived.  The questions for the investigation officer and for the Department to decide are: what is the income of the claimant, and is the claimant a necessitous person.  There are certain allowances set out in the Bill, but aside from that, I think whatever the source of the income may be, all claims will have to be considered on the same basis.</P>

      <P>Dubhairt an Teachta O Diolúin go raibh an chéim oideachais níos ísle anois ná mar bhí sí sul a tosaigheadh ar mhúnadh na Gaedhilge ins na scoileanna.  Má's fíor sin, ní ar an nGaedhilg atá an locht.  Is féidir oideachas do thabhairt tré Ghaedhilg chó maith agus is féidir é do thabhairt tré aon teanga eile.  Má tá aon locht ar an mhúnadh sna bunscoileanna nó sna meán-scoileanna, ní ar an nGaedhilg atá an locht sin.  Má cheapann aon duine go bhfuil munadh na Gaedhilge ag déanamh dochair do chúrsaí oideachais, téigheadh sé go dtí Loch Garman nó Cill Manntan nó áit ar bith eile mar iad nuair a bhíos na feiseanna ar siúl agus feicfe sé go bhfuil na páistí a théigheas i gcomórtas ag na feiseanna úd níos léigheannta, níos foghlumtha agus níos cliste ná mar atá na páistí in áiteacha nach bhfuil an Ghaedhilg dá munadh go maith ionnta.  O bhliain go bliain feicim tuairim dhá mhíle <Col N="177" /> páistí ag dul i gcomórtas le cheile tré Ghaedhilg ag ceann de na feiseanna seo in gach ádhbhar scoile, agus is léir go bhfuil na páistí seo níos cliste agus níos mire in a n-intinn ná mar bhí na páistí fiche bliain ó shoin.</P>
      <P>Rinne an Teachta O Diolúin clamhsán mar gheall ar Ghaedhilg a mhunadh do na páistí nuair a théigheas siad ar scoil ar dtús. Dubhairt sé go rachadh sin chun aimhleasa do chúrsaí oideachais.  Má's rud é go n-eireochaidh linn an Ghaedhilg do thabhairt ar ais mar theanga na tíre, is éigin tosú leis na naoidhneáin. Dá óige a tosuightear ar theanga fhoghluim, 'seadh is fearr.  Sé sin an aois is fearr chun teanga fhoghluim. Dá mba rud é nach mbeadh an Ghaedhilg dá múnadh go dtí go mbéadh na páistí san dara nó san tríomhadh rang, ní eireochadh leo leath cho maith agus d'eireochadh agus an Ghaedhilg a bheith dá foghluim acu sa chéad rang.  Nuair múintear an Ghaedhilg ins na scoileanna ón céad lá a théigheas na páistí isteach ionta, bíonn na páistí seo i ndon cur le n-a gcuid Gaedhilge go dtí an lá fhágas siad an scoil.  Tá an Teachta O Diolúin amú nuair deir sé nach ceart an Ghaedhilg do mhúnadh do na naoidhneáin san scoil.  Tá taithighe agus cleachtadh agam ar an gceist seo. Nuair a thagas páiste cúig nó sé bliana d'aois ar scoil, tosuigheann an múinteóir ar Ghaedhilg a mhúnadh dho agus ní dheineann sé aon iarracht ar aon ádhbhar eile a theagasc.  Nuair a múintear an Ghaedhilg ar feadh bliana nó dhó, bíonn na páistí i ndon&mdash;má múintear an teanga i gceart&mdash;ádhbhar eile fhoghluim tré Ghaedhilg.  Sin é an córas atá ag an Roinn chun na páistí do mhúnadh.  Má múintear i gceart ar dtús iad, beidh siad i ndon ádhbhair eile do thuigsint agus a fhoghluim tré Ghaedhilg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinneadh gearán mar gheall ar &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; nó brabach marcanna a tugtar do na mic léighinn ins na meán-scoileanna de thoradh freagra do thabhairt ar na ceisteanna tré Ghaedhilg.  Dubhairt an Teachta O Diolúin nár cheart agus nár chóir an brabach sin do thabairt dóibh thar <Col N="178" /> ceann mic léighinn a fhreagras i mBéarla. Má tugtar &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; mar sin ins na meán-scoileanna, 'sé mo thuairim go bhfuil sé lán-tuilte ag na mic léighinn atá i ndon ceisteanna ar stair, tír-eolas nó ádhbhair eile mar iad d'fhreagairt i nGaedhilg.  Na mic léighinn atá ábalta ceisteanna d'fhreagairt tré dhá teanga, tá siad nios foghlumtha agus níos léigheannta agus oideachas níos fearr ortha ná na páistí nach bhfuil ach teanga amháin acu.  Ar an ádhbhair sin, ní aontuím leis an Teachta nuair deir sé nach coart an &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; seo do thabhairt. Dar liom-sa, ba cheart an &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; a árdú agus i bhfad níos mó marcanna do thabhairt ar an tslí seo, ní amháin ins na meán-scoileanna, acht ins na scrúduithe i gcóir na seirbhíse puiblí a bhíos ar siúl ó am go h-am.  Taobh amuich de'n cheist gurbí an Ghaedhilg an teanga náisiúnta, is fíor go bhfuil sí níos oiriunaighe mar ádhbhar scoile ins na bun scoileanna ná matamaitic, Algébar nó aon ádhbhar eile.  B'fhearr liom buachaill atá ag fágáil scoile a bheith i ndon a smuaointe do nochtadh tré Ghaedhilg agus tré Bhéurla nó a smuaointe do bhreacadh ar pháipéar in dhá theanga na gan é bheith i ndon sin a dhéanamh ach i dteanga amháin. Bheadh oideachas nios fearr aige, agus saol níos leithne roimhe.  Bheadh an saidhbhreas oideachais ar fáil aige agus é ag fágáil scoile, rud nach mbeadh ag buachail nach mbeadh ach teanga amháin aige.  An buachaill a fhoghluimeas an Ghaedhilg i gceart agus é ag dul ar scoil, beidh an t-eolas sin aige go dtí go bhfaighidh sé bás agus beidh sé ag éisteacht leis an nGaedhilg agus ag méadú a chuid eolais ó lá go lá agus ó bhliain go bliain.  Beidh sé i ndon an Ghaedhilg do labhairt agus na giotá Gaedhilge sna páipeáirí do léigheamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le matamaitic, agus ádhbhair mar í a raibh an Teachta O Diolúin ag cur síos ortha, cá bhfuil an duine a bhfuil eolas aige ar na h-ádhbhair seo tar éis a bheith scartha roinnt bliain leis an scoil?  Tá a chuid eolais ar na h-ádhbhair seo dearmadta aige; ach, mar adubhairt mé, beidh sé ag cur le n-a chuid Gaedhilge ó lá go lá agus beidh eochair eolais aige cho maith.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta O Súilleabháin ag <Col N="179" /> clamhsán agus ag gearán mar gheall ar na &ldquo;gearrtha&rdquo; rinneadh ar thuarastal na múinteóirí.  Baineadh 10% díobh fé'n sean-Rialtas agus anois, tá an gearradh ó'n 6% go dtí 10%.  Dubhairt sé nach raibh siad i ndon an t-airgead d'fháil cúig bliana ó shoin, agus dá mba rud é go raibh go leor airgid acu, nach ndéanfadh siad an gearradh sin.  Ar an dtaobh eile, dubhairt sé go raibh an t-airgead le spáráil ag an Rialtas atá againn anois agus go mba cheart tuarastail na múinteóirí árdú go dtí an sean-fhigúir.  Chualamar go raibh an tír lán de shaidhbhreas agus go raibh an t-airgead go flúirseach ag muintir na tíre agus nach raibh aon deacaireacht airgead fháil i gcóir aon rud fiúntach. Ach le cheithre bliana, tá na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile a rádh go bhfuil an tír scriosta ag an Rialtas, agus go bhfuil bochtannas agus ganntannas in ngach áird de'n tír, o Bhaile Atha Cliath go Gaillimh agus ó Dhún na nGall go Corcaigh.  Ach tá áthrú tuairime ag an Teachta O Súilleabháin. Deir sé go bhfuil an t-airgead chó flúirseach sin gur ceart don Rialtas árdú páigh do thabhairt do na múinteóirí i dtreo go mbeidh an tuarastal céanna acu a bhí sul ar ghearr an sean-Rialtas é.  Tá súil agam nach gcloisfimíd feasta an clamhsán céanna o na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile den Teach &mdash;go bhfuil an tír scriosta ag an Rialtas atá againn fé láthair.</P>

      <P>Is soiléir anois don té is daille againn go bhfuil an Ghaedhlic ag dul ar aghaidh ins na bun-scolta, ní amháin san Ghaedhaltacht ach ar fud iomlán na tíre.  Sé mo bhárúil má cuirtear an obair so 'un cinn mar atá rún ag an Roinn Oideachais a dhéanamh go sabhálfar an teanga san líne seo a bhfuilmíd ann.  Agus má tá sé amhlaidh biodh an buidheachas ar na múinteoirí a chuaidh i gcionn na hoibre go fonnmar agus a chuir a gcroidhe ann go hiomlán.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar mhaithe leis an obair náisiúnta seo, tá súil agam nach mbeidh an Rialtas truaillighe no ceachardha leis na múinteoirí scoile. Tá buidheachas Gaedheal na tíre tuillte go láidir aca as an saothar éifeachtach a rinne siad leis an <Col N="180" /> Ghaedhlic a tharraingt ó bhéal na huaighe agus í a thárrtháil don náisiún.  Is maith an scéal atá ag an Aire go bhfuil airgead ar fáil le scolta úra a thógáil ar fud na tíre. Ní bréag nach bhfuil scoltacha úra a dhith go cruaidh i n-áiteacha.  Níl dadaidh níos mí-fholláine do pháisti agus do mhúinteoirí ná scol dorcha gan díon agus sean-urlár tais agus boladh bréan ag éirighe as.  Neadracha do aicídeacha na sean scolta so, agus beidh lúthgháir ar na daoine go bhfuiltear ar tí tighthe úra a thógáil na n-áit.  Labhair mé cheana fhéin gur cheart faithchi imeartha bheith i bhfasda le gach bun-scoil.  Tá súil agam nach dearn an tAire dearmad air so.  Anois an t-am aige nuair atá Roinn an Talaimh ag roinn talta ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Is mór an crádh-chroidhe bheith ag amharc ar an aos óg ag imeacht uainn nuair a fhágas siad an scol.  Tá na mílte aca ag imeacht uainn anois 'na srút amháin go Sasan.  Níl céird aca ach an spáid no an sluasaid no an piocóid.  Tá sé mar a gcéadna leis na cailíní.  Níl eólas ceart aca ar thigheas agus ní bfuighe siad ach obair chruaidh mhaslach.  Má tá ortha a mbeatha a shaothrú ar an choigcríoch, nar chóir dúinn iad a ullmhú níos fearr?  Níor chóir go mbeadh siad ar an rang deireannach agus ar an pháighe is ísle i dtír ar bith. Ní hé mo bhárúil go bhfuilthear ag déanamh oiread as ba chóir do cheard-oideachais, go háirid ins an Ghaedhealtacht.  Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó scolta againn agus níos mó múinteoirí oilte againn i gceardoideachas.</P>
    <P>Mar dubhairt mé cheana is crádh-chroidhe bheith ag amharc ar na buacailli agus na cailíní seo ag imeacht uainn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt do dhéanamh do cheist an dhá phúnt.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá orm a rá go bhfuilmuid sastá leis an Scéim sin ach go bhfuiltear rócúramach i dtaobh na gcoinníollacha. Is ar son Gaeltacht an iarthar atáim <Col N="181" /> ag labhairt agus tá's agam go bhfuiltear ag clamhsan mar gheall air. Ceapann na daoine san áit sin go bhfuil na coinníollacha ró-ghéar agus nach bhfuil siad ag dul i dtairbhe don sceim.  Is dóigh liom nach ceart sin agus gur cóir gan bheith ró-chruaidh ar an mbreac-Ghaeltacht.  Tá dochar a dhéanamh annsin.  Nuair a fheiceas na daoine ag a bhfuil an Ghaedhilg go measardha maith, daoine a cleachtuigheas í, nach bhfuil aon chúitwamh le fáil nuair a thagas an cigire, iompuigheann siad in aghaidh na Gaedhilge agus deintear dochar mar sin.  Admhuím go bhfuil mor-obair déanta cheana chun an Ghaedhilg do choinneáil beo sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus, in áiteacha in a bhfuil Béarla ag na daoine, tá siad ag iompú arís ar an nGaedhilg.  Tá eolas agam féin ar chúpla áit in a bhfuil an scéal mar sin. Cúis athais domsa é sin.  'Sé atá uainn ná an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht a mhéadú agus an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht a thabhairt isteach ann agus is féidir a lán do dhéanamh fé'n scéim seo.</P>
      <P>Táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire an scéim do bhreithniú.  Tá's agam gur chuir daoine áirithe clamhsán pearsanta isteach i dtaobh na ceiste seo.  Maidir le Gaeltacht an iarthar, sémo thuairim go bhfuil scrúduighthe na Roinne ró-ghéar. Má dhéanamíd comparáid idir Gaillimh agus Tír Chonnaill, feicfimíd go bhfuair níos mó páistí an deontas seo i dTír Chonnaill ná mar a fuair i nGaillimh, gidh go bhfuil níos mó cainnteóirí dúthchais i nGaillimh ná i dTír Chonnaill.  Tá 20,000 cainnteóiri dúthchais i gConntae na Gaillimhe níos mó na i gContae Tír Chonaill agus breathnuíonn sé aisteach nach bhfuil an oiread paistí i gContae na Gaillimhe ag fáil an deontais is tá i dTír Chonaill. Taisbeánann sin nach bhfuil páistí na Gaillimhe i ndon an deontas do bhaint amach.  Cúis ghearáin é sin ag na daoine agus iarraim ar an Aire í do bhreithniú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rud eile, tá árd-mheas agam ar an obair atá á dhéanamh ag Coiste na bPáistí agus ba mhaith liom dá gcuideochadh an tAire leis.  Tá's agam gur thug sé roinnt airgid do'n Choiste anuraidh agus go bhfuil ar an Meastacháin £1,000 curtha i leath-taobh dó i mbliana.  Isé an gearán atá agam le <Col N="182" /> déanamh nach bhfuil an méid ceart airgid curtha i leath-taobh le haghaidh na scéime seo.  Obair thábhactach 'seadh an obair atá á dhéanamh ag an gCoiste agus ba cheart tuille airgid a thabhairt dóibh.  Feicimíd na páistí ag teacht ó Bhaile Atha Cliath go Conamara agus an saol a chaitheas siad ann déanann sé maitheas dá sláinte agus dá gcuid Gaedhilge san am chéanna.  Iarraim ar an Aire, ma's féidir leis é, níos mó airgid a thabhairt chun cabhrú leis an scéim seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe scoile, níl na bainisteóirí i ndon níos mó a dhéanamh ná mar tá siad a dhéanamh agus iarraim ar an Aire an cheist seo a bhreithniú freisin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister's attention has been drawn recently to a report of the Juvenile Advisory Committee&mdash;the advisory committee that sits on juvenile employment.  The figures in that report are rather alarming. It is stated in the report that, roughly, 6,000 young persons, of both sexes, registered for employment at the labour exchanges during the last year and that, out of that number, employment was found for 782 young persons&mdash;in other words, less than 1,000 out of 6,000 registered applications. That is a very serious matter both for the State and for the fathers and mothers of those young persons. A well-known writer has stated that the city which does not attend to its best assets&mdash;that is, the young persons &mdash;would soon find that these young persons would become a liability.  I think we are beginning to find that out ourselves.  We find that many of those young persons are going to other places of employment and that, owing to the low standard of their education, they are not able to find employment, and then they get into bad company and into all the other incidental troubles, because they are not trained properly at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I have drawn the attention of the Minister concerned to this particular problem for a number of years, and I should be glad to know if anything is being done in our technical schools with regard to that matter. These boys could be trained for particular occupations and I should like <Col N="183" /> to know whether anything is being done in that direction.  These girls, as is pointed out in that report, could be trained in domestic economy.  We have schools of housewifery which are for such people.  Of course, it is an expensive method, but still it would be better, even if it is expensive, to give these young people a thorough training in such a course of housewifery for six or nine months, and then let them get occupations, as they easily can with that training, and get occupations, let me say, at a very good wage.  We find that young girls trained in those particular schools can come on for ready employment and employment at good wages.</P>
    <P>My object in this is that I should like to point out to the Minister that something could be done in the matter. Roughly, something like 3,000 are registered for employment, and something like less than 400 have found employment.  These are facts to which more attention ought to be given than is given at the moment.  I suggest that to find that there are over 5,000 young persons in our city without employment in one year is a very serious matter, and I should be glad to know if the Minister and his Department would see if anything could be done with a view to remedying that situation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  For many years the members of this House have been drawing attention to the over-crowding in our city schools.  The Minister said, in the statement he made yesterday&mdash; or, at least, in the translation of his statement&mdash;that that problem had disappeared very largely: that families had been moved from the city to districts outside the City of Dublin, and that thus the problem of over-crowding in the schools had been relieved.  Now, as I understand the matter, it seems, from the Minister's explanation, that these families had been removed to outlying districts and that arrangements had been made to transport the children from these outling districts to the city schools.  Of course, there are, so far, no schools <Col N="184" /> in these outside districts to accommodate the children, and therefore, as far as I can understand, they had to be transported back to the city schools.  As I understand it, the reason for that was that the children were running wild in these outlying districts.  I believe that they were running wild in such districts as Crumlin.  In fact, it was reported at one time that there were up to 4,000 children in these districts for whom there were no schools.  The Minister has made arrangements to transport these children to the city schools, but I cannot see how that has relieved the problem of over-crowding.  Of course, the managers have found that there is a very great difficulty in finding the necessary money, but I suggest that these problems should be kept constantly before the attention of the Minister and of his Department, and, if the money cannot be found by the managers, I suggest that it ought to be found in some way so as not to have the children growing up without any education at all.  It is hard enough, as we all know, to find employment for young persons who have education, but it is practically impossible to find employment for them when they have no education. These are matters of which I have spoken on many occasions and to which I may have to refer again, and I am sorry to have to say that, so far as I can see, no remedy has been found.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, Sir, that my thoughts in connection with this matter will seem somewhat disconnected and somewhat incoherent, because I did not intend to speak on this matter at all; but when I heard what seemed to me the somewhat foolish talk with regard to the subject of education and the teaching of Irish in relation to education in this country, I thought it would be better to say something in this House with a view to getting rid of the sentimentality that has been wrapped around this whole question of education and the teaching of Irish in this country.  I thought I should like to point out what it really means to a great many people in this country and what is the viewpoint of the average parent in <Col N="185" /> this country towards the problem.  My object in speaking is to see whether there is the same good result coming from education since compulsory Irish, if you like to call it such, as there was before.  I know, of course, that I am leaving myself open, possibly, to the charge of being opposed to Irish&mdash;of being opposed to the spreading of the national language as a vernacular.  I am not; far from it; but I think we ought to consider what is the position of the child during the school-day and during his school life entirely.  We repeatedly talk about a fair day's work for the average worker, and we make tremendous efforts to secure that the average worker, in whatever industry he may be engaged, gets a fair wage for a fair day's work; but what is the average day's work for a child at school?  Is it not rather 14 hours' work a day than anything else?  I suppose I shall be asked whether or not that is because of the teaching of Irish.  Admittedly, I say that it has something to do with it.  The point is that you have an over-loaded programme. A child goes to school at 9 or 9.30 in the morning, and comes home at about 4.30 in the evening.</P>
      <P>During all that time, the child is hard at it in school and then comes home with a load of home exercises which he has to do and, possibly, if he is lucky, he gets a half-an-hour off when he has finished his exercises.  In the main, however, for the average child, it is a question of from school to bed and from bed to school, and I suggest that that is not likely to improve either the mental or the physical well-being of the children.  You are likely to create a mental calibre in the child which will make him unwilling to undertake any further study in after life.  You will give him a distaste for reading, a distaste for study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What subject can you drop out of the programme in order to make it less loaded?  There used to be a saying some years ago that the old national school gave an education on which you could build almost anything, on which you could build a very good superstructure, but I do not think that you had all the subjects <Col N="186" /> taught in the old national school that are being taught in the present national school.  I do not know if it is necessary that children should be rushed into learning algebra as early as they are at the present time.  I think there is a good case for having the whole school curriculum examined to see whether there is not overloading of the programme and a consequent overloading and overworking of the child's mind.  The object of this programme is to preserve the Irish language and to make Irish the vernacular.  That is a very good object, and we are all quite agreeable to it.  I said here some years ago that I was rather doubtful if the effort that is being made to make Irish the vernacular in the Gálltacht, or the Pale if you like, is not something that is wasted.  Irish is the natural vehicle of thought in the Gaeltacht.  It is right to continue it there and spread it out, but Irish is not the natural vehicle of thought for children in the Gálltacht and, whatever you may say to the contrary, the children are only learning by rote the Irish language at the present time in the Gálltacht.  It is quite true that they can carry on a simple conversation in it up to a point, the ordinary simple conversation that any adult might indulge in with a child he might meet for four or five minutes on the road.  But it is not right to say that more Irish is being spoken at the present time than ever before because of this programme or policy.  It is quite possible that more Irish is known or that more Irish is being read, just as it might be also quite true to say that there is a better knowledge now of the French language in the Free State than ever before and that probably much more French books are being read than ever before.  That does not, however, mean that more French is being spoken in the Free State than heretofore.  In the majority of cases the children regard Irish as a subject to be dropped once they reach their own homes.  That is because it is not the natural vehicle of their thoughts.</P>
    <P>I want to present the parents' point <Col N="187" /> of view in this matter.  You see boys and girls coming home with what seem to be riddles in arithmetic and riddles in elementary algebra.  They work these out according to formulæ, but they do not try to reason them out at all.  They know the formulæ all right, but they do not try to reason out the solution of the problem at all.  If you were to take some of the Irish words in these formulæ out of the text in which they found them, there are ten chances to one that they would not understand them at all, that they would be so many Egyptian hieroglyphics to them.  The child is overworked in the school, and in the home, in endeavouring to carry out this programme.  We are not expected to restore and redeem everything in this generation.  It is quite true that we have no right to lose or to renounce anything, but there is no compulsion on us to redeem or revive everything in this generation.  If we do not make the primary schools the medium upon which we can build a good national life, then the whole national structure will suffer.  We praise the methods of our Civil Service.  We praise the personnel of that Civil Service, and the personnel of the staffs of our public bodies, but these organisations have been built upon a system of education that is not on all fours with what we are doing at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that it is at this time, when the child is overworked in endeavouring to restore the language, and when the teacher is overworked in a desperate effort to revive and preserve the language, that it is thought well by the present Government, as it was thought well by the previous Government, to refuse to give justice to the teachers in their demands.  I noticed that Deputy Professor O'Sullivan heard the bones of his skeleton rattling in the cupboard when he endeavoured to refer to that subject yesterday.  I suppose the Minister for Education to-day hears the bones of his skeleton rattling in his cupboard.  He makes no attempt whatever to endeavour to help, or to do common justice to the people upon whom that terrible responsibility rests, upon whom he is imposing that responsibility of reviving the language in a place where that language has ceased to be spoken for <Col N="188" /> hundreds of years.  That is a very heavy responsibility imposed on the national teachers in the country.  It was imposed, not alone on the teachers, but upon the children attending national schools.  Whilst I would not be prepared to agree with the sweeping statements made by Deputy Dillon yesterday, I think a case can be made&mdash;and the facts, as they must be apparent to the Minister, make the case themselves&mdash;for an investigation of the whole position, an investigation as to whether the child is able to bear the strain put upon him, and whether common justice is being done to the teacher in this endeavour to bring about a revival of the language.  We are building the whole structure of the nation on the national schools, and unless we do justice to teacher and pupil in the national school, we are going to have a very bad superstructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the speech of Deputy Hogan.  Such a statement in this House is really refreshing coming from Deputy Hogan, who is himself a fluent Irish speaker.  If I had given utterance to such statements I would, no doubt, be called an Imperialist.  Deputy Hogan has run a tremendous risk in expressing himself as he did and I admire his pluck. There appears to be a reluctance, a diffidence if you like, on the part of public representatives in this country to give their real views when speaking on the question of education.  Deputy Hogan has now given us in this House his honest and considered views, views to which I subscribe and to which I have given utterance in this House previously.  Many public representatives, as I have just said, have refrained from giving their real views, and particularly at the approach of a general election, for fear by any chance they would antagonise that powerful body known as the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  I have resisted the cuts in the teachers' salaries.  A great hardship has been inflicted on them of late, and has now come to be known as the falling averages question.  That and the absence of fixity of tenure are to my mind the greatest hardships that can be inflicted on any body of people in <Col N="189" /> any walk of life in this country.  I want to say that I will do my part in restoring their cuts and in getting them fixity of tenure, if my vote will do any good for them.  Having said that, I want to point again to the fact that there are many things which arise on this Vote and upon which members are rather reluctant to speak.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that some years ago on this Vote I referred amongst other things to the question of ramming the Irish language down the throats of the people.  I pointed out the lack of co-operation on the part of the parents&mdash;not a wilful lack of co-operation, but a lack of co-operation because of the fact that the parents did not understand Irish, and that the children were bringing home text books in Irish which were not understood by the parents.  I went on to refer to another aspect of the teachers' position in this country, which they themselves could remedy if they had the guts, but they had not.</P>
      <P>I referred to the question of the married female teacher, and advocated that on marriage she should retire. That has since taken place.  I will just come back to the point I mentioned a moment ago that public men are afraid that by antagonising the teachers they might lose their seats at the general election or the county council elections.  I am going to take that risk again.  On a former occasion, when I took that risk, in one village alone I had national teachers in the vicinity canvassing against me from door to door.  They can do so again now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The president of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, in his address to the annual congress at Cork, said that the spirit of unrest and revolt is becoming increasingly evident in our schools.  No wonder.  The teachers claimed, and claimed successfully, that they should have the fullest civil rights.  That was something which I personally subscribed to, but having seen it in operation I have begun to change my views.  I believe that a teacher has quite enough to do to attend school five or six days a week without actively engaging in politics. <Col N="190" /> I want to ask the Minister does he or does he not consider it an injustice to the boys and girls attending the national schools of the country that national teachers can afford to be away from their schools for four or five days a week during Dáil Eireann sessions?  To my mind that is a tremendous injustice.  The lack of continued contact between the teacher and his pupils&mdash;even if there is a substitute appointed&mdash;is having a very injurious effect upon the education of boys and girls attending those schools and one of the contributory causes to the spirit of unrest.  As I said before, I do not want to interfere with the civil liberty of the teacher to any great extent, but I think his position should be made attractive enough to keep him out of the maelstrom of party politics in this country.</P>
    <P>We find the alarming fact that the total on the rolls of the national schools of the country has gone down from 522,080 in 1926 to 495,829 in 1936. There is also&mdash;mark this point&mdash;a decrease of 48,122 in the infant enrolments in ten years.  There does not appear to be any indication at the present moment that that decrease is going to be stopped.  The indications are quite to the contrary.  In various parts of the country we have a reduced marriage rate.  In some parts of the country there is a reduced birth rate. I cannot see any remedy for the position of the teachers who are at present unemployed, except one, namely, the limitation of the number of persons going into the training colleges.  I do not know whether that will solve the problem, but at any rate it is the only solution that I can offer.  Another solution which has been mentioned is the raising of the school-leaving age. The Minister, who I know has given very great study to the whole educational position in this country, must know that that would put a very large extra sum on the Estimates for next year or the following year.  It is calculated that if the raising of the school-leaving age to 16 years were put into operation in the City of Cork it would mean something like £10,000 extra per annum.  That is in only one area alone.  What it would amount <Col N="191" /> to in the whole area of the Free State I do not know.  Of course the Minister may be able to give us that figure, although I am not going to ask him, without notice, to tell us what that amount would be.  The raising of the school-leaving age, I am afraid, is not practical politics at the present moment, until we can see where economies can be made in other directions. I have protested from time to time that money was being spent by the Government in ways which, in my view, were extravagant and uncalled for, and that that money might more usefully be devoted to such services as education, old age pensions, and other social services.</P>
    <P>I think, like the other speakers that this is a most important Vote.  I regard this and the Vote for the Department of Justice as the two most important Votes coming before us in Dáil Eireann.  I believe that the Minister's Department should examine the position in the light of present circumstances, to see how far they can right the wrong which has been done to many teachers owing to falling averages, and to see in what way employment can be found for the numbers of teachers who have qualified through the training colleges, and have not yet found employment.  I know that the situation is bad in other countries besides our own, but I do feel that in this country the problem is not insoluble.  One means of doing so, I repeat, would be the raising of the school-leaving age, although I do not see any possibility of that being brought about in the very near future. The other suggestion I make is the limitation of the numbers entering the training colleges&mdash;the only method by which you will be able to stop the extra numbers of persons coming into the profession, and for whom no work can be found.  In most trade unions, the numbers of apprentices are limited, and even with that limitation it is found at the moment that, in many of the crafts, there are many for whom no work is available.  The last suggestion I want to make to the Minister is that he should review the position with a view to seeing whether he could agree to limiting the number <Col N="192" /> of those attending the training colleges, and improving the lot of the national teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. P. Daly Mr. P. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few items here to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I see here &ldquo;Grants towards cost of heating, etc., of schools, and cleansing of out-offices: £14,400.&rdquo;  I think, Sir, that that is a very small sum to be allotted for this work.  Down in the area which I represent we have a great number of national schools.  Being a member of the board of health for the area, the managers of those schools have come to me to ask me to do my best with the board to get a water supply and sewerage system for a number of those schools.  We do our part in the board of health, but we find that when we apply to the Department of Education for a grant towards a scheme that a grant is not forthcoming. I think that the sum here of £14,400 is very small.  I put down a question to the Minister some time ago on this matter.  He told me in reply, that where schools were vested in the Department the grant would be forthcoming.  I think that we cannot expect many grants out of a sum of £14,400 for the whole of the Free State.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, and if applications for grants do come to the Department from the area that I represent I hope they will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of falling averages and the very insecure position of national teachers in the country at the present time, I see that provision is made in the Estimate for spending a total sum of £100,496 on the training of teachers. That is the amount of public money that is to be spent on that work, but we find now, and for some few years past, that we have on the unemployment list a number of young national teachers who cannot find employment. Some of them have been trained for the past four or five years, and have not yet got any employment in a school.  I think that in all fairness to these people this House, instead of doing a good turn to young men in <Col N="193" /> training them for the teaching profession is doing them a very bad turn.  We train young men for the teaching profession, and when their training is completed they find that there is no employment for them.</P>
    <P>In the case of teachers already employed we find at the present time that a number of them are living in fear that their position will be terminated in the morning and that their services will no longer be required.</P>
    <P>I think that is bad for the education of our young people, for the country and for the teachers who are responsible for the education of the children, that they should feel themselves to be in such an insecure position. I do not think that any man in any profession or job who feels that his position is so insecure as that can do his work to his satisfaction.  I would appeal to the Minister to remedy that situation: to try and do something that will make the position of the national teachers more secure.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say except to again appeal to the Minister to give something more than £14,400 towards the heating and the installation of sanitary and water schemes for the national schools of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters that I wish to advert to in connection with these Estimates.  I think it was Deputy Keely who said that the Estimates for the Department of Education were amongst the most important of the Estimates for the public services that fall for consideration during these months.  I agree with that entirely.  Education is a matter of primary importance to the State and to the people of the State, but what struck me about most of the discussion that took place on the Education Estimate&mdash;I found it even running through the Minister's speech&mdash;was the tendency to concentrate entirely on the Irish language, as to whether enough was being done for the Irish language, or as to whether sufficient results had been got from the efforts that are being made to make it the vernacular throughout the country.  I would submit to the Minister and the House that <Col N="194" /> the Department of Education have a very much wider function to fulfil than merely ram the Irish language down the necks of the Irish people.  Deputies on all sides, and in every Party in the House, have subscribed to the policy of the resuscitation of the Irish language. We are all paying at least lip-service to it.  If we say anything in criticism of the methods that are employed, irrespective of the policy towards which these methods are directed, we are told that we are anti Irish.  It is about time that that particular attitude was abandoned in connection with this very serious and difficult problem.</P>
      <P>We have the problem of restoring the Irish language, but we have the bigger and wider problem of educating the Irish people, and if we concentrate, as there is a tendency to concentrate, merely on the teaching of the Irish language, in bringing it back at all costs, and by any and every means, and at any and every sacrifice, then we will reduce the people of this country to nothing less than a set of ignoramuses. It reminds me of the old song, &ldquo;They are all out of step but Jim.&rdquo;  Some of the enthusiastic but narrow-minded people who are running this policy of the Irish language, regard everybody who criticises them, or even the methods that they wish to have adopted, as cranks.  The real truth of the matter is that they are cranks. Now, the Irish language does not of itself produce cranks.  It ought not to produce cranks, but that is what is happening.  There are cranks in connection with the policy of restoring the Irish language springing up all over the country, and anybody who dares say a word about the Irish language, or the methods employed for its resuscitation, is regarded by them as a heathen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we all want the Irish language brought back.  We may differ as to the methods by which that can be brought about, but we ought not to be forced to subscribe as a matter of religious dogma to the policy that has been adopted with such persistence and insistence both by the last Government and the present Government of teaching through the medium of the Irish language.  I personally believe that <Col N="195" /> that is going to kill the Irish language. I am convinced, and, like Deputy Hogan, I may arouse unpopularity in certain quarters by this statement, that the methods that are being adopted at the present time in connection with the resuscitation and revival of the Irish language are steadily and inevitably killing the language, and I believe that in my time we will see the Irish language much more near its death than it was 50 years ago.  I learned the Irish language from the time that I was seven years of age.  I learned it at a time when it was not taught through the medium of Irish, when there was no compulsion, and when there was no remuneration for learning it.  At that time there was far greater enthusiasm amongst the people learning Irish than is to be found in any of the schools of the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister in the final appeal he made in his speech took to himself great consolation for the fact that the children in the Gaeltacht are now speaking Irish and learning much more enthusiastically than they ever were before.  He deplored the fact that until recently the wells of the language appeared to be drying up because the people of the Gaeltacht were not giving the enthusiasm, the work and the effort that they ought to for the revival of the language.  How was that problem solved?  According to the Minister, and the Minister to my astonishment takes tremendous balm to himself and encouragement in his efforts for this, by paying £2 of a grant to everybody who speaks Irish in the Gaeltacht.  In other words, if it pays the people in the Gaeltacht to learn Irish and to speak it they will do so, but if it does not they will not. That is what the Minister said in the final paragraph of his speech: that the wells of the Irish language were drying up in the Gaeltacht until some heaven-sent inspiration occured to him to give to the parent of a child in the Gaeltacht speaking Irish a grant of £2.  That appears to me to sound a note of complete and ultimate despair in connection with the resuscitation of the Irish language.  If the people in the Gaeltacht will not speak <Col N="196" /> the Irish language until it pays them to do so, then if they discover that it pays them better to speak English they will speak English and drop the Irish language.  When they have received the £2 grant, and spent it, they will find, when they have to go to England or to Dublin to earn a living, that it is better, as a commercial and as a business proposition, to know English thoroughly, and then the wells of the Gael will begin to dry up in real earnest.  We have a broader and a more difficult task to achieve in connection with education.  We have got to have real education for the people. It is not sufficient, and I believe it would not be worth the revival of the Irish language if, having succeeded in reviving Irish as a spoken language, the inevitable result was to have a nation of ignoramuses.  We cannot live in this island, separated as we are from the continent of Europe, in complete ignorance of the fact that we have neighbours and that we are only one small item in the world.  We have in this House for the last 12 months or two years been discussing foreign policy and international affairs, and that ought to bring it home to us, that we cannot live in splendid isolation. We must equip ourselves to fit in not only with the lives of the people in our own country, but with the lives of people in other countries.  We have to be educated, and if we are not broadly and properly educated in every direction, there is no use in having a revival of the Irish language and being a nation of ignoramuses.</P>
    <P>In connection with that matter, may I draw the attention of the House to another point in the Minister's speech.  He drew attention to the fact that in order to ease the situation for children learning Irish and the position of teachers who have the misfortune to have to teach under the present methods the curriculum of the schools has been curtailed.  Is not that, if pursued, a disastrous policy?  The curriculum of the schools, as I understand from the Minister's speech, is being curtailed in order that more time may be devoted to the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish. <Col N="197" /> In other words, so that this religion of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish, may be continued, the education of the people is being cut down.  I think that is a bad policy.  I believe that by hastening slowly the Irish language can be revived, and brought to a healthy condition.  I do not believe people who say that nobody should raise a voice in criticism of existing methods.</P>
    <P>That sort of thing is not going to bring about the revival of the Irish language.  I do not believe that in order to become a real Gael one must be insular, must be narrow-minded and a bigot.  To revive the Irish language properly requires the infusion of new blood.  There is a tremendous foundation for that as the language is very fertile in its vocabulary and in its ideas.  While there is a lot to draw from, if the language is to survive, it must have infused into it modern ideas and modern methods.  There is no use in cranks saying that one is not a true Gael if he does not speak Irish on every possible occasion, does not get children to speak Irish on every possible occasion, and, above all, does not allow children to be taught or mis-taught through the medium of Irish.  That sort of thing, in my view, will help inevitably to kill the Irish language.  If the methods adopted at present are persisted in, inevitably the Irish language will be killed, and much quicker than the English were able to kill it when they were here.  If the policy of hastening slowly was adopted I believe there is a chance for the language.  I do not know whether I gathered Deputy Keely's remarks aright, that he advocated the desirability of people being bilingual.  That would be an excellent thing indeed, if it could be brought about.  The mental gymnastics of bilingual education would be good for the brain.</P>
    <P>One point that was overlooked by everyone in the matter of the teaching of Irish was that the Irish people are not linguists.  We find it hard to learn languages.  There is no getting away from that.  European <Col N="198" /> nations, the Poles, the Czechs, the Germans, the French, and the Norwegians, can all learn seven or eight languages.  It is unusual in this country to find people who are able to acquire more than three languages. That is because of our natural situation. On the Continent they are surrounded by people speaking different languages.  Here we have to learn languages laboriously.  I think we have more facility for learning a foreign language like French, and acquiring the proper pronunciation of a language of that kind, than the English, but I insist that as a nation we are not born linguists.  That fact has to be taken into consideration in connection with this effort to ram down the throats of our children the Irish language at too great a pace. There are one or two other points to which I want to refer.  To my mind the Minister's speech divided itself into three parts.  It was extraordinary the wave of enthusiasm that ran through it until somewhat towards the end.  The first part dealt with national education, the education carried out by national teachers.  As the Minister proceeded with his speech it became more gloomy and pessimistic. There came into that part of the speech dealing with national teachers an extraordinary amount of criticism of that unfortunate body of men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the speech here but I will tell the House the impression it made on me.  The Minister first quoted, according to my recollection, reports of inspectors about the way teachers were looking after the sanitary arrangements in the schools.  He quoted reports of inspectors as to the lack of method of teachers in preparing their schemes of work.  He then quoted other misdeeds of teachers throughout the country concerning the preparation or non-preparation of work in connection with this that or the other thing, music, drama and the rest.  At all events, the impression conveyed to my <Col N="199" /> mind by the Minister's speech was that there were statements in it showing rather serious faults in some parts of the national education system.  As regards secondary school education, I think the picture he painted was one of complete satisfaction to himself, and as regards vocational education, that it had reached far greater heights than he ever expected to attain.  It is satisfactory, as far as vocational education in secondary schools goes, that that system obtains, but the point I want to make is as regards the secondary schools and vocational education.  As regards secondary education, the system so far as I understand it, exists on the payment of State grants from results.  I think it is time that system, if it exists&mdash;and I believe it does&mdash;was abolished.  It leads to cramming.  It leads to individual pupils not being properly attended to, and it leads to a system by which unfortunate pupils who are learning in the schools are dependent on the results of the examinations.  I may be wrong in that but I understand that grants given to secondary schools depend largely, if not entirely, on the results of the examinations.</P>

      <P>I did make the statement that the Deputy referred to about ramming Irish down children's throats, and I know what I am talking about.  As I said before, I learned Irish before it was either remunerative or compulsory, and I am in favour of the restoration of the Irish language, but I am not in favour of it by the methods which the Deputy wishes to be adopted.  I do not wish to be personal, but if the Deputy interrupts any more, I will become strictly personal. On the question of vocational education, there is one matter I want to find out in connection with the success of vocational education methods.  The Minister has demonstrated the success of that system, and, as Deputy O'Sullivan, who was the originator of the Bill on which that system was founded, said yesterday, it is a matter of profound satisfaction to everybody. I want to know if the Minister can satisfy my ignorance as an educationist, as Deputy O Briain would say, as to what methods are adopted through which pupils educated in these technical schools can be fed into positions. I do not know how it is possible to get over certain trade union regulations. If a young boy wishes to be an electrical engineer, I do not think he can become an electrical engineer through a course of instruction at a technical school.  If he can, I would be extremely anxious to know how, because I have been consulted by constituents who are anxious that their sons should have some sort of opening in that way.  I find it extremely difficult to get any opening for young people through the medium of technical schools in the matter of crafts or trades.  If there is any opening, or any facilities by means of which boys who are not the sons of trade unionists can have some opportunity of learning a specialised craft or trade through the medium of these <Col N="201" /> schools, I would be very anxious to know, as I have not been able to ascertain it so far.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us an account, which I am sure is accurate, of the methods by which young people employed in industry are able to perfect themselves, or render themselves very efficient, through the medium of technical schools.  What I want to know is, if a boy leaving school, having done a good course in the intermediate, wishes to take up a trade or specialised branch of engineering, electrical or otherwise, can he get an opening?  Without having trade unionist affiliations, or being the relative or son of a member of a trade, can he do it through the medium of these technical schools?</P>

      <P>D'ainneoin a bhfuil ráite ag Teachtaí ar an dtaobh eile, táim á iarraidh ar an Aire an clár atá i bhfeidhm i dtaobh múineadh na Gaedhilge do leathnú.  Dubhairt an Teachta O hOgáin gurb é a thuairim féin ná fuil aon mhaitheas á dhéanamh don Ghaedhilg fén scéim seo ach ní aontuím leis in aon chor.  Na daoine atá ar an dtuairim sin, is amhlaidh a dheineann siad tagairt ghenerálta don scéal agus nuair a hiarrtar orra cásanna áirithe do chruthú, ní féidir leo é dhéanamh.  Tá sé maith go leor do dhaoine teacht anso agus tabhairt fén scéim, ach níl aon bhunús le n-a n-argóint.  Nuair a bhí an meastachán so á phlé anuraidh, dubhart go rabhas ag dul timpeall na tíre agus imeasc na ndaoine chó maith le cách.  Bhíos ag cainnt leis na múinteoirí agus leis na páistí agus táim deimhnitheach go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg ag dul ar aghaidh ins na scoileanna agus go bhfuil níos mó Gaedhilge á labhairt anois ná mar bhí roinnt bhlian o shoin nuair ná raibh an scéim seo i bhfeidhm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta Antoine gur daoine misniúla iad na daoine do labhair ar an scéal so ar an dtaobh so. Is ait an rud é go bhfuil na daoine misniúla go léir ar thaobh amháin.  In ainm Dé, caithfimíd tosnú ar an rud so uair éigin.  Do réir na dTeachtaí a labhair ar an dtaobh eile, ní féidir smaointe do chur le chéile i gceart i nGaedhilg.  Muna mbeidh cleachtadh <Col N="202" /> ag na páistí agus iad ag fás, conus is féidir leo a smaointe do nochtadh i nGaedhilg nuair a bheid fásta suas. Dá óige a tosnuítear leis na páistí, 'seadh is fearr, dar liomsa.  Ma fhanaimíd go dtí go mbeidh na páistí deich mbliana d'aois sul a gcuirfear an scéim i bhfeidhm, ná beidh na habhair scoile ag dul i ndeacaireacht agus ná beidh an scéal i bhfad níos measa ná mar atá?</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta Mac Coistealbha gur fhoghluim sé an Ghaedhilg nuair a bhí sé seacht mbliana d'aois. B'fhéidir gur fhoghluim ach, chó fada agus a thuigim-se an scéal, bheadh sé chó maith dhó gan í d'fhoghluim, mar ní labhrann sé í.  O thanag isteach sa Tigh seo ní chualas an Teachta ag labhairt as Gaedhilg am ar bith. Deirim-se ná fuil aon chúis ghearáin ann mar gheall ar staid na Gaedhilge ins na scoileanna mar, fé mar adubhairt cheana, tá sí ag dul ar aghaidh. Dubhairt an Teachta leis ná raibh muintir na hEireann 'na dteangairí. Is dóigh liom gur féidir linn teangthacha d'fhoghluim agus d'admhuigh sé féin go rabhamair níos fearr chuige ná na Sasanaigh.  Más fíor é sin, nach fearr d'Eireannaigh an Ghaedhilg a bheith acu, mar tá a fhios againn go bhfuil rian na Gaedhilge ar a gcuid Béarla?  Is fuiriste fheiscint ó litríocht na Gaedhilge go raibh muintir na hEireann níos cliste go mór san am fadó nuair a bhí an Ghaedhilg á labhairt ar fuid na tíre agus nuair a bhí sí mar úirlís chun teangthacha iasachta d'fhoghluim.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh Laidean agus Gréigis ag na daoine, fiú amháin na spailpiní, an t-am san.  Ar an abhar san, deirim-se go mbeimís níos cliste dá mbeadh an Ghaedhilg mar gnáth-theanga againn agus go mbeadh níos mó eolais againn ar bhrainnsí eile d'ealadhan agus de léighinn.</P>

      <P>Bhíos ag tagairt do chainnt an Teachta Uí Dhiolúin.

Tá an teastas dhá-theangach ag 47.6% de sna múinteóirí agus tá an tard-teastas ag 6.5%.  Sé sin le rá, go bhfuil níos mó ná 50% de sna múinteóiri éifeachtach chun Gaedhilg do theagasc.  Tá cuid de sna múinteóirí ná fuil aon bhaint acu leis an nGaedhilg mar táid ró-aosta.

    <P>Dubhairt an Teachta O Coistealbha gur sórt breibe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta an deontas £2 agus ná labharfaidís an Ghaedhilg mara bhfuighidís é.  Ní dóich liom go dtuigeann an Teachta an cine daonna chó maith le daoine eile.  Buaileadh isteach in aigne mhuintir na Gaeltachta san am atá imithe dá labharfaidís an Béarla go n-eireóc leo agus más rud é go ndearnadar iarracht ar sin do dhéanamh, an aon locht orra é? Nuair thánamair i réim do thuigeamair conus mar a bhí an scéal.  Dheineamair iarracht ar a thaisbeáint dóibh ná déanfadh labhairt na Gaedhilge aon dochar dóibh ach go rachadh sé chun tairbhe dhóibh.  Mar sin, ní raibh ann ach athrú scéil.  Molaim an scéim go hárd agus tá súil agam go leanfa an Roinn dhi.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the advantage of being present when the Minister made his statement, but I gathered from the report in the Press that he stated that there had been a decrease of £13,830 in the teachers' salaries owing to the reduction in the number of teachers as a result of falling averages.  I did not hear and I do not know whether the Minister made any reference to any arrangement which might be made by the Government to deal with the situation that has been created as a result of falling averages.  I understood that as a result of the deputations to the Minister from the teachers' organisation and statements made to individual teachers who met the Minister that some assurances had been given that this question of falling averages would be dealt with by the Government. That is to say, that the teachers who, through no fault of their own, are liable to lose their positions as a result of the average attendances in their schools falling off, should be secured in one way or another.  In the Press the Minister has certainly not been reported as having said that the Government intends to make any provision for the contingency that has <Col N="205" /> arisen.  There is no question about it that a very alarming situation has arisen for many teachers, both fully trained teachers and J.A.M.s&mdash;many of them of 20,25 and 30 years' standing&mdash;who had very satisfactory service during that period.  Now as a result of the attendances in the schools having, for one reason or another, fallen off, these teachers are about to lose their positions.  It seems to me that some provision should be made for the cases of these teachers.  I think every Party in the House is agreed on that.  In fact, Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party attended meetings convened by the teachers' organisations in various parts of the country and expressed themselves in full sympathy and agreement with the teachers' claim for security of tenure in their position.  Therefore, I take it that the Fianna Fáil Party are in favour of the teachers' claim in this respect and that the Government are in favour of it.  Under the circumstances one would, therefore, have expected that in bringing forward the Estimates for the year some means would be provided or some statement would have been made by the Minister as to how the Government proposes to deal with the situation.  The Minister does hint that there is to be a saving in the training colleges.  As a result of fewer teachers being trained in the future, there would be a reduction in that item.  It would appear from the Press reports of the Minister's statement that there is some intention of dropping the provision for pupil teachers.  That will ease the situation with regard to persons who have never been trained and who have got no employment, but I doubt if it will improve matters for teachers actually in employment and who, because of the falling averages, are threatened with dismissal and withdrawal of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister when winding up the debate, would say what his intentions are in this matter of averages.  I would be glad if he would say what the Government have in mind, if they have anything in mind, to meet that situation.  There is one <Col N="206" /> thing that at least could stave off the hardship for a period and that is to have the minimum average attendance reduced by five or six points.  My recollection is now rather vague but I think that under the old scheme it needed an average of 50 for the appointment of a fully-qualified assistant and that once the assistant was appointed there was allowed a swing down to 45 or perhaps 40.  A further swing of five or six points would probably secure the greater number of the existing teachers during their period of service and that might meet the situation.  The difficulty in the matter of the appointment of assistants or J.A.M.'s in the schools could be got over by making no new appointments. But with a reduction in the averages number by five or six points, very many of the teachers would be secured in their positions for the rest of the time they have to serve.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which teachers have been agitating a great deal in recent years.  Both Governments in this country subjected the teaching fraternity to cuts.  Now the teachers were singularly unfortunate in that matter.  The national teachers of this country as a body were, probably, up to 1920 the worst-paid public servants in any country in the world. But the British Government at that time made provision by which the teachers' salaries were substantially increased and they were paid something commensurate with the work they were doing.  The teachers had not enjoyed this increase of salary for a very long time when we came along and brought in a Bill to give them a cut.  They were cut by us before they actually, in many cases, were able to repay out of their bigger salaries the debts they had necessarily to incur when paid the miserably small salaries they had been paid up to that time. I am aware that the Fianna Fáil Party made very definite promises to the civil servants in Rathmines Hall in 1932.  I have an idea that a similar promise was made to the teachers.  I have seen it stated in a report of the Teachers' Congress in Cork, that the Government gave a promise that the cuts we had inflicted on them would <Col N="207" /> be restored by the Fianna Fáil Party. If that promise was made it was kept in a funny way, for instead of restoring the cuts that we had inflicted, when the new Government came in, they inflicted further cuts.  That is what I always feel about the present Government.  They adopted all our vices but none of our virtues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you any?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was that the Fianna Fáil Party mistook our vices for virtues.  At any rate, they have followed us scrupulously in the wrong things we have done.  I think it was wrong to inflict that cut on the teachers for they were not being overpaid in what they were getting.  There can be no question about it that with the change of Government from the British to ourselves, additional work was thrown on the teachers in the taking up of the language programme. They were forced to carry out that programme.  It would have been more encouraging to them if we, at least, continued the old scale of salaries that had been so belatedly given by the British Government.  That, at least, would be more of an encouragement for the work they were called on to do in the revival of the Irish language; we certainly did not give them much encouragement by cutting their already low salaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned yesterday, just following the question of the reduction as a result of the falling average attendance, an increase of £3,000 in the case of the Superannuation Fund, which is to provide teachers' pensions.  The juxtaposition of the statement rather made me think that it was deliberate, because I have a recollection that the Minister for Finance not very long ago, when he met a deputation of teachers in connection with these cuts, turned them down on the plea that the teachers were very well off indeed as the Government had made their pensions safe from being, in fact, unsafe.  That statement coming from the Minister for Finance is absurd because as far as the teachers were concerned their pensions were always safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Deputies might not know the history of the Teachers' Pensions Fund.  There was a provision under the Act of 1879 by which a Teachers' Pensions Fund was formed.  The teachers contributed one portion of the fund and the State and some endowment grant provided the remaining portion.  The teachers kept up their side of the fund all the time; their side of the fund was always solvent; but for the past 20 or 25 years the Government side of that fund became more and more bankrupt.  The Governments, starting with the British Government, one after the other adopted the policy of eating their own tails, as it were.  In order to provide for teachers' pensions annually, they sold some of the stock on the State side of the fund, thus making the burden heavier the next year by selling more of the stock.</P>
    <P>That was the history of the unsound position of the fund.  It was the State side and not the teachers' side that was unsound.  The Minister for Finance should not take any credit to himself for providing that the State replaces the Teachers' Pensions Fund in the solvent position in which it should be if the State always fulfilled its duty towards the fund.  It is no excuse whatever for refusing to meet the teachers in their claim for the restoration of the cuts made in their salaries. Other public servants were cut at the time, and there may always be an excuse for temporary cuts in hard times; but the other public servants have had their cuts restored.  The civil servants have had their cuts restored. It is due to the teachers, who are doing at least as important work for the nation as the civil servants, that they should be treated in as favourable a manner, and I suggest that the cuts made in the teachers' salaries a few years ago should be restored.  If it were only to fulfil even partially the promises made to the teachers, the cuts made by this Government in their salaries should be restored.  It is no argument against the teachers to say that the Government has made provision for the future solvency of the Pensions Fund, because if the fund was insolvent it was the State that was at fault for that insolvency.</P>
    <Col N="209" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to one matter raised by Deputy Daly in connection with the provision of sanitary and heating accommodation in rural schools.  That constitutes a pretty acute problem in certain areas in our county, and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter carefully with a view to making an adequate grant for the provision of necessary sanitary and other arrangements in schools.  In my opinion the amount made available in the present financial year is not sufficient to meet all requirements.  I make the suggestion that better financial provision should be made available for the local public health authority, acting in co-operation with the school managers, so that the sanitary arrangements in schools may become more modernised.  The question has been brought very forcibly before us in various districts.  In some areas in Kerry we have prepared sewage and waterworks schemes.  In these areas there are very important schools with very poor sanitary arrangements, and these ought to be catered for.  Of course, up to this, the question of funds was the big obstacle.  To meet the difficulty, I suggest that the Minister should increase the grants and make certain sums available, to be expended through the public health authorities, acting in co-operation with the school managers and the county medical officers of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important matter has been referred to by various Deputies.  I refer to the question of averages.  This is a vital matter so far as our county is concerned.  In Kerry the average has gone down considerably over a period of ten years and the teachers in the various districts are in a precarious position.  Unless the teachers are given some hope that this matter will be definitely decided with a view to making their positions more secure, their outlook is not a very bright one.  I realise, however, that this matter is in safe keeping when the Minister has it in hands, and I believe the whole thing will be considered very fully and sympathetically. The important point is that if these teachers have not security of tenure <Col N="210" /> they will not be very confident about their positions and their outlook will be impeded, and this will unquestionably react on the educational care of the children and ultimately the nation may suffer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred to both Governments utilising moneys that rightfully belonged to the Teachers' Fund.  I do not think that that is quite so.  I know that Mr. Blythe at one time utilised the money to replenish his Exchequer, and it was not until our Government came into power that this money was restored by way of making the Pensions Fund solvent, putting it in such a way that there was security and hope for the teachers.  Deputies have asked why were not the promises to the teachers fulfilled.  I submit that this action on the part of the Government went 90 per cent. of the way towards fulfilling that promise.  The Pensions Fund was certainly made secure.  I might add that a great deal of the criticism that is made at the present time, especially in our county, is due to the fact that a few teachers get hold of the branch committees, and, in their efforts to get one over on the Government, introduce certain matters.  I have explained to teachers who mean well, and who are out generally for the benefit of all concerned, that they should treat every matter on its merits and that, when they would bring forward their grievances in a reasonable way the Government would go all out to meet them.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a little of that kind of thing going on all over the country.  Apart from that, however, I think it is up to ourselves&mdash;particularly those of us who are representing areas such as I do&mdash;to demand justice for the teachers in connection with the issue which faces them at the moment. That, Sir, I think, is all I have to say on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of a statement made by Deputy Good, he referred to the overcrowding of schools in the City of Dublin, where, I understand, the position is extremely bad. I should like to point out, however, <Col N="211" /> that there is overcrowding in more places than Dublin, and, in that connection, I should like to ask the Minister what has been done with regard to providing more accommodation in the Christian Brothers' schools in Wexford town.  The position there is very bad, and I should like to know how students, under such conditions as prevail there, can acquire any knowledge, and I consider it must be extremely hard for the teachers, in such circumstances, to impart any knowledge to their pupils when one considers the environment.  I understand that similar conditions obtain in Enniscorthy. There, I understand, the Christian Brothers want to secure more accommodation also.  So far as Wexford is concerned, I understand that this matter has been before the Department for the last two or three years, and that nothing has happened yet, notwithstanding the fact that plans have been submitted to the Department long ago.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of schools generally, I should like to know whether or not the £200,000 allocated last year has been spent, because certainly, in the constituency I represent, there was a large number of very bad schools.  I understand that a number of them are incapable of, or beyond repair, and that it would require an entirely new school to fill the bill.  Speaking of schools generally, I want to say that my experience is that the sanitation in schools is very bad&mdash;not alone in old schools, but in schools erected by the Department recently.  Of course, I suppose that is more or less a matter for the Board of Works, but I think the Department of Education should interest themselves in seeing that better sanitation should be provided in the schools.  I have in mind a place called Oylegate in County Wexford, where a school was erected in a place which it was impossible to drain, and that was done notwithstanding the fact that the people responsible for building the school were aware that there was a new sewerage scheme in contemplation.  They knew that that scheme was in contemplation, but they took no cognisance of the fact, and erected the building in a place which it was impossible to drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> The Deputy who just sat down referred to national teachers doing something against the Government for political reasons.  I think that is very unfair and, in fact, a slander on the teachers.  I think it will be very generally admitted that, in general, the teachers have abstained from bringing in the question of politics to the teaching profession in any way, and, so far as that is concerned I think that Fianna Fáil will get at least, as much support from the teachers in the coming election as anyone else will.  At the present moment an agitation is being carried on for the restoration of the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in teachers' salaries, and it is obvious, in my opinion, that that is a just demand.  It is obvious to everybody that the cost of living is increasing daily, and that increase is felt by the teachers just as well as by other people.  Apparently, the Ministers themselves are also beginning to feel the pinch of the increasing cost of living.  We have evidence of that in the restoration of the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in their own salaries.  However, I am not complaining about that, because I am one of those who considered that there should never have been any &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in the Ministers' salaries.  What I am saying is that the Ministers themselves must realise what the increase in the cost of living means, and I suggest to the Minister for Education that he ought to approach his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to restoring the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the teachers' salaries.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of discontent in teachers' circles at the moment, and I suggest to the Minister that it is very undesirable that there should be this discontent, because, where there is discontent, people will not apply themselves properly to the job they have in hand.  Accordingly, I hope that, in the very near future, the Minister will do something on behalf of those people in the employment of his Department. Along with that agitation for the restoration of the cuts, there has been, of course, for a number of years, the agitation with regard to the falling averages and with regard to how teachers are treated in connection with <Col N="213" /> averages that have fallen.  Surely, in a profession of this kind, a man ought to have fixity of tenure in his employment, and he ought to feel sure that when he fits himself for a position of that kind, he will have it for the rest of his life.  Apart altogether from the fact that the cost of living has gone up and is still going up, I think it will be admitted that the teachers have entered into the spirit of the teaching of Irish in a way that is creditable to them.  It must be remembered that they have had to devote a good period of their holidays in the last few years to the acquisition of a good knowledge of Irish so as to enable them to impart their knowledge of Irish to their pupils, and I think that that ought to be taken into consideration by the Minister in an endeavour to persuade the Minister for Finance that the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in the teachers' salaries should be restored.</P>
    <P>Of course, I know that a good many people look upon the teacher as being overpaid, and we have only to look, for confirmation of that, at the action of certain county councils which deliberately pass resolutions to prevent the children of teachers from getting a university scholarship.  That means that the teacher, if he wants to send his child to a university, has to pay more than the farmer who, perhaps, is in a better position to give his child a university training than a teacher with eight or nine children, as is often the case.  Another branch of the Minister's Department to which I should like to refer is the branch concerned with technical education.  The question of scholarships has been referred to, and I notice the Minister this year has a sum of £1,651, as against a sum of £912 last year, representing an increase of £739.  Would he explain what the increase is for, and whether he proposes to enlarge on the system of scholarships which has been in operation for some time past? There, again, I am not at all satisfied that anything practical has been done so far as these scholarships are concerned. One year the technical education committee are told that scholarships are available.  Next year something different comes along, so that <Col N="214" /> vocational education committees in certain areas do not know really what their position is in so far as these scholarships are concerned.  To my mind, more should be done in this direction and more encouragement should be given to pupils of technical institutes to secure that they will get a better training.  To a great extent, a great deal of technical education, to my mind, is all wrong.  We have the position in some of the technical schools in this country that you have males learning commerce, shorthand, typewriting, book-keeping, engineering, woodwork, and various things of that kind.  In my opinion that is only going to make a handyman of some unfortunate person's child and we have too many of them in the country at present. There is not sufficient concentration with a view to turning out pupils for one particular profession.  They get a little smattering of everything, with the result that they are not much good for anything when their period in the technical schools is finished.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there should be scholarships definitely provided each year for pupils of technical schools.  I think the Minister and the people in charge of the technical education department will agree, that there are certain types of instruction for which teachers are not forthcoming at the moment.  I refer particularly to engineering teachers.  The Wexford Vocational Education Committee had occasion recently to appoint a teacher of electrical engineering and we found it impossible to get what the Minister considered to be a properly qualified teacher.  The man we did get is an excellent man, although he is only on trial at present as far as the Department is concerned.  I suggest that pupils should be encouraged to qualify themselves for positions of that kind. At the moment no such encouragement is given to them.  There should be some definite understanding between the Department and each committee with a view to securing that certain pupils who had an aptitude in that direction are given an opportunity of qualifying to become teachers.  Another branch in which teachers are also scarce, in my opinion, is domestic <Col N="215" /> economy.  Here again there should be some encouragement given to pupils with a view to their qualifying as teachers.</P>
    <P>Another matter in connection with technical education to which I should like to refer is the question of salaries of chief executive officers.  There is a very wide difference between the salaries of C.E.O.s in different places, and I think the time has arrived when there should be some standardisation of salaries of these officers.  There is discontent all over the country because of the fact that there is no standardisation in this connection, and I would suggest to the Minister that in the near future he should see that this standardisation is brought about.  I should like again to request the Minister to take up the question of the restoration of the teachers' cuts, and thereby bring about a better feeling amongst the teachers, which will reflect itself in the schools throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a little nervous in getting up to say anything about this Estimate after all the speeches that have been made.  The debate has left two impressions on my mind.  The first is that, having listened to the speeches here, one does not envy the teachers who are controlled by us and who have to impart knowledge to the children, if they are to pursue the line that has been pursued here.  The second is that one does not envy the children if they take up a lot of the stuff delivered in this House.  Surely the question of the education of the children of the country should be approached in a more tolerant, a more broadminded spirit, than it has been approached in a number of the speeches delivered here this evening. Apparently no consideration at all has been given to that matter.  I should like to think that I gave some thought to the question of the education of the children of this country, but particularly to those children who get nothing but a primary education, and I would consider it highly ignorant on my part to assume anything in the nature of dogmatism in propounding any particular theory with regard to what should or should not be done in connection with education.  It is a very profound subject.  The first Governor-General of this State was approached at one time on the question of education&mdash;or complimented, I do not know which&mdash;and he replied by saying that he did not even know the three Rs; he simply knew the Ten Commandments; those were his laws and those were his education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intolerant tirades have been delivered here this evening in speeches like that of Deputy O Briain, which actually make one give up hope of anything solid, broadminded or tolerant being evolved in this country in regard to primary education which will benefit our children and equip them for the battle of life.  I do not intend to go into that generally.  I am primarily concerned with one matter, and very little attention was paid to it in these speeches.  Before you begin to educate the children you want to have places in which to educate them; hence you <Col N="218" /> require schools.  I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance here, because he is in charge of the school buildings. For four or five years past I have been asking that a survey be made of the primary schools of this State; that they should be analysed, and that we should segregate the number which are utterly uninhabitable from the point of view of being passed by a sanitary inspector or a medical officer of health. Secondly, I want it to be realised that a number of them are beyond repair. The Department, in this patchwork scheme that it follows, is trying to repair places that are utterly beyond repair.  They are attempting to repair schoolhouses which were built over 100 years ago, some of which have never been plastered since, or were not even plastered originally.  Does anybody think that anything can be made out of these places?  If dealt with properly they should have been blown up half a century ago.  Attempts are being made to repair them by sending down half a ton of cement with a man or two to put a trowel full of plaster here and there.  To put it very mildly, a large number of the schoolhouses in my own constituency are a disgrace to the State.  It is really cruel to expect teachers to spend their lives in them. Some of them have spent their lives in them, and only that they were very hardy, robust men they would never have survived it.  What about the children?  There is a campaign to build new houses in order to improve the health of our people, and prevent tuberculosis and other diseases.  The children have to go out in the morning along unsheltered country roads; they go into school drenched with rain, sit in those hovels until evening and then march back home again.</P>
    <P>This is a question to which I should like to address myself.  If the Minister really wishes to do something outstanding for education in this country, I would ask him to take the question of the construction of schools in hands, and to look into what has been done elsewhere with regard to the construction and designing of new schools. There is a considerable improvement in <Col N="219" /> the new schools that are being built. They are an improvement on the old ones, which were just built with a door and a few windows, and were simply places which you could go into and get out of.  Modern school buildings elsewhere are very far beyond that.  In Northern Ireland, both in Belfast and in rural parts, it is simply amazing to see the improvements that there are in the construction of the new schools. Taking my own constituency, which adjoins the Six Counties, certainly the contrast between the schools in the two places is very remarkable.</P>
    <P>There has been a very violent contest here, in a mild way, in regard to Irish.  I think the Minister's speech began it.  He quoted a report from an inspector&mdash;Deputy Dillon made great play with it here last night&mdash;about the results of teaching Irish here in the city, and about the condition in which he found the children, with regard to Irish, after they had left school.  I take it that the inspector knows something about education, and of course one would expect that a man who is educated would know some logic.  I am surprised that, having made the report as to the actual educational position of those children, he did not proceed to seek the cause of it and make suggestions to the Minister.  He is a man employed for that purpose, so he really should apply himself to it, and do something to help the Minister and the Government, and to help this House and the country.  What is the reason that he found the children leaving school to be lacking in a reasonable knowledge of Irish, as he has described them in the report quoted by the Minister in his speech?  Of course the inference to be drawn from that quotation was that the teachers were not fully discharging their duties and were not efficient Irish teachers.  That is at least one inference which can be drawn from that quotation.  I do not know why it was quoted, except as a mere statement thrown in.  You could take it or leave it; take what you liked out of it, or take nothing out of it.  As it was not explained in any way the only inference was that the teachers were failing to give proper <Col N="220" /> instruction in Irish.  That is not so. My children are going to an Irish school, and I must say that their teaching is highly efficient.  I do not think that any slur should be thrown on the teachers. They are devoting their very best talents to teaching Irish to our children, but what is wrong?  When the children cross the school door in the evening they go into an atmosphere that, in the main, is entirely un-Irish. Their parents do not speak Irish, the maid does speak Irish, and the people they meet in the streets or in the parks do not speak Irish.  The papers that come into their homes, the magazines, the picture papers and all the others are all printed in the English language.  Therefore, I say that before Deputy O Briain begins to hurl about his implied slanders he should put forward some constructive suggestions. He seems to be a mad enthusiast.  He gave me the impression of being a carpet bagger in this matter.  He has got all the enthusiasm and intolerance of the carpet bagger.  We did not hear any constructive suggestion from the Deputy to help the teachers who are devoting their best talents to the teaching of Irish in the schools.  What has Deputy O Briain ever done to make the atmosphere outside the school favourable for the spread of a knowledge of the Irish language amongst the children who devote so many hours to its study during school hours? Has he done anything to encourage the production of magazines or pictorial papers in Irish for circulation amongst children?</P>

      <P>I never used the language of my country for Party purposes, and I do not want to do it here.  I am not going to let Deputy O Briain ride rough shod over the House.  I have been in favour of raising the school age in this country for a long time.  I listened to a very remarkable speech this evening from a Deputy who dwelt at considerable length on the question of falling averages.  He then spoke of the impracticability, as it seemed to him, of raising the school age owing, mainly, to the cost.  Surely one thing implies the solution of the other. We all know that in rural Ireland school averages are falling.  It is the opposite in the cities and the towns. Take the position in my county.  The children born in 1934 will be of school-going age in 1941.  The fall in the birth rate there between 1934 and 1941 as against 1927 and 1934, the preceding seven years, will be 9.7, or, shall we say, 10.  Therefore, for the 100 children that are in school in Donegal to-day there will be only 90 there in 1941.  We have got to remember that this fall in the birth rate did not begin in 1934.  In the case of rural Ireland there is plenty of accommodation in the schools for more children, so that if the school age was raised from 14 to 16 the question of falling averages would at once be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the summer time I usually pay a visit to the primary school that I attended in my native county when I was a boy.  The average attendance in the winter time at that school in my boyhood days was between 110 and 120.  Now you have 20 or 30 or perhaps 32 or 34 small children attending that school, their ages ranging from about nine to 12.  In my time many of those attending it were full grown people.  I do not want to be dogmatic in what I am going to say because I think that if one is dogmatic on anything connected with education it is evidence of gross stupidity and ignorance.  The problem of education is one that <Col N="222" /> never has been completely solved and never will be.  What I would like to see the children of this country getting is a good Christian education. Teach them to be good citizens.  Give them instruction in writing and arithmetic, but above all give them a good Christian education.  If they get that, and if we make first-class citizens of them, there will not be much wrong with the State.</P>
    <P>There seemed to be a conflict of opinion, due either to intolerance or different points of view, with regard to the progress being made in the teaching of Irish.  From the speeches delivered here one would infer that there was an attempt to score one off the other.  I think that is a cowardly attitude.  We should approach this on a far broader basis than that.  There may be a weakness about cramming. I am not quite prepared to admit it. Up to ten or 12 years of age are the imitative years for children.  These are the years when it is easy for the child to imitate.  Learning a language being a question of imitation, of repeating sounds, it follows from that that the years of age up to 12, before a child begins to think, are the years when it is easy to learn languages.  But the child only imitates and, therefore, it must hear the language.  It must be used continuously and persistently in order that the child will get a full grasp of it.</P>
    <P>If the results obtained have not been satisfactory, there is clear evidence why the full fruits could not be attained, no matter what the teachers do.  I do not envy the teachers, with politicians and others criticising them. The only benefits they get from the politicians are cuts in their salaries. Then they are asked to make a special effort to make the children bilingual or exclusively Irish-speaking, if possible. I do not admit that that is impossible, but you want time to do it.  We must remember that we are dealing with the average child.  There are children who can lap up anything, who are competent to take up any subject or course and be very good at it, but they are the exceptions.  We must keep in mind that we are dealing with the average <Col N="223" /> child who, in the main, makes the best citizen.  I think it is fatal to think that you are going to put into that child anything approaching what is necessary for a proper education and have it completed at the age of 14.  I think it utterly impossible and fantastic.</P>
    <P>Is there any economic reason why the school-leaving age should not be extended?  As a matter of fact, the economic evidence is all in favour of it &mdash;the economic evidence is coercive on that point.  What is the position to-day?  There is nothing more painful, when travelling up and down the country, than to watch all the boys and girls getting single tickets for England. Why do we send children of 14 away from school when there is no work to be found for them?  They are not wanted at home, so far as work is concerned; there are too many others at home.  The result is that they are leaving the country.  Would it not be better, both from the point of view of the physical and intellectual equipment of our children, seeing that that is the economic position of the country, that we should keep them in the place where they would be made of greater value to the State?  If, ultimately, they have to leave this State to look for a livelihood, they would be better able to earn a living on that account.</P>
    <P>Within the last month I had a striking example of the adverse effect of this.  I got a letter from a young boy who had come up to Dublin from the country thinking that he would find gold on the streets here.  Ultimately he found that gold was not to be found on the streets here, and after some months, he came to me as he understood I could do something for him.  As far as I was concerned it was gladly done.  An application form had to be filled up which contained a whole series of questions of a rather complicated kind.  I was afraid he would get involved in them, and so I filled up that part of the application myself.  I did not want it to be shown that he was not fit to write his name, and I asked him to sign his name to it.  When he had <Col N="224" /> signed his name I was really ashamed to send it on.  This was a boy from the country, where there is a superabundance of labour and where he was not wanted for any purpose. Perhaps he had not been doing anything for two or three years.  Would it not be better for the State, assuming he is remaining here, that that boy should be kept in school until he was 16 or 17 so as to get a decent education and a real grasp of the fundamental subjects?  Then he could go out into the world, and if he was successful and earned money and wanted to improve his education, he would have a really good foundation for it and be able to improve himself. Even if he was not able to do that, if he got a job in which he had to read or write or to count money he would be much better qualified for it.  Instead of that he comes up here at 19 or 20 years of age and is only able to scrawl his name as if he had been only six months at school.</P>
    <P>If the school-leaving age were extended, I think it would solve a lot of your trouble with regard to making this country Gaelic&mdash;if you have any hope of doing it.  There are a lot of thing you must do before you can do that.  Biassed speeches here will not do it.  You have more factors than ever you had working against the Gaelicisation of this country.  You have the Press, you have the radio, and you have the picture house.  You have people who show their intolerance when anybody expresses a helpful conviction or opinion.  These people permit films exclusively in English to be shown in the Gaeltacht, and even school children are permitted to go to them.  Then we are told you are going to Gaelicise the country.  These people who are so intolerant in this matter do not utter one adverse word when that is done. They will criticise Governments and Deputies, of course, as being anti-Irish and trying to put people in the wrong while such pictures are being shown in hovels in the Gaeltacht without a word of Irish in them.  Then we have the radio every night, all in English, which can be availed of in <Col N="225" /> some cheap form or another.  The newspapers are all in English&mdash;even the children's pictorial papers.  If you are going to make this country Gaelic let those who are tolerant and those who are intolerant on the matter buckle themselves down to that.  That is the job which has to be done before we can complete this.</P>
    <P>We are spending the huge sum of £4,570,656 on primary education.  I do not say that we are not getting good results.  I think we are.  Having regard to the age at which children are taken from school, which I submit is far too early, comparing the position now with 40 or 45 years ago, I say that a child of 14 to-day is as well educated as children of the same age were at that period.  Generally speaking, I think the children of to-day are better educated and that the standard of education is now much higher.  To-day the children are learning Irish, English, arithmetic and algebra.  As we are spending £4,250,000 on primary education I think we should not spoil the position because of trifling additional expense.  Many people, particularly in the poorer parts of rural Ireland, are reduced financially to very stringent circumstances.  If the House wishes I will drop the adjective and say that they are in stringent circumstances. Having regard to the number of books that children have to get nowadays, I do not think we should spoil their chances in cases where they cannot procure the necessary books.  It amazes me to see the number of books the children require nowadays.  In my time three or four books and a copy book sufficed.  Now children have as many books as a professor would have. As we are spending millions on education we should not stop at providing text books, note books and exercises.  I suggest that the Minister should approach the Minister for Finance and fight his corner with him for whatever sum would be required to provide free books for children attending primary schools.  Some one will suggest perhaps that free books should not be given to children whose parents could afford to pay for them.  We know what human nature is and that the child of parents <Col N="226" /> who pay for the books might sneer at neighbours who are poor whose children got books free.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it is not logical and not putting things in their true perspective if children are denied books that they require, when we are spending such a huge sum as £4,250,000 on education in a small State like this.  I am sure that every Party in the House would approve of the provision of free books and I suggest that the Minister should take the matter into consideration and should review the amount of money required so that next year there will be provision for giving free books in primary schools without any reservation.  If some parents can afford to pay for the books I am sure they will do so, and will not place the burden on the taxpayers. I think it was Deputy Flynn, from Kerry, who referred to those who broke the law.  When you have people in this House, who are supposed to be legislating for other people, applauding the Minister because he obeys the law it becomes rather embarrassing.  The Deputy's speech consisted purely of a defence of the Minister for Finance for his refusal to restore the cuts that were made in the teachers' salaries because he had made the pension fund solvent. Perhaps it was unknown to the Deputy that the pension fund was created by statute, and that an obligation was placed on the teachers to contribute a certain amount of money, and on the Government to do likewise.  Is the Government now going to come to this House and to plume itself on the fact that it had discharged its statutory duty?  I hope there will be an end to the clap trap about the cuts in salaries. Do not let us have pleading that the Government are doing something that they are bound to do by statute.  I think the teachers have been unfairly treated.  There was a cut of 10 per cent. in 1923, and in 1932, as a result of the economic war, of which they are the victims, another cut of 9 per cent. I am surprised that the teachers have any spirit left to teach our children in <Col N="227" /> the primary schools after the treatment they received from two Irish Governments, seeing that their salaries had been placed on what was supposed to be a reasonable and a fair basis by a foreign Government.  Sometimes one meets &ldquo;die-hards&rdquo; who say that they would like to see the English in control here again.  Many &ldquo;die-hards&rdquo; who talk like that do so without justification, but the national teachers, as a body, would have a good deal of justification in wishing for a return of the British, seeing that in recent years they have received cuts of 19 per cent. in their salaries.  There is every justification for restoring the cuts that have been made.  On reading a report of the proceedings at a meeting of the board of public assistance, held in Dublin, I noticed that one member stated that within the last six months the cost of the essential articles of food has increased from 50 to 100 per cent. If the teachers want justification for their claim, there is justification in that statement, and I make a gift of it to the Department.</P>

      <P>Tar éis a bhfuil ráidhte annseo indiu, níl puinn agam le rá ach is docha go gcaithfidh me rud éigin a rá.  It is a well-known saying that every man thinks he can edit a newspaper, and I suppose every man in this House and perhaps every man outside this House thinks he is a potential educationist.  Judging by all that has been said on the question of education and on the wrongs and woes of teachers and pupils, judging by all those platitudes that have been uttered, one is forced to conclude that some of the Deputies in this House lack little in the matter of their own importance.  We have been so stormed with shot and shell in this House in the last two days that I wonder how anyone has survived the storm and that we have been able to exist at all through it must be a tribute to our powers of endurance. <Col N="228" /> We have heard Deputies Lynch and McMenamin speak.  Deputy Lynch has left the House and I regret it.  Deputy McMenamin's leaving of the House I do not regret because before he left the House I was <i>hors de combat.</i>  We have heard the Deputy expatiating about education until we were quite tired of listening. Deputy Lynch stated that when his Party was in office a cut was imposed on the national teachers.  The Deputy complained bitterly of the state of education.  Deputy McMenamin complained of the state of the school-houses. He said some of them were not plastered and that they were falling to pieces.  Now these two speeches provoke a very pertinent query.  If the schoolhouses are so inadequate as these Deputies now profess to believe they are, and if the cut on the teachers' salaries is so unjust now, one is forced to the query why that cut was imposed and why the schoolhouses were not made more comfortable in the halycon days of the late Government when the people, we are told, were better off and everything was, according to the gospel of Fine Gael, going gaily? At any rate in those days the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did not repair the schools, and they had the audacity and temerity to impose a cut on the teachers.  The position seems a little illogical, but illogicability is the badge of all the tribe of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all sympathise with the national teachers.  We all sympathise not only with them but with every such body of men in the country, but at the same time it is impossible to refrain from thinking that the national teachers are at this moment put up by the Opposition as a sort of electoral war-cry.  My metaphor may be a little mixed but the country will understand it.  As I say we all sympathise with the teachers, but I think the Government is doing what it can, subject to the exigencies of time, circumstance and finance to help them.  I think we are all entitled to assume that.  To think for a moment that the present Minister for Education would be deaf to the legitimate <Col N="229" /> demands of the school teachers or to imagine that he is not as keenly alive to the educational necessities of the country as any Deputy on the Opposition Benches is, I think, absurd.  The national teachers have an excellent case.  Possibly a little more tact in presenting that case may be a help to them.  I make that statement having due regard to the whole facts of the case.  I speak as one who has had a good deal to do with the teachers and one who is connected with them both in relationship and otherwise. But I think that in this matter they have not been as tactful as they might have been.  Possibly that might apply to both sides.  But to think that the Government, which has the overwhelming support of the electorate in the last few years and every promise of having that support continued, is in any way deaf to the demands of the national teachers is straining the bounds of credibility too far.</P>
    <P>With regard to the condition of certain schools that have been mentioned, I will say this, that no doubt there are schools which are inadequate. But time and finance will remedy that.  A miracle cannot be worked over-night in the matter of schoolhouses.  If I wished to make capital out of the state of certain schools in this country I could do so. What I do say is that the elections are looming on the horizon and every possible effort is being used at present to attract votes.  In this connection perhaps I might raise the matter relative to the schoolhouses in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, which I represent.  There is a school in Enniscorthy and we have been pressing the Minister for some time past either to have the school rebuilt or the venue changed.  We have been met very fairly by the Minister in that matter.  People might think that the Ministry was not alive to the gravity of the situation in Enniscorthy. I can speak for them and I know that they are thoroughly alive to the gravity of the situation there especially as it affects the pupils.  The delay in the matter was not due <Col N="230" /> to the Department of Education.  It was owing more or less to the question of title rather than to any other cause.  We all know how tedious is the question of making title in connection with the transfer of land from one body to another.  Although we may have a legitimate grievance in this matter, I want now to put it on record that we do not blame the Ministry for the delay; they were not responsible for it.  I am sure that the Minister will do his best now to expedite this matter as much as it is possible for him to do so. Possibly the Minister may devise some short cut to end the difficulty and solve the problem that is still waiting to be dealt with.  Brevity, it has been said, is the soul of wit, and I have endeavoured on this occasion to be as brief as possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn said deliberately, and no doubt meant to convey to this House, that teachers who were antagonistic to the present Government were forcing this particular campaign for the purpose of using it as a stick with which to beat the Government.  Anybody who is conversant with politics in this country must be amazed at hearing this talk about teachers who are actively interested in politics trying to use this <Col N="231" /> particular question or rather these two questions of cuts and averages against the present Government.  It is notorious that the most aggressive politicians amongst the teaching body in this country are those who are out using, and in some cases, abusing their positions on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Jordan agrees with me.  The Deputy has very good reason to know that.  But when the teachers hold meetings to which members of all parties are invited &mdash;meetings which are attended by teachers who, in the main, as always claimed by Fianna Fáil, are supporters of the present Government, it looks rather strange to be told that the people who attend these meetings use them as political propaganda against the present Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kehoe put it in a different way.  He said that if the teachers had approached this matter in a more tactful way&mdash;I am sorry the Deputy did not explain that a little more, and I wonder what he does mean exactly&mdash;if they had started the agitation through the local Fianna Fáil club&mdash;is that what the Deputy meant?&mdash;they might have done better.  The teachers ceased to be tactful when they stood on their own feet and on the merits of the question and said they were entitled to expect from this Government at least some of the promises they made, the promises made particularly by the Minister for Finance before he became a Minister. They said that at least they hoped these promises would be kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn talked about the Teachers' Pensions Fund.  He talked about Mr. Blythe, the ex-Minister for Finance, taking money from the teachers' organisation.  That, of course, was obviously a slip; apparently the Deputy meant it was taken from the fund.  Deputy Flynn ought to know, as was explained by Deputy Lynch, that the teachers' side of that fund was not only solvent, but that there was a <Col N="232" /> surplus there, and whatever shortage there was it was on the side of the State.  If the State kept up their end of the fund in the same way as the teachers kept their part of the fund, the fund would be quite solvent.  The Deputy seems to forget that the Minister did not make the fund solvent. The Minister took control of the whole fund and, instead of having a fund there, State pensions will be provided. Remember that the teachers not only were expected to contribute their own part of that fund and that they actually had a surplus in it, but attempts were made to justify the cut made by the present Government on the grounds that their pensions were being safeguarded.</P>
    <P>We hear all this talk about politics being introduced.  Deputies on the opposite side of the House, particularly those in close touch with the teachers' organisation and who follow the activities of that organisation, will remember what happened a few years ago when Mr. Blythe was Minister for Finance.  I want to make it quite clear that I hold no brief for anyone now, nor did I at the time the cuts were made by the present Government or the previous Government.  When Mr. Blythe put to the Central Executive Committee of the teachers' organisation a proposal which, from the teachers' point of view, was infinitely better than the one put by the present Minister for Finance, certain very active politicians who are not opponents of the Government started a campaign in this country and drove out of office the Central Executive Committee that was then at the head of the teachers' organisation.  Deputy Rice, who is sitting over there, will probably be able to confirm what I say, and the Deputy knows what happened afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardRice" hpid="Mr. E. Rice Mr. E. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  The teachers made a great mistake at that time, because they accepted Mr. Blythe's offer of a 5 per cent. cut to settle the pensions question. They assembled in Dublin at a special congress for that purpose.  That was the first and the greatest mistake the teachers made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="233" />
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on that, certain very active politicians, active on the side of the present Government, started a campaign in this country to drive out of office the central executive committee that had accepted terms which, from the teachers' point of view, were superior to the terms afterwards imposed by the present Minister for Finance.  We have members of that Party now talking about using this as a political weapon with which to beat the Government.  Deputy Kehoe believes in the teachers and he believes in the Minister.  He has wonderful faith. The teachers, he said, had his intense sympathy and he is quite satisfied the Minister will not inflict any injury. So far as I know, the teachers do not want the sympathy of any member of this House or any member of the Government.  They want what they call justice, and they are entitled to get that.  If they are not entitled to that they are not entitled to the Deputy's sympathy; either they have a good case or they have not.</P>
      <P>The teachers ought to be the best judges of their own business.  They say they merely want to be treated in a fair and just way.  They want to be put, not in a position superior to other State servants or superior to the positions occupied by teachers in the North of Ireland or in Great Britain; they want to be put at least on a par with those persons, not to be treated as inferior to the teachers in the North or in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone in the House will disagree with me when I say there is an urgent necessity for dealing with the question of averages. I do not think any person, no matter what his views may be regarding the teachers as a body or considering it from the angle whether the teachers' salaries are adequate or inadequate, will agree that this State should go on spending money sending students to training colleges to be turned into teachers, then to find that they have no schools.  Not only that, but it so happens that many of those who have been trained at considerable expense and who have gained years <Col N="234" /> of experience in schools, are now thrown, so to speak, on the scrap heap, with very little hope of getting schools again.  That is a very undesirable state of affairs so far as the teachers and the country are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow other Deputies into the question of the teaching of Irish, and as to whether the teaching methods are right or wrong.  I confess I do not know Irish very well.  In my own small way in later years I did as much as I could to try to get a grasp of it and, in so far as I can, see to it that my own children get a better opportunity of learning the language than I got.  There is this to be said, that there is very little, if any, opposition&mdash;certainly there is no opposition that could be called reasonable&mdash;to the teaching of Irish in the schools as a subject; but there is grave doubt in the minds of many people as to the wisdom of teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>The words to which I am about to give expression are words which have been spoken to me, and I dare say they have been spoken to other Deputies, by the man in the street, the parents of the children.  The first question you are asked is this: how many of the teachers are themselves competent to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish?  If the Minister is in a position to let us have it, I would like him to give the information. It is a very straight question, and I submit it is a question to which the House and the country are entitled to get an answer.  The statements are made that many of the teachers are not competent to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish.  We must realise that this extra activity, this extra push of Irish, came, so far as many of the teachers are concerned, when they were too old to be able to get a sufficient grasp of it to enable them to teach through its medium. You cannot blame the teachers.  It is well known that many elderly or middle-aged teachers were driven grey on this question of Irish.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken by anybody in or outside the House as being <Col N="235" /> in any way antagonistic to the Irish language.  I have stated my own personal position clearly.  I do say that the best work that could be done for the fostering of the Irish language would be for the Minister to make the position clear by being able to satisfy the parents of the children that those who are charged with the task of teaching the children not only the Irish language but other subjects through the medium of Irish are competent to do so; in other words, that their children are not being practised upon.</P>
    <P>Now that, as I say, is the position as I see it, but I do hope that if there are to be any other speakers from the other side of the House, we will not have any more charges about this agitation of the teachers for the restoration of the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; in their salaries, or about the question of averages, as being a political stunt, which I presume, according to what has been said, is being worked and fostered on behalf of Fine Gael.  I may say that I should like to think that Fine Gael had the support of the majority of the teachers of this country.  I should like to be able to think that, because it would be a sign that the people are beginning to realise that the promises that were made are not being kept and are not likely to be kept; and it must be said to the credit of those who are in charge of the Fianna Fáil propaganda that they have succeeded, not only in &mdash;I do not like to use the word &ldquo;fooling,&rdquo; but, let us say, in deceiving, not alone the ordinary farmer, and to a certain extent the ordinary worker, but even the people who are supposed to have a somewhat better education than the ordinary man in the street, and I think it is a good thing to have it, even on the authority of Deputy Flynn and Deputy Kehoe, that the teachers are swinging around to Fine Gael, and that they are able to organise an agitation in that way which might be of help to Fine Gael.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have listened to a fairly large number of speeches on these Estimates. I am only sorry that most of the speeches were comparatively worthless. Some of them dealt with the programme in respect to the teaching of Irish in the schools.  We have been listening to such speeches for years past and I am not going to weary the House by repeating arguments used quite recently when a motion in the name of Deputy MacDermot was under <Col N="238" /> discussion in the House.  I explained then, and I might repeat the statement for Deputy Morrissey's information, that it is not the policy of the Department that teachers who are not qualified, in the view of the inspectorate, to teach through Irish should do so.  I said in my speech yesterday that we had carried out the policy laid down in the circular of 1930, and that recently we had again called the attention of inspectors to that matter.  If there are teachers attempting to teach through Irish who are not qualified to do so, they are certainly doing it against the wishes of the Department and at variance with the programme as laid down.  Moreover, if the work of such teachers should come under the observation of the inspectors, as it is bound to, it would be the duty of the inspectors to call their attention to the fact that, in our view, they are not qualified to do this work.  I have made that quite clear.  I think it is clearly understood by all who are connected with the administration of education but apparently it is not understood in the Dáil, although I have repeated it several times here, nor is it understood in the country.  A great deal of misrepresentation has been going on.</P>
    <P>It has to be understood, while that is the position, that we have been expecting teachers to endeavour to do what they can to carry out the policy of the Department.  If they were unable, in our view, to teach through Irish, we expected them to use Irish as much as possible and as far as they are able in connection with the ordinary work of the school.  I gave an account also in my speech of the numbers of teachers who have got certificates of one kind or another.  Of the total number, 6.5 per cent. have the Árd Teastas.  I think all these teachers would be qualified to teach practically the full programme through Irish.  We have, in addition, 47.6 per cent. who have the bi-lingual certificate.  I think a great number, if not all, of these should be qualified&mdash;I would not be in a position to say definitely that they would be all qualified in the view of the inspectors &mdash;to teach through Irish, to some degree.  Of course, teachers may be able to teach some subjects through <Col N="239" /> Irish satisfactorily, and not teach others but, according to these figures, it would appear that about 50 per cent. approximately of the teachers should be in a position to teach through Irish.</P>
    <P>As is usual, when these Estimates are under discussion I have been asked to interview my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to making moneys available for certain developments that Deputies consider would be very useful and very necessary in education.  For example, I have been advised to approach the Minister for Finance with reference to the matter of the cut in the teachers' salaries.  I am not quite clear whether it is the cut imposed by the present Government in connection with the settlement of the pension fund problem or whether I am expected to interview the Minister for Finance with a view to getting him to restore, not only that particular cut, but also the cut imposed by the last Government and bring the situation back to what it was in 1920, so far as the teachers' salaries are concerned. I regret that I cannot see my way to approach the Minister for Finance in this matter.  In spite of the great interest that has been taken by Deputies in the teachers' case for a restoration of their salary cuts, and in spite of the appeals that have been made to-day in the House, I feel that I cannot use whatever influence I have in that regard, the reason being that the Government has explained quite clearly, and as I think the country understands, what their position is with regard to this matter of the teachers' salaries.</P>
    <P>When we came into office there was there to be settled the question of the teachers' pensions fund which had become seriously deficient from an actuarial point of view.  Its position financially was becoming very much worse each year that went by.  The problem had been unsolved by our predecessors. They had made a certain offer to the teachers which, as has been pointed out during the discussion in this House, was in fact accepted by the teachers at one stage, though afterwards rejected by them.  We went fully into the question with the <Col N="240" /> teachers' representatives when we became the Government.  We made them a certain offer, an offer which was certainly better than that made by our predecessors, as would be natural to expect from a Government of our generous instincts.  We were unable nevertheless, to get the teachers to agree to that notwithstanding the circumstances of the pensions fund and the likelihood that if that position were to continue&mdash;the fund steadily becoming worse and actuarially insolvent&mdash;they would eventually, within a few years, be left without any pensions.  We could not persuade them to accept, and to recommend to their colleagues and their organisation, the 9 per cent. cut with certain adjustments, and a 6 per cent. cut in the case of junior assistant mistresses, who were brought in, to settle up the pensions fund problem.</P>
    <P>An appropriate resolution was subsequently carried in this House and I explained the position fully at the time.  Different views were expressed at the time but in any case the House implemented that resolution and the settlement became effective, with the result that at the present time, while the main body of the teachers have suffered a 9 per cent. cut, the State has to provide about £388,000 per annum, a sum which will increase yearly until it reaches a figure eventually of £500,000 annually, in respect of charges for teachers' superannuation. I do not see any prospect of the Government's reopening that question at this stage.  It has to be admitted that a share, whether the whole of the 9 per cent. or some lesser amount, must go in the form of a pension contribution.  Although there was an element of economy in the 9 per cent. cut, nevertheless the cut itself was and is an essential part of the pensions fund settlement that we introduced, and for which we got the sanction of the Dáil.  I do not think that there is any possibility of the Government reopening the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>In any case I am inclined to agree with my friend Deputy Kehoe that perhaps the case which is being made for the teachers by the Opposition <Col N="241" /> Party is not quite so strong when we have regard to the fact that the cut which they were prepared to make, and which they offered as a settlement in their time, was 10 per cent. It seems extraordinary, as has been pointed out during the discussion, when the country is in such a serious state financially, according to the Opposition, that we should be expected to go very much further now. As I said, we have already done better than our predecessors in regard to the settlement.  That we should be expected now to restore the whole of the 9 per cent., and not alone that but actually to go back to the 1920 position, because that is what is being put up to us, is simply incomprehensible, and can only be explained by reference to the fact that we are on the eve of a general election.  I think a good many of the teachers themselves realised that the campaign for the reopening of that pensions fund settlement was not likely to succeed. Without attempting to suggest that the teachers have not a perfect right to make their case to the country, and to get support for it wherever they wish, we have explained that we are not prepared to reopen the question at the present time, and that is how the matter stands.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the falling averages, the fall in the numbers of the enrolments and the averages in the schools, particularly in the rural areas, has been going on for some years.  I explained to the House in my opening speech that we were taking certain steps with regard to reducing the number of teachers, reducing the number of candidates in the training colleges, refusing recognition to teachers trained in Great Britain, and reducing the number of junior assistant mistresses, for example, in order that we may eventually reduce the supply of teachers to equal the demand.  But that, as has been pointed out during the discussion, merely covers the question of the entry of new teachers into the teaching profession; it does not cover the question of the existing teachers. That, however, has also been under consideration for a very long time. <Col N="242" /> When it was brought under my notice some years ago we examined the question as it then appeared, and as a result we brought certain revised rules into operation on 1st January, 1935, which eased the position for teachers whose positions were threatened, and we showed that we realised the need for amelioration of the conditions then existing.  Under those revised regulations grants are not withdrawn from assistant teachers and junior assistant mistresses until the average attendance has fallen below the figure for their retention for four consecutive quarters, and such teachers with at least ten years' service are allowed to retain their positions in a redundant capacity for a number of additional quarters, according to their length of service, to a maximum of six quarters, to enable them to secure positions in other schools.</P>
    <P>The position, however, has since become more acute.  The numbers on the rolls of the schools in the rural areas, particularly in the counties on the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry and Cork, continue to show a decline which has been gradually developing for eight or nine years, and which present indications suggest will continue for some time longer.  I need hardly say in this connection that I fully realise the educational effect of the condition of doubt and uncertainty in which teachers are placed who find themselves in a precarious position owing to falling averages, and the increasing number of teachers likely to be affected has had my serious consideration. In the consideration of the whole issue I have been in consultation with the Minister for Finance, and although I cannot at the moment make a definite statement, Deputies may be assured that anything which the State can reasonably be expected to do to meet the situation will be done.  I have no doubt that with the co-operation of the managers, which, from recent public pronouncements, I am quite sure will be gladly forthcoming, a means will be found in the near future for easing the situation. I believe that if we had an arrangement under which teachers who are in danger or on the point of losing their positions owing to falling averages <Col N="243" /> would be listed for appointment to other schools as vacancies arise, the problem would be found to be much easier of solution.</P>
    <P>Another matter that was referred to was the question of the school leaving age.  Deputy O'Sullivan seems to think that relative to our total State expenditure our Estimates for education are possibly not as high as they were ten years ago.  That may be, but there are items under certain of the other Votes which pertain closely to education, although I have no responsibility for them, such as the school meals scheme, the provision of milk for children, and the county medical services. If the proportion of national expenditure to education seems to be smaller than it has been, the reason is that there has been a great increase in social services which are at least as worthy of attention and as worthy of Government assistance as schemes for educational development.  Whenever I have made a case for additional financial aid for educational services or auxiliary services I have always been met very fairly, and if I have not been met fairly it has been, I think, generally because of some weakness in the case which has been put up.  With regard to the school leaving age, the House is aware that the committee which was appointed to investigate the question of raising the school leaving age reported in favour of experiments in this direction in specially selected centres.  It was the view of this committee that those experiments were necessary before it was possible to say with any degree of confidence that it was wise to raise the school leaving age generally.  Last year I announced the intention of the Government to conduct experiments in accordance with the recommendations of the committee, and I informed the Technical Education Congress in Drogheda last June that I was prepared to commence in the Drogheda area, which seemed to my Department to be specially suited to the purpose.  Owing to the regrettable death of the chief executive officer of the Drogheda Vocational Education Committee, on whose valuable experience much of the success of the experiment depended, I was compelled to <Col N="244" /> postpone action in this area.  Early in the current session I communicated with the City of Cork Committee, which expressed its willingness to cooperate with my Department, and it is accordingly proposed to apply Part V of the Vocational Education Act to the city area as from 1st September next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister for a second?  I was present at that meeting, and I should like to know whether you got any communication from the Cork City Vocational Committee in which they asked who would bear the expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have been in communication with the committee, and I think the question of who will bear the expense has not been finally determined, but the intention is to proceed to apply Part V of the Vocational Education Act to the city area as from 1st September next, provided no insuperable difficulty as regards finance arises.  The effect of this will be that for the first year every boy and girl in the City of Cork who is under 15 years of age will be obliged to attend a suitable school or a suitable course of instruction, and for the second and following years the same will apply to every boy and girl under 16 years of age.  In preparation for this change in September a very careful survey has been made of existing educational conditions in Cork and a close estimate has been obtained of the number of additional young persons for whom educational facilities must be provided.  The arrangements for the change are well in hand, and I am confident that the Cork Vocational Education Committee will use its utmost endeavour to secure the success of this valuable educational effort not only in the interests of its own area but also as a pioneer effort in the general interest of education in the Saorstát. Further experiments must depend as to their location and scope on the results of these two or three that are immediately contemplated, and I am entirely opposed to any general application of the raising of the school-leaving age until there is sufficient data to justify such action and supply my Department with the information that is essential to success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> May I point out in that connection to Deputy Anthony that the raising of the school-leaving age, since it will mean that the boys and girls to whom it applies will attend either a vocational or a post-primary school normally, will not be of much benefit, I fear, to the national schools.  The consensus of educational opinion, as I have pointed out before in the House, is that at the age of eleven <i>plus</i> a child should be transferred from the primary to the post-primary school.  So that if we were to raise the school-leaving age, and still keep our children in the national schools, we would be flying in the face of educational policy and opinion as laid down in practically every civilised country.  It is essential that at that age, or as soon as possible after, a child should be transferred to an entirely new school, to an entirely new environment, and entirely new teachers.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of school buildings.  I dealt with that fairly comprehensively in my statement.  I have only to add that the question of the provision of suitable accommodation in the new areas in Dublin is being carefully considered at the present time.  In the rural areas and the smaller towns and villages undoubtedly a good deal remains to be done.  We are obtaining a census of defective school buildings from the inspectors, and arrangements have been made with the Department of Local Government and Public Health for the furnishing of detailed particulars as to the sanitary condition of school-houses by the medical officers of health.  I should, perhaps, mention that there is undoubtedly great difficulty in that managers find it extremely difficult, in a great many cases, to collect local funds towards the building or reconstruction or maintenance of schools.  They have to depend on voluntary appeals to the people, and, owing to various causes, these appeals do not in many instances meet with a sufficiently adequate response.</P>
    <P>It is the custom of the Department to give special additional grants, called excess grants, in the poorer areas and in the more congested areas <Col N="246" /> we have in a good many cases borne the total cost of building new school-houses ourselves.  Nevertheless, we find it necessary, having regard to financial exigencies and certain limitations which are placed upon ourselves, to see that a substantial local contribution is raised in nearly all cases.  The local contribution depends on the circumstances, but in the poorer areas a smaller contribution is asked for.  The manager, of course, has to provide the site.  In certain cases, having done that, all that we ask from him is that he should provide the sand and stone and materials.  But we have not held up a building, in so far as it was possible to avoid holding up any worthy case, by reason of a small difference in amount between that suggested from ourselves and that offered by the manager.</P>
    <P>Any proposals that come to the Department for building or reconstruction are pushed forward, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will be able to tell the House that the Board of Works has been working at exceptional pressure in order to deal with cases.  As an illustration of what we have been doing I can tell the House that since 1932 grants, amounting in the aggregate to £874,000, were made for the erection of 195 new school-houses, the enlargement or extensive reconstruction of 131 existing schools and the execution of minor works of improvement in over 1,100 cases.  If Deputies have cases in mind in which they are interested, where there seems to be unusual delay, I would be glad if they would write to me and call my attention to the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of large classes in schools has been referred to by several Deputies.  We have examined the question.  I pointed out that even in the Dublin metropolitan area there is at present a great fall in the attendances at the schools in the centre of the city due to the movement of population outwards.  We believe that the number of genuine cases of overcrowding is very small, and that in almost all cases which have been examined, where an unduly large class or classes seem to exist, these are due to defective <Col N="247" /> organisation or unsuitable grouping, which can be remedied.  Reference has been made to the heating and cleaning grants.  We have already announced that, as from the present financial year, that grant will be increased from the sum at which it stands and which appears in the Estimate at £14,000 approximately to £65,000, but as the recoupment to the managers will not be made until next year, although the grant will operate from the 31st March of the present year, the figure of £65,000 does not appear in the Estimates.  Nevertheless, the increase, as I have said, will operate for this financial year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Good and Deputy Costello referred to the question of finding employment for juveniles.  The Juvenile Advisory Board is not a board over which I have any control.  I understand its powers come more properly within the ambit of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have explained, when speaking on technical education questions in the country on several occasions, that it is not the function of the teachers or instructors in vocational or technical schools to find employment for students.  No guarantee of employment can be given to students, but I know that, particularly in the large schools here in Dublin, and I have no doubt the same practice holds down the country, every effort is made by headmasters&mdash;some of them are particularly energetic&mdash;in endeavouring to find employment for their students, both boys and girls. There is no regular way in which employment can be found except by individual initiative.  With regard to the question of apprenticeship, there are apprenticeship committees set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce in a number of trades, and on those committees technical interests and technical schools are represented. In that way there should be a definite bridging and connection established between the work in the technical schools and the work of the trades. How that will affect the question of getting additional apprentices, where necessary, into trades is a matter that does not concern me.  It could be more profitably addressed to the Minister <Col N="248" /> for Industry and Commerce.  As Deputy Costello himself fully realises, the trade union regulations governing apprenticeship will have an important bearing on that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the question of domestic economy in our schools and I agree fully with his remarks.  I doubt whether we can stress sufficiently the need which exists for giving the fullest possible courses of instruction in household management in our schools, nor can we dwell too often on the importance of this and allied subjects for girl pupils.  No matter what position in life a girl may be called upon to fill, she will need to have a thorough grasp of the principles and practice of housecraft. It should be quite clear to girls from working-class homes and their parents that the domestic economy classes are at least of as great importance, possibly of more importance, to them as to others.  I should like to urge upon working-class parents that they should see that their daughters take full advantage of the facilities afforded by the vocational schools throughout the country.  I believe that the committees are doing as much as ever they can, within their resources, to extend the facilities for such instruction.</P>
    <P>I think that domestic economy also is taught in most of our big convent schools and in many other girls' national schools.  I know that some of the convent schools are doing excellent work in training girls for domestic service, and I hope that wherever possible such work will be undertaken by our convent schools. We have recently appointed three additional domestic economy organisers for national schools, making a total of nine such organisers, and I hope as a result of their work, and of such other steps as the Department may consider necessary, there will be better provision in our schools in future for this type of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister include needlework in the definition of domestic economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and laundry. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the matter of the emigration of girls to <Col N="249" /> Great Britain.  There are, in my view, better opportunities for girls in domestic employment in this country now than at any time heretofore, and the conditions of employment in domestic service here are likely to improve.  Homes are more comfortable and more easily run, a great deal of the slavish work done in former days has disappeared, and wages have risen.  Unfortunately, a great many girls, who seem to be unfitted for other types of employment, look down on domestic service. They consider such work to be nothing better than slavery.  I consider this to be an altogether wrong impression which parents and others who are interested should dispel.  It may very often be the duty of such parents, or of such others interested, to encourage those girls who are suitable for such employment to undertake it. If a domestic does her work properly she need never be out of employment. There is no question nowadays of a girl being driven to accept unsuitable work.  The difficulty, as the House knows, is to get even partly trained girls at the present time.  I believe that the conditions and pay of a trained domestic in a good home in Ireland compare favourably with any other class of employment that would normally be open to such girls. I doubt very much also whether it is either the pay or the conditions of employment here, or both, which are responsible for girls going to England.</P>
      <P>I think that covers all the main points and the more important questions raised by Deputies.  As I have said, if there are particular matters regarding individual schools in which Deputies are interested, I would be glad if they would call my personal attention to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the advisability of changing the school hours in certain areas? I do not mean country areas or districts where children have to walk four of five miles to school, because I realise that in wet weather it would be much better for the children not to have to undertake such journeys <Col N="250" /> four times.  But take a district like Cork City, where I think the change might be made with advantage.  The school hours there might be from 10 until 1 o'clock, with a break from 1 o'clock until 3 o'clock, and then go on from 3 to 5 o'clock. That system has been in operation in England for a long number of years and has been found to be successful. Complaints are fairly general about the long fast for the children going to school.  I should like to know if the Minister has considered that aspect of the question, and whether any representations have been made to him about the change of hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent a manager who is interested in this matter from making other arrangements with regard to school hours. The Department of Education have preserved a neutral attitude in the matter.  Representations have been made to me and, personally, I have no objection whatever to experiments being tried.  But from inquiries we have made in some of the Dublin schools I feel that parents would be by no means unanimous as to the advantages of changing the school hours and enabling the children to go home for a meal in the middle of the day.  There is the problem of avoiding traffic and there is the problem of the working-class household where the mother might prefer that the children should come home finally when they do come home, at three o'clock normally, and have their lunch then.  In any case, there is no unanimity of opinion in the matter.  It seems to me that to have a general arrangement applicable both to city and country would not work very well.  Each individual school has its own particular problems and the only way in which we can ever come to a final decision on the matter, apparently, is that some manager, who is sufficiently interested in giving the longer interval in the middle of the day, should make the necessary arrangements in his own school.  If we had one or two such experiments we would then be able to ascertain what value there is in the suggested change for the school population generally.</P>

I can assure the Minister that the Cork City Vocational Education Committee are prepared to co-operate to the fullest extent with the Minister within the limits of their capacity to pay.  There was no objection raised; the only snag we saw was the question of expense. We are taxed to the limit so far as vocational education is concerned.  I agree that the experiment would be a very good and useful one.</P>

      <P>No.  The arrangement last year was to take No. 69 as a separate Vote.  There is a slight difficulty in the matter.  There is included in Vote 10 a sum of £18,000 for the expenses of the staff of the special division which looks after these particular <Col N="254" /> works, but there is a payment in (a) which is credited to that from Vote 69 to pay the whole of the expenses. I mean, that £18,000 merely appears there for convenience, and that we would be in an awkward position if we were to discuss that because we could only discuss the staff.  All these matters will come up on Vote 69, and an assurance is given that there will be a free discussion of all elements of the Vote.  There is, in addition, another Estimate, No. 27, which has generally been taken separately, but as far as I am concerned I see no objection to the three Votes being discussed together if the House so desires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; we will keep them separate, and Deputy Corry can make his speech now.  On Vote No. 10 in 1937-38 a net sum of £117,006 is provided, being an increase of £4,065 on the provision for 1936-37.  The increase this year is due to the following causes: (a) an increase in the sanctioned personnel is reflected in an increase of £19,955 in the provision for salaries, which also makes provision for a rise in the cost-of-living bonus; the additional staff is necessary to deal with the extended activities of the commissioners; (b) a consequential increase of £1,750 in the provision for travelling expenses and £ 150 for incidental expenses, telegrams and telephones. Against these increases must be off-set an additional £17,780 to be recovered as Appropriation-in-Aid. This increase is largely due to the intention to recover from Vote 69 the cost of the administration expenses of employment schemes.  That refers to the salaries and expenses of the staff. Vote 11 refers to the works themselves. The provision in 1936-37 was £832,400 and the provision for this year is £977,536 showing a net increase of £145,136.  This increase is largely covered by the larger provision that is made under sub-head B for new works, alterations and additions.  On this sub-head alone there is an increase of £179,342 on the amount provided last year.  As Deputies are aware a <Col N="255" /> large variety of works is provided for under the sub-head and naturally the works to be done vary from year to year.  This year a sum of £150,000 is provided for work on the Shannon Airport and £70,000 at Collinstown. Otherwise the variations under sub-head B are more or less normal.  Under sub-head F, Fuel, Light, Water and Cleaning, there is an increased provision of £4,450 which is due partly to the increased price of turf in Dublin, and the increased price of anthracite coal. Under sub-head J (4) there is an increase of £3,250.  The object of the sub-head was to provide funds for the Barrow Drainage Board to carry out works of maintenance during the first year in which the district will be in their charge.  It was hoped that the final award would have been issued before the 31st March, 1937, but, as it was not possible to do this, there will be no expenditure this year under this sub-head.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head A, Purchase of Sites and Buildings, there is a decrease of £13,230, which is really casual, as the expenditure to be met under this sub-head must necessarily vary from year to year in accordance with State requirements.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head C there is a reduction of £14,569, which is largely due to the fact that fewer buildings, for the maintenance of which the Commissioners are responsible, fall due for painting in 1937-38, and also it is expected that fewer works of special maintenance will arise.</P>
      <P>Under sub-head J (2), Arterial Drainage, there is a reduction of £9,923.  Deputies will appreciate that the provision under this sub-head must necessarily vary from year to year in accordance with the rate at which schemes under investigation mature for execution.  This year the reduction is accounted for by the fact that it is expected that a lesser amount of money can be spent during the coming year, as a lesser quantity of work can be carried out on matured schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reduction of £6,990 under sub-head J (3), Barrow Drainage, where only a token provision of £10 is made. This token provision was made in <Col N="256" /> anticipation of the fact that the final award would have been issued before the 31st March, 1937; as this was not, in fact, done, there will probably be excess expenditure under this sub-head, which will no doubt be met from savings on other portions of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head L, Appropriations-in Aid, there is a decrease of £6,835. These are made up of various sums received in respect of rents, fines, harbour dues, sales of old materials, hire of excavators to drainage districts, hire of dredgers, sales of farm and garden produce, etc., etc.  The decrease this year is largely due to a reduction in the anticipated contribution from the Vote for property losses compensation.  As I have already told Deputies, provision is made for administrative expenses in connection with employment schemes.  The actual position is that all expenditure on administrative expenses is borne primarily on this Vote, but is later recovered from Vote 69, Employment Schemes.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to discuss this Vote in general, but there is one particular matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. I think he is probably fully acquainted with the details already.  It is in connection with arterial drainage.  I gather that it was the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to set up a commission to investigate the whole problem of drainage, arterial drainage particularly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not. I think I made it quite clear at the beginning that I did not assume that the Parliamentary Secretary was at all ignorant of the particular cases that I might bring forward in support of the urgency.  I gathered from his various answers and the different replies sent from his Office to various bodies in the country, that already this question had been elaborately, or shall I say, fully considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee.  I understand that the Inter-Departmental Committee was appointed to consider useful work, and I consider that one of the works was drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Strange to think that the county councils have been advised to the opposite&mdash;that this whole question of drainage was put before the Inter-Departmental Committee who were most anxious to find useful works that would benefit the country and give employment.  I used to be under the impression that there were two particular classes of work that would give employment with correspondingly little expense in anything else except labour.  These were roads and arterial and other drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I had occasion to bring under his notice and also under the notice of his Department the case of two drainage schemes in my native county. I give these as illustrations.  I fear that one particular case may be an illustration of what occurred elsewhere and so I should recommend it to the earnest attention of the Parliamentary Secretary because I am convinced that an entirely impossible position has been created there.  If that is in any way typical of drainage schemes that have been carried out by his Department, I hold strongly that the Department should look into the matter.  I am not now advocating legislation&mdash;I am not allowed to do so by the rules of the House.  I am asking the Minister to get this case examined and if portion of his departmental work is the setting up of this committee, I am putting it to him that first of all the matter is extremely urgent and <Col N="258" /> secondly, most useful and valuable evidence could be got from this and similar cases if there are any other such cases.  One particular case I have in mind is that of the Akeragh Lough drainage.  The scheme was actually undertaken and carried out by the Board of Works.  There was the usual contribution from the State and the usual contribution from the local authority.  Then there was the repayment of the balance by way of an annuity charge.  Now I am sorry to say that I have not the figures with me at the moment but quoting from memory, which I think is fairly accurate, it was estimated in that particular case that the annual improvement to the lands amounted to £332; leaving out of account altogether the amount contributed by the State, and the amount contributed by the county council, the annuity charge on the farmers whose lands were supposed to be benefited to that extent amounted to £232.  So far everything seemed plain sailing.  Considering the condition of Akeragh Lough district at the moment I had, perhaps, better avoid metaphors of that kind.  There was in 1934 what looked like a large charge for maintenance, especially for the first year, of £54.  The next year, 1935, the maintenance charge plus the annuity charge brought the whole sum that had to be made up by the farmers to over £510, although the estimated benefit to their lands at the very beginning was only £332 a year.  Now two things follow; first that it is extremely unreasonable and very unjust to expect any body of farmers to pay, with patience, over £500, a sum largely in excess of even the estimated improvements. I say that that is an intolerable position, but that is one of the results; secondly, I think that these figures do show this: that if in the second year the maintenance charge was £278, sufficient, therefore, to bring the charge on the unfortunate farmers to nearly £200 over the estimated benefit, it is obvious that in the second year in which the county council had charge of the scheme, the scheme had already hopelessly broken down.  That gives a great deal of colour, indeed it completely substantiates the complaint <Col N="259" /> of the farmers that they have got very little, if any, benefit out of it.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think what occurred was this.  Possibly some of the people in the higher lands of that drainage district do continue to get a certain amount of benefit&mdash;though very slight. I think for those in the lower lands the benefit has already ceased.  The drainage district, so far as the lower portion of the district is concerned, has, in fact, reverted to the position that it was in before the work was done. Therefore, instead of getting an annual benefit of £332, as they were led to believe, the farmers of the whole district will be very lucky indeed if even at this early stage in its history they get an annual benefit of £50 out of the scheme.  In return for that they are asked to foot a bill in one year over £500 and in the next year £418.  I am not now speaking of the first year, where the figure was somewhere slightly short of the alleged improvement.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious there is something radically wrong there.  The Parliamentary Secretary may reply to me that once the Board of Works said they had done the work and handed it over to the county council, its functions were finished.  I am quite aware I am not allowed here to advocate a change of the law, but surely it must be obvious to the Parliamentary Secretary that either the scheme has completely broken down or that the character of what is called maintenance work is really not maintenance work in the proper sense at all, but is a re-conditioning, a re-making of the scheme&mdash;it cannot be ordinary maintenance work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know perfectly well the difficulty of dealing with schemes where the tide is concerned, and I know the difficulty of making an estimate.  I do not want to make any <i>ex parte</i> case whatsoever; I want to put the plain facts forward, and endeavour to show the absolutely intolerable position that is there created for those people who are asked to meet a rate sometimes over £500 and sometimes close on £500 annually.  They are asked to meet that year after year, and will be asked to meet it apparently for the next 35 years for a work that they are convinced, <Col N="260" /> and it seems to me properly convinced, gives them no satisfactory return, indeed, hardly any return at all. That is not a reasonable position.</P>
    <P>Again, commissions are well-known methods of delaying dealing with urgent matters, and even if a commission is on the brink of being set up, it must take some time to investigate. Even when commissions do investigate, governments take some time to consider what they will do with reports of that kind.  Then possibly legislation will be necessary, and I cannot see anything in the way of relief coming to this particular body of men for the next five or six years, if they have to await the report of a commission.  I do not know how many other cases there are of that particular kind in Ireland. I mean cases in which the maintenance charge, plus the annuity, amounts to more annually than the alleged benefit. Whether there are any other cases or not, I think that the Board of Works could accede to the request of the local councils to examine such districts. I know of no law preventing them from doing so.  It does not require legislation surely to enable the Board of Works to oblige a council, especially when you are dealing with an intolerable case of that kind.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that, in the case of the Akeragh Lough district, what is included under the head of maintenance possibly is not what is generally looked upon as maintenance by the engineers of the Board of Works.  It was probably something not contemplated as maintenance by the engineers when they were forming their estimate and when they handed over that scheme. It is something in the nature of new work, re-conditioning, pretty much the same as has been undertaken year after year by the Board of Works, when, for instance, old schemes not properly looked after for years are being brought up to date.  There you had practically the old scheme dealt with to a certain extent as if it was a fresh scheme.</P>
    <P>In the case of old schemes, that is understandable enough.  They were neglected year after year.  But here there is no question of neglect.  With the best will in the world the county council could not neglect it, and the <Col N="261" /> amount they have expended shows there was no tendency to neglect. The scheme has broken down&mdash;and thoroughly broken down&mdash;and it would be most unreasonable to expect these men to face that charge without any hope of alleviation for the next five or six years.  Is it reasonable even to ask them to pay the charges already assessed?</P>
    <P>Two steps would seem to me to be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to take.  The first is to get the scheme immediately investigated, to see why it is that in the year 1936 it took £300 to maintain that scheme, or something close to that amount; and the second is to regard this and possibly other schemes &mdash;if there are any such that in the same way inflict intolerable burdens on the people, schemes that are, in their eyes, manifestly unjust&mdash;as exceptional cases and come to their help, as the Parliamentary Secretary in another capacity can come to their help: let him meet it out of the Vote for relief works.  I do not know, as the law stands, of any other way in which he can help at the moment &mdash;perhaps some other Department can.</P>
    <P>You have a position in which the farmers feel they are most unjustly treated.  I know that the engineers were perfectly open and that they tried to give the best estimate they could.  I know the difficulties of estimating in cases of rivers of that kind.</P>
    <P>But the fact remains that the farmers are told that the alleged benefit will be £332 and that that benefit will be a real benefit.  Then they find in the lower portions that the flooding is as bad as ever, and when they find this heavy maintenance charge has to be met they naturally feel that they were, in voting for that scheme&mdash;unintentionally no doubt&mdash; seriously misled.  There may be the feeling that they were misled, that they were not misled in the sense that anybody wanted to mislead them, but that they were misled in the sense that the prophecy, the estimate given to them, proved completely wrong. That is one case and I am afraid there may be other cases in the Saorstát like that.  I know that particular <Col N="262" /> case very well and I have suggested two methods by which the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department could come to the relief of the people.</P>
    <P>The other case I have in mind is in a neighbouring district.  Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary will say that what I have said about the Akeragh district will make him a bit chary about the next district I will mention.  However, remember, I do not know whether it is the purpose of the Department to make up its mind definitely that nothing can be done in this particular case or whether they are merely bent on leaving us in doubt whether anything will be done&mdash;a habit that the Government has adopted and made its own even in larger matters of public policy when we try to get a plain answer to a simple question.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which, then, I should like to refer is in connection with the Brick and Cashen district. At the present moment, although there is no such place scheduled in our geography as a lake, there is a lake there now, and I feel sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he cares to look for it, can find a most extensive lake there.  This is not a question of what one might call an occasional flood.  There is a permanency in regard to floods in that district, and I understand, further, that you have a situation where quite a number of people are paying the Land Commission for what might be called submarine estates, spread out over hundreds of acres, and almost permanently under water.  About two months ago I put a question to the Parliamentary Secretary on this particular matter, and I gathered&mdash;in fact, I was particularly dashed when I heard it&mdash;that the Board of Works had the matter under their very serious consideration.  The reason I felt dashed was that they have had it under consideration for many years past, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows.</P>
    <P>I am sure that it is more than 11 years ago since a petition was sent in to the Board of Works in connection with that matter.  Of course, there was a certain amount of the <Col N="263" /> usual and unavoidable delay in the sending down of an engineer from the Board of Works to examine this particular scheme.  Then a preliminary report came in, and then there was a further report.  Afterwards, there was an estimate of the cost, and the cost was very considerable.  I think it was in 1931 that the Minister for Finance &mdash;fully six years ago&mdash;gave a pledge that the Government were quite prepared to go on with that particular scheme and to give the highest grant that the peculiar grant they have allows&mdash;and that is 50 per cent.&mdash;on certain conditions.  These conditions were that the county council would make a certain grant and that the balance would be met by the beneficiaries. There was a certain amount of delay in that connection caused by a certain gap.  The county council, I think, was prepared to contribute, say, about 30 per cent., but finally agreed to bring it up to 37 per cent.  At that time, I think, the commissioner was Mr. O'Dwyer.  Although the actual benefit to the farmer was estimated at about six per cent., the fact is that the land on which the farmers were living is for the most part of the year under water, so that it is not exactly a working proposition where they are concerned, and the farmers were willing to meet the cost of 12 per cent. or 13 per cent. and the county council to meet the rest.  However, an agreement was then made between the county council, the Government, and the proposed beneficiaries, and the scheme arrived at as a result of that agreement was accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>That matter came up before the Government, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that his heart was bleeding for the people there&mdash; anyhow, that he was convinced of the genuineness of the demand of the people there for that particular scheme.  Then, I think it was the then Minister for Lands and Fisheries who, in dealing with the general matter of drainage, spoke of the inter-departmental committee investigating this whole matter, and said that one of the principal difficulties that the Government had was not in finding money to <Col N="264" /> spend, but in finding ways to spend the money.  I see that the Parliamentary Secretary fully agrees with that dictum of the then Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the proper labour content?  Anyhow, do not make the objection that the scheme is not economic.  Is the cutting of roads economic?  Is the cutting of &ldquo;scraws&rdquo; from the side of the road economic?  I have grave doubts whether it is either safe or economic, and I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I cannot suggest it to the former Minister for Lands, though possibly he might remember his interest in this matter&mdash;that this is a very useful way, even though it might not be entirely an &ldquo;economic&rdquo; way, to spend money.  However, although an engineer was sent down about four years ago, I think, and reported once more about four years ago on the matter, there the thing has rested, and from that day to this the drainage scheme has, I cannot exactly say, hung fire, but certainly has been rather sluggish.  I remember dealing with a sluggish river in the County of Cork.  I wondered how such a thing as a sluggish river got there or how, having got there, it ever stayed there.  However, it did get there and it was ultimately dealt with, the Awbeg; but here is a scheme which has been before the Board of Works for almost 12 years.  I admit that it was necessary for a few years to make preliminary inquiries, but although the preliminary inquiries have been made, and although an agreement on the sharing of expenses had been reached, no real advance has been reached in all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that, for the last three years, not an inch has been advanced except by the floods, and I think he will certainly agree that the floods have advanced.  Again, I say that this is a case that may be taken as typical of cases in the country where, the longer the delay is, the more work will have to be done eventually.  This is not a question of a new district.  It is an ancient drainage district where considerable <Col N="265" /> work has been done a long time ago.  I know there is a difficulty caused by the tide there, and I can understand the chariness of the Board of Works in touching such matters where the tide has to be considered, but if anything is to be done, and if the tides are the worst offenders, one must regard the tides as things that one cannot afford to disregard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But it has to be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it has to be paid for, and I know that one cannot calculate it, but I say that if it has to be paid for, the Government should pay for it.  When dealing with another Estimate yesterday I made the suggestion to the Minister concerned with that particular Estimate that there was one excuse I was not willing to accept from any member of the present Government, and that was the excuse that is framed in the question: Where is the money to come from?  If the present Government has demonstrated anything, nothwithstanding the fact that some years ago this country was held by them to have gone far beyond its taxable capacity, it has demonstrated that that particular reply will not hold.  Therefore, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, if money has been found, and found in large quantities, for much more questionable purposes than the one I am now advocating, I am not prepared to accept that answer&mdash;the cost &mdash;as having any validity at the present moment.  I say that the Government can find the money, and, therefore, I really want to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this question of drainage&mdash;and to this district particularly.  I am not so sure that ultimately it might not be a sounder national policy for the Government simply to undertake and pay for these schemes altogether.  I am not so sure that in the long run they will be any worse off financially.  Mind you, I am not saying that the annuities are not due.  The fact is that the people dislike to have to pay annuities no matter to whom they are due.  But in the case I have mentioned&mdash;the Akeragh Lough district&mdash;it seems absurd and unjust to ask them to pay, because I <Col N="266" /> do not think it can be pretended that the people I have mentioned have benefited.  I think in the long run it might be good policy, and even from the financial point of view it might be no loss, if all the considerable arterial drainage scheme were simply carried through by the Government irrespective of any local charge, at least of any annuity.  The annuity, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, very often means very little.  Take the annuity in the case of the Aubeg.  Does anybody pretend that in that case it is more than a mere symbol?  I think about 98 per cent. was paid by the Government and the county council in that particular case.  I have a vague idea&mdash;I was not at the Board of Works at the time&mdash;but I think something about 2 per cent. was paid by the annuitants.  They may have to foot the maintenance charge.  There is no tidal water there, of course.  I think in that case the 2 per cent. annuity was a mere symbol, as far as the beneficiaries are concerned.  I have not the slightest doubt that as time goes on the county councils will find it extremely difficult to collect these annuities, and it might be a much better bargain even from the Government point of view boldly to face the question: is it worth while going in for arterial drainage?  If it is, let the Government undertake it. It has other advantages than the mere economic ones; it would not be a pure question of profit or loss, of mere material economy.  There are several imponderable values to the countryside to be got from drainage, and I should be very much surprised that a Fianna Fáil Government should find any difficulty in giving proper weight, if I might make a &ldquo;bull,&rdquo; to imponderables. They are quite good at that when it comes to more important matters, and I suggest they could take account of them here.  That is the main question I want to discuss on this particular Vote.  I have taken the two cases I referred to because I have had a personal interest in them for a number of years.  I take them as illustrating the policy of the Department as it is and for the purpose of pointing out what I think should be the policy of the Department in this particular matter of arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the plea put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan that the question of drainage should be taken over generally by some Government Department such as the Board of Works.  The county councils have not the machinery or the resources for undertaking work of this kind.  There is no question about that.  As the Deputy has pointed out, there are various districts in which the land is under water for six months, or at least three months, of the year.  The people who own this land are called upon to pay annuities and charges during the time that the land is under water, just as if the land were available for the ordinary purposes for which a farmer requires land.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that the proper way to approach the matter would be for the Board of Works to have the whole question examined as it affects the whole country, and that they should undertake to carry out these drainage schemes.  Let them make a levy on the county councils if they like, or on the local ratepayers, but certainly they are the proper Department to undertake these works.  They have the machinery and the experience of doing work of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what stage has been reached in connection with the examination by his Department of the scheme for the improvement of Wexford Harbour. That is a scheme which has been before the Board of Works for the past two years, and it is about time that some definite indication should be given by the Board of Works as to whether they consider the scheme submitted suitable, whether it would permit of adequate facilities for legitimate shipping.  The Wexford County Council, the Wexford Corporation and the Wexford Harbour Board all have expressed their willingness to support the scheme financially.  It is unfair to them that the scheme should be held up any further.  The amount of money that the harbour board, the corporation and the county council have agreed to pay in order to subsidise the necessary loan totals £4,000 annually. That shows that they believe in <Col N="268" /> the scheme, and I think it is time that something definite should be done in connection with the matter.  If it is the case that the Board of Works have made up their mind that the scheme is not suitable, they should be in a position to suggest some alternative. The scheme, as submitted, has been prepared by eminent engineers, and it has cost the Wexford Harbour Commissioners a considerable sum of money.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself is, I know, a person who has a good deal of experience of matters of this kind, and I would ask him to have something done to save one of the oldest and best-known ports of the country.  As I have said before, some sort of interim reply has come through from which one would infer that the scheme is not altogether acceptable to the Board of Works.  I do not think I would be asking too much, in view of the fact that the harbour commissioners have spent so much money in having the scheme prepared, that the Board of Works should, if they cannot accept the scheme put forward by the harbour commissioners, suggest some kind of scheme which will prevent Wexford Harbour from shoaling up altogether.  It is one of the oldest ports in the country, a port at which there was always a large amount of shipping.  As a matter of fact, we learned in our geographies when we were going to school that Wexford was noted for its shipping, and we should not like it to lose that reputation altogether.  I would request the Parliamentary Secretary to get the Board of Works to move in this matter. We know they have many responsibilities, but we should like them to put some scheme before us so that we shall be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I understand that some complaints have been made to this Department&mdash; if the complaints have not arrived yet they will arrive in the very near future &mdash;by a representative committee which has been set up in Rosslare in regard to coast erosion.  Rosslare strand is a very important watering-place and the foreshore is rapidly disappearing year after year.  During the past two months a great deal of damage has been done there and certain representations <Col N="269" /> have been made to his Department, or will be made in the near future, with a view to having something done in the matter.  Here again a certain amount was expended by the Wexford County Council in recent years on the advice of the Department of Industry and Commerce or of the Board of Works&mdash;I cannot remember which&mdash;and an exhaustive inquiry was held in order to try and find out what was the cause of the encroachment there.  A very eminent engineer was brought over from England who had some experience of coast erosion on the East Coast of England.  A very elaborate report was prepared by him and was submitted to the Board of Works.  The county council asked the Board of Works to do certain things but evidently a deaf ear has been turned to their request.  I suggest that the Board of Works ought to interest itself in matters of this kind, so that places like Rosslare and other watering places in the country would not be irretrievably ruined.  I do not know whether we are entitled to discuss minor relief schemes on this Vote?</P>

      <P>This is a rather large Vote, and I think we are entitled to a certain amount of information on it. The total amount of the Vote is £977,000.  I have endeavoured to segregate the Vote as well as I could, and I find that of that £977,000 the sum of £700,000 is being spent in the City of Dublin, leaving £200,000 odd for the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>Cork has the plague as far as Government Votes are concerned. I think we are entitled to some information with regard to the expenditure of this money.  In the first place, I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what particular responsibility the national Exchequer has for keeping up public parks here in Dublin.  My recollection in regard to public parks as far as <Col N="270" /> Cork City is concerned&mdash;the Fitzgerald Park and others&mdash;is that they have to be kept up out of corporation funds. I am sure that as far as any little park in any town throughout the country is concerned the same thing applies.  But here we have £17,000 for Phoenix Park and £4,265 for Stephen's Green.  In addition, we have a proposal to erect a new gateway in Parkgate Street for the Phoenix Park at a cost of £4,200. I wonder what kind of gateway that is going to be.  With all due respects to the Parliamentary Secretary, I think that the money would be better spent on the proposal put up by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan about the drainage of land in the country than on making some kind of gateway to the Phoenix Park at a cost of £4,200.</P>
      <P>We have then a whole long line of Civic Guard barracks and God knows what at £4,000 or £5,000 each. When we consider the position of housing right through the country, I personally consider that that £4,200 for the Phoenix Park gateway would be better spent in building houses that are needed for the poor of the country.  I should also like to know what particular service to the nation Dun Laoghaire harbour is giving, seeing that the Central Fund has to contribute £14,075 this year and £14,725 last year.  I think Dublin seems to be the dickens of a happy place, seeing all the money that is pouring into it from all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I would not be at all surprised what Deputy Morrissey's figures would be.  Then we have some kind of harbour in Howth which costs us £1,150 in addition to that.  Those are matters on which the taxpayers in general are entitled to some information. Then we come to the airports; we find £7,000 for an airport in Dublin and £150,000 for one on the Shannon somewhere.  Again I wonder if Cork has got the plague, seeing that whenever there is any money to be spent every Government Department seems to shy all around it and <Col N="271" /> steer clear.  On this Vote, I want information on those particular points, in regard to the Phoenix Park, Dun Laoghaire harbour and the airports. I want to know why the port of Cork, which is the first port in Ireland, not to mind in the Free State, is ignored.  We have to spend £15,000 on an old harbour here to shovel sand out of it, while the port of Cork has been neglected in regard to airport services.  If there is money to be spent we are entitled to our share of it.  I also want to know how it is that out of £977,000 the sum of £700,000 is being spent in the City of Dublin.  That money is being contributed by the taxpayers in general over the Twenty-Six Counties.  Those are the few points I want to make on this Vote.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have his mind made up to be a little more generous when we come to the discussion of the next Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  For instance, he told us that the increase in the Estimate was due to certain increases which were necessary for the purpose of the carrying out of the employment works, and that there was a sum coming over from that particular Vote to the extent of £17,000.  On looking into the matter, it is very hard to convince oneself that the Parliamentary Secretary is exactly correct in that matter, because if you look at page 33 of the Estimates and take the special works division&mdash;that is.  I understand, the division which deals with Vote 69, the Employment Vote, as it is called this year; it is a new Vote&mdash;we find that the increase under that particular heading amounts to only something like £4,760. It does appear to me, therefore, that under this particular Vote&mdash;as I am afraid under every Estimate we have &mdash;there is an alarming increase in the permanent officials of the Civil Service.  If my contention in this matter is right&mdash;and I think the figures prove that it is perfectly correct&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government must have come to <Col N="272" /> the conclusion that we are always going to have an unemployment problem; that we are always going to have the necessity for a permanent staff to an enormous extent to deal with that particular work.</P>
      <P>Of course it does not end there by any manner of means, because I personally know that the staffs of the local authorities are very seriously hampered in endeavouring to assist the officers of the Board of Works in carrying out those particular works down the country.  After all, the local authorities' officers are whole-time officers, and I do not know that we were ever really satisfied that our officers were 100 per cent. able to look after the main work which they had to look after in the counties.  Now they are taxed to this extent, and in addition we have a new permanent crowd brought on to deal with this matter, which is supposed to be a passing phase.  I am afraid that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have gone very far away from the famous plan they had for the curing of unemployment.  Even the InterDepartmental Committee, over which the Parliamentary Secretary presided, does not seem to have evolved anything which will deal effectively with this matter.  If the nation has got to set up a new Civil Service of this type to deal with this matter, then we must be convinced that it is going to remain with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry does not seem to be satisfied to have certain monuments in the public parks in the City of Dublin maintained out of the public purse. Would the Parliamentary Secretary say if any decision has been come to by the Government with regard to the ex-Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix Park?  The sum of practically £4,000 is set apart for it in the Estimates. We would be interested to know what the intentions of the Government are with regard to that building.  Are we maintaining it for the purpose of putting in there the first citizen of the State, or whatever kind of an ornament we are going to have, under the new Constitution?  I would like to be told why we are spending public money on this building.  On the Estimate last year I asked what was going to <Col N="273" /> be done in connection with a national monument which we have in the County Roscommon.  It is the old Abbey which contains the remains of King Phelim O'Connor.  The Abbey is notable for some beautiful stonework, but at present it is in a dreadfully neglected condition.  Last year the Parliamentary Secretary promised that the matter would get attention. If the position is that the law does not permit the Board of Works to take over and care this national monument, one of the best that we have in the west of Ireland, the Parliamentary Secretary should take steps to remove whatever legal difficulties are in the way.  The Abbey is going into neglect and ruin and something should be done immediately to preserve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters that I am anxious to get the Parliamentary Secretary interested in if I can.  The question of arterial drainage has been referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  In my county a considerable amount of hardship is entailed by beneficiaries under certain schemes.  I know one or two schemes where, for instance, the annuity would be £9 or £10 or perhaps less, but the sum demanded this year is four times that amount.  That occurs, I believe, because the final certificate for the scheme has not been furnished by the Board of Works.  At all events the scheme is not finished in such a way that it can be taken over.</P>
      <P>I know some schemes in my county &mdash;there is, for instance, the scheme at Tiermaclane, where some of the beneficiaries under it are this year expected to pay three and four times the amount of what the annuity would be. A demand for £36 has been made on some of them, while if the scheme were completed and handed over, the annual payment would not be more than £8 or £9.  I understand that there are other schemes not finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are left there in an unfinished state.  That leads me on to this, that the county council requested a number of us to make representations to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think this is probably the best way to make representations to him.  My suggestion <Col N="274" /> is that he should make a survey of the various schemes in the county which are not finished.  There are several such schemes, and I suggest to him that an immediate investigation of those schemes should be made so that an unnecessary burden would not continue to be placed on the beneficiaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Deputy, having raised the question here, would give me the names of those schemes in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion was made to another Deputy and myself to go and see the Parliamentary Secretary. I suggested that we should be furnished by the county surveyor or the county secretary with the names and all details of those schemes&mdash;that we were not going to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do certain things unless we were able to produce complete data to him.  I cannot say if the county council have furnished the Parliamentary Secretary with that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the Fergus.  That has been done on several occasions by the Board of Works, and done so effectively that there are scores of acres of land around Doora that are flooded.  All that land is worthless for any purpose whatever.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to do about it.  There is a considerable amount of unemployment in the area. The farmers who are expected to pay annuities and rates on all that submerged land are suffering the greatest hardship.  In connection with the Fergus, representations have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary repeatedly, both by individuals and by public bodies.  I am sure that on every occasion on which he has made a protracted stay in the county, he has had representations made to him by public men and by the people affected in that area with reference to this matter.  I think it is time that something was done in connection with it.  The county council will not undertake any responsibility in connection with the Fergus drainage scheme until it is put in such a way <Col N="275" /> that the council can be certain that it will not have to put the ratepayers in such a position that they will not be able to meet the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised a matter in connection with Rosslare.  There is a little holiday resort in our county, at Lahinch, which has been almost wiped away.  Considerable expenditure has been incurred by the county council and by the people locally at Lahinch.  I do not know whether any extensive national funds have gone into it, but the position has now been reached when neither the local people nor the county council can cope with the danger that has arisen to the town.  Lahinch is in a district which gets little in the way of expenditure from Government sources.  The people there make their living largely out of whatever the holiday season brings them.  If those people are to meet their responsibilities locally and nationally, something will have to be done to maintain this little seaside resort in Clare as an attraction for tourists.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to have an excellent game of golf, I dare say he knows that the links at Lahinch is one of the most famous in the country.  I suggest to him that he should do something to preserve the town for the amenities which it affords not only to the people of Ireland but to those in a great part of Europe and possibly America.</P>
    <P>A great deal of damage was done by a movement of bog mould at Ballinruan. Acres of land were covered with debris.  Three-quarters of the land of some of the local farmers was covered with this bog mould which had come down from the mountain side.  I understand that the suggestion was put forward by the Board of Works to the owners of the land that they should remove the bog mould off the lands themselves.  Where, I ask, were they to remove it to?  It had reached a height of three or four feet, and in some cases was spread over seven or eight acres of land.  Where was the farmer to remove it to?  Was he to put it in on his neighbour's land?  The suggestion, I understand, was made to give £30 or £40 to those people if they <Col N="276" /> removed the stuff off their land.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary has not given the attention to this matter that it deserves.  It is very serious in view of the fact that the land of those people has been put out of commission.  If that land is to come back into commission again, as these people are expected to meet local and national demands in the shape of annuities and rates and such things, some attempt ought to be made to help them.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Corry talk about the proposed airport at Cork.  We have the doubtful blessing of an airport at Rynanna.  I dare say the Parliamentary Secretary heard about that; at least some of us made a desperate effort to get the information across to him that there is an airport being erected at Rynanna and erected under conditions that are not at all satisfactory.  I do not know whether Deputy Corry is misinformed or not&mdash;I hope he is not&mdash;when he says that there is not going to be an airport at Cork, because I understand there was a conference in Cork which the Parliamentary Secretary attended and at which he suggested that £22,000 be spent on an airport at Cork.  The most peculiar portion of the whole thing was that he suggested that 53/- a week should be paid to the workers to be employed in the erection of the airport at Cork.  Of course, Cork elects the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the workers in that particular district have votes for the Parliamentary Secretary, but, unfortunately, in Clare the workers who were offered only 27/- per week can elect only common or garden T.D.s.</P>

      <P>Except we speak on local matters it would be hard to find something to speak about.  There are a few things affecting my constituency which I should like to speak about. Deputy O'Sullivan has already referred to the Brick and Cashen drainage scheme.  We have discussed that several times before and I welcome at this stage the intervention of Deputy O'Sullivan.  I am sure he put forward a good case, but if the same case had been put forward seven or eight years ago perhaps the scheme would have been carried out by now. At any rate, it is about time that we should know from the Parliamentary Secretary and from his Department what is the attitude towards the carrying out of this scheme.  Time and again I have written to and visited the Office of Public Works with a view to finding out exactly how far they have gone towards preparing the way for the carrying out of that scheme.  On the last occasion I visited the office, I am afraid I noticed an attitude of despair there as regards the carrying out of this scheme.</P>

Even though it might be said that a good deal of this money is to be spent in Dublin, you must remember that Dublin is the capital of the country, and it is only natural that we should want to have the capital as well looked after as possible, because we are all interested in the capital of our country. What I am interested in is drainage and such schemes, which I hoped, and still hope, will be carried out in my constituency.  I was told that it would cost about £100,000 to carry out this Brick and Cashen drainage scheme.  I do not know whether that estimate is too high or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is £100,000 or £50,000, it would be well that we should come to some decision as to whether it is going to be carried out or not.  I have a definite reason for saying that because there are many minor drainage schemes around it that could be carried out if this thing were out of the way altogether.  But, when application is made for the drainage of such-and-such a canal, we repeatedly get the reply that that is part and parcel of the more comprehensive Brick and Cashen drainage scheme and cannot be touched until such time as the whole scheme is prepared and the Commissioners of Public Works have made up their minds whether it can be carried out or not, or whether it is feasible or not.  At any rate, I hope that what I have suggested will bear fruit and that within a reasonable time we will get a definite reply from the Office of Public Works as to whether the scheme is going to be carried out or not.</P>
      <P>In that connection I should say that on the last occasion I visited the Office of Public Works I could elicit, as I said, no definite information, as to the exact position; but I was given to understand that if I wrote to the secretary in the ordinary way I would get the information desired.  Thereupon I wrote to the secretary, but from that time until now I have not got a reply. It is always necessary for us who represent people to be in a position to explain whether the thing is to be carried out or not or what attitude has been taken up by the Department.  I hope that in the near future I shall find out from the Parliamentary Secretary himself, if necessary, whether this scheme is to be carried out or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I am not so foolish as not to see the difficulties that must attend the carrying out of this scheme.  It is an enormous scheme, but it must be remembered it covers a very large area in North Kerry and happens to cover the best part of the land in that district &mdash;land which could be converted to the growing of wheat, beet, and barley, which cannot be said of a good many <Col N="279" /> other parts of Kerry.  Having regard to the fertility of the land and the area of land covered for the greater part of the year, it is a scheme well worth considering, even though the cost is enormous.  I know also that we should not confine ourselves to considering the initial expenditure, that we should consider the maintenance costs afterwards as well.</P>
    <P>I would make a suggestion, and I am sure it will be considered very carefully by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I should say first that it seems to me to be the attitude of the engineers in the Parliamentary Secretary's Department not to attempt to go ahead until they can make sure that the scheme will be a 100 per cent. success.</P>
    <P>Why not make an experiment with part of the money, say £10,000?  If it could not be made under the Drainage Acts it might be made by way of a minor relief scheme, or, I should say, an aggregate of minor relief schemes.  I am sure the people of the district would be willing to forego whatever relief claims they would otherwise be entitled to make.  I hope my suggestion will be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.  As Deputy Corish and Deputy Hogan mentioned, it would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary stated what was the attitude generally towards coast erosion.  Is it the intention to deal with it?  Deputy Hogan mentioned the position in Lahinch which is a famous sea-side resort.  I desire to call attention to places in my constituency which are seriously imperilled by the ravages of the sea. At Ballybunion the famous golf links are being undermined year after year, and if some steps are not taken I am afraid serious damage will be done there.  The position is the same at a place called Ballyheigue where erosion is much more rapid.  It would be well if the whole question of coast erosion was considered by the Department.</P>

      <P>I am going to take up a different line with regard to this Vote.  I have no drainage schemes to call attention to, but I am going to raise the question of the cost of administration of the board.  I expected to hear Deputy Corry making <Col N="280" /> some reference to the allowances paid to members of the board.  In the past it was stated by those who are now on the Government Benches that no one in this country was worth more than £500 a year.  Deputy Corry smiles.  I am sure he agrees with that statement.  During the past year a gentleman was appointed as chairman of the board at a salary of £1,500 a year.  I do not know if the position is pensionable.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will inform the House when he is replying.  The greatest qualification that gentleman had, was his statement on one occasion that if it took a 100 years to build up the cattle trade it would not take a 100 years to destroy it.</P>

      <P>I have here a speech which was made by the present Minister for Education in 1928, when in opposition, and I believe it justifies me in raising this question now.  The speech appears in Volume 26 of the Official Debates, page 34, when, as he then was, Deputy Derrig spoke on Vote No. 10.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is also the question of the higher staff of the Board of Works.  There is a chairman and two commissioners.  I understand that one of the commissioners has died.  If these offices are essential, well and good, but we would like to know if they are essential.  Is it absolutely necessary for us to have these three commissioners, as well as having a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Department? If the three offices could be abolished, even if we had to pay full pensions, it is estimated that a <Col N="281" /> saving of nearly £2,000 could be effected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary went into that question, and if he considered the statement that was made by a member of the Executive Council now before this appointment was made. Will Deputy Corry say that the gentleman who has been appointed is worth £1,500 a year?  The Ceann Comhairle points out that I am not justified in attacking a civil servant.

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the question of drainage in the County Mayo.  I would like to know the cause of the delay in dealing with the Gweston, Pollock and Yellow rivers, which are tributaries of the Moy.  A scheme was prepared in 1927 to which Mayo County Council agreed, and it was understood that work would commence shortly afterwards.  The matter has hung fire since.  Within the last year Mayo County Council on three or four occasions sent resolutions to the Commissioners of Public Works asking them to proceed with the preparation of a scheme for the drainage of these rivers. Some years ago when a deputation was sent to the Commissioners with regard to the drainage of these rivers, a question arose as to whether the drainage might not mean flooding on the lower regions of the Moy.  The engineers at the time gave an assurance to the deputation that the drainage would not interfere in any way with the lower regions, as these were not quick moving streams.  I should like to know if it is the intention of the Board to proceed with the drainage.  There is also the question of dealing with another river in South Mayo, the Dalgan Clare river in the Ballyhaunis area. <Col N="282" /> Deputations were sent forward on several occasions about this river, and the county council are anxious that a scheme should be prepared to deal with it.  I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the excellent work that has been done on the River Robe in South Mayo.  The drainage of that river was undertaken within the last few months, and splendid work has been done there.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the possibility of continuing the drainage from the side of the road where work is now going on to the source, as that would relieve considerable flooding higher up.  As it will take two or three years before the work is completed, it would be of great benefit to the people in areas further on if another part of the river was drained and obstructions removed, or if a partial scheme was proceeded with. The work done in the Robe up to the present has given excellent results from Claremorris on to Ballinrobe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for information about the old question of the Nenagh river, with which he is conversant. To a large extent the trouble with regard to the Nenagh is similar to that of other rivers.  But there is this difference, which in my opinion makes it even a more urgent matter &mdash;that the question of the new sewerage system for the town of Nenagh is unfortunately mixed up with the question of the drainage of the river. What I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary is this: whether the matter has been dropped so far as his Department is concerned, or whether they are taking a vote giving all the farmers interested as such as word in the matter.  Are we to take it that the whole question of the drainage of that river has been shelved?  The Parliamentary Secretary may know that the Nenagh Urban Council are anxious to proceed with the sewerage scheme for the town.  They are being urged to do it by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I understand that the sewerage scheme can be carried out independently of the drainage of the river, but only at considerably <Col N="283" /> greater cost.  I know it is felt also that any scheme of sewerage carried out ignoring, so far as it is possible to ignore, the flooding of the rivers, will ultimately not be so successful as if the scheme were preceded by the drainage of the river.</P>
      <P>This drainage is necessary for many good reasons.  The first reason I have already given; (2) a very great area of land is flooded, and flooded for a considerable period of the year, owing to this want of drainage; and (3) there is a considerable amount of unemployment in Nenagh and district.  A number of schemes have been carried out recently, including the hospital, house building, and so on, and these gave a great deal of employment.  These schemes are now finished, there is no employment available, and, so far as I can see, there is no prospect of employment being made available. The drainage of this river would, in itself, give a very considerable amount of employment.  It would lead, as I suggest, to still further employment by leading on to the new sewerage scheme for the town.  I do not want to go over that matter any further.  It has been discussed here and elsewhere fully.  The Parliamentary Secretary is as conversant with the details of this scheme as I am.  It has been under discussion for a long number of years.  I want to know from him now whether it is completely shelved, whether the Department is prepared to re-open the matter, and whether, in fact, there is any possible scheme going ahead, and if so when?  I will leave the matter at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few details in connection with Estimate 11, page 46.  The first is number 92, new headquarters, Kildare Street, for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This project has been in one form or another before this House for a number of years. One would imagine that there was no unemployment in the City of Dublin and that men were not available to carry out the work.  I do not know how many years it is since this matter was first brought before the House. We have now arrived at this position that this building which is to cost <Col N="284" /> £140,000 had, last year, a sum of £25,000 voted for it and the estimated expenditure up to the 31st March, that is yesterday, was £3,000.  I suggest there is something wrong in that matter.  There is a delay and I suggest an avoidable delay somewhere. Surely it is not going to be contended that it was going to take three or four years to get the preliminary plans ready for a building costing even £140,000.  May I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that another evil which is going to flow from this delay is that he will have again to revise his Estimate of £140,000, in view of the increase in building materials?  The point with which I am concerned at the moment is this: the Government say they are anxious to find schemes of work for those unemployed.  If this is the rate of progression towards putting these schemes going, somebody will have to get behind the Department to speed them up.</P>
    <P>Another item here is the Thurles post office.  It is a good many years ago since I first heard of that Estimate, but nothing, so far, has been spent and nothing has been started. I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what is the meaning of putting these things into the Estimate and asking the House to vote money which the Department is not ready to spend.  Apparently they have no intention of spending this year the money they are asking us to vote. Without these items the book of Estimates is cumbrous enough.  It is loaded down with details without putting into it unnecessary details and items with which there is no intention of proceeding.  The next item is the Shannon Airport.  The Vote asked for the years 1937-38 is £150,000.  The sum of £20,000 was voted in 1936-37 and the estimated total expenditure up to yesterday was £20,000.  I would like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the close estimation in that item.  How much of the £150,000 does he estimate to spend this year?  By how much will that particular sum have to be increased if he proposes to pay a decent wage to the people employed on the scheme?  I see an item of £4,320 for the Kilmastulla drainage scheme.  Last year the House was <Col N="285" /> asked to vote that sum, but not a single penny of it has since been spent.  I think we are entitled to some explanation as to why that is so.  Again, the House is asked to vote moneys which the Department apparently are not in a position to spend.  I hope some explanation will be forthcoming on that point.  These are perhaps wearisome details, but they very properly arise on the Estimate under consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation of an item on page 58, Vote No. 11, in connection with &ldquo;forestry hands&rdquo; at a salary or wages from 15/- to 30/- inclusive.  There is no asterisk or query behind that, so apparently the 15/- is 15/- without any perquisites. Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if these men work a full week for 15/- or are they merely part-time men?  Was it from paying men 15/- a week that the Parliamentary Secretary got his idea for the rotation of work that he is spreading through the country?  I cannot conceive that any Government Department would pay a wage of 15/- a week to any employee.  Further down in the same page there is an item &ldquo;garden labourers,&rdquo; 18/- to 57/5 per week.  It seems to me that there is a very wide difference there, and the perquisites would have to be fairly valuable that would bridge that gap between 18/- and 57/5.  Those are matters of detail, but they are matters of a certain importance and I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to include them in his reply.  The question of the building to be erected, some time I hope, in Kildare Street is not so much a detail; it is rather an important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already urged the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the question of an extension of summer drainage works in South Kerry districts.  I should like to mention that in the case of last year's programme, the works carried out under the authority of the Office of Public Works, following out the recommendations of the Parliamentary Secretary, were a great success.  The results speak for themselves.  As a <Col N="286" /> matter of fact, it was proved that £100 spent during the summer on drainage was as productive as £200 expended at other periods of the year. I would strongly urge an extension of that scheme, particularly in so far as South Kerry is concerned.</P>
      <P>There is scarcely any need for stressing the fact that in the South Kerry area we cannot benefit as other areas benefit.  For instance, the Land Commission cannot operate to any extent, because there is no land to be divided and there are no works which would qualify under the ordinary administration of the Land Commission.  Neither can we benefit under the wheat and beet schemes, and the only alternative is some such scheme as I have suggested in the way of summer drainage. I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary has always met us in a just and fair way, and we appreciate every effort that has been made by him in that regard.  The areas that I have mentioned would qualify in so far as the number of unemployed are concerned.  The number remaining on the register in these areas should qualify for an allocation of grants in so far as the works I have suggested are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have gone into too much detail.  The fact is that I am trying to show that as far as these areas in South Kerry are concerned the only hope of the unemployed at this period of the year would be through summer drainage work. Another matter upon which I would like to touch is the question of erosion which is taking place along the Rosbeigh area.  A couple of years ago the Board of Works carried out a very useful scheme there which prevented erosion of the coast line.  Perhaps there could be an extension of that scheme so as to prevent further erosion taking place.  It is not a question of asking for sympathy here for the people of South Kerry; it is a matter <Col N="287" /> of finding some alternative to schemes that we cannot avail of there.  I submit very respectfully to the Parliamentary Secretary that there might be some co-operation between the various Departments so that where parts of the country cannot obtain benefits under the schemes operated by one Department they might be able to benefit under schemes operated by the other Department.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is the intention to complete this year the adaptation of the building taken over in Cecil Street in Limerick for the purpose of an employment exchange.  I am not quite clear from the showing of the figures in the book of Estimates if it is the intention soon to complete that work which this year and last year was left in an unfinished state.  The building is not by any means suitable or attractive in the condition in which it is left.</P>
      <P>It is essential in the interests of the general public and the staff that the work of adaptation be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment.  I see where a sum of £1,700 was provided last year, and I am not quite clear whether it is the intention to use that money in the present season. It is absolutely essential that the work should be put in hands as soon as possible.  I want to refer briefly to the old question of the rotational schemes if I would be in order in doing so.</P>

      <P>Sir, in case the members of the Dáil should get away with the idea that the only places where drainage is required are Kerry and the Barrow and so on, I should like to say something with regard to the Dromore drainage, in Monaghan and Cavan.  I admit that something has been done there, but the rate of progress has been very slow.  The need for drainage there was not so apparent up to recent years, but the abnormally wet summer last year destroyed a lot of crops and left a lot of the land unworkable, and I may say that some of us, public representatives, are being continually besieged by the occupiers of land there to know why the work is not being got on with faster.  I do not suggest for a moment that the Parliamentary Secretary has nothing else to do except to take care of this particular scheme, but I should not like him to forget that we have that little difficulty there in the North just as in other parts of the country, and we should like the drainage scheme there to be proceeded with more rapidly, because this is a matter that affects not only the land, and the arable land in that vicinity, but the towns in the neighbourhood also, and I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary of that fact in order to see if it might not be possible to get a move on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It has been almost a pleasure, Sir, to take part in this discussion. The discussion began with an extremely pleasant speech, delivered in an extremely pleasant manner, by Deputy O'Sullivan, and, if I may say so, I think that a good deal more work could be done in a debate of this kind, if the case were put with the good humour and the good feeling that was exhibited, not only in that speech, but that was, I think, <Col N="289" /> expressed in the intentions of all those who have taken part in the debate up to the present.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the Brick and Cashen rivers, and the Akeragh.  These are typical cases of the necessity and the desirability of the setting up of a commission to inquire into the whole present position of drainage.  On the facts as stated in connection with Akeragh one would say that something radically wrong had happened.  I am very much afraid that, if I were to give way to the pressure put upon me by Deputies on both sides of the House in relation to the Brick and Cashen, I might find myself having delivered to Kerry something of the kind Deputy O'Sullivan referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that you are dealing in this matter with tidal rivers and tidal estuaries which are likely to shift under conditions of storm, and so on, and that it is not in the power of man to prophesy what will happen in connection with such tidal waters.  Even the experience of a couple of years of maintenance will not give you the information you want.  For instance, you may have, as in the case of many harbours in Ireland, just one storm&mdash;even a storm of a couple of hours' duration, but a storm with a particular direction&mdash; and you can have that storm undoing the whole work of years in a night. Where you are dealing with tidal estuaries or tidal rivers of this kind, with contours of the character we have to deal with in those cases, you may have in a particular year a maintenance that is equal to five years, and nothing can prevent it, whereas you may have for the following five years quite a good maintenance, except, possibly, for the expense of keeping one or two men.  I regard the Brick and Cashen and the Akeragh as typical examples on which experience is needed, and sound professional administrative advice has to be given in the form of a report to the Government.  There would be no delay as far as I and the Department are concerned, in setting up that commission and getting it to work. A good deal of preliminary work has already been done.  The whole of the <Col N="290" /> preliminary work of the Board of Works, which proved to be more comprehensive and extensive than we had anticipated, has already been examined. A good deal of the preliminary work, which we anticipated would still have to be done, has been done, and, while I am not going to say for one single moment that this commission is going to report in a few months, or that it should be expected to do so, or that the results of an examination would really be valuable, I am prepared to say that everything that is possible to be produced would be produced by a commission which would be set up for the specific purpose of dealing with difficulties which are hampering us every day and of the realities of which we are, probably, more conscious than any member of the House.</P>
    <P>The figure of £100,000, which has been given in connection with the Brick and Cashen, is an estimate, and our opinion is that there are indefinite things in that calculation, and that, even when we have examined them, a doubtful element will be left.  It is the easiest thing to give a definite answer of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Deputies in reference to such matters, but if the idea is that we say that we shall do all that is possible to see whether an economic scheme can be devised to deal with such problems, then delay will have to be accepted as an actual fact.  In that connection I might just call the attention of the House to figures that have already been given, because there is a sort of general tendency to say that, if you drain this or that river, an incalculable amount of good will be done.  That is a very common expression&mdash;the word &ldquo;incalculable.&rdquo; It generally means, in the mind of the person using it, &ldquo;enormous,&rdquo; but very often the correct interpretation of the word &ldquo;incalculable&rdquo; would be found to be &ldquo;very small.&rdquo;  In fact, very often, the latter might be more accurate.  I am taking the Brick and Cashen case as a case to be strongly and genuinely advocated, and it has been said that this affects the best area and the best land in Kerry.  On this basis of £100,000, the figures are that the Government shall provide 50 per cent., <Col N="291" /> that the local authority shall provide 37½ per cent.&mdash;that is, 87½ per cent.&mdash; and that the beneficiaries shall provide 12 per cent. from an ascertained improved value of 6 per cent.  Now, the best case that is put forward for this scheme, as supposed to be dealing with the best land, is that, of £100 spent on it, £6 will be represented by improved value in the land.  I think that Deputies should keep that particular case and those figures in mind when they feel that there has been delay and possibly a lack of consideration in forcing forward drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>I, personally, in going over the records of the Board of Works and the schemes which have been passed, have been astonished at the generosity &mdash;if I am not using too complimentary a term&mdash;of the State and local authorities in contributions to schemes. Schemes have been passed, in which the ascertained improved value of the land as a result of the total money spent, has been a very negligible proportion of the amount spent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and others raised the question of the difficulty of collecting these annuities.  The argument is that the whole of the drainage work should be what is called a national charge.  Everything is supposed to be a national charge.  I am afraid people are under the impression that in calling a thing a national charge they escape paying for it.  Calling a thing a national charge simply means collecting the same money from the same people in, possibly, different proportions but in many cases people who are demanding things as a national charge, in relation to particular works, will find, if they analyse the matter, that if that demand is granted they will in fact be paying more than they would pay under the present system. The real objection to things being a local charge is that people know that they are paying for them.  That is what people object to.  They think that if the expenditure is paid out of the national Exchequer, well, they are not as conscious of it, but I think it is very desirable that, in relation to a great many things that are now being paid out of the national <Col N="292" /> Exchequer, local authorities and local people ought to pay that amount, at any rate, of the total charge which will make them fully conscious that the expenses of these works are being met by them and not by some amorphous authority called the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggests that the Board of Works should do all drainage, great and small.  We had the 1928 Act under which the local authority did carry out works up to £1,200. We are of opinion ourselves that if drainage works of that kind should be carried out, the figure at which the Board of Works would operate might be a larger figure, but there are types of work which undoubtedly can be carried out by the local authorities, where the local engineering staff is competent and experienced in drainage work, cheaper than we could do them.  In these cases it would be very undesirable that a central organisation like the Board of Works should carry out work which could be done by the local authority.  That is one of the things which will come before the commission.  They will probably be asked to advise us what is the nature of the works that should be carried out by the central authority, what type of work should be carried out by the local authority and what should be the line of delimitation between the two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish has asked me about Wexford Harbour.  I do not need to tell Deputy Corish or anybody in Wexford that I am quite as interested in their harbour as anybody could be. I have very old and very intimate associations with Wexford, and I know its harbour very well, but the position of the Board of Works in this matter is that of technical adviser to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance. Our function has been performed.  We have examined that case and we have reported on that case.  Our work is finished.  We are prepared, we have been prepared in the past and we shall be prepared in future, to the limit of our legal powers, to help.  We have exceeded them on certain occasions, and not with the pleasantest consequences to ourselves, in the <Col N="293" /> attempt to help Wexford Harbour. Our function in the matter is exhausted. It is now for the Deputy to deal with those Ministers whom we have technically advised.</P>

Again, in advising these Ministers we do not want to take the risk of putting upon Wexford, under the impression that they are getting something very beneficial, something that may not be beneficial.  Rosslare Strand erosion, and later the question of Lahinch erosion, have been raised. There was a commission appointed in relation to that in 1929.  It did report, and I shall only just give you the first of its unsatisfactory decisions.  It reads somewhat as follows&mdash;in other words I am not quoting the document: The Saorstát Government should not assume, in general practice, responsibility for the defence of the coast.  It might give assistance in special cases, on special conditions. That is all they did report.  The Department which that concerned is not the Board of Works.  Again, the Minister for Industry and Commerce took power, as a result, I should say, of a commission of this kind, a power which he is exercising at the moment, to prevent people doing damage by removing part of the foreshore, as they were doing even at the most critical points, for the purposes of road-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry says that of the £900,000, £700,000 is spent in Dublin. I am going to interest myself in finding out what proportion of the total actually is spent in Dublin.  There are certain reasons why it should be spent here.  It is the centre of Government and it pays a very large proportion of the total funds that are spent here. There is no means of preventing that, but still it would be worth while knowing.  Deputy Corry says that Dun Laoghaire Harbour is very expensive, but it is actually a profit.  It pays for itself.  I think Deputy Corry is aware of the difficulties in relation to the <Col N="294" /> airport in Cork.  Some of them reside in Cork.  Every effort will be made at this end, at any rate, to help on anyone in Cork who desires effectively to contribute to the carrying out of that enterprise.</P>

Deputy Brennan calls attention to the increase of staff in the special works division, which I think was probably the only comment which would be in order on that particular portion of the Estimate.  Well, last year we administered a fund of £500,000.  This year we have administered a fund of £2,500,000, and have laid down the works; the whole of that £2,500,000 has practically been absorbed on works which have been arranged.</P>

      <P>I am complimenting Deputy Brennan on having said the only orderly thing which could have been said on this.  He commented on the increase of staff.  The only answer to that is that the work has increased. I am perfectly satisfied that there is no Department in the whole State in which the men are working harder and more effectively than in that Department.  I am perfectly satisfied to invite any inquiry of any sort, kind or description, into that matter.  My only feeling is that I am perhaps working some of my men harder than I am entitled to do.</P>

      <P>The question has been raised that the local authorities staff has been hampered in doing this work, but I think we had better leave that over until another occasion.  The Viceregal Lodge has been arranged to be a museum.  No information has been given to me, at any rate, that it is to be used for any other purpose, nor do I believe that there is an intention to use it for any other purpose. The intention is to convert it into a folklore museum.  Plans and estimates are out for that, and I think that contracts are actually in process of consideration. In regard to the Roscommon Abbey, I remember going into that matter at the time, and my impression is that we are up against a legal difficulty.  At any rate I will look into the matter and communicate with Deputy Brennan in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan of Clare wants to know what is going to happen to the Fergus.  I wish I knew.  The Fergus has been a very unfortunate case. After a considerable amount of work had been done her banks broke down. Those banks were repaired again, and in a new place that old bank gave away.  There is reason to believe that the whole of the bank which has been pierced on more than one occasion is structurally unsound.  It goes back for a very long time; it is not due to the structure of the bank, but to the nature of the ground upon which that bank has been built.  We have had to try back from that bank to find further in&mdash;at the price of sacrificing certain of the land which is now flooded&mdash;a basis upon which we could build a solid bank.  Now, that would seem all right, but we are not satisfied that if we do that we are at the end of the trouble in relation to existing banks.  It is a very serious question as to whether or not we should spend more money on that enterprise, or whether we should not recognise that just as an army retreats to get into a sounder position <Col N="296" /> we may have to accept a new line on the Fergus as a line which we can defend from the mixture of tidal action, wind action and flood action.  That is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The bog-slide is a matter on which we did, under another Vote, give certain assistance to the people whose property had been damaged there, but apart from that it is a matter for the Land Commission and not for us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane raised the question of Brick and Cashen.  He made the rather extraordinary suggestion that in a scheme of £100,000 we should try an experiment of £10,000.  Now, I am all for experiment.  I believe that in ordinary cases it is best to do something somewhere and see what happens, but this is one of the cases in which I think experiment is completely ruled out.  I cannot see that an experiment would give us any information of value in relation to the Brick and Cashen.  In relation to arterial drainage, broadly speaking I do not know any portion of that arterial drainage in which experiments would give valuable information.  If for instance it was a question of getting to know the nature and quality of an embankment that would stand up in certain circumstances, I would have no hesitation in saying that an experiment of that kind would be useful, or if it was a question of whether you could, by making models of an estuary, discover what would happen in the matter of silting or anything of that kind, that would be a perfectly legitimate experiment and well worth the money, but that would be the investigating of the effect of a continuous process of some kind, as, for instance, how much silt was going to be carried down under the bar of a certain river for a certain period of years under certain circumstances.  The difficulty we are up against in regard to the Brick and Cashen, Rosslare Harbour, Wexford Harbour, Arklow Harbour and other places, is what would happen in the sudden unpredictable action of natural forces in the way of tide, wind or storm, and I do not see how a £10,000 experiment in that matter would be of assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Somebody raised the question of the cost of administration.  All that I am concerned with is that I was asked whether the salary of the chairman was pensionable.  It is.  Deputy Nally referred to the question of the Gweston, Pollock and Yellow Rivers.  A valuation and survey have been made in those cases.  The question of resultant flooding is being looked into, and the scheme is being considered, but in addition to the question of resultant flooding it has to be remembered that the scheme will require free grants of 92 per cent. at least.  In other words, the very best estimate is an 8 per cent. deficiency&mdash;a very good example of the phrase which I used in regard to the incalculable value of a drainage scheme of this character.  In regard to the Robe, he asked whether an extension could be made on that.  A major extension of the scheme is not permissible, as the Act does not allow of land not included in the scheme being assessed for benefit.  It is open to those interested to proceed by way of separate petition if the scheme is considered large enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey is well aware of the difficulties in relation to the Nenagh scheme.  Once it is turned down by the nominal beneficiaries, as it has been in this particular case, our function is exhausted in the matter.  We can do no more.  That scheme, as far as I remember, is about 30 per cent. economic, and, curiously enough, it is the schemes which are fairly economic which are turned down by farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent. and 17 per cent. from the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is 67 per cent.  It is 33 per cent. economic, but they have turned it down, and we can do nothing in the matter.  It may be a matter for the drainage commission. It is certainly a question which they would consider, whether there are any circumstances in which a government and a local authority would carry out a drainage scheme over the heads of a hostile vote of those who are supposed to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary uses the expression, <Col N="298" />&ldquo;a hostile vote.&rdquo;  I think it is only fair to say that even after the 67 per cent.&mdash;that is, the 50 per cent. plus the 17 per cent. from the county council&mdash;the drainage rate on the lands benefited varied from, I think, 2/6 per acre to 26/- per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point which I want the Deputy to understand. It was rejected by the people who were asked to pay that rate.  It was rejected by people who were told that their land had been improved by £3 an acre.  It was rejected by people who were told that their land had been improved by 2/6 an acre.  If those figures are reduced, then it simply means that the thing is going to be less economic.  In other words, this was rejected because it was a scheme in which there was a very considerable calculable benefit to the land as a result of it.  Again, I want to say to the Deputy that in this matter we can do nothing.  The local people can come forward again with a petition, but they will have to be prepared to accept as a fact that they will vote for a scheme and for a contribution by the local benefited landowners on the estimated value of that benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come back to the other question with regard to the commission: whether there are any circumstances under which a government will insist on carrying out a drainage scheme against the will of those who are going to benefit by it.  Again, that is a question on which we do not know what the advice of the commission will be, but it is one of those questions which the commission might well consider. Take a case like Brick and Cashen in which it is estimated there is going to be a six per cent. improvement. Having regard to all the delays, all the expenses of the commissions, and inquiries and everything else that had to be carried out in relation to that scheme, because people are going to be asked to contribute even six per cent., there is the idea in the minds of some people that, where the total benefit is below a certain amount, it would pay the State probably better to do the whole work themselves than attempt to collect annuities of that kind over the period <Col N="299" /> over which they would have to be collected. That is an open question.  It is one of the questions which will be considered by the commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new headquarters in Kildare Street, at the start I got together my technical and administrative officers and asked them to lay down a schedule of the time it would take to build from the time that we agreed to advertise for plans and specifications.  I was astonished myself as a non-professional man in relation to that particular matter at the time.  We checked over those time schedules.  A very considerable period is required.  Take the plans sent in&mdash;the plans that won the prize. They are not the plans on which you work.  They have to be redrafted. Quantity surveyors have to be let loose on them.  Then there is the giving of the contracts.  The time schedule that we laid down before we started is not being exceeded.  As a matter of curiosity, I would be perfectly willing to let the Deputy look at the originals. He will have to accept it that all those things are being done under the highest possible professional and administrative advice.  There is no delay which could be avoided taking place in regard to the new headquarters at Kildare Street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it does not take four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is going to take four years from the time it is started until it is finished.  With regard to the Thurles post office, in this case the Board of Works is not to blame.  We build things for other Departments and they have to be satisfied.  We have succeeded in getting over the lawyers, but we still have to build the house in a way in which the people who are going to live in it like.  The Deputy is interested in Kilmastulla river.  My recollection of this river is that it is one which has a very high and very steep catchment area.  The water comes down in wild floods and washes everything out.  The engineering difficulties are considerable, and the estimates and plans had to be revised several times in the light of experience that we have had in other places. <Col N="300" /> It will cost somewhere about £11,500. A grant of 50 per cent. from the Government has been sanctioned.  The county council will probably contribute the balance.  This looks to be a 100 per cent. uneconomic scheme.  It is probable that the delay will be less than usual if the county council are going to contribute half and the Government the other half.  We do not anticipate much delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would not be so optimistic if he had a more intimate knowledge of the present financial capacity of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a scheme which is 100 per cent. uneconomic.  The evidence is that if the county council are prepared to find 50 per cent., the Government is prepared to find its percentage. It does not look as if anybody is holding up drainage schemes in this country on the ground of money.  Deputy Flynn of Kerry is interested in some drainage work which I hope to discuss with him on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the other case was a question of wages in forestry&mdash;15/- and so on.  As the Deputy remarked, there is a very wide discrepancy.  At the moment, I cannot naturally identify every one of these, but I will look into the matter and let him know.  I think it will probably be found to be boys, or something of that kind.  Deputy Keyes wants to know whether any further work is to be done at the Limerick Labour Exchange.  It is not intended to do any further work there at present. Maintenance work will be done as it is required by the Department responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that no provision has been made for putting the dock at Haulbowline back at least into the condition it was originally.  Its present condition is due to the neglect of the Board of Works.  This dockyard was handed over in perfect condition to the Board of Works.  We have had in this House each year a Vote for a pretty large sum for the maintenance of Haulbowline dockyard.  Portion of the dockyard was leased to a firm of shipbrokers who were supposed, at any rate, to be responsible for the proper maintenance of the property leased to them.  After having been leased for a number of years, this portion of the dockyard, which contains the dock itself, has now been handed back to the Board of Works.  Some time ago the Cork Harbour Commissioners had occasion to investigate the matter. <Col N="304" /> Tenders were invited for putting the dock back into the same condition in which it was when these people took it over.  I was rather amazed to find that a tender came in from the people to whom it had been leased by the Board of Works, and who were responsible for its proper maintenance while it was leased to them.  The estimate for putting the dock back into the same condition as it was in when they took it was £12,000.  In plain language, Government property which was leased by the Board of Works to a certain firm was damaged to the extent of £12,000 while, at the same time, we were paying from £2,000 to £5,000 yearly to people to mind it. The Parliamentary Secretary has been generous to the Phoenix Park as, apparently, it was considered worth while spending £4,000 on gates there.</P>

      <P>That is a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it will bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary what his ideas then were, as to what should be done with this dockyard. He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the first thing that we have got clear to-day is that the Government do intend, and I congratulate them, to say that that piece of property which may have potential value but which has no immediate value shall be maintained in the condition in which its potentialities can be realised, when the time comes, with the smallest possible cost to the State.  That is the problem which <Col N="305" /> they have had to face, and I take it that that is the problem which they intend to face in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary at that time congratulated the former Government on taking that step. Since then damage to the extent of £12,000 has been done during a period when this dock was leased.  We are faced in Cobh with this position, that when a ship came there recently for repairs she had to be pulled to the site of the derelict dockyard and a few bags of cement had to be mixed and put into a hole in her side until she was taken away to England to be repaired. During the past four months four oil tankers that were lying there have been removed to England, and insurance amounting to £2,000 per ship had to be paid to cover their removal to England.  The repairs could have been done in Cobh had this dockyard been in proper condition to dry-dock vessels.  After all, a Government Department has a certain responsibility in this matter, and if this dockyard had a potential value in 1929, it has a potential value to-day. All I ask is that the dock should be put back into the condition in which it was when leased, seeing that the Board of Works is responsible for its maintenance.  Steps should also be taken to see that those responsible for the damage should put the dockyard into the condition it was in when leased.  We are entitled to have that done.  I consider it to be an extraordinary thing that damage to the extent of £12,000 could be done to a dockyard while the responsible Government Department was paying people from £2,000 to £5,000 to mind it.  As a representative of the people of Cobh, I claim that this Government Department was responsible for seeing that the dockyard was kept in repair, yet the Department allowed the damage to be done.  I raised this question on February 17th, and I asked if compensation had been received from those who did the damage.  I maintain that whatever amount of compensation was received should go towards putting the dockyard into a proper condition.  I do not think that was asking anything <Col N="306" /> unreasonable.  I do not know the Board of Works expert who estimated the amount of damage that had been done but taking damage that was done by the gentlemen responsible, they had the neck&mdash;I cannot call it anything else&mdash;to estimate for Cork Harbour Commissioners that it would cost £12,500 to put the dockyard back into the position in which it was previously.  If that is the position, surely a Government Department is responsible.  If we are to provide £3,435 as well as the wages of the staff, amounting to £2,825, and as similar amounts had to be paid previously, I contend that Government property should be looked after, and we should not be faced with the position at present existing in Cobh. Employment worth at least £100,000 has gone away from that harbour during the past 12 months for want of a dry-dock.  I believe there is a dockyard in Dublin building &ldquo;duck&rdquo; boats.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tom Kelly apparently was missing from the House half an hour ago when I pointed out that out of £900,000 of the Estimate, £700,000 was being spent in Dublin and about £200,000 in the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What harm was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit, so far as Deputy Tom Kelly is concerned.  The harm falls on the poor devils down the country who have to find the money. Take this particular case of Haulbowline. That has been admitted to be one of the three largest dockyards in the British Isles.  A very definite proposal was made, and a very decent and generous amount of assistance was offered by the Harbour Commissioners in Cork who were desirous of putting that dockyard into a proper state of <Col N="307" /> repair.  The assistance offered was too generous considering that the Government themselves were responsible for having the dockyard in its present condition. Surely the whole of Cork County was not to blame for the damage done by others to that dockyard. It would seem from the way in which we are treated here, by every Government that comes along, as if Cork was regarded as the Cinderella of the country.  We are entitled to fair play, and we are entitled, when we have a valuable asset such as that dockyard undoubtedly is, to say that it is the duty of the Government Department responsible to keep it in a proper state and in a proper condition. In the words of the Parliamentary Secretary, it may not be of use to-day, but there is a time coming when it will be of use.  From time to time I have been down there, and I was shown where the man who had this dockyard walked in there with sledges and broke up valuable pieces of machinery so that he could buy it up as scrap.  I spoke of that thing in this House in 1929 when I called the attention of the then Government to the fact that that had been done to the machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot blame Deputy McMenamin.  He knows nothing about it.  We would gladly spare him to the Six Counties.  It would be a relief if they took him.  What I now want to know is when is this work going to be done?  When is the Board of Works going to put back that dockyard into the condition in which it was?  I want to know why it was brought to its present condition.  I may be told that there was no negligence.  I maintain there was, and the present state of that dock proves negligence.  We had that particular gentleman offering to put the docks back in the same condition as he got it, and that offer was handed over to the Parliamentary Secretary himself. On behalf of the people of Cobh I claim that we are entitled to have that dock put back into the same condition as it was.</P>
      <P>The employment that has now been lost to the young people of Cobh could be found again if that dock were put back into its proper condition. That is a thing to which the people of Cobh are entitled.  Is that going to be done and, if not, what is the reason?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that spending £12,000 in putting that dockyard back into the position in which it was, is at least as important as spending £4,000 or £5,000 in fixing an archway or gateway into the Phoenix Park? The money spent in Cobh would be as well spent, at least.  I hope to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary a satisfactory answer on this point.  If not, we cannot finish to-night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in this House gets a sort of creepy feeling down the back when he is told he is going to be reminded of something he said in B.C. 59.  Most of us look back upon our lives with thoughts and recollections that do produce feelings of heat and mental disturbance.  I think it would be very unwise for any Deputy to look back seven or eight years in this House and say that in the whole records of the proceedings since, nobody could find anything in his legislative past which would be rather a horrible ghost to bring up before him.  For that reason I did look forward to that sort of thrill we have at 12 o'clock at night when people are told the ghost walks.  I did look with a sort of stimulation to the prospect of having the worst thing that Deputy Corry could imagine in relation to myself and in connection with Haulbowline, dragged into the light this evening.  I have heard it and I say it is a very poor ghost.  I have no objection to Deputy Corry repeating now what I said in 1929. What I did say was that Haulbowline may have potential possibilities, but that it had no immediate use.  That is what I said then and that is what I say now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  As far as evidence has been put before me by any responsible person, that is the position.  I am not now concerned with wild statements about £100,000 worth of work being turned away from Haulbowline.  The only evidence produced in support of that statement is that a boat was towed into Haulbowline and was repaired by the use of a couple of sacks of cement. Deputy Corry has had full opportunity to bring forward any further evidence on that point, and he has not done so.  I am speaking as one friendly to Haulbowline, as one who is anxious to see brought out any potential possibility which that dockyard has, and I see that Deputy Corry <Col N="310" /> has fallen down on the job of proving his case.  He has put forward no evidence in proof of his statement that I have driven away £100,000 that could have been got for repairing ships in Cobh.  The only ship brought in was one which was repaired without going into the dry dock, with a couple of bags of cement.  Now, I am putting it in that form because I do want from somebody a case which I can put to the Minister for Finance when I go to him to ask for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Why did you?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are worried about is whether Deputy Corry has made the case that we should now spend an indefinite sum of money, which would be considerably more than £12,000, in putting that dock in condition&mdash;for what?  For the one hundred thousand mythical pounds that Deputy Corry has imagined, so that we may tow a ship alongside where we could now tow her to repair her, as she was repaired with a bag of cement in Cork Harbour.  There is a responsible committee dealing with this matter, a committee of the lower harbour, which has at its disposal all the information and all the evidence it is possible to get.  I am dealing with that committee. I am prepared to regard anything it puts forward as responsible.  I am asking the members of that committee to say that there is £100,000 worth of work which could and would have been done.  They have not said anything of the kind.  What Deputy Corry wants to do is to go back to that committee and bring to it any evidence, any documents, any facts, which he can produce which will convince them to the extent to which they will put their signature <Col N="311" /> upon a statement.  Then I will consider it as very responsible evidence.</P>
      <P>At the present moment I am not satisfied, much as I would like to be satisfied, that if Haulbowline was there that any of that work would have been done.  It is a dock 618 feet long.  It is undoubtedly the biggest dock in the Free State.  It is three times as big as any dock in Dublin, and it is three times as unsuitable for the purpose of doing any ordinary repair work.  It is an expensive dock to work.  Deputy Corry may want a man merely to state what suits him.  I have to state what I have to state to the Minister for Finance when I ask that public money shall now be expended upon it.  That dock was built as part of a huge institution, the British Government.  It was never economic as far as they were concerned.  It cost £20,000 or £30,000 a year, but that did not matter to them. They were building it up for another purpose, a purpose which I think it did serve during the Great War.  It was an expensive piece of preparation as far as they were concerned.  They could afford to have, as they have all over the world, extensive coaling stations and extensive dockyards and aerodromes waiting for the chance of using them in times of war emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, you must not put on a parallel line the user of the same thing for a commercial affair.  Imagine Gibraltar being used merely as a commercial harbour.  Imagine trying to get agricultural crops out of the land that they keep as part of a fort.  What I am asking the responsible people to do is to put forward a case on which I can go to the Minister for Finance. Up to the present, I want to say perfectly clearly, and I say it for the purpose of helping those whose business <Col N="312" /> it will be to produce that case, that no case has yet been produced, that no evidence has been put in my possession, which would enable me to ask the Minister for Finance to spend £20,000, not £12,000, on putting Haulbowline into a merely skeleton condition as a dock.  No evidence has been produced to me that if we did do it there would be any user commensurate with that expenditure.  As soon as ever I can get that evidence, and I am very anxious to get that evidence, I will use it with the effect with which I can use it if it is evidence over which I can stand.</P>
    <P>Wild assertions of any kind are not going to affect the issue.  Let Deputy Corry and those others who are interested take what I am saying into serious consideration.  I may say I am a member of that committee myself, though I keep away from it because I happen to have the other capacity in relation to it.  I am actually providing them with the information which will enable them, if they have the evidence in their possession, to provide me with a case.</P>

There is no statement in that report of £100,000 worth of work being driven out of the port, no statement of the kind.  I do not want to deal with that statement at the moment.  I will just mention that the report does not bear out what Deputy Corry has said.</P>
