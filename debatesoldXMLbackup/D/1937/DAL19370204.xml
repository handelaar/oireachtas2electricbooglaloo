      <P>The figures required by the Deputy have not hitherto been compiled by calendar years, and owing to the large number of heads on which bounty has been paid at some time or other during the period under review it would not have been possible to compile them by calendar years within the time allowed.  The information is, however, already available for financial years, and I am having incorporated in the Official Report a table giving the information for each of the three financial years to the 31st March, 1936, and for the nine months from the 1st April, 1936, to the 31st December, 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state why he deemed it expedient to reduce by order the quantity of home-grown wheat to be used by Irish millers in 1936-37.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to unfavourable weather conditions during the period of growth, the yield of the 1936 wheat crop was lower than the average yield for recent years. Consequently the quantity of home-grown wheat available for milling was less than was estimated at the time that the National Percentage Order was made in December, 1935.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that hardship is imposed on the people in the country by the admixture scheme.  I am satisfied that the results of the scheme have been beneficial to the country, and I do not intend to discontinue this policy which results in the increased consumption of home-grown grain in substitution for imported feeding stuffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of pure Indian meal in Derry City at present is £7 per ton and in Belfast £6 17s. 6d. per ton, while the price of the admixture is £9 5s. 0d. to £10 a ton?  Does the Minister believe that the imposition of an extra 2/6 or 3/- per cwt. is not putting an impossible hardship on people in the poor parts of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the desperate plight to which the small farmers in West Cork have been reduced?  Is he aware of the position, especially in Durrus, about which representations have been made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Surely the Minister for Agriculture must be aware that many of these small farmers are reduced to the verge of starvation in portions of West Cork, especially the portion I have mentioned, and does he not know that they are in a desperate position at the present moment?  My information is based on the correspondence which has taken place between the parish priest of that district and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to allowing Indian meal in free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in large areas in West Donegal maize meal is used as a human food, and that the increased cost has placed an immense burden on those people? Is he further aware that the increased cost of maize meal mixture has placed an immense burden of at least 18/- a pig on every producer of fat pigs in the country?  Is he further aware that, comparing the prices ruling for barley and oats in this country up to the harvest of last year with those ruling in 1931, there has been no increase in the average price of barley and oats at all, and that while there has been no increase in the price of barley or oats, there has been an increase of from 3/- to 5/-, according to the time, in the price of maize meal mixture as compared with the price of plain meal in Northern Ireland and Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that certain correspondence has taken place between representatives in Durrus, West Cork, and his Department or the Department of Industry and Commerce? Therefore, I think that we should have at this stage, either from the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, some statement which would guide those people <Col N="182" /> in the future.  Is the Minister prepared to allow in the Indian meal free of duty?  The Minister must be aware that the cost of the mixture to those poor people is one that they cannot bear, and that it is not economic for them to produce pigs.  The Minister must be aware of all those facts.  In view of the circumstances which I have related, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce must, I feel sure, be aware that something should be done to relieve the position of the unfortunate farmers in that part of the country.  They are almost on the verge of starvation.  They are living to-day on potatoes and milk.  They cannot afford to buy bread, and that is a fact that cannot be disputed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether under the powers conferred on him by Section 137 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, he will require from the Pigs Marketing Board (1) a return of the moneys they have collected under Section 147 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, from curers; (2) statistics of any payments made out of the fund so collected; and information as to the basis on which such payments, if any, were calculated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to ask the Pigs Marketing Board to furnish the returns suggested by the Deputy.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that at the present moment the Pigs Marketing Board is illegally and fraudulently transferring the funds of the hypothetical price fund to the curers in order to compensate the curers for any losses that the curers may have sustained on bacon exported to the British market during the past twelve months?  Does he not himself remember that he gave an undertaking that the hypothetical price fund would be used exclusively for the purpose of increasing the price of pigs for the benefit of producers during the months of February, March, April, May, and June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first statement made by the Deputy could only be made by someone entirely irresponsible.  It was a very serious statement to make.  Of course, the statement is untrue, but that is nothing strange from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Is he to be completely unlike any ordinary ratepayer who, when he gets notice of a demand for increased rates from the local body, naturally asks himself and his neighbours or anybody he can get from the local authorities, why the rates should be mounting; and is the reason why the Minister makes no enquiry in this matter that he is paying the rates out of the taxpayers' pocket and not out of his own pocket?  If the Minister claims that he is the same as any other ratepayer, I think we are entitled to hear from him what he has to say on this very large additional provision.  I think the House is entitled to get some expression of opinion from the Minister. Is he silent on this matter because the rates are being driven up by Government policy?</P>

      <P>The two reasons given in the particulars for this additional demand are that in some rating areas the rates are higher and, secondly, in some cases, more rateable property was acquired by Departments. It is the second reason which arouses my curiosity, and I want to ask the Minister for Finance if he would give any indication as to which <Col N="201" /> Departments acquired more rateable property.</P>

      <P>I should like to supplement the question by asking what is meant by the item under the head C&mdash;Contributions towards Rates on Premises occupied by Representatives of External Governments.  In the original Estimate there is nothing, and so, apparently, there were no contributions towards premises by representatives of external Governments.  In the revised Estimate there is a sum of £750.  These are not the rates on a cottage, and surely the Minister ought to be able to give us some explanation about a foreign Government which, presumably, has come in since the rates were struck, and occupied a premises which, at 20/- in the £, would amount to a rateable valuation of £750.  Surely that cannot be a question beneath the notice of the Minister, and we are entitled to ask if external Governments are pouring in at this rate and what the premises are that were occupied which would drive the valuation of them upon the rates for this year.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Dockrell, the position is that until 1932-33 provision was made in this Estimate, No. 17, for making contributions towards the rates on premises occupied by <Col N="203" /> representatives of external Governments; that is to say, for contributions towards the non-beneficial rates on premises occupied by representatives of external Governments.  In the years 1933-34 and up to the present year, this provision did not appear in the Estimate, because the question of reciprocal concessions in regard to this matter arose.  The position since then has been clarified, and henceforward provision will be made by this country on a basis of strict reciprocity. The fact that an adjustment has been made in regard to this matter has involved the provision in this year's Estimate to cover, not merely the contribution which would be made in one year, but to cover the arrears of contributions since 1932-33.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain what he means by reciprocity in this matter, and to what extent are we being relieved of any rates abroad in respect of rates that Legations here are being relieved of?  To what extent are we being charged rates abroad in respect of Legations that the Minister is now causing to pay rates here?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear, Sir, that the Minister for Finance is trying to provoke Deputies in this House, because it is grotesque for the Minister for Finance to say that he has come in here to introduce an Estimate, calling for the expenditure of £720 in connection with his own Department, but that he requires notice of any question arising <Col N="204" /> in connection with that expenditure. The whole Estimate procedure, Sir, becomes farcical if the Minister comes in here and says that he will answer no inquiry in regard to the substance of the Estimate, whether he has the information or whether he has not, and that if anything arises on the Estimate it must be put down by way of Parliamentary Question which can only be answered after the Estimate is disposed of.  Now, we have no guiding line here as to whether this increase in the rates is due to the acquisition of new property or to the ordinary rise in the rates.  Therefore, we can only give our own conjecture as to what this Estimate arises from.  Deputy MacDermot may have noticed that, in his own constituency, the county council recently struck the rate, but when the general Estimate was before them they were informed that the board of health estimate was up by £5,000, the asylum estimate was up by £2,000, and the vocational education estimate was up by £1,000.  It was therefore decided that there could be no new steamrolling done in the county at all this year because there was no money to pay for it.  The chairman of the county council anticipated that this was merely a momentary difficulty and that at the end of the financial year it would have disappeared and he turned to his colleague the Fianna Fáil chairman of the board of health to confirm that view. The chairman of the board of health said he was sorry that he could not give any confirmation, that the estimate of the board of health was up by £5,000 this year and that it would be up by £3,000 next year.  I then directed the attention of the local authority, as I now direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that we have come to the end of four glorious years' spending of borrowed money and that we have now started on 60 weary years of repayment.  While that repayment is going on, this Supplementary Estimate is going to come in here again and again for 60 weary years.</P>

      <P>That is very typical of <Col N="205" /> Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;Let us be merry while we may.&rdquo;  I had occasion on a previous discussion to liken the Fianna Fáil Party to a gentleman who went out on the spree.  There was a friend of his who urged him to be prudent, when he was rolling out of a public-house and he replied: &ldquo;Let us be merry.&rdquo;  He was asked &ldquo;What are you going to do to-morrow if you have a sore head?&rdquo;  His answer was: &ldquo;Who knows that I will not be dead to-morrow?&rdquo;  That is the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party now.  You have had four glorious years of spending borrowed money and you are going to start on 60 years of repayment.  That is what this Supplementary Estimate is for, to make the State contribution to the first of the 60 instalments on the debts at present outstanding.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  It is an instalment by the State in respect of the first payment by local authorities of their first instalment on the accumulated debts of the last four years. Many Deputies think that this is a peculiar Supplementary Estimate just as the Chairman of the Roscommon County Council thought the demand was only for one year, but I want to inform them that they are going to get this Supplementary Estimate every year for the next 60 years. Your children and grandchildren will get it in this House.  Every year you will have to make a special contribution on behalf of the State towards the increased rates.  The State, however, can bear it.  Am I entitled to draw a distinction between the capacity of the State to find this money and the capacity of the man who has purchased a house and who is still paying instalments on the purchase price?</P>

      <P>The Minister has not given any explanation of the items which go to make up this Estimate.  I should like to ask him, for instance, if the increase in sub-head A is due to the recent increase in wages in the printing trade.  Under sub-head C&mdash; Carriage and Transit&mdash;there is an increase from £810 to £1,250.  That is an increase of 50 per cent., and it seems to me that some extraordinary transformation has taken place, because stationery is not a very bulky item.  You would transport a lot of stationery for £400.  There are some other items in which increases are <Col N="208" /> shown, but of course we can understand that the price of paper has risen recently.

There is, therefore, a substantial increase in the Estimate. It would appear as if that increase is to meet the cost of a new and extended service.  I should like the Minister to state what are the services that have brought about this extension in cost.  Perhaps he would explain if these higher amounts are due to the increased price of materials or to the extension of services.</P>

I also ask in what areas are there bondholders who are entitled to repayment and who have not claimed. Naturally we will not object to money for advertising in areas where there are bondholders who have not claimed. We want to pay all, but we object to providing money for advertising in districts where bondholders not only claimed but clamorously claimed, and one such area is the City of Dublin. You, Sir, must be the final judge to say whether so-and-so claimed, but with great respect, I do not see why we should advertise in Zanzibar. Naturally if there was a claimant there who did not claim, we might approve of advertising there.</P>

      <P>The amount now required is £1,000, and it is not for advertising.  It does represent an increase in the sub-head of the Vote, which covers not merely money required for advertising but salaries, wages and expenses of staff. This £1,000 does not provide for or include anything for advertising, but it does provide an amount that it is expected will be required to enable repayment to be made by March 31st, 1937, which is the date fixed by statute.</P>

Which are we to believe?  Is it the explanatory note or his <i>ex parte</i> statement?  He says he has no knowledge of the Estimate, and that anyone who wants an answer must put down a question.  I submit, with the explanatory note before us, that there is provision for advertising and that the Minister has deliberately tried to mislead the House.  However, I recognise that I am restricted in what I say to what is fairly relevant, If the Chair, having heard both sides, is of the opinion that there can be no reference to bondholders, despite the fact that there is provision for advertising, in deference to the Chair, I am prepared to accept that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Contingency Fund is a peculiar fund, as it arises as a result of Ministers in very grave emergencies making payments for which they have no special authority.  A certain fund is set aside, an omnibus fund, out of which unforeseen expenditure is met. They have no particular authority to make disbursements, and in these circumstances, they turn to the Contingency Fund after which a Supplementary Estimate is produced to reimburse that fund for the sums spent.  I suggest that it is easy to discuss these sub-heads under any Estimate, past or <Col N="216" /> present, and that the Minister could run down the items one after the other, having a note of each case in which payments were requisitioned.  We should like information as to the authority on which stamp duty was remitted on deeds and other instruments for public departments; what was spent on the equipment of a local building as a temporary place of worship following the malicious burning of Kilmallock Protestant Church; why was a plot procured beside the grave of Arthur Griffith; what were the expenses in connection with the Saorstát Legation official's funeral; and under what circumstances was bounty paid on the birth of triplets?  Five minutes would suffice to tell us.  There is nothing in this Supplementary Estimate that I can see that would in any way divide the House at all.  I think all these payments were probably amply justified, and one at least greatly became the Government.  It was a very graceful and proper gesture, and I do not hesitate to take this opportunity of complimenting them on the steps they took on the occasion of the obsequies of the late Senator Duggan.  It much became them and was a graceful gesture.  I think it would be a helpful thing if the Minister ran through the sub-heads and made a statement on them, and very possibly no further question would arise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has referred to these funeral expenses for a Saorstát Legation official.  He seems to know something about it.  There have been periods during the year when I was not in a position to follow what was happening in the world and I do not know anything about this case. I think that in the normal way the Government does not pay the funeral expenses of officials.  Is this a case of bringing a man's body home?  It may be that it was in the newspapers, but I never saw it, and the Minister ought to tell us something about it.  It is surely absolutely outside the ordinary line of Government expenditure to spend money on funerals.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity that Deputy Dillon is given to pontificating in regard to the Estimates because occasionally, just as the rest of us do, he makes mistakes.  It is not true to say that the Contingency Fund is there to meet grave emergencies and thereby to imply that it can only be resorted to when the emergency is grave.  As a matter of fact, the mere fact that the total provision made for the Contingency Fund amounts to £20,000 indicates at once that whatever else it is intended to deal with, it is not intended to allow Ministers to carry on in grave emergencies.  The main purpose of the fund is to defray urgent and unforeseen expenditure which is not covered by ordinary Votes and for which it may be impracticable to seek the immediate approval of the Dáil.  That is the main purpose and it has been modified somewhat in practice. For instance, if the amount taken from the Contingency Fund is comparatively small and one which is not likely to be contentious, and which does not raise any grave financial principle or any issue of public importance, the custom is to defer making the reimbursement to the Contingency Fund until towards the close of the financial year in which the fund has been availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has been raised by Deputy Dillon in regard to item No. 1 of the repayments which it is now proposed to make. <Col N="218" /> That item is for a sum of £586 8s. 6d. stamp duty on deeds and other instruments for public Departments.  It is an item which has appeared year after year since 1923, or since 1924, possibly, the position being that the Revenue Commissioners have had general authority to stamp free of cost to the parties concerned any deed or other instrument presented by a Government Department, the duty on which would otherwise become a charge on the Vote.  As no power, however, exists for the remission of stamp duty imposed by statute, the amount of the duty on such documents is recouped to the Revenue Commissioners from the Contingency Fund, and the purpose of the Vote is to reimburse the Contingency Fund for the amount so paid out of that fund by way of stamp duty to the Revenue Commissioners.  That has been the practice for many years, and it is quite obvious that, notwithstanding the dictum of Deputy Dillon, the payment of this stamp duty and the need for its payment does not constitute a grave emergency.  It is merely a matter of administrative convenience, an arrangement which conveniences the Revenue Commissioners and the Government Departments concerned, and which has been approved of year after year by the Dáil, and which has not been questioned until Deputy Dillon rose to question it here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item to which attention was directed was the second item for £96 6s. 2d. for the equipment of a local building as a temporary place of worship following the malicious burning of Kilmallock Protestant Church. The House will remember that the church in question was burned in July, 1935.  Immediately following this regrettable incident the Government decided that all the necessary repairs should be carried out at the expense of the State to render the church suitable for service on the following Sunday.  The church authorities, however, preferred the alternative of equipping the school, which accordingly was done by the Commissioners of Public Works.  It has been decided that the recoupment of that expenditure will not be sought, and accordingly <Col N="219" /> provision has been made out of the Contingency Fund to reimburse the appropriate Vote in that connection. I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything in regard to the third item, which was the amount required for the acquisition and perpetual care of a burial plot contiguous to the grave of the late President Arthur Griffith provided for the remains of a former member of his Ministry.</P>
    <P>The fourth item which has been questioned is the item of £21 7s. 3d. in connection with the funeral of a Saorstát Legation official who died on Legation premises.  The circumstances of this man's death were tragic.  It occurred on the Legation premises. He was found to be deeply in debt, and there was no possible way in which his burial expenses could be recouped, and he has been buried at the expense of the State in the country where he died.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £6,229 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1937, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Riaracháin na nAchtanna um Arachas Sláinte Náisiúnta, 1911 go 1934, agus an Achta um Pinsin do Bhaintreacha agus do Dhílleachtaithe, 1935, agus chun Ilsíntiúisí agus Ildeontaisí, ar a n-áirmhítear Deontaisí áirithe i gCabhair mar gheall ar Chostas Sochar agus Costaisí Riaracháin fé sna hAchtanna um Arachas Sláinte Náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £6,229 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses in connection with the Administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1934, and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, and for sundry Contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid, in respect of the Cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The bulk of the increased gross provision is accounted for by an additional amount estimated at £10,000 under sub-head F (2) required to meet: (a) the Exchequer proportion of the expenses of administration of the Unified Society, and (b) increased expenditure on sickness benefits.  As regards (a), certain expenditure fell to be made in the current financial year out of the administration account of the Unified Society in respect of purchase of premises and setting up a superannuation fund for staff.  Provision had been made for it in the year 1935-6, when £11,669 was unspent under this sub-head generally, but the final issues of moneys for the purposes referred to were not made until 1936-7.  The balance of the proposed additional provision is due to estimated increased sickness benefits during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head AA, the sum of £88 represents additional provision required owing to all work on the 1933 valuation of the Unified Society being unexpectedly completed in the current financial year by the British Government Actuary.  This work is performed under an agency arrangement.  With regard to sub-head G, District Medical Referee Service, the additional £220 is required by the number of persons attending for examination before the district medical referees being greater than was estimated for.</P>
    <P>The gross total additional sum required is, therefore, £10,308, which is partly offset by a saving of £200 under sub-head A, Salaries, etc., and by an estimated increase of £3,879 in Appropriations-in-Aid due to the fact that the amounts recovered from the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund were in excess of those estimated for. These amounts are recovered in accordance with Section 43 (2) of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, in respect of expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  The net Supplementary Estimate is accordingly £6,229.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had rather thought that the Minister would have made a <Col N="222" /> more detailed explanation under this Vote, because some of us had hoped that under the provisions of amalgamation there would be considerable savings in the cost of administration. The Minister now says that there is a saving of £200 in the additional Estimate, and he refers us to sub-head A in the main Vote.  When you turn to sub-head A in the main Vote you see that it is Salaries, Wages and Allowances, an item which is increased by £7,400, so that, presumably, there is now a saving of £200, which decreases the increase from £7,400 to £7,200. Some of us had thought that, presumably, the advantages of amalgamating all those insurance societies would be increased benefits and decreased cost of running the national health insurance. Personally, I am very sorry that for another year apparently the additional benefits which the worker was supposed to get have been swept away.  The Minister will remember that certain insurance societies had increased benefits, and that those now disappear.  We were led to suppose that there was going to be a saving in the cost of administering the Act. Apparently the workers are not getting more benefit, while there have been more contributions heaped on the employer.  One would think that with decreased benefits and a decreased amount of work there would be a saving.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether any Deputies in this House have read the statement which is laid on the Table of this House, and I do not know whether we are to read this additional Estimate in conjunction with that.  I would like to say that personally I do not approve of the procedure there adopted, because apparently the employer is expected to do a whole lot of work which was originally done by the approved societies.  The employed person, or &ldquo;the insured&rdquo; whichever you like to call him, is going to be taken out of the picture altogether.  Apparently he is now not going to have any responsibility at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to call the Minister's attention to some matters that will arise under those revised regulations. The employee objects because he <Col N="223" /> will not have an opportunity of finding out whether his card has been stamped for the period of his employment. His employer has to send in, over his head, his insurance card to the National Insurance Society.  The employer objects from the filing point of view.  The receipts are at present in alphabetical order.  In my young days I read a story about &ldquo;Convict 99.&rdquo; Apparently employees are now to be referred to not by their names but by their numbers.  That will be the position in the working of the National Health Insurance Society.  The order in which the files are kept will necessitate a separate file making future reference to the individual record more complicated. In the second place extra work is involved in keeping the files or lists which the Insurance Society now demands.  The names are not to be handed in in alphabetical order&mdash;in the order in which the employer has them.  They must be arranged in a digestible form for the society.  That extra work will come at an awkward time, at the end of the half year.  At the present time individual receipts can be got ready for signature at any time.  Lists will have to be prepared at the time of the disposal of the cards or at the time when employees may be dismissed or taken on.</P>
    <P>In the case of dishonesty on the part of the employer&mdash;and I suppose there are dishonest employers&mdash;the fraud would not be discovered for six months or possibly a longer time than six months.  The card that would have been supposed to have been sent in may not have been sent in at all.  There is another matter I have to mention and which I do not think is at all fair. The employees will have to be interviewed as to whether the correct particulars are entered on their cards. Apparently, that additional burden is thrown on the employer.  The employer runs the risk of a large outlay at any time when called upon to stamp cards. If any irregularity&mdash;with which the employer possibly would have nothing to do&mdash;were discovered it may be very prejudicial to the employer.  That is the sort of irregularity that should have been discovered sooner if the present system were continued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> I have already referred to the fact that the cards will have to be put back in alphabetical order on receiving them from the insurance society.  The new cards received from the society, presumably in numerical order, will require alterations on being put on to the alphabetical files.  When the approved societies were working, most of the employees handed in new cards when coming to sign for or stamp their cards.  This has not been the case since the amalgamation took place and very many cards are now in arrears.</P>
    <P>I would like to call the Minister's very serious attention to the undesirability of cutting the employee out of this transaction altogether.  This is a system in which everything is done for the employee&mdash;his contribution is deducted off him, his card is stamped by the employer and is by him handed to the insurance society.  I am not complaining so much about making deductions or stamping the cards, but I think it would give an additional protection if the employee were asked to stamp his own card.  I think it is a most undesirable practice to have the responsibility for the contribution withdrawn altogether from the employee.</P>
    <P>It is rather hard to understand why, in the face of decreased benefits and decreased work on the part of the amalgamated society, we are faced with increased costs.  Perhaps the Minister can excuse it by saying that there are decreases in the increases. I would like the Minister when replying to deal fully with this point and also with the regulations which, I take it, are to be made in conjunction with the present Supplementary Estimates which have been laid on the Table of this House.</P>

      <P>This is only a Supplementary Estimate.  Therefore in the brief statement that I read I only dealt with the sub-heads with which we were primarily concerned&mdash;with the moneys that we are seeking.  I did not make any general statement with regard to the working of the national <Col N="225" /> health insurance system during the last year or explain whether there was any increase or decrease in the cost of administration or the numbers or anything of that kind.  I do not know whether I would have been permitted by the Chair on a Supplementary Estimate to give a review of these matters.</P>

      <P>The Chair had some difficulty in endeavouring to bring the contribution of Deputy Dockrell under any of the sub-heads of the Supplementary Estimate.  Administration and general policy are not debated on a Supplementary Estimate.  However, if the Minister desires at the request of the House to go more fully into the matter, the Chair will not rule stringently. But it will not be permissible, when the Minister has concluded, to proceed to debate the general policy of national health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have an opportunity in probably less than a month of going into the whole matter when the ordinary Estimates come up for discussion.  The whole question of national insurance policy can then be gone into by any Deputies interested in the subject.  The primary cause of the demand for an increased Vote here, arises from the fact that the amalgamated society is instituting a superannuation scheme for its staff.  The increase is £10,000 but this is modified by decreases on other heads and the net increase is £6,229.  It is because of the institution of this superannuation scheme that this Supplementary Vote is required.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other items to which I wish to refer&mdash;the actuaries and the medical referees.  There is a slight increase in the one case of £88 and in the other an increase of £220. But the real cause of the need for the Supplementary Vote is in order to provide for a superannuation scheme for the staff of the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the question of decreased benefits.  Except <Col N="226" /> in the case of a very small number of societies and a relatively very small proportion of members of National Health Insurance there have been no decreases.  There was a small number of societies that were in a kind of privileged position.  Because of certain types of persons that belonged to those societies, the societies were in a position to give better benefits to their members than were the vast bulk of the societies that existed before unification.  The members of the societies able to give special benefits have certainly lost, and so far as that small number is concerned there are decreased benefits. For the vast majority of the insured there are neither increased nor decreased benefits.  Deputy Dockrell referred to a regulation and said that it put an extra burden on employers. That, I would like to tell him, is not a regulation.  It is merely a voluntary arrangement that was suggested to certain employers in Dublin and Cork who had a large number of employees, and they were asked whether it would not be a convenience for them as well as for the societies.  They need not put it into operation if they do not like.  Most of those who were asked did put it into operation, and thought it was an improved system.  However, if Deputy Dockrell thinks it is a serious burden neither his firm nor any other firm employing a large number of employees who are subject to National Health Insurance need adopt the scheme.  It was believed that it would save time and trouble to all concerned to have the thing done in that way.  It is certainly some disadvantage, so far as an employee is concerned, but there is nothing to prevent an employee satisfying himself that his card has been duly stamped.  He can ask to see the card, and see that it is stamped.  The responsibility is, to a certain extent, taken off his shoulders by reason of the fact that the employer is trusted to act properly.  It is purely permissive, and there is no obligation on an employer to adopt the system if he does not wish to.</P>

      <P>However, if the Minister does not wish to go into the matter now, I suppose it can be raised later.  Certainly, if this is a voluntary scheme for the employer, that is not the way that it was put to the employers. It involves a lot of work on the employer, and I do not think that employees would like to have to be trotting into the office asking to see their cards every month as to whether the stamps had been stuck on them or not.  I do not think that employees would get much encouragement for that procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Expenses of Primary Education, <Col N="228" /> including National School Teachers' Superannuation and a Grant-in-Aid, etc.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises out of the case of a national teacher who was arrested on the 18th July, 1931, and brought before the Military Tribunal on the 30th December, 1931. He was found guilty there.  On giving an undertaking to the Tribunal to enter into recognisances, he was released from custody on the same date.  In view of the fact that the offences of which he was convicted were committed before the passing into law of the Act, the Tribunal decided to recommend the Executive Council not to enforce, in his case, the provisions of Section 31 of the Act on the matter of the forfeiture of his emoluments as a teacher.  Under that section, the teacher automatically forfeited his appointment and became disqualified for seven years from the date of conviction from holding employment payable out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  The teacher resumed duty, and has been paid salary by the Department from the 8th December, 1931.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council, early in 1932, intimated to the teacher that they were prepared to grant him a free pardon. A free pardon, however, was not granted, in fact, until the 11th December, 1934.  A question then arose as to the legality of the payment of salary and capitation grants to this teacher in the period from the 8th December, 1931, when he resumed duty, to the 11th of December, 1934.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in his report, raised the question of the disqualification of this teacher from holding office under Section 31 of Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931.  The matter was the subject of discussion before the Public Accounts Committee.  It has been examined carefully since in the Departments concerned.  It was originally thought that legislation would have to be introduced, and should be introduced, to rectify the matter, and make legal the payments which had been made to this teacher, but it has not been found practicable to do so.  It was intimated to the Public Accounts Committee, when the matter was under discussion <Col N="229" /> there, that, subject to its views, a Supplementary Estimate would be introduced to regularise the payments made to this teacher.  The Committee, in its final report, dated the 8th July, 1936, on the Appropriation Accounts for the financial year 1934-35, expressed agreement with the procedure proposed. As a result of the agreement of the Committee of Public Accounts with this course of action, the present Supplementary Vote is being introduced. It is to cover the amounts illegally paid.  The amount paid by my Department to the teacher in respect of the period from the date on which he was granted a free pardon was £1,247 approximately.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate now presented is £10, leaving a balance of £1,237 to be met out of savings under the relevant sub-heads of the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement has not been quite clear to me.  This case cropped up about two years ago.  I am speaking from memory now of what took place at the Public Accounts Committee.  My memory is that the public officials before the Committee gave a promise that the Government would introduce legislation amending Article 2a of the Constitution.  The Minister has not explained how it is that from the end of 1931 until the end of 1934 his Department continued to pay money which was clearly illegal.  The form of the Supplementary Estimate seems to me to be wrong.</P>
      <P>Article 31 (3) of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every person convicted while this section is in force of an offence mentioned in the Appendix to this Article shall from and after such conviction be for seven years from the date of such conviction disqualified for holding any office or employment remunerated out of the Central Fund or moneys provided by the Oireachtas or moneys raised by local taxation or in or under or as a paid member of a board or body established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-section goes on to deal <Col N="230" /> with the question of free pardon and the quashing or annulment of conviction and it is quite clear that anybody who is convicted of a charge before the Military Tribunal is debarred from holding any office remunerated out of public moneys for a period of seven years.  If that conviction is quashed, then the person concerned may be paid as from the date of conviction.  If he receives a free pardon, then he may hold such office from the date of the free pardon.  It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the law most specifically refuses power to the Government, or even to a local body, to employ a man so convicted between the time of conviction and the time of free pardon.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this was adverted to early in 1932 and that this man was told he would get a free pardon.  If that had happened, apparently, the Department was aware in early 1932 that it was breaking the law of this country, having told the man that he would be granted a free pardon, which, apparently, he did not get until the end of 1934.  I should like to know what is the reason for that lapse. Was it that the free pardon required that he should appeal for the free pardon and that he failed to do it?  If not, was it that the Department, from 1932 until the end of 1934, consistently and regularly broke the law; that the Government regularly broke the law which is supposed to be binding on the rest of us?  The heading in the Estimate here speaks of the amount of salary and capitation grant paid.  We know that the Government could not pay any salary to this man.  Consequently, to my mind, what we should be told in this Estimate here is that it is a free gift.  Clearly, we are not paying the man a salary, because even now it is illegal that he should have drawn salary during that time.  What the Government is proposing is that a man who was brought before the Military Tribunal shall now receive a free gift from the Government of £1,247.  It cannot be called salary.  It can be nothing but a free gift, and this Supplementary Estimate, as I judge, as put before us, is really asking us still to do an illegal thing, because the <Col N="231" /> law lays it down most specifically that no man can hold office and draw an emolument paid out of public taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us no explanation as to why it is that this illegality was persisted in by his Department over a period of two years.  He has given no explanation as to how it is that when this man was told by the State at the beginning of 1932 that a free pardon would be available for him, that pardon was not granted until the end of 1934.  I do not know whether or not the failure to grant the free pardon was because this man did not take the necessary action of appealing to the Government for a free pardon.  The Minister has not told us the reason the Government broke the law and kept on still breaking it for another two years.  If the man did not take the necessary action and the Government broke the law to assist him, I think then that the whole thing is scandalous.  However, I do not want to be taken as saying that, because the Minister has given us no explanation about this matter, or, at best, a most inadequate explanation of the case, and I think that the fact that the Government during a number of years broke the law by doing a thing which was most specifically required by the law not to be done, requires more explanation than has been given by the Minister.  I should like to know why his Department continued to break the law during that period, and why that lapse from 1932 till the end of 1934 was allowed to go on without that free pardon being granted, and whether it was caused by this man refusing to accept the pardon, although he continued to get the money.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the cause of the delay was.  I presume the <Col N="232" /> position was not adverted to.  Deputy Fitzgerald forgets that it was the Government of which he himself was a member that, in fact, reinstated this teacher and who were responsible for paying him in the first instance. When I became Minister for Education the position was that this teacher had already taken up duty and was in receipt of a salary.  Perhaps, to be strictly legal, had I been aware of the position, which I was not, I should have stopped payment to the person concerned when I heard of the case. The position was that when I became Minister for Education he was already in receipt of these payments; so that some time at any rate would have elapsed&mdash;probably not such a long time as did, in fact, elapse&mdash;before he received the free pardon, in view of the change of Government.  All I can say, in explanation of the delay, is that the matter was not adverted to, and the seriousness of the position from the legal point of view was not understood by the Department of Education.</P>

I should like to inform the House, however, that that was done in conjunction with the statement <Col N="233" /> made by the official that the advice of the Attorney-General had been sought on this matter and that he advised legislation to deal with the matter.

At the present moment, the law still is that a man who has been convicted under those circumstances should not hold any such office.  What is the difficulty?</P>

      <P>The intention undoubtedly was to introduce legislation and, as the Deputy says, we can take it that a promise of that nature was made to the Committee on Public Accounts.  As a result, however, of further examination of the question from the legal point of view, very grave doubts were expressed by the legal advisers of the Government as to the feasibility of amending the Constitution retrospectively; so that my advice at the present moment is that legislation is not contemplated for that reason.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Institutions of Science and Art, and Sundry Grants-in-Aid, etc.</P>
      <P>The gross additional provision of £1,000 asked for in this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet expenditure in connection with publications in Irish during the current financial year in excess of the provision made in the original Estimate.  The amount provided for in the Vote for Science and Art for 1936-37 was £6,000, and the closest estimate now available of expenditure falling to be met during the year is £7,000.  As indicated on the face of the Estimate, the expenditure is in respect of the preparation and publication of translations and original works in Irish and the preparation and publication of Irish music.  The provision covers such items as fees to authors and translators and composers of work accepted for publication, payments in respect of copyright and the cost of printing.  The gross additional provision required is offset by an anticipated saving of £990, due to economies in other directions, or rather to the fact that a certain scheme of reorganisation has not been brought into effect as early as was anticipated.  The net additional sum asked for in the Supplementary Estimate is accordingly £10.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any indication of the nature of, the music which it is proposed to publish? Would he be good enough to tell us if <Col N="235" /> the Department have consulted with any body of artists or recognised authorities on Irish music with a view to selecting authoritative material and with a view to ensuring that whatever is printed, with the seal of the Government's approval, will truly represent that type of Irish music which we might not expect a publisher, who is seeking nothing but profit, to produce. I take it that the publications in Irish which are here referred to are commonly known as those produced by the Gúm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a great deal of criticism of that but, personally, I am not in a position to pass judgment on the Gúm.  I feel sometimes that their activities are misdirected.  I cannot imagine that any very material contribution is made to Irish literature by the publication of a translation of such books as &ldquo;Murder in the Villa Rose.&rdquo;  It may be a very good story but, nevertheless, its translation into Irish might have been deferred until some more valuable books were produced. This much I will say about the Gúm and I say it in no spirit of criticism.  I take it that the books produced by the Gúm are produced for the purpose of providing a wider variety of literature for young people and persons who want to read Irish for relaxation.  Might I suggest that some steps should be taken to make the books a little more digestible in appearance?  Nothing is more depressing than to give a young person a book which is supposed to be an instrument of amusement and recreation and which is most manifestly from the same press as Blackie's Irish Reader.  It may not be Blackie's.  It may be Jones's or Foster's Irish Reader. These may be most excellent publications for the purpose of indoctrinating the young in the spelling of simple words, but they are associated in the minds of the young with the classroom. We want to produce books which will be associated in the child mind with more attractive subjects&mdash; fairy tales and school tales, such as were available for Christmas presents in the bookshops in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> I put it to the Minister that most of the Gúm's productions are of a dreadfully forbidding exterior.  We ought to try to induce young people to read these books and enjoy them, not to look upon the reading of them as tasks.  I think a great deal could be done along the lines of giving these books a more attractive appearance. I want to make it clear, however, that I am not criticising the Gúm.  They may or may not be deserving of criticism.  I do not know, but I do suggest that they should make an effort to give the books which they produce a more attractive appearance.</P>

      <P>With regard to the publication of Irish music, would it not be well for the Minister to take some advice as to the personnel of the committee who are going to advise him in this matter.  My experience is that we have a lot of &ldquo;Come-All-Ye's&rdquo; coming over the ether which is offered to us as Irish music, but which is not very creditable to the country.  I should like to know whether anything has been done regarding the publication of music such as the Bunting Collection which I regard as a standard work. The Bunting Collection in the view of persons better able to judge than I am, is at the present moment beyond the reach of the ordinary school-child and is certainly beyond the reach of many working-class people.  Does the Minister propose in publishing this Irish music to publish such works as the Bunting Collection, say in parts, so that they will be within the reach of the ordinary working-class people?  I applaud the efforts of the Minister in that direction, and I do hope that the personnel of the committee will be such that we will get out of the rut of the &ldquo;Come-All-Ye&rdquo; stuff that we <Col N="237" /> have heard so frequently over the wireless and on concert platforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony perhaps is not aware that Bunting is being edited, I understand, and published by a private publisher.  That is to say, a gentleman here in Dublin who is well known has undertaken to republish and re-edit Bunting's work.  It is not being done under Government auspices. The work we are chiefly concerned with is the work prepared by Carl Hardebeck. There has been, unfortunately, a delay in getting that music printed but a substantial number of pieces by Hardebeck will be available.  Probably about a hundred pieces in all will be available in a comparatively short time.  There is a small committee of experts to advise the Department regarding the suitability for publication of pieces of Irish music.  I think that the committee is doing its work satisfactorily.  It is prepared to consider very carefully any work offered to it &mdash;either original work or, as the Deputy suggested, the re-editing of Bunting or of the work of other early workers in that sphere.  We have also a committee of experts in connection with the publication of text books. With regard to the ordinary publications under the Gúm, they are intended for the general reader and they are, generally, works of fiction and very largely translations.  It may be that some of these translations are not regarded as satisfactory, but there is a difficulty because we have to try to provide the type of ordinary reading which young people are accustomed to have in English.  We have to try to provide that type of ordinary fiction in Irish.  Some people might think that the type of fiction ordinarily read by young people does them a certain amount of harm.  I do not agree.  I simply say that it need not be of a very high standard.  The Gúm had undertaken the publication of a large number of these translations and were committed to publishing them.  They had expended a certain amount of money on having them translated and, although I held up a certain number of them, there was a definite loss, from the financial point of view, in not proceeding <Col N="238" /> with their publication when arrangements had proceeded a certain length.  In addition to that type of ordinary fiction for adolescent and adult readers, there is the question of providing standard works of a more substantial character&mdash;historical and biographical works.  The Gúm is quite prepared to undertake the publication of works of that kind.  They have published recently a life of Daniel O'Connell in Irish and other works of that kind which, I think, compare favourably with corresponding standard works in English or other languages.</P>
      <P>The number of writers we have in Irish is not very great, and we should like to see a steady output of works in all departments.  We should like to see, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, a fairly good output of children's books. In my opinion, there is not at all a large enough selection of books for small children.  We have also to keep in mind the need of our young people who are in secondary schools or who are leaving secondary schools.  The number of books in Irish read by these people at the present time is astonishing. We have advertised frequently and offered what we consider to be good terms for original works in Irish.  We have not got as many original works as we should like.  That is not the fault of the Gúm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to call attention to the fact that while there is a good deal of criticism&mdash;much of it unfounded&mdash;of the work of the Gúm, very little is being done to encourage the Gúm by trying to get sales for the books, even the books about which there is general agreement as to their value.  Except in rare cases, one does not get a sale of more than 1,000 copies.  That is a very bad indication of the interest taken in Irish literature.  If we are to do satisfactory work in modern Irish literature, we shall have to try to increase the Irish-reading public. With regard to the appearance of the books, the aim is to make them as cheap as possible.  These books, which are generally available at a price of 2/-, may not be everything one would wish from the point of view of appearance, <Col N="239" /> but the Government is not making any profit on them.  The sole aim is to put the book on the market in legible clear print with a reasonably good appearance but not very ornamental, since our idea is to keep the price as low as possible.  If Deputies will compare the prices of the Gúm publications with the prices of books published by private firms, they will see that no effort whatever is being made to obtain profits, and that the sole idea is to make the books as cheap as possible for our young readers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that there are great difficulties with regard to the printing and correction of books in Irish?  I am informed and I believe that there is a shortage of printers who have a good knowledge of Irish and that there is a shortage of readers in the printing offices who are capable of correcting works in Irish, with the result that a huge amount of correction is thrown back upon the Gúm, which should not ordinarily be the case.  In fact, a great deal of work is done by the Gúm in putting manuscripts in proper form before being sent to the printers, apart from the huge amount of correction that takes place subsequently.  Having regard to these great difficulties, I think the record of the Gúm is very good.  They have published 300 books, are having printed about 115, and 120 further volumes have been accepted and are in course of preparation for the printers. Our object is to improve the quality of the books not only from the point of view of appearance but from the point of view of their literary quality and their usefulness to the public.  To make the scheme of the Gúm a success, it is necessary, in the first place, that we should have educated writers who will have the requisite qualities to enable them to write attractive original works in Irish and, in the second place, that we should have a sufficient reading public to encourage those writers, so that, if their works are produced by the Gúm, they will get a far larger number of readers than they seem to be getting at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister <Col N="240" /> says about the printing of these Irish books is quite correct.  There appears to be no great rush on the part of the printers for contracts for printing these Irish books.  The reason is that we have not got, as I think the Minister will agree, educated Irish writers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, what the Minister says is quite correct&mdash;that there is not a sufficiency of persons who can read Irish and make the necessary corrections, although they proclaim that they are educated Irish speakers. That is the big difficulty.  I have experience of where an educated man &mdash;he must have been educated, because he was a professor&mdash;wrote a book in Irish.  It was corrected by another educated Irishman, and there were so many corrections that the printer had to charge almost as much as it would cost to produce a new book.  Then a third gentleman got hold of it, and altered it back almost to the original, so that when three educated Irishmen got hold of the book, each had a different conception of the use of the verb in many cases.  There was a conflict of opinion as to which was the correct form, and, until there is some uniform style in Irish, it shows the necessity for going slow and putting on the soft pedal.  I am not saying that in any critical mood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain to the House that when I used the words &ldquo;educated writers,&rdquo; I meant writers who are versed in other languages, who, for example, are capable of translating from French or German, and who have an acquaintance with other literature, which would enable them to be of greater advantage to the Irish language.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Anthony, and it was very far from me to suggest that any person writing in Irish at present is not educated, if that is the implication the Deputy is trying to put on what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that a great many native speakers may not have had the advantage of a University education, but very excellent work has been done by them.  In fact, the work of our native speakers compares with the work done to-day in any other literature, and has received commendation, the best commendation being the translation of some of these works, such as &ldquo;An t-Oileanac&rdquo; and the works of Muiris O Suilleabhain.  The translations into English and descriptions from these works are equal to those of any other literature.  They are certainly able to rank with any work in English at the present time.  I do not want to prolong the discussion unnecessarily, but I should like to know from Deputy Anthony if, by any chance, the case he has in mind, where the professors were blamed for delays and a large number of corrections, could not be attributed to the owner of the printing office or the staff, as I understand, is often the case, because, although they have not a real knowledge of Irish, still they undertake the printing and publication of a large amount of work in the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Minister, it is a remarkable fact, and it is a quite common experience, that some of the cleanest proofs have been turned out by men who have absolutely no knowledge of Irish, either spoken or written Irish.  It is when corrections are made, sometimes by authors and sometimes by proof readers who are good Irish scholars, that the trouble begins.  It is a remarkable fact that the same trouble is not experienced when printing, say, a French grammar, a Latin grammar or a German grammar. There you have certain hard and fast rules to guide you, but in the case of Irish it is otherwise.  The Minister can ask the proprietors of printing houses in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere if I am not giving the exact situation.  I am not mentioning this in a critical mood, as I want to help the Minister in this matter.  The printing of Irish has been found more difficult and, I believe, less profitable to printers than the printing of works in foreign languages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we can get books printed in Irish abroad more cheaply, and possibly better in many cases, than here is a sufficient answer to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions: (1) Is he free to give us the personnel of the committee which is advising him as to the music which is to be published by the Department; and (2) has the Gúm ever translated the Fairy Tales of Hans Andersen, Grimm, or a book like &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; has been translated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is entirely mistaken in trying to make these books cheap looking.  I would like if he had them handsomely turned out and sold cheaply.  The amount of subsidy that would be required to make books like Hans Andersen, Grimm or &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; cheaper in a gift edition in Irish than in English would be comparatively trivial.  If you could get copies of Hans Andersen, Grimm and &ldquo;Treasure Island&rdquo; handsomely bound and attractively got up, borrowing, if necessary by contract or by licence, illustrations from some well-known edition in English, and publish these in a form which would justify anybody who wanted to give a birthday or a Christmas gift to a child, it would be helpful.  Let the two books stand in a bookseller's shelves, an edition in English on the one hand, and an Irish edition handsomely bound, and let the handsome Irish edition be half the price of the English one.  In that way you would get these books into the hands of children who would prise into them, look at the pictures and read the text.  That seems to be the obvious object of An Gúm.  You will not get children to read a 2/- book for pleasure.  Most young adults buy a good many of the books they read on their external appearance.  It is only when one reaches middle age and gets a little more experience of literature, that one joins the select company of Deputy T. Kelly and becomes a book lover and a connoisseur, not caring for the cover but for <Col N="243" /> the contents.  No one will withhold from Deputy Kelly a tribute to his love for books.  I think he will agree with me that the number of persons prepared to pass judgment on books by their contents are outnumbered by those who are attracted by a pleasing exterior.  That is peculiarly true of children.  They have to be induced to read books and I suggest that that is the way to do it.  I should be glad to have the names of those who are to advise the Minister as to the music which is to be published.</P>

    <P>I would like to say a few words about the sub-heads so that Deputies may understand the necessity for this Vote.  Sub-head 1, F (3) Veterinary College, £1,340.  That is required to meet the cost of reorganisation of the staff of the college.  There was no revision of the staff either in <Col N="244" /> numbers or scale of salaries since 1915, although in the meantime the course for veterinary students has been extended from four to five years. It was found necessary some time ago to increase the number of professors and lecturers and also to increase the scale of salaries.  For the present year an additional sum of £1,340 is required.</P>
    <P>The next item is G (3)&mdash;Improvement of Live Stock&mdash;The £5 required is a token provision for the purchase of thoroughbred stallions.  The Commission of Inquiry into the horse-breeding industry recommended amongst other things the purchase of high-class thoroughbred stallions.  There will be a substantial provision for this purpose in the annual Estimates for the coming year, and this token Estimate is put in in case a stallion of the type required might turn up and might be purchased by the Department.</P>

With regard to sub-head H&mdash; Grants to County Committees of Agriculture&mdash;under the present law and regulation, a committee of agriculture is entitled to pound for pound against what is raised in the county rate.  In preparing the annual Estimates, we cannot be sure how much the county council intends to raise. We do know what the county committee proposes, but we do not know at that stage what the county council will sanction, and this amount of £2,971 is required to make up the deficit on the Estimate of what would be required by county committees last year.</P>

    <P>There is a sum of £2,881 in respect of land reclamation.  This sum will be required for the current year for the salaries and expenses of 44 land reclamation supervisors.  Additional temporary men were put on for the land reclamation schemes during the winter months.  Roughly between <Col N="245" /> 3,000 and 4,000 acres came under our reclamation schemes up to this, but during the present winter the area is likely to be about 10,000 acres.  This is a scheme with which Deputies are familiar, in which a grant is made to the owner of a small holding in congested districts, and, in fact, outside the congested districts now, to reclaim part of his own land and bring it into production.  A sum of £100,000 has been allocated out of the Vote for employment schemes.  Of that, £50,000 is being spent on land reclamation; £30,000 on the distribution of seeds&mdash; grain and potatoes&mdash;to smallholders; and £20,000 on the distribution of artificial manures and of lime to smallholders.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it may perhaps not be recouped this year.  With regard to item K (1)&mdash;Agricultural Societies and Shows&mdash;£500 was voted originally for this for the expenses of the Department's exhibit at the Royal Dublin Society's Show and other shows.  It requires to be supplemented.  There was a Grant-in-Aid given to the Royal Horticultural and Agricultural Society's Autumn Fruit Show of £230; £50 to the Munster Agricultural Society for their autumn show; and there was a shortage of £206 in respect of the Department's exhibit at Balls-bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head M (4)&mdash; Loans for Agricultural Purposes&mdash;I think there is nothing to be added to the explanation given in the Estimate. There is an additional provision for loans for the purchase of premium bulls of £1,000, of hand-sprayers, £550, and of agricultural implements, £6,000; to what is already voted owing to an under-estimate in the original annual Estimate.  Item M (5)&mdash;Improvement <Col N="246" /> of the Creamery Industry&mdash;arises also in a number of respects which were unforeseen.  The scheme under the Dairy Disposals Board for reorganisation of the Dingle Peninsula proved more successful, in the sense that there was more milk available, than was estimated by the Department, and this necessitated a larger central creamery and the erection of two auxiliary creameries sooner than was anticipated. There was a reorganisation of the Ballymacelligott group in Kerry and improvement in the Rathmore group.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required of £2,145 under item M (7)&mdash;Oats and Barley Purchase Scheme&mdash;is in addition to the token amount already voted.  Towards the end of 1935, the merchants undertook to purchase whatever oats and barley were available at a fixed price, the Department guaranteeing that they would get sale for it by the 31st May following. There was this slight loss on the transaction which arose in this way, that whatever oats and barley they had on hands at the period mentioned, they were authorised to sell to the maize millers at the price which the Department promised to give them, and the expenses incurred in having that corn transferred to the maize millers is being paid for now out of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not remember the exact price, but let us assume that we fixed 10/6 a barrel, the price on 30th June would have come up to that amount by reason of the guarantee. Item M (10) is a small vote for compensation to an officer for injury to clothing.  With regard to N (1)&mdash; Diseases of Animals Acts&mdash;when the Order dealing with the warble fly came into operation last year it was worked very successfully on the whole.  After it had been in operation for some time, there were a certain number of deaths of animals due to what might be described as rather vigorous application of the Act, in that, where the warble was removed by squeezing and afterwards, in some cases, by a certain <Col N="247" /> amount of too vigorous rubbing in of the powder, the animal got a sort of ptomaine poisoning when part of the warble remained behind.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is a form of ptomaine poisoning caused by part of the warble remaining and becoming absorbed.  It was considered at the time that if no compensation were offered, it might have a very bad effect on the administration of the Order in general, and it was decided to pay this compensation on a veterinary's certificate.</P>

      <P>Yes, in all cases.  The next item is O.2.&mdash;Dairy Produce Acts.  The amount required in this case is principally for the purpose of paying temporary assistants for the collection of the farm butter levy who were employed towards the end of last year.  With regard to O.3.&mdash; Destructive Insects and Pests Acts&mdash; this amount was paid to additional inspectors under the Potatoes Acts. O.9.&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts: Again this is an increased provision in respect of appointing additional cereals inspectors, and the cost in particular of red marvel seed wheat under the scheme for the supplying of a sufficient quantity of red marvel seed from our own home-grown wheat, as we found particular difficulty last spring in getting imported seed when the season for sowing red marvel came around.  With regard to O.13. &mdash;Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts &mdash;this amount is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about O.10?  You did not mention it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can deal with O.10 and O.13 together.  The original Estimate provided for £100,000 for the purchase, storage and sale of butter for export, and under the change in the agreement with Germany more butter would be exported than was anticipated at that time.  When the Estimates were being prepared the agreement <Col N="248" /> with Germany was on a 3 to 1 basis. It was subsequently altered to a 2 to 1 basis, and on 1st January of this year it was altered to a 3 to 2 basis.  On that account more butter would be sold.  The same would apply to eggs. The sum of £100,000 was originally provided, and that has to be increased in order to make up for the additional export of eggs under the altered agreement. The same applies to cattle.  The original Estimate was for £200,000, and that has also to be increased.  Of course, against those, there will be corresponding receipts from sales as an appropriation.  The Estimates for 1936-7 were naturally provisional, as I have already said; we could not have foreseen the alterations that were to be made in the agreement.  There was also a change in the Belgian trade agreement.  The quota for the importation of cattle into Belgium from Saorstát Eireann has been increased from 120,000 kilos, which would be about 2,400 cwts, to 150,000 kilos or 3,000 cwts.&mdash;that is on a live-weight basis, allowed into Belgium weekly since 1st December, 1936.  I said that an account of the receipts and expenditure in connection with the export of cattle would be submitted in due course to the Oireachtas in accordance with the requirements of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts.</P>
      <P>There is another item under O.13. which has not been covered, and that is the position of canned beef manufacturers. At the time when the agreement was being made with the Waterford Co-operative factory for the manufacture of canned beef there were two applicants who substantiated claims that they were about to engage in the canned beef business, and had purchased machinery to that end.  Their claims were duly acknowledged and they have now been settled for a sum of £1,410 between the two.  Then there is also the distribution of cattle export licences, which will cost £2,300. The provision is for the salary and expenses of supervisors and temporary assistant supervisors, who are allocated to the different counties to inspect the cattle of those who apply for fat cattle licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the county committees employed their own men, but this year the assistant supervisors who had been working under the Cattle and Sheep Act, or at least some of them, were allocated for this purpose.  There are a few smaller items mentioned here&mdash;the Flax Act and the Agricultural Wages Act&mdash; under which a supplementary sum is also required for the employment of staffs.  The Appropriations-in-Aid mentioned are £1,000 which will be contributed by millers under the seed wheat schemes, and there will be £190,000 additional receipts from the sales of butter for export.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The millers who bought Irish wheat in the ordinary way as part of their home-grown wheat quota were asked to put aside the wheat grown by certain farmers, which wheat had been inspected, and they will sell that wheat at a price agreed upon by the Department.  Although they may sell that wheat for seed they will not be required to replace it by other home-grown wheat, in spite of the fact that it is to be regarded as part of their quota.  At the time when the agreement was made with the millers, Irish wheat was considerably dearer than foreign wheat.  The miller would, therefore, have very good profit, because he would be purchasing foreign wheat to replace a dearer wheat that he was able to get rid of again after getting sufficient to cover his expenses.  There was a levy charged on each barrel of wheat to make up for the difference.  This £1,000 results from that.</P>

There are then the repayments from the Vote for Employment Schemes in respect of the cost of administration, £3,975, which is the sum I already referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The other appropriation referred to was the fee received in respect of cattle export licences, £12,000, which fee, of course, as Deputies are aware, is the charge on application for licences for export of fat cattle.  There is then mentioned the repayments from Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund of amounts temporarily advanced to that fund, £200,000.  That arises in this way: In the original Estimate we voted £200,000 to the Stabilisation Fund, but we also put down an appropriation of £200,000.  Neither took place; we never voted it, and, therefore, could not get the appropriation.  There is, therefore, no appropriation of £200,000. Under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act there would ordinarily be an appropriation of £185,000 which does not arise under the original Estimate.</P>

The Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act was in full force when the original Estimate was being prepared. All these matters about the supply of cows to Roscrea, the supply of cattle <Col N="251" /> to Waterford, the supply of free beef and the collection of levies on cattle and so on were in full force at that time, but practically every one of them has been altered in the meantime, giving us a net difference of £185,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This, at any rate, is a very interesting Estimate.  The first part deals with the veterinary college on which the Minister would have been well advised to have expended much more than the few paltry pounds that he did expend.  I would like the Minister, between now and the time when he will be preparing the main Estimate, to turn over in his mind whether we should not wipe out this veterinary college altogether and establish in this country the kind of veterinary college that we ought to have.  Owing to a series of unfortunate circumstances the Bureau of Agricultural Research which very nearly came to Ireland went to Rome. The result of that is that a great international centre of agricultural information is now located in Rome.  The fact really is that Italy does not seem to be an export country at all, in a sense, and the valuable publicity that will be associated with an international association or bureau of that kind will be lost.  If that Bureau of Agricultural Research were established here it would be of immense value to our <Col N="252" /> agricultural community.  In addition, it would be a great centre of agricultural learning from which our people would directly benefit.</P>
      <P>I now see a chance of establishing something perhaps not so advantageous from the publicity point of view, but something that would be of direct additional advantage to this country &mdash;that is a great veterinary college which would become, in time, the finest veterinary college in the world. There is no reason why we should not have such a college here.  This country can, and I hope will, remain the headquarters of the horse and cattle breeding industry in the world.  It is not our aim to produce the largest number of animals, but it is our aim to produce the best quality.  This country has also become the centre for the production of the sporting dog.  So that in all sorts of live-stock production, particularly the section associated with the luxury side of trade, this country has a great position.  We have all the best materials and we should take advantage of these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see built up here an agricultural college on the most modern lines.  I would like to see, in addition to the highly efficient staff we already have, endowments founded so as to draw to this country the most distinguished veterinarians in the world.  It would surprise Deputies to think how small a sum will attract men of outstanding capacity in the learned professions.  It is very difficult to realise that a man at the head of a big joint stock company may get £100,000 per annum as a salary while the most distinguished living scholar looks upon £2,000 a year as a princely reward.  If we establish in this country five or six professorships with annual salaries of £2,000 a year I think we could take from the world its most distinguished men who would be free in the sphere of veterinary science to take up a position away from their own country.  If we could gather into this country a body of men who would make it a great centre of veterinary learning, I think it would be of immense advantage to the country.  I have dwelt on the publicity side of this matter.  There is no need <Col N="253" /> to dwell further on it, though I think the value from an agricultural point of view would be immense.</P>
    <P>Take the case of cows which do not breed regularly in this country at the present time.  One of the great causes of that irregularity in breeding is contagious abortion.  If a specific remedy could be discovered for that bacillus it would save this country an almost unheard of sum per annum.  In addition to that recognisable disease there is the catarrhal condition which prevents cows breeding regularly in this country.  This is a very simple disease, but it has cost the people of this country, I estimate, about £3,000,000 per annum.  That cost is falling almost altogether on the small farmer.  What the cost of that disease must be in other countries is a matter that I would hesitate to attempt to estimate.  But it would be worth all we could possibly spend on any veterinary institution if we could discover remedies for those two diseases alone, never mind all the other branches of veterinary medicine that might advantageously be investigated.  This is a matter to which I have given some thought, and no doubt it is a matter also to which the Minister has given some thought.  I do not ask him to give us a considered opinion on these problems to-day, but I do take this opportunity of inviting him to occupy the time between now and his main Estimate in considering whether a substantial sum of money, invested as I suggest, would not be a good investment for the country.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant in connection with the sub-head for the purchase of horses to express dissatisfaction with the Horse Commission.  But it does seem odd to me that we should be opening. a sub-head authorising the Minister to purchase racehorses.  I do not think that breeding racehorses is a business susceptible of too much Government interference at all and I think if it is attempted by the Government they must make a mess of it.  The breeding of racehorses is, most essentially, a matter for private enterprise.  It is the judgement of the individual in the choosing of yearlings that results in the Blandfords and the other great <Col N="254" /> sires that have appeared in this country.  It is a type of business into which skilful men are induced to go by the immense awards that are sometimes available.  It is not like any other farming business.  The breeder of racehorses knows that for two or three years he may have to meet heavy losses.  It is just his luck if he happens to breed poor stuff.  Then, suddenly, in one year he may breed one horse that will bring him a fortune, and in that way he is compensated for the lean years which he expects in the business.  That is not the way that Government experiments can be carried on.  No Government could undertake risks of that kind.  I am aware that we have had here for some time a stud which was controlled by the British Government.  I am not at all sure, and never have been sure, that that was a desirable institution.  I would much sooner have seen a guarantee given to the big breeders in this country, men like the Aga Khan and others, with large establishments here, that their interests would be very carefully looked after by the Government, and that any facilities the Government could provide them with would be forthcoming.  I would then leave this matter of horse breeding in their hands, that is, horses of the racing type.  I should prefer to see the Government giving attention to the type of horses bred by the small farmer, troopers, hunters and farm horses.  I think there is a great potential market for troopers and an immense one for hunters.  If the Minister means to try to help this branch of the trade, I think he will be doing good work.  I would, however, urge on him that he should not commit himself in the matter of racehorse breeding, because I do not think he can make any valuable contribution to that branch of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister's explanation in connection with the oats and barley scheme.  He says that he gave a guarantee to the grain buyers that he would take the oats and barley off their hands at a certain date at a certain price.  He now proposes to pay compensation to the extent of <Col N="255" /> £2,145 to the oats and barley buyers for transferring these oats to the millers.  I do not know what the ruling prices for oats and barley were at that time.  I would like to know from the Minister if the millers, at his suggestion, took over this oats and barley at a fixed price and soaked the maize meal mixture with the cost of that operation, because I suspect that is what happened.  I think we ought to know.  It is getting quite tedious and boring for Deputies of the House to try and follow the devious operations of the Department of Agriculture, but it is a source of never-ending amazement to those who are intimately concerned with agriculture to discover the astute methods which the Department has devised for soaking the taxpayer in taxes without letting Dáil Eireann know anything about it.  The number of adjustments that can be made between levies and payments with a view to extracting taxation out of the consumer, and of passing it on to a beneficiary in the form of a dole or bounty, are so numerous that it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the change in the agreement with Germany necessitating the purchase of more cattle.  What was the change in the agreement with Germany?  Some of the more guileless members of the Fianna Fáil Party hear of these trade agreements with Germany with some satisfaction.  I wonder do they realise that when we send cattle to Germany we pay the land annuities, not only to Britain, but to Germany as well. The Germans buy cattle here on the Dublin market for about 23/- per cwt., while the price that the Germans would have to pay for the cattle in Denmark, or in countries contiguous to Germany, is 34/- or 35/- per cwt.  So that we are actually paying the land annuities to Germany as well as to Britain on all the cattle that are shipped under this German trade agreement.  The Minister here is apparently buying cattle and selling them to Germany.  Would the Minister give us the average price that he has got from Germany for those cattle up to now?  I think we ought to have <Col N="256" /> that figure.  Would the Minister also give the average price that we get from Germany for our eggs and butter?  I ask Deputies to read the newspapers.  If they do they will find that at the present time the Germans, owing to the policy that they have elected to pursue, are starving themselves for butter, not that there is not plenty of butter if they wanted to buy it, and plenty of people who want to sell butter to them, but owing to the policy that they have embarked on they have determined to suffer the want of butter.  These people would be very glad to get butter if they could have it on terms which would fit in with their economy.  The astonishing part of it is that they can come over to this country and buy our butter on the terms that there is a willing seller and that they are a willing buyer.  We give them butter for half nothing, and we charge our own consumers 5d. a lb. on butter in order to enable the Minister for Agriculture to sell it cheaply to the Germans.  The Minister knows as well as I do that when we settle the economic war, if it is ever settled, the devil a pound of butter will we ever sell to Germany again. When the Germans finish their armament programme and all the other codology that they are going on with at present and return to their normal sources of supply, they will not take 6d. worth of butter from us, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>

      <P>Well, it did happen once, and the fact is that we are now selling butter in the German market at the same price as they are getting for Australian butter in London.  The truth is that we are selling butter more cheaply to Germany than they can get it from Denmark.  I say that that is preposterous.  Nobody will deny that our butter, quality for quality, is at least as good as, and, in fact, superior, to the Danish butter, and the only reason they have been able to beat us is because of continuity of supply. It is not because of the superior quality of their butter.  The trouble with us is that the men who handle Irish butter find themselves in winter without any supply, and so all the people who handle our butter have to handle Danish butter as well.  The <Col N="259" /> people who handle Danish butter do not care whether they handle Irish butter or not because of the lack of continuity of supply, but quality for quality our butter is as good as or better than Danish butter.  We are trying to cultivate a market in Germany that will not ever give us the price we would eventually get in the British market if we had continuity of supply and were able to compete on level terms.</P>

      <P>Has not the fact that Denmark has an alternative market in Germany something to do with the price in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, certainly not.  It has nothing to do with it&mdash;nothing whatever.  I do not think even your own Minister would maintain that. Now, observe what we are doing.  We are paying the land annuities to Germany with our cattle, and we are selling them Irish butter at the price of Australian butter.  There is only one commodity which, in normal times, we find a great difficulty in disposing of, and that is the matje herring. Would you not imagine that, when the Germans are getting from us animal fats and meat on extraordinarily advantageous terms, they could be induced to go a little out of their way and to take one item which we are really anxious to dispose of, and that is the matje herring?  So far, I have been quite unable to extract from the Minister in public any comprehensible statement as to what our position is <i>vis a vis</i> the German Government at the present time in regard to matje herring.  I say, however, that we ought now to say to the German Government that either they will take matje herring as part of their purchases from this country, or their trade agreement is of no value to us. If the German buyer never came to the Dublin market again, I would not be sorry to see the last of him, because every beast he takes out of this country he takes at a cut-throat price which does not pay the producer. Under the extraordinary circumstances of the moment, of course, farmers are willing to sell to anybody who will buy, but every beast the German <Col N="260" /> takes from us, he gets at a price below the cost of production.  So far as the butter and egg sales there are concerned, they are worthless to us from an economic point of view.  They are simply an emergency exit for stuff accumulating here as a result of the silly and futile quarrel which the Government insist on maintaining with England in financial matters. There is one thing, however, that we ought to be willing to give the Germans, and that is the matje herring.  If that were done, and if they would guarantee to take our supply, I would even be willing to support a two-to-one agreement with them against us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Heaven help us when Deputy Corry thinks he can advise me on points of order.  I urge upon the Minister that if this German agreement is to be continued, an absolute <i>sine qua non</i> should be that the Germans are going to take from us all the matje herrings we can produce. They are taking from Great Britain more than, I think, five times the quantity that would absorb our entire output, and the situation has only become critical because, heretofore, they allowed the British to buy our herring and then ship them to Germany.  Now they will not allow that any more, and the result is that our fishermen cannot sell their fish at all.  That has resulted in a very grave situation for the fishermen in the West and in North Donegal, and I urge on the Minister most strongly to take effective measures to deal with that matter, and that, before we pass from this proposal to raise nearly £500,000 for the cattle, butter and egg exports to Germany, he should tell us that he is going to find in Germany, this April, May and June, a remunerative market for the matje herring that will be then available from our fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I see that we are going to compensate two gentlemen who contemplated setting up in the canned beef trade and who would not be let do so until the Waterford factory got going.  Here we have people who are prepared to go into the canned beef trade without any assistance at all <Col N="261" /> from the Government, and then the Waterford factory comes along and is established under the patronage of the Government and gets a monopoly of the trade.  Not only do they want a complete monopoly of the trade before the factory is set up, but they want the Government to pay compensation to the two firms which are going to be stopped in order to create a monopoly for the Waterford factory.  It is bad enough to create a monopoly without charging them anything for it, but if we are going to give them a monopoly of the trade and a present in cash as well, we are coming to a pretty pass indeed.  I should like to know from the Minister whether that aspect of the situation has occurred to him.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (i) provides for grants for land reclamation, and they will come back under the Appropriation-in-Aid. The Minister talks about reclaiming land in the congested areas. I have put to him and to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, as well as to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, a scheme which, to my mind, would do more good in rural Ireland than any other scheme of land reclamation that has been suggested or attempted so far.  Most of the land in this country on the small holdings deteriorates from two causes &mdash;or perhaps I should say, they manifest two symptoms of deterioration. One is rushes, and the other is flaggers.  Now, the sovereign remedy for both those pests, and for the condition which brings them about, is the creation of good flagged drains.  French drains are no good because they get clogged too quickly in the soil on most of our farms, but good flagged drains, followed, in the cases of rushes, by cutting and the application of basic slag will, if persisted in, clear any land of rushes.  A sure way of getting rid of flaggers is adequate drainage.</P>
    <P>Immense sums of money are being spent on scraping the sides of roads, making bog roads and so forth.  Would it not be possible, instead of sending gangers to look after men on the side of a road, to make every small farmer his own taskmaster?  Would it not be possible to say to a small farmer: &ldquo;If you will dig and flag drains on your <Col N="262" /> own land with a proper level, we are prepared to give you a subsidy of so much per yard on such drains as are properly constructed&rdquo;?  You need no ganger standing over a man who is digging drains on his own land.  He will take very good care to do the job well on his own land.  You need have nobody urging him to work quickly because he is not going to get paid by the day.  He is going to get paid by the amount of work he does and the less time he devotes to the work the less money he will get.  If you get every acre of arable land drained on that plan, not only are you going to improve the holding of every small farmer but you are going to get the best possible national return in the improvement of the only natural resource our people have got, the arable land of the country.  By expending all the money you can in improving the arable land of the country in that way, you will increase its yield and possibly you will recover in the national income a great deal more than the money you have expended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Was a scheme of that kind not tried already under the minor drainage schemes, and was it not a failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think such a scheme as I suggest has ever been tried although I did mention it to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know whether he has investigated its possibilities.  I know from my own experience that it is a scheme which is peculiarly susceptible to casual labour.  Say you are going to make a 12 inch drain.  If you open a trench 18 inches wide, the first thing you have to do is to put the flags standing on their edges down the drain on the inside with the intention of putting the flags across subsequently, before you cover in the trench.  In 90 cases out of 100 no serious inconvenience will arise by leaving the drain uncovered for a month or even two months.  It is highly unlikely that it would cause any serious injury to anything.  Therefore, when I determine to dig one main drain, and four tributary drains running into it, it is no serious inconvenience to notify <Col N="263" /> the responsible person who has to approve of the drain in order that I may qualify for the bounty, and to wait for his visit for three weeks, a month or five weeks.  All he need do is to go out, look at it and see that the levels are approximately right, see that there is sufficient width left and that the drain is properly flagged. He would then say to the farmer: &ldquo;You can proceed to fill in this.  I will certify it and you will get the bounty.&rdquo;  That kind of work could be going on, on every small farm in the country.  That would be the most valuable form of land reclamation that could be done and in the long run would be the most economical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head M has a wide application. I should like to ask the Minister what are the agricultural implements referred to in connection with the item for £6,000.  In regard to the additional provision for loans for the purchase of premium bulls I want to sound a note of warning.  If the present miscegenation goes on for any length of time there will not be a decent cow left in Ireland.  During the year 1933-34, when economic pressure was so keen, an immense number of our best cows and heifers went out of the country because if you wanted to sell a beast at all you had to bring out the best beast you possessed.  During that time an immense amount of choice cattle left the country.  At present or at least for the last ten years, there has been a steady demand from Scotland for blue bullocks and for black bullocks and there has been a strong demand from parts of England for the white-faced bullock.  The result of that has been&mdash;and I do urge the Minister to give attention to this problem because it is going to become more acute in future as a result of certain regulations made by the British Department of Agriculture&mdash; that any man who had a good Shorthorn cow and whose primary purpose was to get her along to the lactation period, brought that cow to the bull who would produce the most saleable calf.  What happened was that occasionally you would get from the cross <Col N="264" /> of a Shorthorn cow and an Aberdeen-Angus bull or a Hereford bull, which are pure beef breeds, a very good-looking heifer which had all the external appearance of a good Shorthorn. The farmer then, instead of selling that animal to be fattened for the butcher, would be tempted to keep it.  His Shorthorn cow was getting old and he got rid of it and he would keep the cross-bred heifer as his foundation cow.  The progeny of that heifer would be bad enough but the progeny of her progeny would be infinitely worse.  You had in that way a steady deterioration in the cow stocks of the country.  Now, it is a comparatively simple thing to sweep away a bull stock which is not giving satisfaction but it is an entirely different matter to change your foundation stock of cows.  It would take a generation to improve it because you cannot breed a stock of good cattle on a bad foundation stock. If you allow your cow stock to deteriorate, you are in ten times worse case than if your bulls deteriorate.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the British Ministry of Agriculture have just passed new regulations in regard to the rates of bounty on fat cattle. They are going to give a bounty of 7/6 on every fat beast reared from a calf that was bred in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  They are going to give 5/- on every grade A beast that was fattened from a calf bred in Saorstát Eireann or outside the United Kingdom.  A grade A beast, in 90 cases out of 100, is going to be a beast which is a cross from a Shorthorn and a Hereford or polled Angus bull.  There will, therefore, be an immense additional urge on our people to use the polled Angus or Hereford bull from this time on. What I want to point out to the Minister is: can we not try in administering these bounties, loans, and premiums to encourage the people to keep their Dairy Shorthorn bulls? I now warn the Minister that, unless vigorous steps are taken to encourage the people to keep Dairy Shorthorn bulls, the whole foundation stock of this country will be destroyed because there will be no Shorthorn heifers left.</P>

      <P>I have delayed the House on a great many matters arising here, and I do not want to go at great length into the details of this sub-head.  But what should happen is that if a man wants to breed a calf for sale to the butcher as a fat beast, he should go to a Hereford or an Aberdeen Angus.  When he wants to breed a heifer to keep for his own stock, he ought to go to the Shorthorn bull.  The difficulty is that there is so much more call for Aberdeen Angus and Hereford bulls that the bull-keepers will not keep Shorthorns, and very often people find that they cannot get Shorthorns.</P>

They are only talking through their hats.  In three sub-heads we are providing £6,000 additional for inspectors.

      <P>We had the Minister for Agriculture straining at the leash to get into office to sweep out all those fellows.  They said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will soon civilise them; we will be driving civil servants out of Merrion Street like bees out of a hive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hive in Merrion Street has been swarming and a new hive has been set up and, with every Estimate that comes in here, there are humming about a new flock of bees in the form of inspectors.  The Minister is proud of that and bóasts that every day and every week he and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are creating more and more and more <Col N="266" /> inspectors.  That is like the wealth. Do you remember the other boast about more wealth for the people? More money for the people and more and more and more&mdash;why should it ever stop?  May I paraphrase that and say: &ldquo;More inspectors for the people and more and more and more &mdash;why should it ever stop?&rdquo;  I am amused at the Red Marvel wheat proposal. I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture still thinks that wheat is not a precarious crop in this country, that it is a safer crop than oats or barley and perfectly easy to save. Did he see any of the wheat with blue whiskers going down to the millers of the South and West?  Did he hear of any flour coming back to the millers on the ground that the people could not eat it and of the millers stating in reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the best we can make with the wheat we are getting.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think that there can be any doubt this year that the Minister is learning the painful lesson we tried to teach him&mdash;that wheat in this country is a highly precarious crop.  He is recommending Red Marvel as a spring wheat.  I think that people are fools to sow a spring wheat at all.  If they are going to <Col N="267" /> sow wheat they should sow winter wheat.  Winter wheat has some chance of maturing and of being harvested early, but, if you have wheat maturing at the end of September, there is a chance that not alone will you not be able to save it properly, but that you will lose the whole crop.  I am surprised that the Minister should speak of Red Marvel as a spring variety. Has his attention been directed to a Scandinavian or Norwegian wheat called Diamante?  According to experiments carried out in Roscommon, that has proven the best type of spring wheat yet tried in this country for early ripening.  Perhaps the Minister would make note of that variety and let us know, in his concluding observations, whether it has been brought to the attention of his seed experts, and, if so, what their opinion is of it as a spring variety for this country.  The first desideratum is to get a variety to ripen at all.  Under modern conditions, whether the wheat grown be good or bad, the grower will get paid.  It is high treason to describe any wheat grown in this country as anything but superior to Manitoba No. 1.</P>

      <P>I disagree with my friend, Deputy Allen, on the merits of the best Manitoba and the best Irish wheat.  He said he knew more than Deputy Dillon about wheat.  I do not know whether he knows more about it than I do.  I am egotist enough to say that I know something about it and I certainly differ with Deputy Allen as to the merits of the two classes of wheat.  I think that the consensus of opinion amongst the various judges of wheat in any country would be with me.  As regards the problem of agriculture&mdash; and it is a problem&mdash;as long as we are in our present circumstances, with the growing cost of everything the farmer requires, it is becoming almost impossible for him to meet his liabilities.  I do not want to criticise the present Minister for Agriculture. In the very difficult circumstances that exist, I believe he has done his best.  As I said before in this House, I do not believe any man in his position, in present circumstances, could solve our difficulties.  No Minister for Agriculture could, under present conditions, put the farmers into a position that would be a happy one.  I do not know if ordinary Deputies who are not farmers realise the difficult position the unfortunate agriculturist is in, and I propose to deal with that question in a different way from what it has hitherto been dealt with in the Dáil.  For the past few years the tendency of the Government has been to build up industries, by intensive help, in the way of <Col N="269" /> bounties or tariffs.  I do not propose to say anything against that but to point out that all that costs money, and that the bulk of the cost falls on the farming community.</P>
      <P>What is the primary consideration in setting up a new industry?  We proceed on the basis that it is going to be made possible to set up the industry to produce a profit over working costs.  Interest on capital will also be provided for.  Provision is made by means of bounties or tariffs so that the goods can be sold at a reasonable price, and that it will suffice to pay the workmen a decent wage, because they have unions to regulate that, and then to make a reasonable profit on what is sold.  If a man starts a boot factory or some other factory he must know his business and he is provided for as a director or in some other capacity.  Eventually a sum has to be found which will pay a dividend of from 10 to 25 per cent. judging by the accounts that some companies have published.  I want now to put before the House the position of the farmer, compared with the industrialist. While it is desirable to do all that we are doing for industry, I wish to point out that what is good for one industry is good for another, and that provision must be made for the oldest and the chief industry under somewhat analogous circumstances. I do not say that it is possible to give the farmer the same profits out of his industry as it is possible to give in other industries, but until some attempt is made to do so, it is useless for any of us to be blaming the Minister for Agriculture, for the time being, for the present position.  In my opinion no Minister can get agriculture out of the quagmire. While provision is made for establishing industries what happens in relation to agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here figures for the year 1936 dealing with the position on an average farm in the south of Ireland, consisting of 50 Irish acres or about 75 statute acres.  I would say that it is worked as well as any farm in this country, and I think the Minister will <Col N="270" /> agree with me when he hears the figures.  On this farm there are 24 dairy cows and some other stock. Assuming that some part of the milk of one cow is consumed in the house, the milk of 23½ cows goes to the factory.  I can vouch for these figures as they are the figures that will reach the income-tax authorities.  Last year the owner of the farm received £256 9s. 7d, from the creamery for milk.  The Minister will admit that a man who got that amount last year for milk was getting a good price, and that he must have been a man who minded his business.  I calculate that that milk must have been the produce of cows giving 600 gallons, that they were good cows, and the best the average farmer could have.  There were some other profits made from 18 calves which sold at an average of nearly £5 each, which was a pretty good price and shows that they were well cared. Three old cows were sold for £19, and on the whole they sold well.  Three cows were bought for £37 10s.  The receipts from milk were £256 9s. 7d., and the profits from other items and from cattle £83, or roughly £340 from the working of the farm.  On the other side are the wages of permanent labourers and a few casual men at £180.  I do not think the wages were very great, but possibly the amount was as much as this man could pay. What I am trying to arrive at is something which will enable farmers to pay a bigger wage.</P>
    <P>The rent of the holding was £33 and the rates £34 10s.; feeding stuffs, £15; insurance, £7; chemist's bill, 10/-; repairs, including shoeing, harness and milk tankards, £33, or a total expenditure, including wages, of £306, leaving a profit of £35 or £36.  No one can say that the farm was not well worked. There was some tillage&mdash;oats, potatoes and mangels&mdash;which did not show a profit because it was fed to the cattle.  The profit on the farm may be taken at about £40.  The question is: Is that really a profit?  If I was drawing up accounts for any other industry there would not be a profit in this case, as provision should be made for losses on various articles and for a capital account.  I presume the <Col N="271" /> farmer cannot go into business without capital any more than people can go into any other industry without capital.  The farm would have a value and also some of the stock.  The farm I am speaking of was value for £3,000 five or six years ago, and I would put down the present value at £2,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not the authority on order in this House yet. The day may arrive when he will be. No one will congratulate him more than I will, when he steps into the shoes of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I am putting the value of the stock on the farm at £400 and £150 on machinery.  There was £2,500 of the man's capital in it.  If agriculture is ever going to survive in this country, there must be some provision made by which the man who puts his money, his work and his ability into it will get some return, that not alone will his farm show a profit but that there will be some return on the capital that he has put into it.  If I had magnified that man's profit of £40 into £240 or £340, I would not have been putting agriculture into any privileged position compared with other industries, because it is reasonable to assume that a man will get 5 per cent. on the £2,500 capital he has in it, and which most farmers have in their farms.  In addition, the manager of that farm was worth something just as much as the manager of any other industry, but instead of having a return of at least 5 per cent. &mdash;and if a man gets 5 per cent. return on his capital and his stock, there would not be much of a grumble in this country&mdash;he gets a return the sum total of which is 1 per cent.  I do not believe that there are a great many farmers in this country who are getting more than 1 per cent. return on their capital, when you take into account their own labour in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this contribution of mine is about as much as I want to say on this Vote.  I have at various times spoken on the different items.  Deputy <Col N="272" /> Dillon has gone into them item by item and I do not propose to go into them again, but I do want to emphasise that the farmers must be placed in a position in some way analogous to that of ordinary industrialists, and there must be some provision made which will make it possible for them, out of their year's work, to provide a decent wage for the labourer who works for them, a decent profit on the things they produce, and a little extra profit to provide some interest on the capital they have invested and some return for their own labour.  Up to this, this has not been the case.  I do not say that it is the fault of any Government and I am not accusing the present Government alone in that respect.  I am going to argue that agriculturists, since the advent of this State, and for a long time before it, have not got the return out of their land that is their due.</P>
    <P>Since the new policy of intensive industrial effort has commenced the position has been worsened because while every provision is made for a certain profit for industrialists, while every effort is made by the Government so to arrange circumstances in industry&mdash;and by that I mean industry outside agriculture&mdash;that there will be a profit for the industrialist, there is no such effort made to provide any decent margin of profit for the farmer. Until something is done on those lines, it is useless for us to criticise the different items in an agricultural Vote.  There may be different views on Government policy, as there would be on the policy of any other Government here, but so far as I can voice the opinions of the people who sent me here, I shall, no matter what Minister for Agriculture happens to be here, or what Government happens to be in office, always get up to protest, to fight every corner I can fight, until eventually the farmers of this country wake up and demand and get treatment as near as possible to the treatment given to other industries.</P>

      <P>It was extremely interesting to listen to Deputy Bennett's figures.  I entirely agree with him that the farmer's business should be <Col N="273" /> placed on as sound a basis as possible, but what would be the position of that farmer with the 24 cows whom he mentioned if Deputy Dillon were Minister for Agriculture for the past two years?  Deputy Dillon says that it is a scandal to have the people of this country paying 5d. extra for their butter because we are exporting butter.  If Deputy Dillon succeeded in his object in the Division Lobbies a few years ago, what would be the position of that farmer?</P>

      <P>No, it would not.  The £256 which that farmer made from his milk would be reduced to about £90 and he would have £90 for his 24 cows for a year.  If a man had to feed cows for £3 a year each, he would have sold his cows long ago. He would have got about 2d. a gallon for his milk.</P>

That would be something like 2d. a gallon for his milk at the creamery, instead of the 4d. and 4½d. he has made to get this sum of £256.

      <P>I am just anxious to thrash out this matter of this farmer with the 24 cows and the 50 acres.  He made £256 9s. 7d. by reason of the fact that we had a Butter Stabilisation Act here and butter was sold to those terrible Germans at a better price than we could get in England for it. If Deputy Dillon had succeeded, there is another thing that would have happened.  That poor farmer would be left with two-thirds of his butter which he could not sell at all and the best thing that would happen to him is that, instead of getting £256 out of 24 cows, he would have got £90.  What would have been the result?  He would have whipped the danged cows out on the road and let them go.  Then you would have no cattle trouble at all, because, without cows, you could not have any calves, and, without calves, you would have no bullocks, so that the whole problem would be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is bad enough to have Deputy Dillon inflicted on this House, but God help the unfortunate farmers of this country if he is ever inflicted on them as Minister for Agriculture.  Deputy Dillon's principal argument was about the German market.  As a matter of fact the position is that the German market is a better one than the English market for what butter we are selling there. We are getting a better price, and, after all, that is the only thing which need concern us.  We are getting a far better price from Germany than we are getting from England.  The other matter that Deputy Dillon was anxious about was the premium bulls. The late Minister for Agriculture, God rest his soul, made a statement in this House in regard to premium bulls and this Livestock Act that I will always remember, because he made it after he was put into Opposition, and it was in regard to a <Col N="275" /> policy which he had carried out for six long years.  Here is what he said: &ldquo;If the Livestock Act is continued in operation as it has been during the past six years, you may get very fine cattle, very fine looking bullocks, but it will be very difficult to get a decent milch cow in this country.&rdquo;  That statement is in the Official Reports for any Deputy who wishes to read it. That was the opinion of the manner in which the Dairy Shorthorn Society and all the rest of the societies were working out in results, and the manner in which bulls were being inspected for licences throughout the country.  I consider, Sir, that it is a mistake, and a rather fatal mistake. I do not believe that there is such a thing as a dual purpose animal.  A cow is either bred for milk or bred for beef.  When the inspectors are going around, the milk yield is never taken into consideration in inspection for licences.  All that is taken into consideration in the inspection for licences is the appearance of the animal.  Has he fat enough?  Has he condition enough?  That will undoubtedly lead, and has led, as the late Minister for Agriculture stated, to the position where you will find it very hard to get a decent milch cow in this country.  Then we had a statement from Deputy Bennett in regard to wheat.  I do not know exactly what is Deputy Bennett's judgment on wheat; I do not know how much wheat he grows down in the County Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>So I believe.  Deputy-Bennett reminds me of the three gentlemen in Cork who called themselves the Wheat Growers' Association, and went to the Cork Milling Company looking for a better price for wheat.  One of the directors of the Cork Milling Company met them.  He turned to one gentleman and said: &ldquo;If I give you your price now, how much wheat will you give me?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;Oh, everybody in Cork sends his wheat to you.&rdquo;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the director, &ldquo;how much will you send me?&rdquo;  The answer was: &ldquo;I do not <Col N="276" /> grow it at all.&rdquo;  Of course, the second gentleman grew a lot of wheat down in Anglesea Street and, as to the third, bricks and mortar would be more in his line.  One grew no wheat at all, the other had an office in Anglesea Street; and the third gentleman was a builder.  Deputy Bennett got up here and made a solemn declaration about the quality of wheat.  He knew a lot more about it than Deputy Allen, who grows wheat every year.</P>

      <P>I remember for two years the late Minister for Justice, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, was crying out for a bad harvest: &ldquo;Next year we will have a bad harvest.&rdquo;  When the next year came, we heard: &ldquo;We will surely have a bad harvest next year,&rdquo; and, the year after that: &ldquo;We are certain to have a bad harvest next year.&rdquo;  We have Deputies getting up there and speaking about agriculture, and they know no more about it than my own shoe.  Deputy Bennett gets up there and solemnly tells us all about Irish wheat.  He knew more about wheat than Deputy Allen; then he admits that he never grew a grain of wheat at all.  Then Deputy Dillon gets up and begins to talk about the wheat with blue whiskers that was going into the merchants.  But he tells us he grew none either.  That is what is wrong.  For heaven's sake leave farming to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon comes in here and switches on to industry.  Just in order <Col N="277" /> to have a cheap sneer at the industrial side of the Fianna Fáil programme, he condemns the canned meat factory in Waterford.  I wonder did he consult Deputy Richard Holohan?  I am sure, if he spent half an hour with Deputy Holohan before he came in here to condemn the Waterford canned meat factory, he would not be so glib in his statements about it.  I am sure, too, that if he consulted ex-Deputy Denis Gorey, the late leader of the Farmers' Party, he would not have come in here with those statements in regard to things he knows nothing about, in order to have a cheap sneer, in the hope that nobody would call his bluff. We are sick of that kind of thing. For heaven's sake try and be sensible for once.  We have had one and a half hours of the time of this Dáil occupied here with the most nonsensical trash ever dished out.  I do not wish to delay the House further than to refute those two most nonsensical statements&mdash;Deputy Dillon's statement about butter and wheat, and his statement about the canned meat factory.  I hope Deputy Holohan will meet them, and deal with them as they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to practically all of the speech made by Deputy Corry on the Estimate before us, but I did not hear him boasting about the wealth of the agricultural community as he has done on previous occasions.  His whole speech was an attempt to refute statements made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Bennett. I do not think he has succeeded.  I do not think he expected to succeed; I think his object was to kill time and attempt to bolster up statements which he has made here before.  I want to go back to the Estimate.  In viewing it, I see that seven or eight items refer to the salaries and expenses of additional staffs.  Deputy Corry, in his election campaign before Fianna Fáil came into office, said that these would not be increased.  There was no necessity to increase them; they would carry on the work of this country much better than it had been done before, without any increased staffs or any increase in taxation in any shape or form.  I think the items here <Col N="278" /> amount to between £10,000 and £11,000 for increased salaries and expenses of staffs.  While the first item&mdash;Veterinary College&mdash;Provision for additional staff, is absolutely necessary, I hope that that staff will be sufficiently augmented to carry out the research work that is necessary for the Department of Agriculture in this country.  I wish to reiterate what Deputy Dillon has said.  No matter what is the cost of getting the best men, the best men ought to be got to carry out this research work.</P>
      <P>I would specially like to refer to one item under the Flax Act, 1936.  The additional staff required necessitates an increase in the Vote by £876.  I take it that money is going to the staff. I wonder what the staff is doing now. Flax scutching is almost completed by this time in the Free State.  I wonder if in this particular item there could be an additional sum provided for research work.  That is to say, for the carrying out of experiments in growing flax seed, and in fact for the development or propagation of the best kind of flax.  If that were started we might find ourselves in the course of a year or two with a sufficient quantity of flax seed to meet all the requirements of the growers here.  I am sorry there is no provision in the Estimate for this work.  The main Estimate will be introduced later, but then it will be too late to make arrangements for the carrying out of a matter of that sort.  If the staffs are to be engaged and the work is to be done it is the duty of the Minister and the Department to see that work is provided for them and that they will give full value for the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item here to which I wish to refer is the sub-head for the improvement of live stock, for the purchase of thoroughbred stallions.  Now I understand that it is impossible at the moment to get thoroughbred stallions.  I know people who have made application for them to the Department of Agriculture and they have been unable to get them.  I do not quite understand that item when I know that thoroughbred stallions are not available.  With regard to this item of grants to county committees <Col N="279" /> of agriculture, I have reason to know that some grants or subsidies were given for lime or sand.  Owing to the inclement weather we have had for the past two months, it was impossible to secure the sand.  The people are obliged to go out and dredge the sand and bring it in.  I understand the subsidy will not be available after the 1st February according to the Department's regulations.  It would be well, if possible, to extend the period for another month so as to give those people an opprtunity of getting in the sand.  That would be specially helpful in the case of wheat-growers.  These require sea sand for their wheat tillage, and if the time were extended it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is a sub-head for agricultural societies and shows, including Miscellaneous Grants-in-Aid.  There are no shows mentioned but I take it it means the Royal Dublin Society and the Cork show.  Might I point out that there are very important shows held throughout the Free State outside the Dublin and Cork shows.  If any money is available for having the Department's educational exhibit shown at these provincial shows it would be money well spent.  People who cannot attend the Dublin or Cork shows, attend the local shows.  They should get an opportunity of enjoying the educational advantage which the Department's exhibits would confer on them.  I hope the Minister will consider having the Department's exhibits shown in future at the provincial shows.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to find what the opinion of the Fianna Fáil Party is with regard to agriculture.  The only speaker of that Party, outside the Minister, in the course of this debate, was Deputy Corry.  His contribution was not very helpful to agriculture. If we had an enlightened statement from a back-bencher on the Government side, it would, I believe, be very helpful to the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by Deputy Dillon and the other Deputies who have spoken on this Vote and in what I have to add I propose to confine myself to a <Col N="280" /> couple of small matters.  In the County Cavan there is a fairly general complaint that the quality of the seed oats available last year was not up to a good standard.  I think the Minister was asked to receive a deputation on this matter.  The farmers of Cavan are anxious to get some Scotch seed oats as a change.  The experience of these farmers after a great many years is that they would benefit by an occasional change of Scotch seed oats.  They know after long years' experience the beneficial effect of such a change of seed.  The answer of the Minister generally is that we have as good oats in our own country as there is in Scotland.  I am not going to dispute that point at all and neither am I going to give a personal opinion on the merits of Scotch as against Irish seed.  But a great number of the farmers of Cavan who have given the matter thought have come to the conclusion that Scotch seed is an improvement on Irish seed.  I know that while Irish seed may be as good as Scotch seed I have personal experience that Irish seed supplied in the County Cavan some years ago was of very inferior quality and some of it was not fit to be sold.  I think the Minister would be well advised in allowing a small quantity of oats to be imported free of duty so as to improve the seed. The corn grown from that seed this coming year would be sold by the growers to their neighbours for next year's oat seedlings.  Every experienced farmer is convinced that the importation of Scotch oat seed would be helpful to growers.  In such circumstances the Minister might allow a quantity of this oats to be imported free of duty for seed purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a matter raised by Deputy Dillon which is the most important matter in the agricultural industry just now.  I refer to the infertility of cows, or what is called contagious abortion, or whatever else the name of it may be.  I do not know really that it is contagious abortion. I believe it is due to sterility in the bulls, or that an insufficient number of bulls is licensed by the Department. <Col N="281" /> I believe that these pedigree bulls are not able to serve 20 per cent. of the number of cows that the old cross-bred bulls served successfully.  I notice that the more highly the animals are bred the smaller the number of cows they serve.  For that reason I believe that the Minister would be well advised in directing his judges at the local shows to license a large number of bulls than they have been licensing hitherto.</P>
    <P>In the meantime there should be some research work done so as to discover a cure for this disease.  It is impossible at present to say what causes it. I know that the farmers of the country as a whole are suffering huge losses because of contagious abortion in their cattle.  I believe that loss runs into millions.  The dairy farmers are suffering most keenly, for in many cases they are not only left without cows and milk for the year, but they suffer heavy losses in disposing at what might be called throwaway prices of cows that have aborted. The poorer farmers are specially hard hit in this way, because they are not able to hold on to their cows until the following year.  They are glad to get 50/- for some fairly good young cows, and that is all because of this disease. I would suggest to the Minister that he should inquire into the matter.  Perhaps he would think it well to license more bulls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the trade agreement with Germany.  It is a very good thing, of course, to trade with all the countries that we can, and to do so on the best possible terms that we can get.  At the same time, trading on a 1-2 basis with Germany is not of very great advantage to this country.  It means a double advantage to Germany when we have to sell our agricultural produce to her at the same price that we sell it to Great Britain, subject to the tariffs.  Now that the Government are in communication with Great Britain with a view to renewing the arrangement for trade for the coming year, would it not be well if they could also arrange with her to take from us the extra stuff that we are sending to Germany and <Col N="282" /> other countries?  There is no question but that Great Britain is able to buy more stuff than we have to sell.  If she were to take the extra stuff that we have to sell in return for what we have to buy from other countries, it would be of great advange to us.  I do not know, for instance, the quantity of manufactured articles that we take from Germany, but I believe these could be supplied just as well by Britain if we could get Britain to take the extra stuff that Germany is taking from us.  It would be to our advantage to do so.  It would be better for us to get on a pound for pound basis rather than be carrying on as we are at present on the 1-2 basis.</P>
    <P>We have to admit, of course, that Britain is collecting all the disputed moneys on the limited amount of our produce that she is taking from us, so that whatever extra produce she took under the arrangement I suggest would carry no tariff.  We would be getting full value for it, and that would help to lighten the burden that we are bearing at present.  Therefore, there would be a double advantage in dealing with Britain by a trade arrangement on the lines I suggest.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I have anything more to say on this Estimate.  It would be useless for me to go into the general question of the agricultural industry. I do not think that we are likely to make any impression on the Minister's policy, but I do hope that he will give attention to the matters that I have called his attention to.  If he agrees to do, the results may be of some use to the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I desire to refer to disease amongst cows, and the numbers of them that farmers, to their great loss, find are not in calf.  I do not know whether that is due to abortion or what is the cause of it, but at any rate there is something seriously wrong.  It is a matter that calls for special attention from the veterinary branch of the Department. I would ask the Minister to give special attention to it during the spring and next summer.  During last <Col N="283" /> year and the year before there were little signs of this disease to be seen in the locality where I live.  After ten weeks or so cows that were thought to be in calf were found not to be in calf.  In five or six months' time we knew exactly what the position was, but we are not able to say whether it is abortion, or indeed what it is, that has got into the herds. Farmers do not know how to treat the disease properly.  Instructions for its treatment are given in leaflets issued by the Department, but in order to apply the remedies suggested it would be necessary for farmers to bring veterinary surgeons to their places.  Farmers, unfortunately, are not in a position at the moment to pay veterinary surgeons.  Therefore, I think the Department should make a bigger effort in sending around more of their own staff to see if something cannot be done to prevent the spread of this disease.  About nine or ten years ago I saw something like this disease in our locality.  At that time I had about 30 cows, and Deputies can realise the losses which the spread of the disease could cause me and my neighbours who also keep a good many cows.  The loss of a cow and calf every year in a big herd is a very big item.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to give his attention to the amount of money allocated for premiums for bulls.  I think he should be a little more generous in the amount of the premiums given to people who keep bulls of the shorthorn breed so that there will be plenty of heifers to keep up the standard of dairying in the country.  During the last couple of years we have been short of heifers of the shorthorn breed.  The number of calves that were killed has left us short, but of course it could be seen from the beginning that that was going to be the outcome of that policy.  There is a big demand from other countries as well for heifers, so that I hope the Minister will do something by way of increasing the premiums for the shorthorn breed of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the horse-breeding <Col N="284" /> industry, we have probably a sufficient number of sires throughout the country, but I think they are not up to the standard of 20 or 25 years ago. The thoroughbred sires that we have all over the country can to an extent be availed of by farmers, but I do not propose to deal with that aspect of the industry.  What I would like to see is that sires calculated to produce hunters would be up to a higher standard than they are.  If the Minister would agree to give some help to farmers so as to make it easy for them to purchase a better class of sire, he would, I think, be conferring a great benefit on the industry. I am one of the directors of the Waterford meat factory.  We have had the canned meat business going on there now.  I do not know what price the Minister paid for the cattle that were sent there, but so far as we are concerned we have done our best to try and dispose of the stuff. I think we will be able to make the business pay for itself this year.  In the first year that it was started we were not able to do that.  We hope to do better this year.  There is an item of £400 for the factory in the Estimate.  I would like to hear from the Minister what exactly it is for. Now, with regard to this item about the compensation paid to canned beef manufacturers.  Does that mean the factory in Waterford?</P>

      <P>I think, Sir, it would be for me to answer the last Deputy's question first.  I had hoped to get names submitted for the various committees by the 1st of February, and for that purpose I sent circulars to county committees and Deputies asking them to submit names.  Two or three days ago, however, I was told that some of the counties are not covered for the moment.  However, these names will be in some time in the near future, and then we will be in a position to nominate the committees and boards.  Even after that, however, it will be about two months before the Act will be operative, but I still hope that it will be operative before the 1st of May.</P>
      <P>Now, first of all, with regard to the question of stallions, which was raised during the debate, I should like to explain that I am not any more in favour of developing the horse racing industry than of developing the hunter or trooper industry.  We have, however, an Estimate from year to year for the provision of loans and subsidies for the purchase of stallions of the ordinary hunter and trooper class, but up to this year we have not had an Estimate for the purchase of stallions of the racing type, and that is why this title had to be introduced in order that we might be able to buy that type of stallion.  As a result of the recommendations of the Commission, we also intend to improve the other strains of stallion and to give more encouragement in the way of finance.  I think Deputies will find, when the annual Estimates are circulated, that we are proposing to the Dáil to provide a much larger sum for that purpose in future.  So that we hope we may succeed in getting a better type of stallion and in getting a bigger number, if possible, also.  I agree with the Deputy who has just spoken that it is almost impossible to get them at all at the moment.</P>

      <P>What is the Department's attitude with regard to the Clydesdale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked the commission to inquire into that question also, <Col N="286" /> and I think I am stating their views correctly when I say that they thought the Department's regulations too rigid on that question.  The Department had only allowed the registration of Clydesdale stallions in certain districts, principally from Dublin up to Louth and Monaghan and about ten miles around Cork.  As a result of the recommendations of the commission, we have relaxed that regulation and have agreed to register the Clydesdale or Shire stallion in part of County Meath and County Offaly at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not feel too happy about it, but I do not feel that I know as much about the horse-breeding industry as the people who sat on that commission and the officers in the Department.  However, we will see how the experiment works. Now, with regard to bulls, I would assure Deputy Dillon and others that every encouragement is given to the dairy type of bull.  The amounts voted under the various heads&mdash; premium bulls, special loans for congested districts, and so on&mdash;in all these schemes we favour the dairy bull, whether the Shorthorn or Kerry, and as far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned in this expenditure of this money, they do not favour in any way the encouragement of the beef classes.  There may be something in what Deputy Dillon says, but not so much, I think, outside the West of Ireland, perhaps.  However, outside the West of Ireland, I think, people are more inclined to breed for milk than for beef.  As far as I know, in Munster and most parts of Leinster, the milk strain is looked on as more important than the beef strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the questions that were raised as to the trade with Germany, I stated that the price we are receiving for butter in the German market is fixed by the highest Australian price in London.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon says, that we have succeeded here for some time in getting an average higher price for our butter than Australia gets in Great Britain, but I think if you take <Col N="287" /> the top Australian price in London as an average price for our butter in Germany, we will be doing very well, and I think that if there were no economic war or no interference with our trade with Great Britain, we could carry on that trade and carry it on at a profit&mdash;a very slight profit, of course, but at some profit at any rate.  With regard to the cattle for Germany, the price there varies, but at any rate we are in the position that we can instruct the buyers to try at all times in the Dublin market to go a little bit higher than the other buyers are inclined to go, and, in that way try to get prices as firm as possible.  I think the fact that we have bought, say, 300 or 400 cattle in the Dublin market has a good effect in keeping prices up and, in addition to that, we have carried on this trade in cattle with Germany as a profitable enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true to say that you are paying the annuities to Germany in the cattle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  Perhaps the Deputy could reason it out that way, but I am not inclined to agree with him.  Now, with regard to the Red Marvel wheat, Deputy Dillon asked why we confined ourselves to Red Marvel wheat.  The reason is that it is a crop that is more generally grown as a spring crop than any other in this country, and in a scheme like this, where we are merely providing a supply of commercial wheat, we thought it better to keep to a strain that had been tried and found generally satisfactory.  It is quite possible that in time we may find other spring varieties more satisfactory, and experiments are being carried out on various breeds and strains of spring varieties to see if we may be able to get a more suitable variety.  For instance, one variety which is grown very generally in Canada and other places, and which is commercially known as Manitoba wheat, has been tried here and has been found to be very successful on certain farms, but it appears to require good land.  However, it comes in quickly, and if sown on the same day as Red Marvel it is <Col N="288" /> almost certain to be ready a couple of weeks beforehand, which is certainly desirable.  However, whether the fact that it comes in more quickly outweighs its possible disadvantages, such as proneness to disease and so on, is a matter for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say off-hand, but I think the Deputy may take it that none of these strains has escaped Professor Caffrey and his staff in Glasnevin, and of course, as time goes on and he tries them through the county committees, we will be able to decide which is the most suitable strain.  Possibly, it is from Glasnevin that they came to the Roscommon committee to be tried.  There was certainly a loss in wheat here last year in certain parts.  Certain crops failed. Certain crops of wheat were unmillable, but the same would apply to a certain part of our barley crop and our oats crop.  We had big failures in turnips.  We always have in this country failures in turnips, and there may be failures in any crop a farmer may try.  I do not think at all, however, that the percentage of failure in the wheat crop was anything more than the percentage would be in any other crop.  Certainly I would say that probably no country whatever has uniform stocks.  Take America, Australia and the big wheat-growing countries.  They have catastrophic failures during some years such as we do not ever have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very unscientific description.  The Deputy asked me about the Flax Act and the staffs. There is one supervisory inspector, three inspectors and three temporary inspectors.  In addition there is a scheme for the training of scutching apprentices.  I do not know, however, if any of these men would have any time to carry out the research in flax-growing which Deputy O'Donovan has mentioned.  Deputy O'Donovan has <Col N="289" /> some experience of the work of the Department's inspectors in this respect, and he knows that if such is possible it will be done.  Deputy O'Donovan also went to the trouble of adding up the amount provided in this Supplementary Estimate for additional staffs.  He states that the cost is between £10,000 and £11,000.  I assume his figure is correct, but you will notice that in this Supplementary Estimate I have asked for £439,092, but it is stated that there are savings amounting to £439,082.  One item in these Estimates is a saving of £16,000 on staffs under the Cattle and Sheep Act, so that there is not an aggregate increase in the expenditure on staffs. Under the rules which are observed here, however, I have to come to the Dáil for the increased expenditure required for any staff under any new service or Act.  That is not an aggregate increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern asked about seed for Cavan.  There is being provided under the portion of the Relief Vote that is administered by my Department out of the Unemployment Fund, a certain amount for seed.  That is a cheap seed scheme, not a free seed scheme.  The seed is given in small quantities to small holders at a reduced rate.  Part of the County Cavan, West Cavan, comes into that scheme so that there will be a certain amount of seed oats and seed potatoes distributed in that part of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I do not agree with the Deputy.  We come now to the question of contagious abortion and sterility in cows.  So far as the opinion of our veterinary staffs goes, they do not look upon them as the same disease.  Contagious abortion is a forerunner of sterility.  They are not the same disease but one is caused by the other.  We have not succeeded, nor has any other country either, in finding a ready remedy for this trouble. Some two or three years ago the veterinary surgeons working in the research laboratory at Thorndale did a survey of certain parts of the country and it was found that contagious abortion was a real trouble in the country.  I think they found that few herds were free from it.  A number of our herds were fairly badly affected.  It is all right carrying out a survey to find out the incidence of the disease, but in the research laboratory here, they have been carrying out experiments and trying out various remedies and they have not yet found an easy remedy for this trouble.  If we had a sure and certain remedy, I think Deputies may take it that the Department would lose no time in making that remedy known and in giving whatever assistance might be necessary. When Deputy Holohan said that the Department is not sufficiently helpful, he ought to remember that perhaps the veterinary staff have not that confidence in these remedies which would make them so enthusiastic in their help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that question, may I ask if his attention has been directed to the fact <Col N="291" /> that a great deal of the temporary sterility of cattle is due to catarrh or vaginitis which is not contagious abortion.  There is a Danish remedy for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  Again I do not like to speak dogmatically on these subjects, not having the knowledge that a person who so speaks should have, but as far as I can learn from the veterinary profession there is a cure for that, but I am afraid the treatment must be always carried out by a veterinary surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer may know his cattle are affected but he does not know whether it is contagious abortion or sterility.  He must really get a veterinary surgeon to tell him.  I think the only solution for a farmer who wants to improve his herd in any way is to take the advice of a veterinary surgeon and to allow the veterinary surgeon to give whatever treatment he thinks fit.  I do not think there is any other way of dealing with it at the moment.  Continuous research in this and other countries may give us a vaccine.  It is the sort of disease which should be improved by a vaccine, but so far we have not got that vaccine.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £32,442 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, sec. 46, and c. 71, sec. 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, secs. 17, 18 and 20; 53 and 54 Vict., c. 49, sec. 2; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; 25 of 1925; 11 of 1926; 19 of 1927; 31 of 1929; 11 of 1931; 33 and 38 of 1933; 11 of 1934; and 41 of 1936).</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £380 required under sub-head C&mdash;Incidental Expenses &mdash;is due to the increase in expenditure on advertising in connection with tenders for contracts for the carrying out of improvement works.  Owing to the increasing rate of division of untenanted land during the past few years, new holdings are being created in larger numbers, with a consequent increase in the volume of improvement works to be carried out.  The rate of expenditure on improvements for the current year has exceeded original anticipations.  Outlay for the nine months to the 31st December, 1936, amounted to £486,500 and it is expected that expenditure at a corresponding rate will continue to the end of the financial year.  Provision for a further £40,000 is, accordingly, made under sub-head I&mdash;Improvement of Estates, etc.&mdash;making the total provision for the year under this sub-head, £646,500.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T (1) provides a sum of £1,500 to meet the deficiency in consequence of the 50 per cent. reduction under the Land Act, 1933, in the sums collectable from tenants as payment in lieu of rent.  Under the Land Act, 1923, the Land Commission are liable to the landlords for the full amount due to them in respect of payment in lieu of rent.  Of the present provision, £714 is required to make good the deficiency relating to the period from the May gale, 1933, to the end of the <Col N="293" /> financial year 1935-36 and the balance, £786, to meet the deficiency in the current year.  The new sub-head Z&mdash; Losses&mdash;was opened in order to provide for payment of compensation&mdash;£61, including costs&mdash;to the owner of a private motor car damaged in collision with a cart driven by an employee of the Land Commission and for payment of £1 to an officer of the Land Commission to compensate for damage to clothing.</P>
    <P>Under the new sub-head A.A., provision is made for the payment of lodgment fees in connection with warrants lodged with under-sheriffs for the recovery of arrears of land purchase annuities, etc. Provision for this service was made in previous Estimates but it did not appear in the Estimates for the current year in consequence of a judgment of the High Court, Halpin v.  The Attorney-General. The doubts raised by that judgment were removed by Section 17 of the Land Act, 1936, and the provision is, accordingly, restored to the Vote.  The amount required for the current year is £23,000.  Recovery of the fees will, where possible, be effected by under-sheriffs, and it is expected that £5,000 will be recovered by the end of the financial year for Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.  The fees paid to county registrars, where they discharge the duties of under-sheriffs, are surrenderable to the Exchequer.  The gross amount of the Supplementary Estimate &mdash;£64,942&mdash;is offset by savings on other sub-heads and by an increase in the amount available for Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote, leaving the total net sum required £32,442.  The main savings occur under sub-head A&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash; £4,136; sub-head J&mdash;Advance to meet deficiency of Income from Untenanted Lands&mdash;£7,000; sub-head R&mdash;Payments under Section 27 (2) of the Land Act, 1933&mdash;£6,000; sub-head S&mdash;Amount required to complete Purchase Proceedings pending under Land Acts, 1903-1909, £5,000.  Smaller savings elsewhere in the Vote amount to £5,364.</P>

The result of that is that estates are not being improved in accordance with the sound, old Land Commission practice that used to obtain.  In the old days, when an estate or holding was acquired for sub-division, the Land Commission inspectors went down and if they found that part of that land was run-down or boggy or swampy, they deemed it their duty to put every acre of it in the best condition in which it could reasonably be put before they divided it and allotted it to tenants.  The general theory was that, when you got a holding from the Land Commission, all the arable land on that holding was fit for cultivation forthwith and was in a proper condition to maintain the family put in there.  I say that families are being put into holding now by the Land Commission and the condition in which the land is being handed over to the tenants is a public disgrace.  The only result of that is going to be that you are going to break the incoming tenants, because in very few cases have incoming tenants the capital to reclaim land that requires drainage and improvement that ought to have been done by the Land Commission and for which this House votes money.  It might be well for Deputies to remember that this House has differentiated between the purchase price of the land and improvements.  The Exchequer pays for the improvements and the <Col N="295" /> tenant pays for the land.  If you put the tenant in on the land without having these improvements done, he will be broken.</P>
      <P>There is a second aspect of the situation to which I invite the attention of the Minister.  At first glance he will think that I am being acutely contentious, but he may live to learn that what I am saying is true.  In the old days, when the Land Commission prepared a scheme for distribution of a given piece of land, they regarded it as their duty to ensure that every person given a piece of land was a fit and proper person to get such land&mdash;that is to say, that he was an industrious type of man, that he had some little capital of his own, or he had family connections who would help him in the initial stages of getting going in the new holding.  The Commissioners were prepared to stand at his elbow and give him a hand during the first three or four years, but they always wanted to know before they gave a man a holding that he was the kind of person who might reasonably be expected to make a success of it.  I allege that that criterion of excellence has been completely abandoned, and that anybody who puts up to get land now gets it.  In addition to vexing the Minister, I may vex some of my own colleagues, because&mdash;the Minister probably does not expect me to say this&mdash; I have investigated most of the complaints made to me about the distribution of land, and I generally found that, taking all things into consideration, no reasonable man could find any political discrimination in the distribution of land by the Irish Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I am always prepared to admit that while I found that Fianna Fáil complained that it was Blue-shirts were getting the land, when the position was examined closely there was a pretty fair average assortment all round and it could not be alleged that there was favour towards one side or the other.  If one place got a surplus of supporters of the local cumann, it was found that in other places quite <Col N="296" /> a surprising number of supporters of Fine Gael were put in.  After five years we have come to the conclusion that there is very little political discrimination shown by the Land Commission. That is, as far as I can make out.  There is one thing I cannot understand, however.  I could understand if all the unsuitable tenants were being put in by Fianna Fáil, then I would say that it was clear the Minister was putting in every rag, tag and bobtail prepared to go and shout for him.  I could understand foursquare political corruption and jobbery, and I could understand jobbery.  I think the Minister could understand jobbery also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be desirable that we should start to compare our respective traditions. Let us confine ourselves to this question. I think the Minister is as good a judge and as good at his job as the next, and I would expect to find a pretty good job done in that regard. I do not allege that against the Minister in connection with land.  I do not think it has been done, is being done now or was done by his predecessors. What I do allege is a far graver responsibility, that in order to create a general impression of a great achievement the Land Commission has been driven to divide land at such a rate that makes matters impossible for the staff, if it is to be done in an efficient way, with the result that the land has not been improved or the tenants properly chosen.  I say that if the Minister looks into land that was divided in his own constituency in the course of a couple of years, he will find, at least on one estate, that more than half the land has been already set by the tenants to shopkeepers in a neighbouring town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very same neighbourhood, if <Col N="297" /> he will go and inspect another estate, I think he will agree with me that a good deal of the land was quite unfit to be put into the hands of tenants on small holdings, because the expense of renovating it is such as will make it impossible for them to carry on.  I deliberately refrained from naming the estate but, with the Minister's permission, I will send the name to him. I do not think it is fair to drag individual names up in this House unless there is authority to do so.  I will send the Minister the name of the estate, as he knows it as well as I do. I think that is an illustration of the evil that I allege, and I should be glad if other Deputies gave their experience, and compared the condition of land handed over to incoming tenants now with the condition of that land seven years ago.  I ask Deputies also to tell their experience of the average tenant put on divided estates now with the average tenant put on similar estates seven or eight years ago.  I believe they will confirm what I am saying, that the land has not been adequately improved, and that sufficient discrimination was not made in the choice of persons getting holdings. That lack of discrimination is the failure on the part of the Land Commission to satisfy itself that the incoming tenants are persons who have a reasonable chance of making a success of the holdings they have been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the division of land in my constituency does not agree with that of Deputy Dillon.  As a matter of fact I found that the Land Commission are sometimes a bit too careful as to what land they will acquire for division.  I was interested in some land, as I wanted it divided, and I was informed that the Land Commission did not consider it suitable or good enough for division.  I found that the inspectors were very careful about the people to whom they would give land and when making inquiries regarding suitable applicants, they endeavoured to find out if they had practical experience of the working of land.  They always insisted on that qualification. <Col N="298" /> One of the first questions they ask is whether an applicant has had practical experience of working land.  Very often an agricultural labourer has more experience in that way than people who are better off in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone are men needed with a practical knowledge of the working of land, but they also need some backing and, to my mind, the best classes of persons to whom to give land are the sons of small farmers.  If possible, give land to people as close as possible to their friends, because very often they are not in a position to purchase the necessary farm implements and horses with which to work the land, and if land allotted to such people is situate anyway near their own friends, they get a good deal of work done free and they get a loan of horses.  The Land Commission are very anxious to ascertain if applicants for land come within that category. It must be recognised that there is an insistent demand all over the country for the division of land, and I am sure every Deputy is annoyed by people in his constituency worrying him to get after the Land Commission about land.  It is quite possible that as a result, the Land Commission have to do what Deputy Dillon stated, to divide land that is not very suitable for division.  My complaint, and I am sure it is that of other Deputies, is that the Land Commission are not going fast enough.  I had a letter from a constituent this morning bewailing the fact that only 270 acres had been divided in County Waterford last year.  My particular complaint is that people write to me stating that they have offered land to the Land Commission for the past three or four years, that they got the usual reply, and heard no more about it.  I also get complaints from people who are looking for land, intimating that owners have offered land to the Land Commission, and as the people in the district are anxious to get it, they want to know when it will be taken and given to them.  Between <Col N="299" /> all, it is very hard to know what to do.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring to get the Land Commission to take over farms and divide them, and we endeavour to recommend suitable tenants.  A farm in my neighbourhood was offered to the Land Commission two years ago.  It was land that was eminently suitable for division, being a national holding which would be free of rent in a few years, and lately it has been taken over by a private purchaser.  We are up against this position, that there is the energetic go-ahead man who wants more land, a successful butcher, perhaps, who wants accommodation land to produce the raw material for his business at first cost.  The natural desire of such a man is to acquire more land, while, on the other hand, we are met with groups of people who ask: &ldquo;Why allow such a man to buy land?  He is wealthy and can afford to pay an uneconomic price.  We cannot do that; we want the land and would be able to work it.  Why do you not get it for us?&rdquo;  This matter is becoming dangerous For instance, in my county lately, there was a recurrence of cattle driving, and cattle which were put on an estate were driven and scattered all over the country.  That is just an instance of what might happen if land division is not speeded up.</P>

      <P>In the Vote before us, I find no request for moneys for the purchase of land.

I quite agree that it would be desirable that the Land Commission should put land into the very best possible condition before dividing it, but it is not very easy, because there is such an insistent demand for the division of land that if the Land Commission were to follow counsels of perfection and put the land in the very best possible order, it would be very long before the claims of those calling for the division of land would be met.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one matter in connection with the division of land in County Wicklow.  We are not as fortunate as other counties in having any of our estates divided, and the only appeal I want to make briefly to the Minister is in respect of land convenient to villages or areas with a population of several hundreds.  The action of the Land Commission some years ago in connection with what were called cow-parks was found to be a great convenience.  It is a great convenience for a man who may not be successful in getting nine or ten acres of land to get a portion of land for the grazing of his cows.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been customary about this time of the year to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the purposes of the Land Commission, but this Supplementary Estimate, taken in conjunction with the increase in the improvements sub-head of the Vote for the financial year 1936-37 as compared with 1935-36, shows an increase of approximately £100,000; <Col N="301" /> in other words, at the end of this financial year the Land Commission will have spent approximately £100,000 more than in 1935-36 on the improvement of estates.  Now, £100,000, even in these days of high spending, is an enormous lot of money, and I think the total Estimate for the improvement of estates now amounts to £650,000. Even admitting for the moment that the Minister has succeeded during the last two or three years in speeding up land distribution enormously, and in dividing double and treble as many acres as were divided in the days when his predecessors were in office, the amount of money spent on the improvement of estates at present still represents about six times, or at least five times, as much as the amount spent during the time the previous Government were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the main Estimate was being discussed last year, I asked the Minister if he were satisfied that all this huge expenditure was justified and that the Land Commission and the State were getting full value for all the money spent.  I have no doubt that in a year like this, when the Government propose holding a general election, they would be inclined to be more generous than usual in the expenditure of money on works such as are provided for under this subhead of the Vote, but, nevertheless, I still hold that the expenditure of £650,000 on the improvement of 100,000 acres of land does not, to my mind at least, represent adequate value, either to the State or to the Land Commission. However, as I say, I raised this question when the main Estimate was being discussed last year, and I invited the Minister to say something on that point, but so far as I can recollect he steered clear of it altogether when replying.  In any event, when money is spent on the improvement of an estate or a holding, it is only right that the person for whom that holding is intended should get the full value of it, and I submit that in very many cases throughout the Free State at the moment the allottee is not getting the value of these improvements, and that in many cases, because of the types of <Col N="302" /> allottee selected, the original owner of the land or some shopkeeper in a neighbouring town is getting the benefit of the taxpayers' money which the Land Commission spent on the improvement of the holdings.</P>
    <P>It is only right, I admit, that landless men and men living in labourers' cottages should be considered for land when it is being divided, but it is also the duty of the Land Commission to see that that man has either the means to work that holding when he gets it, or, if he has not got the means, that some provision should be made whereby he will be enabled to work it.  The Minister must know as well as I know that at the present moment in many parts of this country land is being divided and the allottees who are getting that land proceed immediately to sublet it, either to the original owner or to some shopkeeper or trader in the neighbouring town.  I submit that it is not fair either to the Land Commission or to the State that that state of affairs should exist, or, if it does exist, that it should be allowed to continue.  The Land Commission should see that the person on whose behalf money is spent on the improvement of a holding is the person who will benefit by the expenditure of that money.</P>
    <P>In connection with that matter, I want to complain of the delay in some cases which takes place before the necessary works of improvement are started.  I know very many instances where estates were improved at least three or four years ago.  I know one particular estate where a scheme of improvements was drawn up about four years ago, and the tenants who benefited by the provision of this estate were told that they were to get grants for the erection of new houses or the improvement of existing houses. In a few cases, the tenants have got those grants, but in the majority of cases they have not got them yet. That is only one instance.  I could give half-a-dozen other instances, but I am not going to weary the House with that point.  I submit to the Minister that there is very often quite unnecessary delay in making available <Col N="303" /> grants especially for the improvements of houses for tenants on estates divided by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The only one other point I wish to make is with reference to Section 17 of the Land Act of 1936.  The Minister read the particular paragraph relating to this particular sub-head so fast that I could not follow him quite clearly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, there is a sum of £23,000 provided in this Estimate for the payment of the necessary fees under that section.  It is the section relating to the collection of Land Commission annuities by means of warrants issued to the county registrars or sheriffs.  The Land Commission, in the first instance, must pay those fees to the county registrars or to the sheriffs.  Then the county registrar or the sheriff proceeds to collect those fees afterwards from the unfortunate tenants who are in arrears with payment of Land Commission annuities.  When you consider that this Act has been in operation only for a short time, the sum of £23,000 appears to be rather an abnormal amount for that particular purpose.  I should like to get from the Minister some statement with regard to the manner in which this particular section of the Act is working out.  What loss does he estimate will be incurred because of the operation of this particular section by the end of the financial year?  I should also like to know what is the cost of operating this particular section for one whole financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that under this section, notwithstanding the enthusiasm with which it was received by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party when it was first introduced as a Land Act in 1933 and subsequently amended and strengthened by a section in the Land Act, 1936, the State will have to pay the piper for the privilege of getting the county registrars and sheriffs to collect annuities from unfortunate defaulters.  The position is then, in my view at all events, that the loss will be exceptionally heavy, and that as long as this particular section remains in operation the State will continue <Col N="304" /> year after year to lose ever increasing sums of money.  Under the old arrangement&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;the loss was trifling in the course of the whole financial year.  This is only a provisional Estimate and it is intended to cover a very short period; yet we find that the State has to foot a bill of £23,000 for the purpose of making good the fees and expenses to which sheriffs and county registrars are entitled under that particular section of the Act.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I wish to refer.  Under the Act of 1931 provision was made for the purpose of carrying out certain necessary improvements to holdings before they were finally vested in the tenants. Does this sum of £650,000, which the Land Commission is spending or will spend by the end of this financial year, include any money for that particular object?  I think I asked that question before when the Land Commission Estimate was being discussed, but I have no recollection of getting a reply, and I would be interested to know what amount has been set aside for that particular purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what Deputy Dillon has said in regard to Land Commission officials.  So far as I know the Land Commission officials&mdash;and I am fairly intimately acquainted with their work&mdash;they certainly carry out their duties in a very fair and very scrupulous manner.  So far as the division of land is concerned, there is no doubt that they do to the very best of their ability try to select the right person.  If the right person is not selected, and if the State is losing money because of the manner in which the Land Acts are being administered, the fault does not lie either with the Minister or with his higher officials in the Land Commission.</P>

There is also another case to which I should like for a moment to direct the attention of the Minister.  It is that of a man named Patrick Fitzgerald, Harpurs Island, Glounthaune, in the Keane Estate. That estate is not yet vested.  The place is practically an island.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  If it does not affect that it affects nothing. Surely to Heavens the preservation of that man's farm would be an improvement. The estate is not yet vested; therefore, it comes under this heading. The position there is that the land is completely surrounded by water, and when the tide comes in it <Col N="307" /> bursts down the barriers that were put up there.  This man wrote to the Land Commission last year asking if they would spend some money to prevent the tide wiping out his farm altogether.  The Land Commission replied that that was his business. That is what they told him.  This country has been left with white elephants enough without the Land Commission leaving it some more.  If the purchase money of that estate is going to be handed over to that landlord without a proper deduction being made for the upkeep of the bank, well then I hold that whatever officer in the Land Commission is responsible should be tried right away.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  The trouble is that this land was acquired by compulsory purchase.  The man was compelled to buy under the 1923 Act whether he liked it or not.  The State, who advanced the money, are responsible to the taxpayer for the preservation of their interests.  In this particular case the embankments are being broken down every day, the  is continually coming in and if it succeeds in coming in as it has been doing, the whole farm will in time be wiped out.  I suggest to the Minister that the money should be held back from the landlord so as to insure that those embankments are kept in proper condition.  We have cases cropping up where the landlord having got his money has gone off and nobody is responsible for the maintenance of these embankments.</P>

      <P>If the tide comes in and wipes out this land I do not want anyone to say that I was responsible through my negligence.  It is time that the Minister took that matter in hand.  This £646,000 is apparently being spent everywhere else except in East Cork, where there has been no division of lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that there should be any criticism or opposition to this Vote.  As I understand the matter, this will enable the Land Commission to spend £100,000 more on improvements of estates this year than they did last year.  That has been criticised from the point of view of the value obtained by the Land Commission for the money expended. Opposition Deputies criticised the spending of the full amount of £646,550 on the improvement of hundreds of thousands of acres of land.  I hold that good value has been obtained for this money.  My only complaint is that sufficient money has not been allocated to carry out the full improvement schemes that we would like to see put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think nobody will argue that the wages paid to the workmen employed on these improvements were too high. Neither can the argument be used that the houses erected were too good for the incoming tenants.  I think it is quite obvious to all that the road-making and the fencing carried out has not been extravagant.  The roads leading to the new houses were necessary and only very necessary fencing was carried out.  We would like to see still further repairs to these roads and still further money made available for the improvements.  I hold that only very necessary drainage has been carried out on these farms that were given to the incoming tenants. For these reasons I do not see why there should be any criticism or any opposition to the passing of this Vote.  It has been argued that the Land Commission is merely expending the money in making improvements not exactly for the incoming tenants but for the late owner or local shopkeeper who will take the land upon <Col N="309" /> the eleven-months system.  Now, generally speaking, in the County Meath we have not met with much of this abuse.  If it exists in other counties it certainly does not to any large extent exist in Meath.  It did exist seven or eight years ago, and for this reason&mdash;that no houses were erected for the incoming tenants and no roads were made into their farms. Consequently as they were living far away they were compelled to let the lands on the eleven-months system. That is not so now.  The Land Commission is doing what is necessary to enable the incoming tenant to make full use of his land.  That is what the estate improvements in Meath do. Where these improvements have been carried out within the past couple of years we have no complaints to make. The only thing that so far has been overlooked in my county is that no provision has been made for the erection of corn lofts where stables have been erected.  Where out-offices have been erected we advocate the erection of corn lofts.  That is because when the new tillage policy comes into operation as a result of the division of these lands there will be a call for such facilities by the tenants so that they may be able to store the corn they grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to know the period that is involved.  Is it the period since the passing of the Land Act of 1933?  Does this £23,000 represent money exclusively due to the sheriffs for costs involved down the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if for the period under review the Minister could give me the aggregate amount of sheriffs' costs in connection with the issue of warrants from their offices.  A lot was said on this Vote that, in my opinion, is very much beside the question.  A lot that is said both inside and outside this House had, in my opinion, been better left unsaid.  Deputy Goulding talked <Col N="310" /> about cattle driving which had no relation whatever to this Vote.  I think Deputies should examine their consciences as regards what they said in the past about cattle driving.  I am glad to say that in the constituency that I represent we never had any trouble of that kind.  Public men should have some sense of responsibility, and should not talk about cattle driving.</P>
    <P>As regards the division and improvement of estates, I do want to say in a most unqualified manner that the inspectors of the Land Commission who have been engaged on the work of the division of land over the last 25 years have been absolutely fair and efficient, and, in the main, remarkably shrewd in the selection of the tenants for the holdings.  We have this ramp about the division of land.  In the first place, you cannot divide land overnight, and in the second place we have not so much land to divide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  If you rush the work of the improvement of estates in pursuance of a public clamour, then the cost is going to be excessive.  If a man experienced in that work has to be taken from some other employment and put in it he is going to demand higher wages. Deputy Roddy was justified in saying that an economic value has not been got by the Government or the State for the amount of money spent on these improvement schemes.  One reason for that is that the inspectors engaged on it have been driven off their feet.  They have not been given sufficient time to do the ordinary work that falls to be done when the exchange of land takes place.  They have not the time to do the work in the way that it should be done, and that is largely because of this ramp for the division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Land Act of 1933 was going through I said I thought the process of the collection of land annuities was very efficient.  Exception was taken to the cost.  I urged on the Minister that, if the costs were thought to be excessive, the scales <Col N="311" /> should be reviewed and reduced.  The reason I gave for that was this, that, generally, the State solicitor lived in about the centre of a county.  He travelled over the county attending the district courts.  Tenant purchasers in arrears could arrange to meet him at the district courts, and either ask him to stay his hand or take portion of the amount due in order to avoid an increase in the costs.  In the main, I found that that system worked out very well.  I would say to the Minister that, if he thinks the present system is calculated to inflict extravagant costs on tenant purchasers, he should revert to the old practice.  So far as my experience goes, I found that State solicitors were very human in dealing with tenant purchasers in these matters.  The sheriff is more of an official.  His machinery is more rigid than that of the State solicitor's. It is more cast-iron, and he will not be as sympathetic in dealing with tenant purchasers as solicitors who have dealings with the people almost every day.  The sheriff is operating a cast-iron machine in his office, and he has no mercy.  He sends out the bailiffs, costs are piled up, and these fall on the tenant purchasers.  I would, therefore, say to the Minister that, if he thinks that the tendency under the present system is to place an excessive burden on tenant purchasers, he should revert to the old practice which I think worked very well.</P>
    <P>So far as the sub-division of land in the County Donegal is concerned, I congratulate the higher officials and the inspectors responsible for doing that work.  They do their work efficiently and well, and I think it is due that a tribute should be paid to them.  Politicians should have nothing to do with the division of land, but, unfortunately, politics comes into almost everything in this country. This is a work which should be left to an impartial body of men.  Speaking for myself, I should prefer to be defeated a thousand times rather than appeal to political passions in order to get votes over a matter of this kind.  I congratulate the officials <Col N="312" /> on the manner in which they have done their work in the County Donegal.</P>

      <P>I confess that I have heard many strange things said in this House, but I thought I would never see a Deputy get up here and mention such a thing as a soft-hearted solicitor.  Deputy McMenamin has made an appeal to the Minister to put back into the hands of solicitors various jobs which involve persecuting and harassing tenants, and in doing that he condemned sheriffs for the manner in which they do their work.  He described them as rigid and cast-iron.  I do not think I have ever heard solicitors described as anything but cast-iron until I listened to Deputy McMenamin this evening.</P>

It was stated here to-night that some of the lands already divided were given to unsuitable tenants and that those lands now held by the tenants were sublet by them to shopkeepers in towns and villages.  I agree that that has occurred in some places, but I do not think it would be advisable for the Minister or for the Land Commission to take that into account when they would be dividing lands.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, there is just one more point.  I notice sub-head AA.&mdash;Fees Payable in connection with Proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, £23,000.  I should like to inform the Minister that a good many tenants in my constituency, instead of getting their receivable orders in the ordinary way through the Land Commission for their half-yearly annuity, receive a warrant from the sheriff, with costs of something like 7/- or 8/- on each warrant.  I think that is very unfair on these men, many of whom have come to me and complained about it.  They say that it is very unjust and that they should get their receivable orders from the Land Commission as they always got them.  They say that it is not fair to ask them to pay 7/- or 8/- for a warrant to the sheriff, and I hope the Minister will see that that will be rectified.  They get no receivable order from the Land Commission, Sir, but they get a warrant from the sheriff for only a half-year's annuity.  I hope that the Minister and the Land Commission will see that that state of <Col N="314" /> affairs will be made right.  In conclusion, Sir, I have nothing but praise for the inspector and officers of the Land Commission in the performance of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, Sir, I should like to make a plea for a resumption of work by the Land Commission in the improvement of estates in West Cork.  Some years ago very useful and valuable work was done in this direction, and I may say in that connection that it was very efficiently carried out by the officers of the Land Commission and by the subordinates to whom their powers were delegated.  However, since the advent of minor relief schemes and under the régime under which these minor relief schemes now operate, the change has been marked by and almost complete cessation of Land Commission work throughout West Cork.  Hence it is that one very frequently hears of complaints by tenants on estates not vested, as to inroads by way of coastal erosion that has deprived them of numbers of acres of land, and complaints of the absence of other facilities that would be a very valuable improvement to the estates in question.  I urge the Minister strongly to see that some portion of the money devoted to the improvement of estates is allocated for work in the area to which I have referred, which, by reason of its uneconomic nature, is certainly extremely deserving in the matter of the apportionment of public moneys and which, I think, can lay claim to many useful avenues for expenditure of that money through the improvement of the estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice with pleasure that quite recently a substantial estate has been acquired by the Land Commission in the estate formerly held by Lord Carbery in West Cork, and I suggest that the officials of the Land Commission will find a very valuable opportunity of doing substantial improvement work, and I hope it will be undertaken at a very early date.  My knowledge of the Land Commission officials' work in regard to the improvement of estates has been a very happy one indeed, and one in which I can, without any reserve, pay a tribute to the <Col N="315" /> efficiency of their work, and, I may say also, their sense of impartiality.</P>
    <P>With reference to the complaint that Deputy Daly has made in regard to the issue of documents in connection with the collection of annuities, I may say that in that particular branch of the Land Commission&mdash;I do not know, Sir, if it is strictly correct to refer to the matter, but I am only making a passing reference to it&mdash;I have always found the same consideration extended to the tenant purchasers and I have never at any time noticed any evidence of any desire or any tendency to harass them unduly.  I think it is right that it should be said that, in the matter of the difficulties of the average tenant purchaser, and in the consideration of any representations that have to be made on their behalf, such representations are always sympathetically considered. I urge on the Minister that the whole work of improvements in West Cork should not be left entirely to the operation of the minor relief schemes, because these minor relief schemes are often governed by questions such as the degree of unemployment prevalent in a district and perhaps not always by the value of a particular scheme that could be undertaken equally well, and perhaps, in some cases, better, through the agency of the Land Commission, for the improvement of estates.  There is a tendency at the present time to transmit, from the Land Commission offices to the Office of Public Works, proposals of this kind, and I earnestly urge the Minister that in any further schemes for the improvement of estates the work that is well and capably carried out in the constituency I represent might be resumed on some kind of reasonable scale through the agency of the Minister and his Department, the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Whilst I am rising, Sir, to support the motion for the payment of this money, I must take this opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention to the very little activity there has been in County Longford for the past 12 months.  If I were to sit quietly here and to let this Vote pass without making some <Col N="316" /> protest about the inactivity in County Longford, I would certainly have to meet some criticisms when I got back. There are cases of estates being taken over there three years ago, and houses were to be built on them two years ago, and they are not finished yet.  Several ranches were inspected and yet not seven yards of them have been divided.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a growing feeling in County Longford that they are being neglected there.</P>

      <P>There has been a welcome change in the tone adopted by some Deputies this evening.  Not so long ago I heard Deputy Dillon trumpeting forth that the Fianna Fáil cumainn decided who got the land as well as who got the jobs.  I am glad to see that he has had the grace to acknowledge, on investigating the position, that he is now satisfied that such is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, if the Minister will refer to what I said he will find that the protest that I made in this House was against the growing practice of Fianna Fáil clubs announcing that they were going <Col N="317" /> to acquire certain land.  I pointed out that such a practice was extremely undesirable and gave rise to a great deal of disquiet and alarm in the country.  I was careful to point out that the Land Commission exercised a discretion but that this business of groups of men purporting to be able to deal with the land of some of their neighbours was a disgusting practice. So it was and so it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate the Deputy has now made the <i>amende honorable.</i> He is now quite satisfied that the Land Commission distribute the land to people they consider most suitable for it, irrespective of the Party to which they belong.  Other Deputies have said the same thing.  That is a very healthy position to be in.  Deputy Dillon also said that he was not satisfied that the Land Commission were getting the right type of people for allotments.  That was one of his main points.  Another was that the land had been handed over in a bad condition, that it was not fit to be given to any tenant.  So far as I can discover from the Land Commission officials there has been no change in either the method of selecting allottees or in the matter of improving estates.  The same practice that has always obtained obtains now.  In the particular case to which Deputy Dillon referred the land has only recently been handed over.  I shall have any case of that kind inquired into and the Land Commission will see what further can be done to improve the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the practice of the Land Commission to improve the land as far as it can possibly be improved before it is handed over.  I am advised that the people to whom the land is being given are of just the same type as ever they were.  You will, of course, get people who will not make good use of their land no matter how inspectors try to assist them.  I would remind the House that if people neglect to use their lands in the way in which they should use them, the Land Commission has power to take the land from them, and they will do <Col N="318" /> so.  There is an investigation going on at present.  Officers are making inspections of land that has been allotted in recent years and are making reports, and when these reports are considered the question will arise whether some of these allottees should remain in possession of their holdings or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the land is not worked as it should be worked, it will not be left with them.  They will not be left in possession of lands they are neglecting and not working.  Of course I have no choice as regards the type of allottees but I can tell Deputy Dillon and the House that the same practice is followed as has always been followed in these matters.  As regards the point raised by Deputy Dillon about the particular estate he named, I shall have inquiries made.  Other Deputies referred to the question of land division but they were ruled out. If they so desire, they can speak to me privately on the matter.  Deputy Roddy complains that there was £100,000 more spent on improvements this year than last year.  He also said that the amount spent on improvements was five or six times the amount formerly spent in that way.  I take it that the Deputy's point was that we were not getting the same value for the money spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will find it very hard to prove that.  Of course I have to take the reports I get from the responsible officials, and Deputies will remember that a tribute was paid to them from all sides of the House.  I am informed by them that the standard of work is just as high now as at any time.  If three times the amount of money that was formerly spent is now being spent, there is three times as much land being divided.  Naturally, there will be three times as much expenditure on improvements.  Deputy Roddy also asked whether the improvement grant contained any provision for improvements <Col N="319" /> under the 1931 Act.  I could not give him that information.  He complains that that question when put previously had not been answered.  I have not got separate accounts for the improvements carried out under the different Acts, so that I cannot give him that information.  Then he speaks of a loss of £23,000 which he says the unfortunate defaulters will have to suffer.  That simply refers to the fee which has to be lodged with the warrant. Deputy McMenamin objects to the new system and thinks that the old system was better for the annuitant.</P>

      <P>He suggested that there was an undue burden thrown on the unfortunate defaulters by this new system of collection.  Of course, that is not accurate at all.  I may tell Deputy McMenamin, what I imagine he should have known already as he belongs to the legal profession, that at least the State solicitor's fee and the cost of the civil bill proceedings are saved by the defaulter.  In a case where there would be £4 14s. 0d. due, there would be a difference of £1 6s. 0d. as between the new and the old system.

We have no intention of departing from the present system, and we are quite satisfied that it is a much less expensive system than the old system. Deputy Kelly raised the question of corn lofts.  Certain buildings are erected by the Land Commission, but you could not expect them to do <Col N="320" /> everything for these people.  We think they have been treated pretty well.  Deputy Murphy seems to think that where minor relief schemes are in operation the Land Commission avoids doing any work.  It is the other way round.  The Land Commission will do the work it has to do, and if the Board of Works finds the Land Commission before them in any area, they will not go into the division where the Land Commission is operating. It is only where the Land Commission are not working, that relief works are being done.  Deputy Daly complained that certain defaulters did not get their receivable orders before they got the warrant from the sheriff.  The position is that a warrant is never issued against a defaulter who has not got a receivable order as well as a six days' notice. Deputy Corry complained about the maintenance of embankments in cases where the landlords were liable.  The position is that where a landlord is liable to maintain an embankment, an application is made to the court for the retention out of the purchase fund of the sum required for the maintenance. If the landlord is not liable, there can be no such retention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Agriculture to-day to requisition infor mation from the Pigs Board as to what they were doing with the money in the Hypothetical Price Fund.  When we passed the Pigs and Bacon Act through this House, one of its features was that there would be what was known as a &ldquo;hypothetical price.&rdquo; Very few Deputies understand at this moment the nature of that arrangement. The representation made to us by the Minister was that, when the Pigs Board was established, their object would be to make the price of pigs to the producer more constant from month to month than it had ever been before.  He wanted, at the same time, in order to achieve that purpose, to induce the producers to produce more pigs in the spring and early summer and fewer pigs in the autumn.  He complained that there was nearly always a surplus of pigs in the autumn and a scarcity in the summer.  To achieve that purpose, he <Col N="322" /> said that he wanted a scheme whereunder the Pigs Board would be entitled, in the autumn months, to fix a hypothetical price for pigs.  That hypothetical price was to be substantially in excess of the price which the curer actually paid to the producer and the curer, in respect of each pig, was to hand over to the Pigs Board the difference between the actual price he paid the producer and the hypothetical price, as fixed by the Pigs Board.</P>
      <P>In November of last year the price fixed for Grade A pigs by the Pigs Board was 58/- per cwt., or thereabouts. Every man who sold a pig got 58/- per cwt.  For the purpose of my illustration, I propose to assume that each pig produced 1 cwt. of saleable pork.  At the time that 58/- per cwt. was fixed as the &ldquo;fixed price&rdquo; for pigs, the &ldquo;hypothetical price&rdquo; for pigs was fixed at 66/-.  That meant that the bacon curer paid the pig producer 58/- for his pig and paid the Pigs Board 8/- in respect of every pig he took in for curing.  Later, the difference came to be 10/-, and I think that it is now 12/- per pig, so that, on every pig sold by a farmer into a factory, he was fined from 8/- to 10/- or 12/-.  That money was taken by the factory and handed over to the Pigs Board wherewith to constitute the Hypothetical Price Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consented to that arrangement because the Minister told us that the only purpose for which that fund could be used was to carry out the reverse process in the spring months and in the months of early summer.  He said that in summer we would find that the value of pigs would be, say, 60/-, but that he would see that the Pigs Board would fix a minimum price of 75/- or 80/- per cwt., and that farmers would get about 15/- a cwt. more than their pigs were worth.  But the bacon curer who pays that inflated price for pigs will be entitled to recover out of the Hypothetical Price Fund which accumulated during the winter months, the difference between the real value of the pigs and the inflated price that the Pigs Board put upon them, so that all the farmer would drop in the autumn he would get back in the spring and summer.  He wanted to do that so as to induce most people to produce pigs <Col N="323" /> in the summer and less in the autumn, and when the balance was nicely established, the whole thing would level itself out and the fund would be used for other purposes.  I want to remind the House that, at our instigation, sub-section 6 of Section 147 was put into the Act, which compels the Pigs Marketing Board not to use the hypothetical price fund for any purpose other than the purposes referred to in that section, which are those I have described.  Lest there be any doubt on that, I refer to column 260 of the report of the special committee which considered the Pigs and Bacon Bill, 1934.  This is what I said to the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no intention by the Minister to use this levy for the purpose of building up a fund wherewith to pay export bounties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To this the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not as export bounties.  I think that the State should continue the export bounties as against the tariff. I have an amendment down which raises that point.  We want to get the home price and the export price even.  There were times when it would pay a factory to export bacon, and other times when it would not pay it.  We should, as far as possible, leave the curers in a position in which it would be all the same whether they exported or sold at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I said in reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a virtual withdrawal of what the Minister said.  The question whether it is profitable to export or not is regulated by the British tariff and by the Minister's bounties.  Is the Minister going to pay an additional bounty out of this?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By that I meant a hypothetical price fund.  Then the Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the bounty and tariff, that position existed in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that the hypothetical price fund was devised and should be used exclusively for raising the price of pigs in spring and reducing it in the autumn until we have got an even supply and have got around towards <Col N="324" /> having the price stable during the whole 12 months of the year.  My allegation now is that what the Minister for Agriculture is doing is this: he is using, through his influence over the Pigs Marketing Board the hypothetical price fund for the purpose of relieving the Exchequer of a share of the bounty they ought to pay in order to meet the British tariffs.  At the present time, there is a substantial tariff against Irish bacon going into Great Britain.  The Minister's bounty does not nearly equal that tariff.  However, we have a quota for bacon and pigs on the British market, the value of which is well known to the Minister. He is very anxious that the curers of this country will never fail to fill the quota for bacon, and, accordingly, when he does not want to pay out of the Treasury a bounty to enable them to export profitably to the British market, he is conniving with the Pigs Marketing Board and stealing the money that the farmers paid into the hypothetical price fund on the understanding that they would get it back in the spring, handing it to the curers as a bounty on their exports of bacon to make up whatever they have lost on their export transactions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Holohan and, I think, a Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches asserted that the co-operative factory in Waterford was making bigger profits than it ever made.  I want to congratulate the bacon curers on making more profits than they ever made, but what justification can there be for robbing the farmers of what they were legitimately entitled to receive by taking it from them and giving it to the curers?  We are getting to-day 64/- per cwt. for grade A1 pigs at the factory.  Comparatively few pigs make that grade.  The cost of feeding stuffs has gone sky high, maize meal being £9 5s. or £9 10s. a ton, bran and pollard, 8/6 per cwt. and meat meal is nearly 12/- per cwt.  At these prices, it is absolutely impossible to make a profit on pigs at 64/- per cwt.  Until recently, we were only getting 58/- per cwt.  Surely this hypothetical price fund ought now to be used to lift up the price of pigs to <Col N="325" /> a figure which will make it economic to produce them.</P>
    <P>When farmers have paid this money into this fund&mdash;and nobody but the farmer who sold pigs to the factory contributed a penny piece&mdash;surely to God they are entitled to get that money back.  Is it reasonable or is there any justice in asking farmers to provide the raw material for the immensely prosperous bacon curers and also to give the bacon curers a bonus of 10/- to 12/- on every pig sent in?  There are extremities of abuse to which the agricultural community in this country will submit, but really, when they see these activities going on to the extent to which they are going on, activities which are a brutal injustice, it is difficult for them to hold their patience.</P>
    <P>How can you defend giving Messrs. Denny or any of the great bacon curers in this country, some of them in a great international combine, hundreds of thousands of pounds from the pockets of the producers?  The greatest pig producers are those in the congested and poorer areas such as Mayo, West Connaught and West Cork, Cavan and Longford.  It is the people in these districts produce the pigs and they are fined from 8/- to 12/- per pig and the proceeds of the fund are handed out as a bonus to bacon curers.  It is almost unbelievable that any Minister professing to be responsible for the agricultural industry would tolerate the existence of such a state of affairs, but not only is he tolerating that, but when asked to inquire, he says he will make no inquiries.  He has the power to and the right to inquire, and could compel them to give him the facts, but he says he does not want to know and will not inquire.  How can that man maintain that he is doing the duty he was appointed to do towards those whose interests he is supposed to protect, I cannot understand and it is for that reason I am giving him an opportunity this evening to explain what he considers to be his responsibility as defender of the producers, and why he is prepared to leave the interests of the bacon producers to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who shows mighty <Col N="326" /> little interest in the farmers who are supposed to be looked after by the Minister for Agriculture as their champion, spokesman and defender.</P>

      <P>It is hard to be what I might call positive with Deputy Dillon, as I think he has made the most nonsensical statements I ever heard. Deputy Dillon read some extracts from the debate that took place about the creation of the hypothetical fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed that the hypothetical price would be what the curer should pay, taking into account the price of bacon and other things, and that the appointed price would be the price the producer should get, taking into account the cost of feeding stuffs; and if the hypothetical price was higher, the difference went into the fund, and if lower, the curer would draw from the fund.  Now Deputy Dillon, in order to get away from that, says that the board was acting illegally and fraudulently.  I suppose he looked into the matter since this morning and found that he was wrong but, he is not manly enough to say that he was wrong.  Now, in order to create a smoke screen, he talks about taking money from the farmer.  Why did the Deputy agree to the scheme at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

It was always provided in this Act that the money would be collected from the curer, put into the fund and then paid out to the curer. I am not so innocent as to imagine that the curer pays it out of his own pocket. I know that it comes from the farmer or from the consumer eventually, but the machinery of the Bill was that the curer would pay into the fund and would take from the fund, and that is what is being done.  There was nothing illegal or fraudulent about it, although the Deputy to-day said there was.</P>
