      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state (1) if the question of national defence (by sea and land) has ever been raised with Britain during the past five years, or have any negotiations been entered into in that period respecting the position of the Irish ports and habours mentioned in the Treaty, and such matters of international importance as the new air base at Rhynana and the oil refinery in Dublin; and (2) has the question of the setting up of a subsidiary Free State Navy ever been mentioned in such conversations or negotiations, and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>The defence of Saorstát Eireann in relation to the taking over of the ports has from time to time been mentioned broadly in informal conversations.  No negotiations relating thereto have taken place.  As I have said here recently, we cannot organise a reasonably adequate system of defence in this country until the ambiguity caused by the occupation of our ports has been removed.  The airport and the oil refinery represent a normal stage in our national economic development.  Their defence in time of war would be a part of ordinary domestic routine, and it has not been referred to in any conversation.  The creation of a Naval Defence Force is part of the general problem of our national defence.  It will only become a practical issue when the general problem has been solved.  It has not been the subject of any discussion between the two countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the Sligo County Council had made any advances since 1932 for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to assist farmers in the erection of new dwelling-houses; and, if not, whether he is in a position to take any steps to ensure that the Sligo County Council make such advances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>No advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts have been made by the Sligo County Council.  The Acts empower local authorities to make advances to persons for the purpose of acquiring or erecting houses for their own occupation.  I have no power to interfere with the discretion of the local authority with regard to the operation of the Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state, (a) the number of houses in the town of Ballymote, County Sligo, which have been condemned by the local medical officer as unfit for human habitation; (b) the number of houses erected by the Sligo County Board of Health in the town of Ballymote since 1932, and (c) the number of such houses in course of erection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of houses in the town of Ballymote which have been condemned by the local medical officer as unfit for human habitation is 74.  The number of houses erected by the Sligo County Board of Health in the town of Ballymote since 1932 is one.  There are no houses in course of erection in the town, but proposals are under consideration by the board of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the obvious failure of the Sligo County Board of Health to provide adequate housing facilities for the residents of the town of Ballymote, will the Minister take whatever steps it is possible for him to take to compel the Sligo Board of <Col N="1475" /> Health to provide suitable accommodation for those people who are living in condemned houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has certain powers under the Housing Acts, but we are reluctant to use these powers or to interfere with local authorities unless we are absolutely compelled to do so.  We try to point out their duty to local authorities and persuade them to adopt the right course.  We have had correspondence with Sligo Board of Health, as with many other similar bodies, and we have endeavoured to induce them to speed up this desirable work.  I shall consider the matter raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not have stated, in the course of his reply, that the Sligo Board of Health have a scheme for the erection of cottages in Ballymote?  It is rather extraordinary that the Deputy should avail of the Dáil for the purpose of dealing with this question when he could have approached members of the board of health and asked them to hasten the Department's decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister I have approached the board of health by means of correspondence through the Department frequently on the matter of the provision of adequate housing accommodation in their area in general, and I am not satisfied that they have done all that they might have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, can he give the House particulars of the scheme which is at present before him from the Sligo Board of Health, and which is awaiting his sanction or approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts that question on the Order Paper, I will give him all the information that I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that it would be more disingenuous if he stated frankly that the provision of houses in Ballymote is largely being held up by himself and <Col N="1476" /> his own Department because of their failure to give approval to schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely untrue.  I have been trying for the last three or five years to get the Sligo Board of Health to put up adequate schemes in this matter.  I do not like to use strong language, but certainly they have not done their duty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>The proposed source of supply is Lough Lene. When pipes were being laid to convey water to the town, objection was raised by certain persons to water being taken from the lough.  Negotiations were entered into, and I am informed agreement has now been reached which will obviate any resort to compulsory acquisition of the water rights.  The matter is one for the commissioner, acting on legal advice.</P>

      <P>On that proposal would like to point out that some amendments have been submitted to item No. 9.  The normal purpose of the adjournment from 6 to 7 o'clock is to enable those who have been taking an active interest in the Constitution to obtain an interval, but if it is proposed to take item No. 9 between 6 and 7 o'clock, the time set aside for the interval, it will be inconvenient for those who want to participate in the discussion on that Bill and who have amendments to move to it.  I would suggest, therefore, that item No. 9&mdash;Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Bill, 1937&mdash;be excluded from the discussion between 6 and 7 o'clock.  If it is desired, item No. 9 could be taken now and disposed of if it is considered that the matter is one of urgency.  I submit that it is unfair to take it during the time that is set aside for the interval for those who are actively interested in the Constitution debate.</P>

      <P>I agree, but surely we can discuss items 4 and 5 during the interval.  What is the difficulty about doing that.  I protest against this. I got no intimation of any proposal to take this business until a quarter to three this afternoon.  I did not get the slightest information from the Government whips, or from the Government side, that it was proposed to take the three items mentioned by the Vice-President in the interval between six and seven o'clock this evening.  It is rather strange that that information should be withheld from a Deputy who had a natural interest in one of these particular matters.  I suggest that the only purpose for insisting on the inclusion of No. 9 is to handicap &mdash;and that is the only effect of it&mdash; those who are interested in the Bill, and the adjournment of the Dáil for a half-hour will not seriously affect the matter.</P>

    <P>1.&mdash;If and whenever on the passage by Dáil Eireann of any Bill, other than a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution, the Taoiseach certifies by messages in writing addressed to the President and to the Chairman of each House of the Oireachtas that, in the opinion of the Government, the Bill is urgent and immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace and security, or by reason of the existence of a public emergency, whether domestic or international, the time for the consideration of such Bill by Seanad Eireann shall, if Dáil Eireann so resolves and if the President, after consultation with the Council of State, concurs, be abridged to such period as shall be specified in the resolution.</P>

      <P>In Section 1, lines 10 and 11, to delete the words &ldquo;and if the President, after consultation with the Council of State, concurs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is in the name of Deputies Costello and McGilligan.  I do not see why this power should be given to the President.  I do not see why this power should not be in the hands of the Dáil and the Government. Again, Sir, it is being assumed that the President will be a non-political personage, but of course that is all camouflage.  That, however, is at least the pretence&mdash;that he will be a non-political personage and will be above politics&mdash;but this Article, as it stands, means that the President will be brought into the most controversial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle behind this Article, Sir, is that where the Seanad&mdash;as Deputies who have read the Constitution know&mdash;has relatively <Col N="1484" /> limited powers in this Constitution, and when there is a question of still further encroaching on these limited powers, it is advisable that that should only be done in such circumstances as are provided for&mdash;such as a case of emergency, and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that such a thing can happen. There might be an emergency of a kind in which the Seanad would have to pass a Bill at whatever time the Dáil would say was necessary.  Consequently, we should have whatever checks we can possibly get in connection with that time limit and the power of the Seanad; and obviously, as the President is there as an extra party, it is right that he should be used as a check. After all, the President would be in close touch with the Government, and there can hardly be any doubt that, if there were a reasonable case to be put forward that there was a state of emergency, he would concur in that; but you have that check, at least, that a man, not immediately in the Government, but who has placed on him a special responsibility to see that the Constitution is properly worked, can exercise that function.  That is the intention in bringing in this provision, and I think it is a good provision.  I think it is a safeguard against the possible abuse of the very great powers that are here given to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree, Sir, with what the President has said. I cannot believe that the President is still serious in saying that this President that he now proposes would be above politics and Party.  I find it is extremely difficult to debate a Constitution of this kind on that presupposition, and I hold that the continued repetition by the President of that phrase throws a doubt on the case he makes for this Constitution, or for any portion of it, or for the fairness of it. One or other of two things can occur, and one of these is the most dangerous thing that could occur&mdash;so far, at least, as being a safeguard for any alleged rights is concerned.  The President, whoever he may be, will have the same <Col N="1485" /> political views as those of the Party to which he belongs, and he will be the nominee of the Party that is dominant in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the word &ldquo;predict.&rdquo;  I was pointing out that there were two alternatives. Surely the President can understand the difference between two alternatives, as I said, and actual prediction.  My point is that the future President will be in close touch with his Party, and that he will be the nominee of the Party in power.  I do not see how any person can be elected as President, under this Constitution, unless he were a member of the dominant Party. Therefore, the holding of a so-called watching brief for the rights of the people and the rights of the Seanad, as suggested by the President, will be non-existent, or else the proposed President will be a person who, in a time of crisis, will use that time of crisis to embarrass the Government or to embarrass whatever side is in opposition to him.  Even, as I said, if there were any likelihood or possibility of the man concerned, by virtue of his office, becoming a non-Party man, I suggest that bringing him into a thing like this will only stultify that intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is an amendment without a single spark of merit.  I also think that it is an amazing amendment to be introduced by a Party that always stood for a strong Second Chamber of some kind. It is amusing to hear Deputy O'Sullivan using the same old argument now, in connection with the President, that he always characterised as contemptible when applied to a Second Chamber.  What is the issue here?  The Constitution is providing for a case where it should be possible <Col N="1486" /> to abridge the very limited period of time during which the Seanad is to be entitled to delay the passage of a Bill into law; and, so that that power of abridgement by the Dáil shall not be abused, it is provided that such abridgement shall not be carried out without the consent of the President after consultation with the Council of State.  I cannot imagine a more reasonable or a more desirable provision, and, as I have said, the amendment which seeks to remove that provision seems to me to be without a single spark of merit, and to be in flat contradiction of the theory and record of the Opposition with regard to a Second Chamber.</P>

He made a reference last week to Article 25, Section 2, and said that this was a compulsory power in connection with the President. I do not think it is a compulsory power.  It merely delimits the time.  He told us the last day, before he consulted his lawyers, what the lawyers would say.

      <P>If the President fails or neglects to sign within the respective times appointed by paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, a Bill presented to him in accordance with the said Section 2 or Section 3 of this Article, such Bill shall be signed by the Chairman of Dáil Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are on quite a different thing.  A man may have a legal obligation to do something and fail in doing it or neglect to do it.  In that case something <Col N="1489" /> may be said for making certain that through his neglect the thing which was to be done, will not cease or fail to be done.  Consequently you may have to make further provisions to ensure that in the case of failure, the act which he should have done will be performed by somebody else.  That matter did arise in another connection and we had the general Article which says that in case of failure by the President to do certain things, the acts which he should have performed, will be performed by a certain commission and that the Council of State, as a further reserve, would come in to do it.  There is just a small point arising here as to when failure has occurred.  If the Bill has to be signed within say a period of from four to seven days and you do not know until after the seven days whether he has or has not failed, the question is to ascertain when the time has passed by which the action should be performed.  We would want to make provision for that, possibly.  We shall look into that point and we can decide the matter on the Report Stage.  This is quite a different matter from the question as to whether it is or is not obligatory on him to sign.  It is obligatory on him to sign.  He must do his duty and you will have to make provision as to when that duty will be done.  You will have to make provision for somebody else doing it after the time within which it should have been done by the President, has elapsed. I do not accept the amendment, but I shall see about a later amendment.</P>

      <P>There was an alternative there, to leave it to the High Court alone.  There is something to be said for that inasmuch as you would have the same court dealing with constitutional matters all the time, but then there are objections from another point of view. We understood that, on the whole, it would meet with a greater degree of approval to have it go to the High Court.  On that account we changed back, and this series of amendments is simply to make that position clear.</P>

      <P>If that position is clear, namely that the High Court would have jurisdiction in taking into account the constitutionality of a law, I am satisfied, but it is not quite constructive, if I may suggest that to the President.  Take the case of the <i>habeas corpus.</i>  Unless a judge of the High Court can take into account the constitutionality of a law, a citizen of this State who was arrested under a law the constitutionality of which he contested, could not apply to a judge of the High Court for a <i>habeas corpus.</i>  This is not a case of tweedledum and tweedledee between the High Court and the Supreme Court; it is a matter of great importance to the liberty of the subject that that particular right should not be taken from him.  If the President is quite clear that his amendments will allow that jurisdiction to remain in the High Court I am satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point on which we were deciding; as a matter of fact that only emerged at a later stage.  We were dealing with the general question as to whether it is better that the High Court should have the initial jurisdiction as regards the constitutionality of laws, with an appeal to the Supreme Court, or whether you should have the Supreme Court being the first court to deal with it, and have no further appeal.  Much could be said on both sides, and it was not easy to make up one's mind as to which was the better.  The point brought out by the Deputy is undoubtedly an extra reason why it is well to have the High Court having the original jurisdiction in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Article 35, Section 5 provides that the remuneration of a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court shall not be reduced during his continuance in office.  I take it that that is intended to establish the independence of the Judiciary which function through those two courts, and is probably intended to demonstrate to the community as a whole and to judges in particular that judges are not liable to have their salaries reduced if for any reason they do things which incur the displeasure of the Executive Council.  I should like to know why the same principle is not extended, for instance, to District Courts, where it is just as necessary to demonstrate the same considerations. The District Court, in the main, is the poor man's court.  District justices may from time to time do things which the Executive Council may dislike, and if the Executive Council dislikes the decision of the District Court they would appear, under this Constitution, to have power to reduce the salary of the district justice. At all events, the district justices are being treated differently from judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court, and I should like to know from the President why there is that distinction.</P>

      <P>Either Deputy Norton or I appear to be under a misapprehension.  My impression is that we are confirming the existence of the Supreme Court and the High Court in the Constitution, with the idea that these courts cannot henceforth be changed in their structure, except by amendment of the Constitution, and consequently a referendum. It is not the desire to create that position with regard to district justices.  Any future Courts of Justice Act might reconstruct the whole of the legal system as far as district justices are concerned, and it is only because they do not come, in any shape or form, into the Constitution, that they do not come in with regard to this particular protection and their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want another excuse than that it was not in the original Constitution.  Many people are persuaded that a provision of this kind, which applies to the other courts and safeguards the judges of the High Court and of the Supreme Court, should apply also to the district justices, both as regards fixity of tenure and their salaries. The President knows possibly that there is a tendency to treat district justices as if they were civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a feeling that is abroad, that they are more under the thumb of the Department of Justice than the judges of the Supreme Court or of the High Court.  That feeling is abroad. District justices can be changed, while other judges cannot be changed, their salaries can be interfered with in a way in which the salaries of the others cannot be interfered with, and they can be brought to book in a way that the other judges cannot be brought to book, so that there are possibilities of interference with their <Col N="1498" /> independence.  If the President gives the matter consideration he will find that they deal with more numerous cases than the other judges.  As far as the ordinary man is concerned, it is the fair administration of the law by these judges and district justices that gets good repute or bad repute for the administration of the law, more than the conduct of the judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court.  A great deal of the respect that the administration of the law has gained in the last 15 years is in no small measure, due to the manner in which the district justices carried out their duty.  All these considerations and the merits of the case are in favour of putting them in the same privileged position as the judges of the Supreme and High Courts. I would be more eager to safeguard their independence and judgments than the independence and judgments of the Supreme and High Courts.  Now that we are completely re-amending the Constitution some definite reason must be given for the exclusion of this particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Sullivan had listened to what Deputy MacDermot said, he would realise what the position is.  Here in the Constitution we are providing special mention for constitutional courts.  If the Deputy looks at Article 36 he will see that it states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Constitution relating to the courts the following matter shall be regulated in accordance with law, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>i.  the number of judges of the Supreme Court, and of the High Court, the remuneration age of retirement and pensions of such judges,</P>
      <P>ii.  the number of the judges of all other courts, and their terms of appointment, and</P>
      <P>iii.  the constitution and organisation of the said courts, the distribution of jurisdiction and business among the said courts and judges, and all other matters of procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> In other words, we have not set out to deal with all classes of courts, their organisation and terms of appointment. We have dealt, to a certain extent, with the Supreme Court and High Court and, having done so to that extent we lay down the terms of appointment and the remuneration of the judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court.  The immunity that the rest of the judges get is a question of law.  By the Courts of Justice Act which was passed recently the circuit judges are given practically the same immunity as judges of the High Court.  The only way to deal with the matter Deputy O'Sullivan is raising would be to put in the whole legal scheme here or a great part of it.  We cannot afford to do that.  We think it would be an unnecessary overloading of the whole system.  No one has suggested at either side of the House that the same position will not continue in the future as existed and we may take it that all are anxious to preserve the independence of the Judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an answer to my argument that this was not in the Constitution.  I am protesting against the fact that it is not in it.  The reason given by the President is the usual one, that it was not there already, and that he does not want to put it there, as it would occupy another page.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the Constitution.  Can the President explain why certain judges are put into a privileged position while others are not?  Practically the only argument he made was that it would occupy one or two more pages in the Constitution.  Why are these people not protected by the Constitution? The President said they were not protected by the original Constitution. That is no argument.  I am protesting against the fact that they were not protected.  I want to have Circuit Court judges and district justices put on the same basis as the other judges, as regards <Col N="1500" /> immunity and fixity of tenure.  Why are they to be removable by a different method to the other judges?  The President told us that that will be decided by law, but he refuses to do it by any constitutional safeguard. For them there is to be no constitutional safeguard and they can depend on the law.  The President has said nothing to show there should be a distinction between these two classes.  He must know that it is highly desirable there should not be interference, especially with these two classes of judges, and more particularly with justices in the District Courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the President may have been influenced by the consideration that was so strongly impressed on us yesterday by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the less we put into the Constitution the better. It is obvious that the Supreme Court and the High Court ought to go in because they have constitutional functions.  It is equally obvious that with the rest that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has certainly made some effort to explain why district justices and Circuit Court judges are not included in the protective provisions of Article 35.  Of course, his case was a most unconvincing one.  The President says that it is necessary to set out the structure of the High Court and Supreme Court in this Constitution.  That is so, perhaps, and we do it.  But would the functions of the Supreme Court and High Court, as set out in the series of Articles dealing with them, be incomplete and unworkable if Section 5 of Article 35 were excluded? I suggest that the structure is there, just as strong, just as effective, just as immutable, if Section 5 were not included.  The President goes on to say to judges of the Supreme Court and High Court: &ldquo;Your remuneration shall not be reduced during your continuance in office.&rdquo;  I urge that district justices and Circuit Court judges should be made as independent of the Executive as Supreme Court and High Court judges are.  The <Col N="1501" /> President says these people have rights in law at present.  So also have High Court and Supreme Court judges rights in law.  Why not, therefore, either leave the whole class to have their rights in law, or give the whole class constitutional protection in the manner that the President is giving this special class of Supreme Court and High Court judges that protection?</P>
      <P>It is most vital, if we are going to have a satisfactory kind of legal and communal life, that the judges should be absolutely as independent as the Legislature can make them. One of the most effective ways to make judges independent is not to give the Executive Council of the day a grip on the pockets of the judges. But, as the President knows, when this Constitution is passed, the position will be that he dare not introduce a Bill to reduce the salaries of the Supreme Court or High Court judges, unless, of course, he can get endorsement for his proposal through the medium of a referendum.  But he can introduce a Bill and say to these Circuit Court judges and district justices that their remuneration can be cut.  The fact that the President is seeking to put the Executive of the day in a position to cut the remuneration of certain judges, while not being in a position to cut the remuneration of other judges, is a most serious anomaly and, it seems to me, is calculated to demonstrate that the Legislature and the Executive Council do not regard Circuit Court judges and district justices as being entitled to the same measure of independence from the point of view of exercising their normal functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is perfectly right when he says there is a mentality which regards district justices as civil servants.  Of course, there is.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Finance are responsible for the creation of that mentality.  We frequently read in the newspapers outbursts by district justices, when they receive a circular from the Department of Finance, or from the Department of Justice transmitting a communication received from the Department of Finance.  These justices are <Col N="1502" /> compelled to complain that they are not civil servants and that they are not subject to instruction in that way from the Department of Justice. Because the Circuit Court and the District Court are poor men's courts, I want to ensure that, so far as possible, those who dispense justice and equity in these courts will be as independent as it is possible to make them.  I do not think this Constitution does that.  Section 5 ought to go entirely and let all the judges have their rights in legislation.  But, if the President is sticking to Section 5, he ought to extend the same guarantee to all judges, so as to indicate that, so far as salary is concerned, they are all regarded as independent.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly verbose Constitution. It has not suffered any great pruning. Another few lines in it would not outrage anybody's feelings.  Article 36 deals with courts other than the Supreme Court and the High Court. What is the difficulty of declaring somewhere in that Article the same principle as is enshrined in Article 35, Section 5?  I think there can be no real difficulty in doing it.  I cannot imagine that the legal advisers of the President or the Parliamentary draftsman could not devise a form of words which would not take up very much space to demonstrate that the remuneration of judges is untouchable in order to show that the Legislature regards these persons as being as independent as it is possible to make them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the general independence of the judiciary, you have Article 35, Section 2, which states: &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  So that, so far as stating the principle is concerned, it is stated in the most general terms.  Obviously it is important to have the higher courts dealt with, because if the higher courts are all right, then, by appeal, you can get to them in any case, so that you have the position safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the general principle.  It is important to have the higher courts definitely safeguarded by the Constitution itself. In this Constitution, as in the old Constitution, having dealt with these courts, the organisation of the other courts is left to law, and I think for a very good reason.  The organisation may have to be changed from time to time.  The case that Deputy Norton is making is that, if we leave this in here&mdash;which he does not object to, I take it, in its own particular application&mdash;and if we do not put in something about the other courts, by implication, perhaps, we suggest that the other courts which are to be organised by law need not have the same immunity as regards interference with salaries.  Anything that would shake their independence will be contrary to the general spirit of the Constitution.  Therefore, to do anything by direct method like that would be in itself contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.  I cannot and will not undertake to set out the organisation of these courts and go into the Circuit Court and other courts. It is all very well to say that it will only mean an extra section.  It is advisable not to do what is not necessary. What I will do is this.  I will examine the question to see whether we can put the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; in the full sense there&mdash;whether we can bring it into this without upsetting the general scheme, if that will satisfy the Deputy.</P>

I would want to examine all possible classes of judges in the State to see whether it would be right that a judge appointed in some petty capacity could not be removed except by some extraordinary resolution here in this House.  This Article is in accordance with the principles adopted here on the Courts of Justice Act when that measure was debated here.  I was not here then but I expect the whole matter was debated. What we are doing in this Constitution is this: first of all we are dealing with the special courts and making them as copper-fastened as possible.  In Article 35, Section 2, we state: &ldquo;all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo; That states a general principle.</P>

      <P>I would say that the judges would be defined both by the Constitution and by law as &ldquo;judges.&rdquo; They would be so defined.  We have certain judges here defined in the Constitution. Their class is defined but their number is not.  It is left to law to settle that.  With regard to the other judges, these would be defined by law.  The House has a general idea what judges are and, when the law is being passed, every person who would <Col N="1505" /> be set up would be defined and characterised as a judge, how they were to be appointed, what qualifications they would have before being appointed, and so on.  When you say &ldquo;qualifications of judges&rdquo; I take it they would be classed as the judges that are here mentioned in the Constitution and such other judges as would be set up or provided by law.  And all such who would get the character of judge, whether by Constitution or by law, would be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  That is how I read the section.  It is the clear meaning of it.</P>

Surely the continued existence of courts of the type of the District Court and the Circuit Court is inevitable.  Remember the amendment of the Constitution is always possible. We might take it for granted that these four types of courts will continue to exist&mdash;the Supreme Court, the High Court, the District Court and the Circuit Court.  Why not give these four courts full immunity?  Why not give the judges in the Circuit Court and the District Court the advantages that Section 4 of this Article gives the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court?  If you say it is against the spirit of the Constitution that they are to be interfered with, now that we are legislating and making a new Constitution, why not put that in?</P>

      <P>Apparently Deputy Donnelly is on common ground with the President.  The President says you can start an action in the District Court and you ultimately get a trial by a judge in the High Court.  I am sure that information will be a powerful revelation to the people in Gloucester Street.  It will be a great revelation to them to know that a penniless man can get into the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The courts, he says, are open.  It is nonsense to tell people that the courts are open to them.  One might as well say that the Gresham Hotel is open to everyone, as to tell the people that the courts are open to them.  You can go into court if you have a pretty big bank account and if you are capable of paying cheques to a bevy of legal men in order to get a verdict from the courts. I think it is very important in the interests of the judiciary and of everybody else to ensure that the persons who dispense judgment are as independent as we can make them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President says there is a declaration in Article 35, Section 2, that the judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.  That is a platitudinous declaration.  The British Parliament once passed an Act saying that everybody <Col N="1507" /> was entitled to the wherewithal to live, but they took very good care not to say who was to provide the wherewithal.  Now we are making a provision that all judges shall be independent but we are not doing the obvious thing to take steps to ensure that when they exercise that independence it will not be possible for the Executive Council to get at them.  I want to guard against a position arising like that where a person was reported as saying that his soul was pure though his tongue had been sold. I want to prevent the possibility here of the District Court and the Circuit Court judges suffering retaliation.  I want to protect them against that.  If, for instance, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice mentality were to develop to a degree greater than exists to-day, I want to prevent the judges from suffering or from the possibility of suffering from that mentality.  Deputy Donnelly says there is no reason for protecting the judges of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  I think there is.  These two courts dispense more justice than the High Court or the Supreme Court. They affect closely and intimately the lives of the poorer people.  These courts are the courts to which the poor people go for justice, and they are, to me at all events, of much more importance than the High Courts.  They have to deal with a type of case which ordinarily does not trouble people higher up.  These courts affect the lives of the ordinary plain people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil has recently passed a Courts of Justice Act which deals with the organisation of the courts and the judges in the various courts.  Certain immunities have been given to the judges, but we cannot, in this Constitution, cover the whole domain.  I am just as anxious about the independence of the judiciary as Deputy Norton is; I am just as anxious that the poor man's court would be as free from interference by the Executive as any other court; but there is a limit to what can be done in a Constitution, to what it is reasonable to do in a Constitution.  Does anybody imagine that we can prevent injustice <Col N="1508" /> or wrong things being done by legislation in the future?  We cannot, and it is an idle dream to think that you can. You cannot possibly meet in the Constitution every case where an injustice or a wrong thing may be done by a future Legislature.  You cannot do it. It would be an absurd thing to attempt it.</P>
      <P>The only question worth examining is whether it would be possible to extend that phrase, the remuneration of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, over a wider field.  I will have that matter examined.  As long as you leave things to legislation that is only one of the ways in which the independence of the judiciary might be interfered with.  There are a number of other things, too, if we were to think of them, a number of ways in which their independence might be sapped and interfered with.  Can we provide for all these things?  We cannot.  Certain of the arguments have impressed me, and if it would be possible, by means of a simple amendment, to meet the views that have been expressed, then that will be done.  I will promise to have certain aspects examined.  I will not promise to change it, but I promise to have the matter examined to see if we could extend that clause 5 to the cases of all judges.  I am just a little bit doubtful whether it is possible to do it.  We might deal with a class of judges, but we are not able to anticipate future arguments, and future legislation may possibly mean something of the kind where it would be inadvisable to have this thing.  I will consider carefully what the possibilities are.</P>

      <P>I say that it is one of the harshest judgments that could be passed on any Constitution. Apparently it is the President's idea of a Constitution.  He cannot do it here, but still in Article 35 (4) he takes steps to do it as regards two classes of judges.  Why can he not do exactly the same thing for the other two classes of judges whom I mentioned?  The President says that we cannot cover everything, that if future Dála wish to do injustice in this respect they can do it and the Constitution cannot prevent them.  But the man who says that, definitely tries to prevent that type of injustice being done as regards two classes of judges and he will not make the endeavour with regard to two other classes who are much more amenable to pressure from Departments and on whom Departments try to exercise more pressure than they do in respect of the others.  I got the impression from some speeches that not merely is it impossible to do this but that it would be undesirable in any case to do it.  The idea conveyed to my mind was that it was wrong that this independence should be secured to this low type of judges.  I do not share that view.  I think it is more necessary to guard the independence of that class of judge than the more highly paid judges, the men of higher status.  It is, in my opinion, supremely important, and that is the reason that I urge on the President to give consideration to a modification of Article 35 (4).</P>

      <P>I agree with the observation made by Deputy Norton that from many points of view the independence of the lower grades of judges, the District Court and Circuit Court judges, is more important than that of the higher judges.  The people they have to deal with are the poorest and most helpless class and it is supremely important that the independence of the judicial officers who deal with their rights should be strictly preserved.  The President says that you cannot guard the independence of the judges in every way, that there are many ways in which their independence <Col N="1510" /> could be sapped otherwise than by the way it is suggested it could be done here.  I agree with that, but is that an argument against taking such steps as can be taken to guard the independence of the judges?  One way in which it can be done is to preserve the rights of the Circuit Court judges and the district justices in the same way as it is proposed to do it in Article 35 (5) of the Constitution. I do not see what difficulty there can be in the way of including the other class in this Article, in mentioning the Circuit Court judges and district justices as well.  I agree with Deputy Norton that that is even more important than the preservation of the independence of the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court.  The people these judges have to deal with are quite defenceless people.  They have not the same safeguards against injustice as people whose rights are being determined in the higher courts.  I suggest that the President should reconsider this matter and include these other classes.</P>

Then there was his point about bringing in the lower courts.  Might I draw his attention to the fact that they are already brought in?  In Article 34 it is stated that the courts of first instance shall include courts of local and limited jurisdiction, with the right of appeal as determined by law.  I suggest that they are already included as courts of first instance. Would it be possible to give them the same status, from certain points of view, as you give the judges of the higher courts in Article 35?</P>

      <P>There is one point which arises on Article 58 which is relevant to the present consideration.  In Article 58 there is a distinction drawn between a judge and a justice.  In the Irish text judge is translated as &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; and a justice is translated <Col N="1511" /> as &ldquo;iúistis.&rdquo;  In the Courts of Justice Act of 1924, district justices were called judges of the District Court and the Irish translation of that text was &ldquo;breitheamh.&rdquo;  The particular use of the word &ldquo;breitheamh&rdquo; in the 1924 Act gave a very considerable solace to the judges of the District Court in reference to their tenure of office.  If the distinction is now made in this Constitution, particularly in the Irish text which it is intended shall be the dominant text, between &ldquo;iúistis&rdquo; and &ldquo;breitheamh,&rdquo; that will tend to start an argument that the justices of the District Courts are not judges in the proper sense at all.  I would like the President to consider that point.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. There were questions about the Land <Col N="1512" /> Commission, as to whether their functions were of a judicial character or not, and, keeping to that case alone, it is quite obvious that those commissioners have been set up for a certain purpose with limited and well-defined functions, and it would be ridiculous to leave any doubt whatever as to that position by law.  This particular Article is designed to cover a case like that.  It is very difficult to define exactly when a body is exercising a judicial power or performing a judicial function, and so as not to get tied in the knot that judicial powers or functions could only be exercised by the ordinary courts established here, you have to have a provision of this type.</P>
      <P>What we say is that &ldquo;Nothing shall invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions&rdquo;&mdash;such as the Land Commission, for example&mdash;&ldquo;notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.&rdquo; In other words, you have to make provision for bodies of that sort, and you have to provide that the Constitution does not get you into a position in which such bodies could not function.</P>

      <P>I put a definite question to the President which he has not answered.  Will this not make it possible to confer by ordinary law on Departments&mdash;not merely the Land Commission, but an ordinary Department&mdash;power to exercise what are really judicial functions and to give judicial decisions?  The President is not quite so innocent as not to know that this matter has come before the courts in connection with certain Departments and that it was held that certain Departments were exercising judicial functions and against the Constitution. Suppose the purpose is what the President says, does he not realise that he is opening the door wide to conferring on Departments full judicial powers in everything that does not concern life or liberty, and that so far as property is concerned he is giving by the Constitution power to hand that <Col N="1513" /> power over to a Department?  The tendency of Departments of Government everywhere will be to arrogate more and more functions to themselves and to usurp, if they can, the place of the courts.  This seems to invite that. The President might have in his mind a case like that of the Land Commission where a court has been set up, but I suggest that it is plain that this Article has a much wider scope than anything indicated by the President and really means that our Departments in the future can be given almost unlimited authority to deal with property of various kinds, to exercise what are really judicial functions and to oust the courts altogether.  There is no remedy in that case of an appeal to the courts against them on the ground that it is against the Constitution. That appeal was possible before, but it will be so no longer.</P>

      <P>Am I right in thinking that the cause of this Article 37 is the fact that Section 1 of Article 34 says that justice shall be administered in public courts?  Is that the reason it was thought necessary to put in Article 37, or what is the new situation which led the President to believe that the powers of the Land Commission might be brought into question if this Article were not put in?</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is apparently quite unfamiliar with the provisions of Article 64 of the existing <Col N="1514" /> Constitution which declares that the judicial power of the Irish Free State was vested in the judges appointed under the Constitution.  On that particular Article, a number of cases came before the courts, entirely irrespective of Article 2A or the Military Tribunal, and in point of fact, the President, I think, has quite overlooked the fact that the Supreme Court has declared that the Irish Land Commission, in the exercise of its functions, does not infringe the provisions of Article 64 in the case of Lynam and Butler.  That decision&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;was to the effect that the Land Commission, in exercising their powers, did not exercise powers of such a judicial nature as to infringe the provisions of Article 64 of the existing Constitution, and, in the course of delivering judgement in that case, the late Chief Justice Kennedy gave a very illuminating exposition of the meaning of the expression &ldquo;judicial power.&rdquo;  From that case, and as a result of his decision, it has been possible to determine with fair exactness, but not with complete precision, whether or not the exercise by any particular body of persons, whether departmental or otherwise, would or would not have infringed the provisions of Article 64 in reference to judicial power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to define precisely what is meant by the exercise of judicial power.  There are a number of bodies exercising administrative functions in the machinery of the State as it exists at the moment. Certain enterprising lawyers, not confined to this side of the House, were disposed to test the issue as to whether certain bodies of that nature, in the exercise of their functions, were contravening the provisions of Article 64.  In Lynam and Butler, a definition was not possible, but an exposition of the meaning of the expression was given by the late Chief Justice which was about as illuminating and comprehensive an expression as it could possibly be hoped to obtain, and that case has ruled all the efforts that have since been made to determine whether or not certain bodies were exercising powers in contravention of the Constitution.  We <Col N="1515" /> have the special Commissioners of Revenue&mdash;that is one case; we have the lay commissioners&mdash;another case; and there are other matters.  We set up here last year machinery under the Insurance Act by which the rights of people in connection with policies of industrial life assurance were to be determined by some officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce. That is the position when this Article is brought into this Draft Constitution.  We had the position under the existing Constitution&mdash; Articles 64 and 65&mdash;that the general intention was that judicial power should be exercised in public by the public courts, paid for by the taxpayer, and that that judicial power should be exercised by judges who would be independent of the Executive in the exercise of their judicial powers.  That was the paramount intention of the Constitution, that they should have the right to determine the existence or non-existence of rights and wrongs as between the citizens of this State, and the idea at the back of it was to prevent that growth of bureaucracy which was eating into the exercise by judges of judicial power.</P>
    <P>We know that all judges are jealous of the infringement of their prerogatives in connection with the exercise of their powers.  All permanent Departments are equally anxious to grasp the right to determine certain issues and certain questions without giving the ordinary citizen any right of being heard.  In some of our statutes we have gone very far, indeed, in that connection and I am prepared to admit that some of the statutes passed before 1932, when the present Government came into office, offended against the principles of which I am now speaking.  But the present Government have, in some of their legislation, exceeded anything perpetrated in the statute law in this country before 1932.  I need not refer specifically to any of these powers. If necessary, I could furnish a list. It would rather appal the ordinary citizen when he discovered the vast powers arrogated by Departments to <Col N="1516" /> themselves, which powers really amount to the determination of rights as between citizens and public Departments&mdash;that is to say, the arrogation by Departments of judicial power to themselves.</P>
    <P>We had reached a point where, in consequence of the practice over 15 years and the decisions of our own courts, we had arrived at an approximate idea of the limitations that could be imposed upon Departments or other bodies in whom powers of a quasi-judicial nature were vested, and I think the position would have been met by leaving matters as they were. This Article opens the door wide to complete bureaucracy.  I do not for a moment say that it is the intention of the Government to do that.  But that is not the test which you apply to the provisions of any Constitution. You test it on broad principles, irrespective of present-day considerations. When an elaborate system of court machinery is being established under the Constitution, the least we should see is that the functions of the judges who will man that machinery will be guarded from encroachment by departmental action.  It is natural for Departments to consider that they are the best judges in reference to a particular matter.  We have a provision in a statute at present by which the mere certificate of an official is conclusive proof of a certain matter without the necessity for doing any of those things which the ordinary citizen has to do.  By that example we see the extent to which these powers could be pushed by an unscrupulous Government if they so desired.  You cannot test this Article by thinking of the present Government or the past Government.  This Article takes away the entire effect of the opening words of Article 34, which provides that justice shall be administered in public courts.  The real safeguard a citizen has against any tyranny on the part of an Executive or a Department is an independent judiciary.  The real safeguard in respect of any rights that may be given in any Constitution is to be found in the exercise of judicial power in public by independent judges. Article 37 provides that judicial <Col N="1517" /> powers of a very serious character may be exercised in public or in private by people without any knowledge of law, without any experience of the administration of law, without any experience of the construction of statutes, and without any experience of the way in which a case is conducted in court.  This provision may lead to injustice.  As we are laying down what is intended to be the fundamental law of the country, one of the basic principles contained in the Constitution should be to provide for the exercise of judicial functions in public courts by independent judges without danger of encroachment by any grasping Executive or Departmental authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentRice" hpid="Mr. V. Rice Mr. V. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite understand that what was in the mind of the Government in drafting this Article was the desire to provide for cases such as the Land Commission, referred to by the President.  The Article, however, makes too wide a sweep and provides a very big net.  It is proposed to permit the exercise of &ldquo;limited functions&rdquo; of a judicial nature to persons other than judges.  What is meant by &ldquo;limited functions&rdquo;?  There is no definition given.  It would be possible, under the Article as it stands, to give all the powers of a High Court judge to a non-judicial person, putting some limitation on these powers.  These would still be &ldquo;limited functions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a real danger in the point referred to by Deputy Costello&mdash;the invasion by Departments of the judicial office and of judicial functions.  It is the tendency of Departments not merely in this country but in other countries to arrogate to themselves functions of a judicial nature.  It is often hard to draw the line between administrative acts and judicial acts, but the tendency in Departments always is to extend the domain of their own jurisdiction.  We have known instances of that in recent years.  I think that the Article could be drafted in such a way&mdash;if it is necessary at all &mdash;as to prevent these dangers occurring but I think it would be better, as Deputy Costello suggested, to let the position remain as it is now&mdash;that is to say, as defined by Article 64 of the <Col N="1518" /> Constitution as clarified by a number of judgments given in the courts as to what is meant by the exercise of judicial power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that lawyers in general would agree with the views expressed by the two lawyer Deputies who have just now spoken. My information is that the existing position was anything but satisfactory and that it required a very great effort, indeed, to right the position by making fine distinctions between exercising functions of a judicial character and exercising judicial powers.  It was very strongly represented to me that the present position should not be allowed to remain.  It is to clear up the existing situation and make the position definite that we have introduced this Article.  Everybody will admit that modern legislation requires that bodies other than the public courts should have power to exercise functions of a quasi-judicial character.  You cannot precisely define those powers. You can only do your best to narrow the opening while allowing for the exercise of the necessary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the objection is made that, in opening the door, we are opening it too much.  That, of course, is always a difficulty.  You want to open it sufficiently wide to admit all the things that are necessary to be done and you do not want to open it so wide as to make it easy to have abuses.  That is the difficulty we have here.  It was attempted to narrow this down by the use of the words &ldquo;limited functions.&rdquo; The Deputies opposite rub their shoulders. I would be glad if they could do better.  We say &ldquo;the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters.&rdquo;  We clearly exclude criminal matters, and we say &ldquo;by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law.&rdquo;  They must get their functions from law.  What you are really trying to do is to prevent decisions of bodies like these being upset on a purely technical point: that they were exercising functions of a judicial nature, and, therefore, should not have functions at all.  You want to prevent a technical plea of that sort <Col N="1519" /> from interfering with things that have to be done.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about bureaucracy and about the powers that Departments take to themselves, but, unfortunately, it is a fact that modern conditions of society demand that that sort of work be done by somebody. You cannot provide that the public court will deal with all matters that arise.  Take, for example, the question of referees.  In various cases, are they not more or less exercising functions of a judicial nature?  I would be very glad if I could get an amendment from the opposite benches which would narrow the door so as to admit just the things that have to be faced.  There is no disposition on our part to make bureaucracy easy or anything of that sort.  When we use phrases about bureaucracy, we ought, I suggest, be careful to realise that modern conditions are of such a character and so complex that we must have machinery to deal with those conditions.  The rigid watertight department arrangement for Government in the past is not possible to-day.  The Department for Industry and Commerce has to do a number of things.  Some of the functions relating to that Department are of a judicial nature.</P>
    <P>Are you going to stop that Department from functioning, so that, everything that it does of a judicial nature will have to be brought into the public courts?  Clearly, that is not possible.  I I am not anxious to open the door one inch wider than it has to be, but I suggest to Deputies opposite that we have a position here that has to be dealt with.  We want to put the position on a sound foundation, so that purely technical pleas will not be used to hamper the whole machinery.  That does not prevent anybody from having recourse to the courts afterwards. There is no suggestion of that.  This is only to prevent purely technical pleas being made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lavery made a speech before the legal society of U.C.D. last winter very different in argument from the speech that Deputy Costello made here this evening.  In that speech Deputy Lavery remarked that the courts were failing to meet the requirements of the public.  He said that there ought to be power, and that it ought to be possible, for the ordinary citizen to go into the courts to get his rights either from his neighbour or from a public Department.  He specially mentioned public Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There was evidence, he said, that the courts were failing to discharge their function, and because of the expense, and for other reasons, the ordinary citizen was prepared to suffer injustice rather than resort to the courts. Deputy Norton, a short time ago, pretty well supported that view when he said that to tell the people in Gloucester Street, or people with a great deal more means than the people in Gloucester Street, that the ordinary courts are open to them is like telling them that the Shelbourne Hotel is a very nice place to stop in when they have not got rooms of their own.  It is all very well to talk about the encroachments of bureaucracy.  Nobody wants bureaucracy entrenched at all.</P>
      <P>But bureaucracy is better than nothing, and if the courts are not open to the ordinary citizen, as Deputy Lavery evidently thinks, and as most of us think, or open even for the middle classes&mdash;if the High Court and the Supreme Court only exist for people with very considerable means&mdash;then it is well to have at least a civil servant available that one can appeal to for certain rights.  A civil servant, unless he is a very sinister person, will make an effort to do justice, and an effort to do some sort of justice is better than no effort at all.</P>

      <P>The President referred to what he called the present unsatisfactory position with regard to the matter dealt with in this Article.  It is perhaps unsatisfactory, but that is owing to the extreme difficulty, if not the impossibility, of drawing the line between what are purely administrative functions and purely judicial functions. That is the reason why the position is not so satisfactory perhaps.  The President made the further point that the decision of a Department should not be set aside on a purely technical plea.  We all agree with that, and that position is protected by the present state of the law.  The courts have on a number of occasions refused to set aside acts done by Departments on the ground that they were not an infringement of the exercise of judicial powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that that Act gave enormous powers to the Executive&mdash;powers which, at the time, I was very definitely of the view were going to be abused; and I still think that the existence of an Article such as Article 2A could only be justified under extreme circumstances.  We have tried to create the circumstances under which Acts of that kind would be unnecessary.  We have tried to bring about conditions that would render such an Act unnecessary any longer.  Although the power is taken here to pass such legislation, I do still hope that the need for passing legislation to implement that power will not be necessary; but I think it would be a very grave mistake also for us, in view of the situation and the conditions that we have passed through, to do anything to prevent the passing of legislation of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to pass that other Act&mdash; which was so clearly and obviously against the Constitution&mdash;you had to introduce a constitutional measure.  In fact, you had to make it the Constitution. That was the position.  The position was that the rest of the Constitution <Col N="1525" /> had to be read subject to Article 2A.  Now we have had a motion here from Deputy Norton regarding the rights and liberties possessed by the citizens, and saying that they should be continued.  Well, I suggest that the Deputy should read Article 2A of the old Constitution. The position is that you are providing here that, if it should be necessary to set up special courts, you would not be prevented from doing so by the Constitution.  One does not want to provide a constitutional barrier to the setting up of such special courts.  After all, we are going here to have a Constitution which will not be changed easily.  Under this Constitution it will not be possible to summon your Dáil or Seanad over-night, and in a day or two get a whole Act passed through. Under this Constitution you could never pass even a very, very modified Article 2A.  This, however, gives you power, if the occasion demands it, to bring in such legislation, but this itself is not enacting anything.  If the conditions demand it, you will have to have an Act to implement what you want.  Perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;implement,&rdquo; as it is not the proper word to use; but under this Constitution you would have to have an Act brought in to set up such courts, and whatever Government would be here would have to bring it in. Accordingly I have no apology whatever to offer for that.  I feel that it is a matter of ordinary common-sense and wisdom.</P>

The first use made of that machinery of government by the present Government was against people who had not paid their rates.</P>

      <P>He seems to have been making a great point out of the fact that the President has changed his mind in connection with the Military Tribunal.  It is extraordinary how we all change our minds on occasions.  I was looking over some records recently of an occasion on which Deputy Morrissey apparently changed his mind.  I remember meeting Deputy Morrissey at a meeting in the Shelbourne Hotel when he was very anxious to hurl Deputy Cosgrave out of office because, as he said in this House, Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues were the greatest political &ldquo;omadhauns&rdquo; that ever cursed this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make one suggestion in connection with clause 3 of Article 38?  However much the <Col N="1528" /> President may not be disposed to accept my statement, the suggestion I make is one that I would recommend any Government with which I was associated to adopt, having regard to my experience both before and after the change of Government in connection with the Military Tribunal. That is, to allow the courts to determine, as a question of fact, whether the circumstances existing in the country were such as to justify the establishment of special courts and secondly, to provide in this Constitution that any law that would be passed establishing special courts, must provide for an appeal from the decision of these courts to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  As I say, I make that suggestion in all seriousness to the President as a matter that I would advise any Government in their own interest to incorporate in a law establishing special courts.  The President is probably aware that in connection with another clause in this Article ousting the jurisdiction of the courts during a time of war or armed rebellion, the decision as to whether a state of war or armed rebellion does or does not exist rests entirely with the courts.  That was determined both prior and subsequent to the Treaty. A decision of our own courts, somewhere about 1923 or 1924, was that a state of armed rebellion did not exist although the courts had decided prior to that that such a state did exist.  My submission to the President is, that if the suggestion I make were adopted, it would go far towards calming the very reasonable fears that special courts would be used for subverting the liberties of the subject and also for the purpose of enabling criminal trials to be carried through without advertence to the ordinary rules of evidence.  The last remark I shall make on that subject is that some people think that the rules of evidence and laws of evidence are something in which lawyers revel, something which are highly technical. The rules of evidence, as a matter of fact, have been established over a course of years and as the result of experience.  They are worked out as the result of experience, brought to bear on the interests of the <Col N="1529" /> ordinary litigant and on his interest alone.  I make this suggestion for the President's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, of course, is now apparently anxious to justify the circumstances which necessitated the use by the Government of Article 2A, but I suggest to him that, in setting up a new Constitution, there is no case for the insertion of a provision to establish special courts in the manner provided in this Article, and that we have no evidence before us of the desirability of establishing such courts.  There is no condition of affairs in the country to-day which justifies the continued use of the Military Tribunal.  There is no situation in the country to-day which justifies the continued incarceration of people or, at any rate, of the overwhelming majority of the people detained, in accordance with sentences imposed by that nonlegal body.  I suggest that it is anticipating trouble and anticipating a very abnormal situation to put a provision of this kind into the Constitution.  If a situation developed here in which there was an abnormal set of circumstances existing, the country should have an opportunity to consider that situation without its being made so easy and convenient for an Executive Council to resort to the introduction of such special courts.  I think, in a situation of this kind, we ought to aim at ensuring in the Constitution that our normal legal machinery would be adequate for the trial of any ordinary type of offence.  It is not a very healthy situation when a country thinks it necessary to establish special courts for the purpose of dealing with offences.  The ordinary run of civilised communities is that the ordinary courts are adequate to deal with offences known to the law of the country.  That is the situation that should be aimed at in this and every other Constitution which is to govern a democratic country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see this Article here used for the enactment of legislation which creates an offence not known to the normal law of the country.  This is intended to be a justification for perpetuating the Constitution (Amendment) Act, an Act which creates a <Col N="1530" /> whole category of new offences, offences not known to the ordinary law of this or any other country.  I think it is regrettable to find a provision of this kind in the Constitution. The President, in other days, denounced the Constitution (Amendment) Act.  I think he was right then and I think he is wrong now.  I do not think any set of circumstances justifies the continuance of that Act on the Statute Book having regard to the conditions which exist in the country to-day.  This Article appears to me to be incorporated for no other purpose than to justify the continuance of that Act.  We may be told after the Constitution is passed, and the Constitution (Amendment) Act continued in operation, that the authority for keeping it in operation was the Constitution passed by this House and endorsed by the people.  It is not possible, of course, to get a clear verdict from the people in a Constitution of this kind as to whether or not they desire the continuance of Article 2A and whether they are prepared to have that Article covered or continued in Article 38 of this Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is a very important aspect of the question.  Are we to understand&mdash;because it would alter my viewpoint a good deal on this Article&mdash;that when this Constitution is passed Article 2A will be dropped, and dropped definitely, and that no effort will be made to revive the Article in another form and as a basis of the abnormal legislation that is provided for here?  Whether that is going to happen or not&mdash;and my fear is that it is going to happen&mdash;we ought not to embody legislation of this kind in a normal Constitution.  If there is need to meet any special situation, it ought to be an obligation on the Executive Council of the day, firstly, to enact its legislation through the Legislature, and, if that legislation invades the ordinary rights of the citizens as enshrined in the Constitution, there ought to be an obligation on the Executive Council to get the authority of the people by referendum to pass that ordinary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike giving any Executive the power to pass that abnormal, extraordinary legislation in the simple, easy way that would be possible if this Article passed in its present form.  All that is necessary to do then is to get a majority of one in this House and special legislation of the type foreshadowed here could be passed.  It will then be possible to invade the ordinary liberties of the citizen in the manner provided for in this Constitution and in precisely the same way as the Constitution (Amendment) Act was passed.  If a set of circumstances of that kind arises, the Government should be put under an obligation to get its legislation through the House, and should be compelled to get a referendum from the people before it is entitled to tear up the ordinary protective provisions of the Constitution. I think, therefore, that this type of legislation which is foreshadowed here is the type of legislation for which the Government should be required to get a special mandate from the people by means of a referendum, and that it should not be slipped in in this way <Col N="1532" /> in order to enable the Government to utilise it when a particular set of circumstances may make it possible for the Government to use the provision in the Constitution in a manner that will enable them to make political capital out of their powers and to inflict considerable political damage on their political opponents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that anybody is entirely satisfied with what is known as the Public Safety Act, or Article 2A as it stands, and if legislation is brought in under the power given by this new Article 38 of the present Constitution, I think it is more than likely that such legislation would differ in some important respects from the actual provisions of Article 2A of the old Constitution. As for this new Article itself, Article 38, which Deputy Norton considers to be unsuitable to a civilised or democratic country, I must say outright that I warmly support it.  It is unfortunate that such an Article should be necessary, but there is no use in shutting our eyes to facts.  Owing to the unfortunate circumstances of our history there is an old tradition of secret terrorism in this country, a tradition that is liable from time to time to be revived.  We have not got it out of our blood yet in this country. I am sure that, as a result of the exercise of self-government, the time will come when we will have got it out of our blood, but it is not out of our blood yet, and while Deputy Norton speaks as if the state of the country were wholly satisfactory, our memories are not so very short as he seems to imagine.  After all, there were three very terrible murders committed not at all so long ago, the More O'Ferral murder, the Egan murder and the Somerville murder.  It is for cases like that&mdash;where the ordinary courts cannot be expected to function successfully, and have in fact been proved by experience not to function successfully &mdash;that it is necessary to provide by such an Article as is now under consideration. Therefore I warmly support the Article, and I would consider myself undemocratic if I opposed it, because nothing could be more undemocratic than to expose the humble <Col N="1533" /> citizens of the country to crime and intimidation and violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Norton continued to speak he began to get a little bit clear about what the actual position is.  The position is that this Constitution, by its enactment, will repeal Article 2A.  You will then have the ordinary courts, trial by jury, and so on.  I am perfectly certain that there is no Deputy here in this House who will hold that trial by jury is possible if there is an organised, armed body that can intimidate and terrorise.  Is it not quite evident that, under modern conditions, if you have an organised, armed body throughout the country they can prevent trial by jury?  If you are to preserve trial by jury as an institution, you need protection of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing here, then, is that when this Constitution is passed we are thrown back upon the ordinary law.  I hope that that will be sufficient&mdash;that we will be able to work under that.  I sincerely hope so, but we have to remember that it is only a hope.  If that hope should not be realised, and if there should be circumstances such as we have passed through, in which you will have murders committed and in which you will have intimidation and terrorism, surely the community as a whole must be empowered to protect itself.  Consequently, in such circumstances, you do need to have a system under which you will be able to protect the community in general by means of these courts, which will not be intimidated.  That is the purpose.  It would certainly be very wrong for us, in passing a Constitution of this sort, which unlike the old Constitution cannot be changed by a simple Act, if we did not make provision for a possibility which is there.  All that is done here is that it will be possible, if it is necessary, to bring in a law to arrange for special courts of a character that will not be open to intimidation, and I think we would not be doing our duty at all if we <Col N="1534" /> did not have an Article of this sort.</P>
      <P>Just listen to what it says: &ldquo;Special courts may be established by law&rdquo;&mdash;they must be set up by law; this does not set them up&mdash;&ldquo;for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law&rdquo;&mdash;the law will determine the cases or, rather, it will determine the general conditions&mdash;&ldquo;that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the ordinary courts are not able to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order, does Deputy Norton suggest that they should not be supplemented by courts which could do the necessary work for the community? What Deputy Norton wants is, that we should omit this provision, and we would then find, before we could take any action to supplement the ordinary courts, to make the administration of justice effective and to preserve the peace, possibly that we should have to go through the process of amending the Constitution by means of a plebiscite.  I am perfectly certain that if Deputy Norton was here, and had the same responsibility for seeing that order is preserved in the community, he would take very good care that the possibility of establishing such courts would be provided for in the Constitution.</P>

I never heard a more thorough justification than the President gave, and I <Col N="1535" /> congratulate him on it.  Deputy Norton must not think that the President will forego this Article.

The President had that different conception of truth.  We now have it that he does not think Deputy Norton will ever get on these benches and that he does not expect to change him.  I want to apologise for one slight dereliction on my part towards the present Government.  I refer to a quotation I gave in which there was a reference to a government of angels.

      <P>The President became heated and bothered over this Article and, as he was speaking, while I recognised the figure present as that of Deputy de Valera I found considerable difficulty in recognising the philosophy and the mentality that was Deputy de Valera's that I used to know when he was on the Opposition Benches.  It was the very antithesis.  While the hand was the hand of Esau the voice was the voice of Jacob.  The President delivered a speech which was an absolute repentance for everything he said when on the Opposition Benches.  He <Col N="1536" /> said that if a jury cannot be got to function in abnormal circumstances someone must be got to convict.  Will the President treat himself to a little exhilarating amusement this evening by looking up a speech he delivered on a Bill to abolish the practice of having juries named in open court?  When the President discourses in a rather heated way about the necessity for something of the type of a military tribunal, will he look up the speech he made on the Constitution (Amendment) Act?  If he does not think that sufficiently fiery, let him look at the speeches made by those who are now sitting on the Front Benches.  When finished with that process, let him then say to himself: &ldquo;Well, all we said about that then I now justify as something that is necessary, even in circumstances which to-day are in no way comparable with those which existed when the Constitution (Amendment) Act was introduced.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said at that time precisely what the President said now.  I venture to say that if a committee of inquiry was established to compare the Second Reading speeches on the Constitution (Amendment) Act and the speech the President delivered five minutes ago, there would not be much trouble in discovering that there was no difference whatever in the mentality in both instances as to the necessity for that particular type of abnormal legislation.  I prefer to believe what the President said in 1931.  I think what he said then about the Constitution (Amendment) Bill and the abnormal powers in it was right. I think the President is wrong in 1937. If the President gets rather annoyed and heated because I think he was right in 1931 and wrong in 1937, that is equivalent to a declaration by the President, though not conveyed in so many <Col N="1537" /> words, that he believes in 1937 that he was wrong in opposing the Constitution (Amendment) Act in 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that there should be no necessity for putting this abnormal provision into a Constitution of this kind.  If there are circumstances which necessitate abnormal measures, the Government should be forced to go to the country to get authority from the people.  They should not have exceptional facilities or abnormal powers enshrined in this Constitution.  I say in conclusion that if the President were still over on these benches, instead of being in the particularly delicate position he is in now, when he is standing on thin ice, the President would be saying the very same things about this provision as he said in 1931 and as I am saying now, namely, he would be advocating that a Government should not be entitled to arrogate to itself these special powers for use with any speed or facility the Government cares to exercise in the utilisation of these powers.  I believe he would be saying, if he were on the Opposition Benches, that, if there is an abnormal situation, the people ought to be given an opportunity of saying whether the situation is so abnormal as to justify giving to an Executive Council the powers which the President proposes to arrogate to an Executive Council under this Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an absurd statement about the Government arrogating to itself powers under this Constitution. It is arrogating nothing.  It is equally absurd to say that this is unusual.  As a matter of fact, there is hardly a Constitution of a written character in which you have not sweeping provisions to enable the Government to suspend the whole Constitution in the circumstances in which we are only taking power to set up a special court to deal with cases where the ordinary courts cannot function. So that it is nonsense to make statements of that sort about the Government arrogating power to itself.  What is here is a very mild form of an Article which is found in partically every written Constitution, an Article providing <Col N="1539" /> for the complete suspension of constitutional guarantees in order to be able to deal with cases where the ordinary machinery of Government is not capable of coping with the situation it has to deal with.  Consequently, if we did not have this here, we could have it in another form.  We could have&mdash;and it might have passed without any criticism such as has been levelled at this&mdash;an Article which would be in the usual form, that in certain circumstances all constitutional guarantees are suspended.</P>
      <P>I think we are doing very much less than suspending all the constitutional guarantees.  We came in here with no desire to use anything but the ordinary courts.  We suspended Article 2A the moment we came into office; we put it out of operation, so far as we were concerned.  Then we had to resort to it, because it was the only thing available at our hands, to enable us to act in the public interest at the time.  It was the only means available to us and, as it was available to us, we used it.  But we had confidence in ourselves that we were not going to abuse these powers.  If I were in opposition, I would again oppose the Government being allowed to continue with these powers.  It is one thing having confidence in yourself and in the Government.  There is no nonsense about it.  It is a fact that every man is able to judge for himself whether he is going to abuse an instrument. If the same instrument is put into other people's hands, naturally he will be suspicious and say that they might very well abuse it.  If I were on the other Benches, I would be opposing any extraordinary powers such as are in Article 2A.  I would not be opposing this, because this is in a rigid Constitution and gives to the Legislature power to pass laws to meet emergencies which are provided for in other Constitutions by another method, and a much more drastic method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing further to say in regard to this than that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of my colleagues, an Article such as this is necessary so long as it is possible <Col N="1540" /> to have an armed organisation in the country.  There may be quite a different set of circumstances in ten years' time.  It may be another type of armed organisation that you will have to deal with&mdash;a different type. As long as you have modern weapons and modern powers of organising, then the community needs to have some method at its disposal for dealing with such situations, and all that is done here is to provide that a law can be passed to deal with such a situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should not go on the Records of this House that this particular Article is far less drastic than the ordinary provision found in written Constitutions providing for the suspension of constitutional guarantees in certain cases.  In its effect this particular Article is capable of being used in every bit as drastic a manner as any of the provisions in any of the written Constitutions providing for the suspension of the constitutional guarantees.  The chief guarantees in written Constitutions are: the guarantee of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the guarantee of the free expression of opinion, and the guarantee of public meeting.  This article allows any law to be passed, in the circumstances covered by it, suspending the right of <i>habeas corpus</i>, suspending the right of free speech, suspending the right of free expression of opinion, and suspending the right of public meeting. It is right, irrespective of the merits or demerits of this Article, that it should not appear on the Records of this House that this Article is not as drastic or as capable of being utilised in a drastic fashion as any of the provisions of the Continental Constitutions providing for the suspension of constitutional guarantees.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of them.  Let us see one of <Col N="1541" /> them.  This is Article 124 of the Constitution of the Polish Republic:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The rights of the individual&mdash; liberty of the person (Article 97), inviolability of the dwelling (Article 100), liberty of the Press (Article 105), secrecy of correspondence (Article 106), right of combination and association and of forming unions (Article 108)&mdash;may be temporarily suspended in the whole territory of the State, or in any parts thereof, if rendered necessary for reasons of public safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All these individual rights are swept away through the whole State if rendered necessary by reasons of public safety.  The Article goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Council of Ministers has the exclusive right to decree such suspension...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;there is no question of law now&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...with the authorisation of the President of the Republic in case of war or danger of war, of internal disorder, or of grave conspiracies of a treasonable character threatening the Constitution or the public safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is pretty drastic.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is almost a common feature of these written Constitutions that there is power for a most sweeping suspension of all the guarantees to the individual, and so on, that are given in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the President's conversion is complete. I am not arguing against this Article.  I am only pointing that out. There is no good in his telling the House that he is repealing Article 2A, when any Government with a majority can carry it in 48 hours.  Secondly, he said that he would not have brought in Article 2A.  But he administered it. Why did he never amend it?  Was it because he was squeamish about amending the Constitution?  He brought in several amendments to the Constitution.  If there was anything in that Article which was too drastic, why did he not amend it?  The explanation is quite clear.  The President has no confidence in any Government that is not himself.  Is not that what he said? <Col N="1542" /> No powers are to be given to anyone except himself, and any powers proposed to be given to anybody except himself he will criticise and obstruct and refuse powers against even murder if necessary.</P>

They will be quite different at the end of 1937.  The circumstances are different now because he is responsible for the Government.  He was not responsible in 1931, and he will not be responsible at the end of 1937.  That is the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked now why we did not amend Article 2A of the Constitution.  If we had to deal with the situation we would have to bring in a Bill to give certain powers.  Now the greater includes the lesser, and in Article 2A there were those powers which I would certainly oppose being given to any Government if I were in Opposition.  I certainly would oppose the giving of such powers because I <Col N="1544" /> had a right to think they would be abused.  I would not be surprised at all to find, if there was an Act brought in under this, that the Government and the Opposition would be taking different views about it.  That would be no surprise whatever to me.  We have got here an Act which gives us lots of things we would not bring in at all if we were bringing in the measure ourselves.  But included in that Act are powers which we ourselves would seek.  Why should we, while in office, change that Act?  That Act gave us certain powers.  We were not going to abuse these powers, powers that we believed could be abused.  Why should we, as long as we were in office, bring in and pass another Act?  When we were dealing with these matters we did not think the Seanad was going to deal with the measures we would bring in, in the same way as the Seanad dealt with the measures brought in by the Opposition when they were in office.  The circumstances in which we used that Act were circumstances in which it was necessary to use it in order to protect order and public safety.  We had to have some measure, and we used this and we continued to use it.  Now this Draft Constitution is completely repealing the Constitution.  A situation will be created, once the Constitution is enacted, in which you will have only the ordinary law on which to depend.  You will have to depend on conditions at the time.  Whether the Government of that time will immediately come to Parliament with a measure providing for the powers which may be necessary to maintain order is a situation that will have to be faced. That is the situation, and that is why this Article is here.</P>

Will any Deputy on the Government side who spoke so strongly on this matter five years ago, tell us what has arisen in the last five years which justifies them in changing their minds?  I want to say quite clearly and candidly, that I am glad that Deputies on the opposite side including the President have come around to our point of view.  The difference between the President and Deputy Norton is this: the President knows he was wrong in 1931 and he now admits it; Deputy Norton and the Labour Party know they were wrong in 1931, but they are not prepared to admit it even now.  That is the difference between the Labour Party and the Government Party.  The President has made that very clear in every speech he has made upon this Article.</P>

      <P>(a)  the said next preceding sub-section shall not apply in respect of any part of such income which is, in the said year of assessment, accumulated for the benefit of a child (being a child who, at the beginning of such year, is under the age of twenty-one years and is unmarried) of the settlor nor in respect of income arising in the said year of assessment from accumulations of the income hereinbefore mentioned:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  whenever in any year of assessment beginning after the 5th day of April, 1937, any sum whatsoever is paid under the trusts of such irrevocable instrument out of such property or the accumulations of the income thereof or out of the income of such property or the income of the said accumulations to or for the benefit of a child (being a child who, at the beginning of such year, is under the age of twenty-one years and is unmarried) of the settlor, such sum shall be deemed for the purposes of <Col N="1548" /> this section to be paid as income, but subject to the limitation that this paragraph shall not apply to so much of such sum as is equal to the amount by which the aggregate of such sum and all other (if any) sums paid after the 5th day of April, 1937, under the trusts of such irrevocable instrument to or for the benefit of the said child or any other child (being a child who, at the beginning of the year of assessment in which such other sum was paid, was under the age of twenty-one years and unmarried) of the settlor exceeds the aggregate amount of the income arising after the 5th day of April, 1937, from such property together with the income arising after the said date from the said accumulations.</P>
    <P>In this sub-section the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; does not include any annual or other periodical payment secured by the covenant of the settlor, or by a charge made by the settlor on the whole or any part of his property or the whole or any part of his future income, or by both such covenant and such charge.</P>
    <P>2.  In page 4, before Section 2 (9), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(9)  The following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to the construction of the expression &ldquo;irrevocable instrument&rdquo; in this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the said expression shall be construed as including instruments made before, as well as instruments made after, the passing of this Act;</P>
    <P>(b)  an instrument shall not be an irrevocable instrument for the purposes of this section if the trusts thereof provide for all or any one or more of the following matters, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the payment or application to or for the settlor for his own benefit of any capital or income or accumulations of income in any circumstances whatsoever during the life of a child of the settlor to or for the benefit of whom any income or accumulations of income is or are or may be payable or applicable under <Col N="1549" /> the trusts of the instrument;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the payment or application during the life of the settlor to or for the wife or husband of the settlor for her or his own benefit of any capital or income or accumulations of income in any circumstances whatsoever during the life of any such child as aforesaid of the settlor;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the termination of the trusts of the instrument by the act or on the default of any person;</P>
    <P>(iv)  the payment by the settlor of a penalty in the event of his failing to comply with the provisions of the instrument;</P>
    <P>(c)  an instrument shall not be prevented from being an irrevocable instrument for the purposes of this section by reason only that the trusts thereof include any one or more of the following provisions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a provision whereunder any capital or income or accumulations of income will or may become payable to or applicable for the benefit of the settlor, or the wife or the husband of the settlor, on the bankruptcy of a child of the settlor to or for the benefit of whom any income or accumulations of income is or are or may be payable or applicable under the trusts of the instrument;</P>
    <P>(ii)  a provision whereunder any capital or income or accumulations of income will or may become payable to or applicable for the benefit of the settlor, or the wife or the husband of the settlor, in the event of any such child as aforesaid of the settlor making an assignment of or charge on such capital or income or accumulations of income;</P>
    <P>(iii)  a provision for the termination of the trusts of the instrument in such circumstances or manner that such termination would not, during the life of any such child as aforesaid of the settlor, benefit any person other than such child or his or her wife, husband, or issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> 3.  In page 4, section 2 (9), to delete all from the word &ldquo;where&rdquo; in line 32 to the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 37 and substitute the words and brackets &ldquo;except where it occurs in the expression &lsquo;income tax&rsquo; and where, in sub-section (1), paragraph (b)  of sub-section (2), and sub-sections (6) and (7), it is immediately preceded by the word &lsquo;as&rsquo; or (in the said sub-section (6) by the word &lsquo;his&rsquo;).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of these amendments, broadly speaking, will be that income from invested funds which is settled to or for the benefit of a child of the settlor under an irrevocable settlement shall, to the extent that such income has in fact been accumulated for the benefit of the child, be treated as not being the income of the parent.</P>

Therefore, I am going broadly to sketch this problem so that the Minister may come to the Fifth Stage armed with all the requisite information to deal with it. I want to give him an outline of the allegations that will be made against him.  This Bill is designed to provide revenue to meet the Charges that will come in course of payment during the next year.  Last year inflated Estimates were made for unemployment works, relief works, and for certain other social services.  I ask the House to note&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My allegation is that this Bill contains provisions that it ought not to contain, because I have reason to believe that the money it is proposed to raise will never be used and that at the end of the year we will have speeches made by the Minister for Finance at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to the effect that he can confidently forecast that the taxation provided for in the Finance Bill of 1937 has yielded a revenue far in excess of what he anticipated.</P>

I think it was to cover a few cases that were late I know that one minor curer at <Col N="1556" /> least was held technically to be late but I think that, morally, he could not be held to be late because he was actually carrying on correspondence with the Department with regard to his rights during February and March.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 92 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion therefrom of paragraph (f) (being the paragraph commencing with the words &ldquo;an order&rdquo; and ending with the words &ldquo;production of bacon&rdquo;), and the said sub-section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Principal Act stood, these production orders had to be made about a week before the period.  The amending Bill, as introduced, brought that down to a period of three days, and now there is a further amendment providing that they need not publish until the last day of the production period for the coming production period.  It is a matter that concerns <Col N="1558" /> the bacon factories alone.  It is not the concern of anybody else as to how they may regulate this business with regard to production periods, but the Bacon Board believe that at certain times of the year, such as the present, when there is some difficulty in getting enough pigs, it would be well if they were to make their production period short and, even weekly, if necessary, in order to meet their difficulties in the best possible way.  The bacon curers are all agreed that if the production quota were fixed on the last day of the period to come into operation the following day for the new period, it would be quite workable.  I, personally, thought the scheme was unworkable until I got an assurance that the bacon curers themselves were quite agreeable to accept it as being necessary to meet the difficulty at certain times.  It would not, however, be adopted as a routine practice, but only in time of great difficulty.  They may go to the last day of the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to demur in a highly technical matter of this kind, but the Minister will recall that the whole underlying principle of this legislation was to provide, for protected periods, stability in the trade. The production quota order is a vital matter because it determines absolutely the number of pigs which can be sold by producers to factories.  If we are to have a production quota for only a week and a new production quota thereafter, does it not seem to fly in the face of the entire principle underlying the Bill?  The price of pigs in this country is determined by the Pigs Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board is, in fact, controlled by the Bacon Marketing Board.  I observed recently that when the bacon curers found themselves confronted with a shortage of pigs and, possibly, keen competition to get pigs, they adopted a new departure.  Deputies may forget that while the Pigs Marketing Board have the right to fix the price of a pig delivered at a factory, there are still fairs and markets functioning in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last three weeks or a month, a very acute shortage of pigs arose and the result of that was that if I sent my pigs to the factory I would <Col N="1559" /> only get 73/- a cwt. for a Grade A1 pig but, in the streets of Ballaghaderreen, I could get 82/-.  On the last fair day in Ballaghaderreen my neighbours and I brought out our pigs and got from 80/- to 82/-, when all we could get from the factory was 73/-.  After congratulating ourselves, we went back to the pig-sty, looked at each pig, stroked its back, congratulated it and hoped it would be ready for the market at no far distant date, so that we would get 82/- for it as well.  Then we read a paragraph in the newspapers to the effect that the curers had got permission from the Minister for Agriculture to buy a large quantity of pigs in Northern Ireland, where there was a temporary glut, and to bring these cheap pigs into the Free State and manufacture them into bacon, whereupon the price of pigs in Ballaghaderreen market fell by from 15/- to £1.  Pigs that were worth 82/- were now only worth about 68/-.</P>
    <P>I consulted Monday morning's post in the hope that what we would lose on the roulette we would make up on the roundabouts, by getting a substantial reduction in the price of bacon as a result of the purchase of these cheap pigs in Northern Ireland.  What was my astonishment to find that the price of bacon had been increased by 6/- per cwt. by the curers!  The price of hard, salted bacon quoted by one of the principal curers last week was 120/- per cwt.&mdash;4/- higher than his list price.  His list price, which I have before me, is 116/-.  His representative quoted me 120/- per cwt. for hard, salted bacon. In a well run factory, 20/- over the price of pork delivered at the factory should yield the curer a modest profit. Lest I should be overstating my case, let us assume he should have 26/- per cwt.  If he is paying 73/- per cwt. for top grade now, I am not exaggerating if I say that he is paying about 70/- all round for his pigs.  On that basis, he ought to supply the consumer with bacon at 96/- per cwt.  However, we have got to remember that the Minister for Agriculture is using the hypothetical price fund to help himself, or the Minister for Finance, to pay the bounty on exported bacon.  The hypothetical price fund levy when I last heard of it <Col N="1560" /> was 12/- per cwt.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what the hypothetical price fund levy is now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The curer has to pay 70/-, plus 10/- levy.  Out of his 26/- profit gross, he has to pay all the cost of manufacture.  That is 106/- and the price of pigs is 120/-.  I am making up the price of bacon on the basis of the fixed price for pigs delivered at the factory but I know that the curers are at the present time buying cheap pigs in Northern Ireland and I do not know what they are paying for them.  They are being allowed to bring in these cheap pigs from Northern Ireland to keep down the price of my pigs in Ballaghaderreen market because, for the first time in two years, I am in a position to hold for a good price from the bacon curer.  If the farmer whose price is being beaten down by imported pigs from a country where there is a temporary glut makes any complaint that he has to pay an inflated price because of the protective tariff that is levied on what he has to buy, he is &ldquo;sabotaging Irish industry,&rdquo;&ldquo;playing England's game,&rdquo;&ldquo;betraying the unemployed and the downtrodden, and he is Public Enemy No. 1.&rdquo;  Everything the pig producer has to buy is rigorously protected, and the price is proportionately raised but if, by chance, the pig producer succeeds in creating a situation in which he can ask a good price from the curer for the pigs he has produced, immediately the Minister for Agriculture opens wide the door and invites in all the surplus pigs from Northern Ireland, heating down the price of pigs on the market here by 15/- per cwt.  That is not justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever has come over the Minister for Agriculture in regard to all this pig business, he seems to have delivered himself over body and soul to the curers.  Whatever they want him to do, he will do it.  That does not seem to me to be reasonable or just at all.  The Minister will say in reply: &ldquo;I have got a quota on the British market and I have to fill it.  If we have not enough pigs to fill it here, <Col N="1561" /> we must get pigs from somewhere.&rdquo; But when the curers are buying cheap pigs in Northern Ireland to keep down the price of our pigs, they are required to make no contribution at all. Whether they make a contribution on their pigs or not, the admission of these pigs freely results in the price of the Irish farmer's pig here being beaten down to a surplus-level price. By that, I mean the price which rules when there is a surplus of pigs on the market.  I think that requires explanation. The Minister ought to explain to us now why it is that when there is ever any change in the price of pigs, or in the price of bacon, it is always at the expense of the consumer of producer, but never at the expense of the curers, who at the present time control not only the Bacon Marketing Board but the Pigs Marketing Board as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the position is in the country, and I know for a fact that the price that is being paid for pigs is not up to the standard. Comparing the prices paid for pigs and the prices charged for bacon, the Pigs Marketing Board should be well aware of that fact, which is a source of great complaint in the country. This matter of allowing pigs in from Northern Ireland to depress prices here should not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated here on other Stages of this Bill that I was not in a position to say what was a fair price for bacon according to the prices that were being paid for pigs.  The prices Commission are investigating that matter.  I know that they have proceeded with a certain part of their investigation.  I hope they may be able to report soon, so that we may know whether there is profiteering on the part of curers, wholesalers or retailers or anywhere else.  The point was made that I took no action about the pigs coming in from Northern Ireland. I was not asked to take any action.  Any person is permitted to go to the North of Ireland, buy pigs there and bring them in here.  There is no tariff or prohibition of any kind.  If abuses were to arise in connection with that, perhaps a case could be made for <Col N="1562" /> some tariff or embargo on the importation of pigs.  But if I had brought in a proposal a few weeks ago to put a tariff on pigs coming into this country I can imagine the type of speech that Deputy Dillon would have made.  He would ask me in what circumstances I would expect pigs would ever come in here from the North of Ireland considering the prices that were being paid there.  I am sure that is the type of speech he would have made, because he never thought until now that we could get anything like the same price here as they were getting in Northern Ireland.  If it becomes an abuse in any way, or interferes with our own producers, action will have to be taken to fix a price here.  The top price at the moment is 75/-, and if a producer has pigs I think any factory will take them.  If not, as soon as this amending Bill goes through provision will be made to compel the factories to take them under certain circumstances.  I would like the Deputy to believe that I have taken no action with regard to the pigs coming in here, but if it is thought I should, I am prepared to consider it should the situation become dangerous in any way for our producers.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister heard any explanation for the sudden influx of Northern Ireland pigs here.  After all, his officials must know what the <Col N="1563" /> situation is, because it is of vital importance to know from time to time what the available supplies of pigs are.  I must confess that the Minister astonishes me when he tells me that there is no restriction on the purchase of pigs, because he will remember that one of the very relevant facts, when fixing a production quota, is to assess the number that will be available.  Well, if all the pigs in Northern Ireland are available as well as the pigs in Saorstát Eireann, how is that assessment ever made, or how is it ever hoped to make such an assessment? How is it, if that be true that there was never any restriction on bringing in pigs here, that the present situation came about?  Surely it is true to say that our quota to Great Britain requires that the bacon manufactured here shall be bacon manufactured from pigs reared in Saorstát Eireann, or need bacon only be manufactured in Saorstát Eireann? Can we buy live pigs in Northern Ireland, and ship them under our bacon and pig quota to Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter that I want to ask the Minister about is this. <Col N="1564" /> The Minister must know as well as I do that 26/- a cwt. is an ample margin for curing bacon.  He must know also, as I know, the prices that the curers are charging for bacon.  There is no concealment about it.  The price lists go out every Monday.  Has he nothing to say to the Pigs Marketing Board when fixing prices for pigs? They have fixed a price for pigs which, allowing for the legitimate profit that ought to be made by the curers, bears no relation whatever to the current price of bacon.  Surely it is the Minister's duty, if he finds that the producers' representatives on the Pigs Marketing Board are not fighting for the interests of pig producers, to change them.  Two of his nominees have been sitting on the Pigs Marketing Board nominally representing the producers.  They have publicly stated, on at least one occasion, that they concurred in the prices fixed.  The price fixed to-day is 75/- per cwt., and the price charged for bacon made out of pigs bought at 75/- per cwt. is 120/- per cwt.  Is it not time that the Minister either changed the producers' representatives on that Board, or else sent for them and asked them to render an account of the manner in which they have been discharging their duties, because somebody seems to have fallen down very materially? While the Prices Commission is supposed to be examining into the price of bacon, the producers of pigs are being ground between the upper and the nether Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture says that he hopes the Prices Commission will shortly report.  I received a requisition from the Prices Commission a couple of days ago in my capacity as a bacon wholesaler and retailer, asking me to give them full particulars of all the bacon we have bought in three years, with the several prices we paid for gammons and other cuts, and the several prices at which we have sold the bacon&mdash;gammons and other cuts&mdash;for three years.  If they had asked me to give them the first verse and the last verse of the Persian Koran, translated into Aramaic, I might have been better able to answer them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, Sir, according to the Minister, they are both relevant so far as the Prices Tribunal is concerned, and I say that, if the Prices Tribunal are going to follow along the lines that they have been following up to the present, we need not expect to have a report from them for the next two or three years. Meanwhile, however, the evil continues, and my suggestion is that we should deal with it now.  I know that now I can get 64/- a cwt. in the market and 75/- a cwt., at the factory, and that the price of bacon is 120/- a cwt.  I ask the Minister now to take such steps as may be necessary to abate that evil, as it seems to me to be, and not to wait till the Prices Tribunal conclude whatever sittings they are having now.</P>

    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 4 and 6, some changes might be made in the wording, if the principle were accepted.  I have put these amendments forward for a very definite purpose.  The Act of 1935, it is generally admitted, was in favour of the big man, and it is recognised that this Bill is much more in favour of the big man than the Act of 1935, and consequently there is the danger here of dealing with the people aimed at in a sectional way. What I was aiming at in these amendments was that, whatever was the amount minor curers had done in any year&mdash;let us say, the year 1935, or the period ending in June of 1935, the date of the passing of the earlier measure &mdash; should be related, if it could be got, to what was being transferred into the terms of the Act and this Bill, and that that amount should be stereotyped for them as a start-off&mdash;that being granted to them as the amount of the business they did in a particular year before this type of thing was thought of.  My idea was that it would be only fair that they, having worked under normal conditions for a certain period, should have that continued even under the later conditions.</P>
    <P>The object of the other amendment is to see that whatever percentage should turn out to be the correct figure for a particular period should be taken into account, supposing the same people remained in the business.  The object of the amendment is that there should be a proportion according to the amount they did.  There will be different categories of minor curers, we may presume.  Some of them will go up into the class of big curers, but others will move out altogether, and I gather that most of them will move out; but it might have to be further determined what exactly should be the proportion between them.  The main thing is that a group of people, who are known as minor curers, should have some kind of stabilisation according to whatever their interest was in this whole business, and that some allowance should be made, in the percentage <Col N="1569" /> allocated, for the weakening of ordinary trade conditions, but that certainly allowance should be made for any coercion that might be put upon them by means of the Act.</P>

      <P>I might have stated at some stage of the discussion that the tribunal which sat on this question said that, in their opinion, there were too many factories in the country but, as far as legislation goes, in either the Principal Act or this Bill, there is nothing to put a minor curer out of business.  A minor curer has a perfect right at the end of the period to become a licensed curer.  There is no justification for the statement that the Bill militates against the minor curer as compared with the larger curer.  The only difference it makes is that, if he does wish to go out of business, he will be compensated &mdash;but only if he wishes to go out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite recognise there is a good deal of misapprehension on this matter, because Deputies in this House, on Second Reading, made their speeches as a result of reading in the papers what minor curers said and not as a result of reading the Bill.  This Bill makes no change, except that if they opt to go out, they must get compensation.  If they do not opt to go out, they must become licensees, and nobody can prevent their becoming licensees.  When they become licensees, as the Bill stands they will get a quota equal to that of the smallest licensee at present.  Coming to Deputy McGilligan's amendment, if any minor curer becomes a licensee, and gets a quota equal to that of the smallest licensee, his condition will be considerably improved over what it was in 1935 because during the qualifying period, if any factory manufactured more than 2,200 cwt. of bacon, the proprietor automatically becomes a licensee under the Principal Act.  Any factory proprietor that manufactured less than 2,200 cwt. but who carried on business for 45 weeks, was entitled to become a minor curer.  The minor curer, therefore, did in fact manufacture less than 2,200 cwt. of bacon but, even so, under the Principal Act &mdash; and it is not changed under this Bill&mdash;his quota when he becomes a licensee will be brought up to that of the smallest licensee.  He is automatically getting better terms under the Principal Act than any other curer.  He is getting more than his proportion when he becomes a licensee, but to take an arbitrary figure of 7½ per cent. or 5 per cent. <Col N="1571" /> would be treating the minor curers very much better even than was proposed in the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I do not know, if we take the 1935 figures, what it would be, but it would be considerably less than what they did in the last 12 months.  The majority of the minor curers have expanded their business considerably in the last 12 months, because there was no restriction upon them whilst all the licensees were restricted in the amount of bacon they could produce.  The minor curers could go out and buy as many pigs as they liked and have these pigs manufactured into bacon. On the whole they extended their business considerably, and yet in the last 12 months they only did 2.8 per cent. of the whole business.  They had therefore no claim to anything like 7½ per cent. or 5 per cent.  I think they are very generously treated by the Dáil under the Principal Act when they are guaranteed a quantity at least equal to the smallest licensed curer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they licensees in the previous period?  I do not think so. <Col N="1572" /> They were minor curers who graduated during this period.  The Minister describes them as doing 2.86 of the business.  Now, 2.86 may sound very small, but as a matter of fact 2.86 is not a disreputable business for a group of small men to do.  I know a considerable factory which did only 5 per cent., and if you told anybody that it was only manufacturing 5 per cent. of the total output, they would think that it was an insignificant unit, but it is very far from it.  The situation in the bacon industry is that you have three or four men doing about 70 per cent. of the business, and the remaining 30 per cent. is divided amongst about 40 men, if you include all the minor curers.</P>

      <P>It would be over 50 per cent.  If you take these three firms you will find that I am right.  I merely mention that to point out that although you may have a number of small men dealing with a small section of the trade, it is a good rule to provide for the distribution of the industry all over the country, to provide for the two-pig man who, when very often he cannot get a price for his pig from the big firm, finds a minor curer within a reasonable distance from his farm.  One of the largest curers might be a rail journey away.  So long as we had the minor curers in existence, they provided centres of manufacture where the small man could get, if he was hard pressed, a fair price for his pig.  The Minister says that all these minor curers extended their business so far as they could.  Does that apply to the four minor curers who took licences?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They used to be among the minor curers.  Those were the four minor curers who would ordinarily have progressed furthest, because they were the four largest of the minor curers.  They were the leaders of that class.  For some strange reason they did not foresee what would happen to them if they took a licence early on in the preliminary period.  If they had remained minor curers during the preliminary period they could have extended their business indefinitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, so long as they remained minor curers the board had no authority over them at all.  I contend, with great force, that there was no compulsion on them to make that contribution, and they could pay any price they liked.  They took licences, and the moment they took licences they came under the jurisdiction of the board.  When the export quota licence was fixed at a higher figure&mdash;at 12½ per cent. higher than the original export quota&mdash;a corresponding amount had to be taken off the home-production quota; at the same time the supply of pigs began to dwindle, and you had a situation in which their quota was disproportionately reduced.  That is a complicated calculation and we can elaborate it later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>For about an hour, Sir, before the subject was interrupted by these other items on the Order Paper we were discussing, not the desirability or the undesirability of Article 38 of the new Constitution but the past history of the President of the Executive Council in relation to Article 2A of the old Constitution. While I have sometimes heard the President credited with being an astute political tactician, I must say that I thought I never saw a worse display of political astuteness than he gave in allowing that subject to occupy the amount of time that it did occupy. I think that if the President had sat tight and said that the House in general is convinced of the necessity for an Article of this type in the Constitution, refusing to be drawn into a discussion of his past in the matter of Article 2A of the old Constitution, he would have saved a lot of very valuable time.  It would at the same time have prevented him from giving a rather agonising display.  I have sometimes watched an acrobat doing a dangerous act; I have watched him with a sort of agonising emotion arising from the fear that he might do something that would kill him at any moment.  Similarly, as I listened to the President, I kept asking myself: &ldquo;What on earth is he going to say next?&rdquo;  I think even his bitterest enemy must have wept a little for him in listening to his hopeless attempt to prove his consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that the public of this country and of every other country is very ready to forgive inconsistency in a public man when it <Col N="1575" /> comes to the conclusion that he has learned from experience.  I think that it is very much to the credit of the Government that on this matter and on a number of other matters they have learned by experience, and it is a perfectly idle and undesirable exercise to embark on explanations which are designed to show that the apparent change has not been a real change.  The politician accused of inconsistency can always retort with <i>&ldquo;tu quoque.&rdquo;</i>  In any country you will get such changes; you will get people, when they are out of power, advocating a course that they had resisted when they were in power, and criticising policies when they are out of power that they themselves would unhesitatingly have adopted when they were in power.  There have been plenty of instances of that sort on the part of the Opposition Front Bench during the present Parliament, and no doubt there will be instances under every other Parliament so long as Party Government lasts.  I cannot but think that this passion of the President for proving his own consistency is one that is damaging and danger-out to the country, and that, if he <Col N="1576" /> would only leave it aside, his actions in some other very important matters might be different from what they are. For example, something might be done about setting the so-called economic war.</P>
    <P>For the moment I am concerned only with this Article of the Constitution. I think we all support it, with the exception of Deputy Norton, and how far his opposition to it is sincere is not for me to judge.  But I would appeal to the President to desist from the invitations that he was actually offering to the House at the moment we adjourned for tea&mdash;invitations to bring forward a supply of quotations from past speeches of his on the subject of Article 2A of the old Constitution. I have a collection of such quotations here if he wishes to see them.  For the sake of the time of this House, and in order that we may settle down to discuss the things which we really have to decide about this Constitution, I would urge on him that if he does care to see them he should let me show them to him in private rather than recite them in public.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;All citizens without distinction of of sex, class or religion shall be held equal before the law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;without distinction of sex,&rdquo; having been introduced by the President himself, I think, in some previous Article dealing with sex, it would be right to put this in here and, <Col N="1579" /> if it were omitted here, it would certainly cause confusion in interpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, of course, the chief objection to bringing in the thing at all.  It should have been taken for granted.  However, I will look into that so far as putting in the question of distinction of sex is concerned. It would be very much better if we could define &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; generally and make it quite clear in that clause that there was no distinction to be drawn in the right of citizenship between the sexes.  It might save having to put this in all these clauses.  I have no objection to putting it in, of course, except on the ground of a form for the Constitution.  It was intended to be applied.  I am not, however, prepared to delete the sub-section.</P>

      <P>If the President is not prepared to delete the sub-section, is it not possible that, though formally that sex distinction will not be a bar, in reality it can work out so?  There was, for instance, the 17th amendment to the American Constitution, the famous amendment about race and colour, and so on, adopted after the civil war.  States could not bring in any bar on the ground of colour after the passing of that amendment, but a number of States got over the amendment by a provision of the following kind in their Constitution &mdash; that nobody whose grandfather was a resident of the State and did not vote shall be entitled to vote.  That did not mention colour, but it debarred all coloured people from voting.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that you may lay down that no distinction of sex shall prevail, but, on the ground of difference of functions or capacity, you can easily rule against women quite as effectively as if you never put in the saving clause as suggested.  I think the President will admit that if he holds on to the second portion of the clause it really does not very much matter what he puts into the first, because, under that, his Government or any other Government, can do what they like.</P>

As the President knows, that of course excited alarm, justified or unjustified.  What I want to get at is&mdash;is there anything to be gained by putting it into the Constitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not fully open the amendment of Deputy Mrs. Redmond, in the sense that I only adverted to one particular portion of it. I am sorry Deputy Mrs. Redmond cannot be here to move this, and I only have to do the best I can in somewhat unusual circumstances.  Article 40 is one of a series of Articles which, rightly or wrongly, has certainly caused perturbation in the minds of people who lay very great stress on the importance of women's rights.  My first reading of this Constitution certainly led me to the conclusion that Article 16 was the place where the flaw was really to be found.  The subsequent Articles, Articles 40, 41 and 45; merely seem to reinforce the argument that the omission of the very significant words &ldquo;without distinction of sex,&rdquo; which were in the original Constitution, was deliberate and had some significance. The President has undertaken to put in these words, or, alternatively, to find some sort of definition of &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; which would make it clear that there was, in fact, to be no constitutional distinction permissible as between the sexes.  I do not care whether the words &ldquo;without distinction of sex&rdquo; are put in, or whether some phrase is discovered by the ingenuity of the draftsmen which will meet the President's ideas.  But, even if it is clear by the definition of &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; that they are all equal, the President ought to give some consideration to the question as to whether there is any ground for the fears so widely expressed, and, if there is any ground, whether they cannot be met in some of these Articles that have given rise to the fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, the very Articles which have caused the greatest trouble, apart from the omission of the words &ldquo;distinction of sex,&rdquo; are Articles which do not appear to have any really <Col N="1581" /> practical value in a constitutional instrument.  They are headlines, if you like, statements of general principles, statements of high ideals, to put it at its highest.  You would be inclined, as I was on the Second Reading, to call them something else; but they are there, and they do not appear to me to be essential.  Taking Article 40: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law,&rdquo; we had something similar in the American Constitution which has passed into a joke.</P>
    <P>It was said that so-and-so had not yet been born equal, or declared equal, and he got into the United States of America and had not acquired citizenship.  It is of no practical importance whether we say in the Constitution that everybody is equal before the law.  In my view, it is all rubbish.  What I want to know, as a practical lawyer, is, what is the meaning of it; what practical effect is it going to get?  Assuming this is a statement of fact or a statement of an ideal, where is it going to lead? If I see a law passed subsequently to this Constitution when it becomes operative, am I to look down through that law, acting on behalf of a private client, to see is that in contravention to this very broad statement, that all citizens are equal before the law? Presumably, I am.  I want to know from the President how he proposes to give this declaration practical application. In the second part of the clause he provides that the statement in the first clause &ldquo;shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to difference of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo; I had some few words to say on &ldquo;social function.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I read the second part of that section I rather traced its source to the late Lord Balfour.  I do not know whether the President will accept that proposition or not.  When the late Lord Balfour was trying to cut down the practical effect of the declaration of equality that had been agreed to at the Imperial Conference in 1926, he put in this phrase &ldquo;difference of function,&rdquo; and he said that the British Commonwealth of <Col N="1582" /> Nations were hereby declared to be co-equal, none subordinate to the other, but he said that there were, nevertheless, differences of function. In other words, he said that though we were declared to be equal, nevertheless by reason of the philosophic theory developed by him, they could, in practice, take away altogether the practical effect of the declaration of equality.  We were not taken in by that at the Imperial Conference.  We had no use for high principles and we had no use for grandiloquent statements until we saw them in practical operation, and we succeeded in seeing them in practical operation.</P>
    <P>You have here a phrase about all men and women being equal.  We want to know what is the practical application of that in Article 41.  What does the President mean by saying that the family is the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, possessing &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo;?  I am head of a family and I want to know what my &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; are.  At the moment I do not know what they are.  If I find anybody wanting to filch these &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights,&rdquo; I want to be in the position to prevent him from doing so.  It really requires a certain amount of effort to pronounce these words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible.&rdquo;  I do not know what they are.  What practical effect is going to be given to the declaration that all citizens are equal before the law?  That is a phrase I can understand.  I would urge that some practical effect be given to it.  I can say that I could exercise my practical ingenuity on behalf of a client in boring a hole through an Act that may be passed hereafter by the Parliament here.</P>
    <P>When I ask myself what is the meaning of &ldquo;due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function&rdquo;, I find myself in a difficulty.  So far as the phrase &ldquo;differences of capacity, physical and moral&rdquo; is concerned, it has given rise to well-founded fears in the minds of ladies who have made a special study of their particular rights and particular <Col N="1583" /> duties in connection with the state of public matters.  It has given rise to a grave fear that although the citizens are declared to be equal before the law, yet because enactments may have regard to physical capacity, and because of subsequent, Articles which speak of the inadequate strength of women, the conclusion to be drawn from that is that though men and women are equal before the law, yet this Article recognises physical disability and capacity and allows laws to be passed recognising these capacities. Article 45 speaks of the inadequate strength of women.  The result of that would be to enable some future Government, not the present one, to pass legislation which would, in effect, take away their political or social rights from women as a class or as individuals.</P>

      <P>They overlap each other.  With regard to the question of sex in amendment No. 113, there was some discussion on this matter a few nights ago with regard to another Article, and the President said he was considering in what way he would meet the point that Deputy Mrs. Redmond raised.  He also said that he would further examine the question whether there was any necessity to consider other points that were in that amendment with regard to the clause generally. I do not know whether the President has made up his mind yet or not. When I asked him on the matter he referred me to Section 3.  Whether the personal rights of the citizen are adequately protected by Section 3, I am not sure, or that the protection goes so far as is proposed in this amendment of Deputy Mrs. Redmond. In Article 44, Section 2 (2), there is <Col N="1584" /> this provision: &ldquo;The State guarantees not to endow any religion, and shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.&rdquo;  I am not sure that that gives quite as much protection and freedom as the direct statement here that &ldquo;all citizens without distinction of sex, class or religion shall be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  I would like the President to consider that before he gives his final decision.  It seems a little weaker to prevent positive discrimination against persons.  That is not quite the same as declaring that all are equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of Section 1 of Article 40, to which I have put down my amendment that the three lines&mdash;that is the second sentence of Section 1&mdash;should be omitted, I would like to make a few remarks. In reading this Constitution over, I have again and again been greatly taken with the phrase, which seems to give one something solid to rest upon and something that is really useful as a basis of the State.  But when I read the next sentence, I find that the stability that I thought at first was there was taken away by some qualifications, so that one is left in doubt as to which is the dominant phrase or whether it is the phrase which lays down the general principle or the phrase which states the qualifications. As to the adoption of that principle, what really would be the guiding light of those administering the Constitution in the future?  The President said that one might be willing to give certain powers to one body of persons&mdash;himself and his colleagues &mdash;while being quite unwilling to give such powers to persons in whom one has not confidence.  That is natural human psychology.  I suggest to the President that while one might be quite willing to give the present Government or the present legislators the application of these principles, both the fundamental principle and its qualifications, one might not be willing to give it to unknown legislators in the future.  I am not at all sure that some future Legislature would not think that the intention expressed in the Constitution was not really in <Col N="1585" /> the qualification rather than in the principle.  What the wise framers of this Constitution really mean is that that principle shall not be carried too far, and that we have to watch it very carefully and to direct its activities. I fear very much, with regard to Article 40, that what future legislators would take advantage of in certain circumstances&mdash;I do not say in all circumstances&mdash;would be the second sentence of Section 1 rather than the first sentence.  They would say: &ldquo;Yes; while it is the doctrine and theory that we admit the equality of all persons, yet we must take care that it is not misunderstood, and the really important thing is to have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on in Article 40 we have the statement: &ldquo;Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.&rdquo;  That is definite and intelligible to everyone, but then you have the statement: &ldquo;Orders of Merit may, however, be created.&rdquo;  What are Orders of Merit? To some readers of the Constitution it would appear that what was in the minds of the Government is not so much that titles of nobility shall not be conferred, but that an Order of Merit will be instituted.  Then, again, we have the sentence: &ldquo;No title of nobility or of honour may be conferred on any citizen&mdash;except with the prior approval of the Government.&rdquo;  Time after time we have these sentences that look at first like a precise statement, such as should be in a Constitution, but then they are watered down by some qualifying phrase.</P>
    <P>Most notorious of all, we have later in the same Article references to the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions, and the right of a free Press is preserved as long as it does not differ with the opinions of the Government.  That is the interpretation that will be put upon it by a Legislature in future, not perhaps by the President and his colleagues, but by a less clear-sighted or a less honest Government in the future.  This right is to be preserved in relation to the Press as long as it is not used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  Any Government which is very <Col N="1586" /> sure of itself, of its own rightness, may regard the differences of opinion which members of the Opposition may make use of as being directed towards the undermining of the State; they may hold that what undermines the authority of the Government, by a system of easy logic, undermines the authority of the State.  I only use those arguments to show the sort of qualification which is put on excellent first principles, right through this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a Government in the future composed of people who had not the benefit of hearing those debates during these present weeks were to interpret, as applying to their own legislation, Article 40.  I think the phrasing is so vague that it would be very easy to put any intention into those lines: &ldquo;This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;  Since I read this first I have been puzzling as to what it means.  I can understand what is meant by physical capacity, but I cannot understand what moral capacity means.  I have asked nearly everyone I have met in Leinster House to-day to explain what moral capacity means, but nobody could tell me.  I hope the President will be able to explain it to me.  I have never met the phrase &ldquo;moral capacity,&rdquo; and I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether I can understand it or not, but it does matter that those who may have to interpret the Constitution in the future should be able to understand it on the basis of the document itself, and that seems to be impossible.  We may understand it when the President has given us his explanation, but on the face of the document itself I venture to say that no Legislature in the future or no court could interpret what &ldquo;moral capacity&rdquo; means.  It is proposed to legislate here that the State may in its enactments have due regard to something that nobody understands.</P>

      <P>It is clear, as Deputy Costello pointed out, that many people have been alarmed by this clause. There has not been for many years such a condition of alarm among the women, as to their rights as citizens of the country, as has been aroused by certain clauses in the Constitution. The President smiles, but I do not think that he has been smiling for the last few weeks when he was receiving deputations.  Deputies who have been receiving letters on this subject have not considered it a smiling matter from the point of view of the serious nature of the letters, which show a very widespread and genuine alarm on the part of a large number of the most thoughtful women of the country, the women who have given most thought to matters concerning their own sex.  One should not forget that, although the number of women sent to represent citizens here is not large, women constitute, if not a majority, almost a majority of the citizens, and anything which causes alarm to them should be treated with respect and full consideration.</P>
      <P>The reference to having due regard to differences of physical capacity certainly points to the suggestion that the State, in legislation in the future, is to consider that one of the ruling maxims, where it is to be at all applicable, is to take care that due regard is paid to the physical differences of the sexes.  That is the meaning put on it by many people and, although I do not suggest it is the meaning that is intended, it is open to that interpretation.  One recognises that it is quite proper, if women were to endeavour to undertake certain industries for which they were physically unfitted, that it might be the State's duty to forbid such activity.  There is no danger here that women would go in for coal mining, for example.  It might be necessary in other countries to prohibit such activity on the part of women.  Again, it is not likely to be necessary to prohibit them from going in for such unsuitable work as the stoking of engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in the law of the country <Col N="1588" /> a power residing in one of the Ministers to limit the number of women and prohibit the employment of women in certain industries.  When that was under discussion a year or two ago, the Minister pointed out that the intention was to protect women from being forced into occupations unsuitable for them.  But at once the cat jumped out of the bag when Deputy Norton explained that a use of such a section would be to prevent women competing with men in employment in which they might endanger the occupations of men.  One sees there, when a provision is put before the House by the Minister as a protection, how it may be used by a responsible Party in the House and is interpreted to be a useful weapon to drive women out of certain employment.</P>
    <P>When that happens one can see how such a clause might be applied by a Government in the future which had particular views in regard to the employment of women.  I think these three lines are unfortunate in their vagueness, unfortunate in the lack of meaning in one of the phrases used, and I believe they include what may prove to be a very considerable danger to the women of the country and perhaps to other persons, if the words are allowed to remain in the Constitution in the form in which they stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we will again have to traverse some of the ground we covered in the Second Reading debate; it seems to be inevitable that it should happen.  Let us take, first of all, this question of political rights of women which it has been suggested are being threatened by this Constitution.  I explained already to the House that we had a citizenship law actually an Act which is probably the most advanced in the world, and by women's organisations regarded as perhaps the most satisfactory from their point of view.  We have a complex situation here on account of the taking over under Article 3 of citizens who are entitled to the rights of citizens here, and we do not want to deprive any of these of their rights. The situation in regard to citizenship <Col N="1589" /> was such that it was not easy to put the whole category of citizens into a simple phrase, and we got over the difficulty by adopting one of the methods which you find in Constitutions for dealing with it, namely, that you leave to law the question of the acquisition and loss of citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have not at any time distinguished between the sexes in regard to political rights, I thought that that was a sufficiently well-established principle here and that there was no necessity whatever&mdash;that we should take it for granted&mdash;for putting it into our Constitution in any definite way, until the time might come when it would be easier, if it were then thought desirable, to put the whole thing into a simple phrase.  The phrase &ldquo;distinction of sex&rdquo;, which appears in the old Constitution, I rejected deliberately, on the ground that it was appropriate at a time when women had only just got their political rights, that it was a sort of relic of that time and there was no necessity whatever for introducing it into the Constitution here. However, fears have been excited&mdash;to my mind, needlessly, and, I think, from the point of view of those who hold certain advanced views in regard to women's rights, not wisely&mdash;and I have said quite definitely that if you are not satisfied so far as your political rights are concerned, I am prepared to put in the fullest safeguards in the most convenient way I can.  There was no intention at any time, and I do not think that anybody will suggest that there was, to weaken the position of women, or to interfere with their rights by the way in which this Constitution is drawn up.  The only difference between us is how that can be most appropriately done&mdash;whether it should be done by bringing in what I regard as an objectionable phrase every time we speak of a citizen, &ldquo;everybody without distinction of sex&rdquo;.  Now, we have the suggestion that we should put in &ldquo;without distinction of class or religion&rdquo;.  I am sure that if we continue much longer, some other people will be trying to put in another category and to add to &ldquo;class&rdquo;, which is very difficult to define, and &ldquo;religion&rdquo;, some other additional <Col N="1590" /> class.  I think the whole thing is objectionable, and it is very much better, if we have to deal with the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, to try to get as comprehensive a definition as we can and make it quite clear that that definition is irrespective of sex.  I leave that then.  I take it that we have come to common ground in regard to it and that we need not discuss it further.</P>
    <P>Coming to this particular Article, what is the meaning of it?  Deputy Rowlette says that this Constitution is characterised by indicating certain broad principles and then appearing to qualify them.  That qualification is necessary for truth and for life.  You indicate what is the ideal to be aimed at, but you have also to take into account the fact that very often these principles are stated in a form in which they are not, in fact, true.  All persons are not equal before the law or anywhere else, and it is ridiculous to say they are.  Life is full of inequality.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on what you mean by &ldquo;before the law.&rdquo;  Does it simply mean that when an individual comes up in a court of law the judge is not going to deal differently with him, if he is in one particular class, from the way he would deal with him if he were in another class, from the point of view of being a man or a woman? That is the meaning of it, but I would say that that has not been the only meaning which people have tried to get into that phrase &ldquo;shall be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  The suggestion is that it means that, when you are passing laws, you must not distinguish between the various classes and the various social functions they have, that you must not distinguish between capacities of various kinds.  Of course, that would be ridiculous.  I am not able to trace completely the history of the phrase &ldquo;equal before the law&rdquo; as to its origin and meaning, but if it is interpreted in its narrow sense, that, when a person is up in a court of <Col N="1591" /> justice, the judge and the law ought to deal with that person, irrespective of class or religion, or anything else, then that is a definite, precise and narrow meaning, and if there was common agreement that it was to have that meaning, and that meaning only, we could understand it; but I say it has been strained by certain philosophies and as a result of certain philosophies completely away from that meaning and that in fact, the only basis on which you can take it, the only respect in which people can be taken as completely equal is in the fact that they are human persons, having a certain same nature, certain destinies and so on.  That is the only really true, philosophical way in which you can speak of equality, so that &ldquo;as human persons&rdquo; is put in here deliberately to make the statement a true one and not a false one.</P>
      <P>The next part of it is designed to prevent a straining of what was a narrow expression into another sphere, and to prevent its being used to suggest that we should not have regard in our enactments to differences of capacity, social functions and so on. Of course, we must.  As a matter of fact, we are bound to.  Deputy McGilligan wants to know why &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used.  We are bound to.  If we want to be just, if laws are to be just, they must take note of capacity of various kinds and therefore that statement as it stands is true.  Without this qualification it would be false.  If you say there is no use in it because it has to be modified, my answer is that there is a right use of various things and a wrong use.  We have private property and there are certain qualifications in regard to it; we have liberties of various kinds and there have to be qualifications, because there would be a wrong use of them as well as a right, and, while indicating that the right use of these things must be preserved, we have also to show that the State is not debarred from preventing the wrong use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of this is, to my mind, clear.  I might refer to the suggestion of Deputy Costello about this phrase &ldquo;social function&rdquo; having been got from Lord Balfour.  I have no idea <Col N="1592" /> when Lord Balfour used it, or of the circumstances in which he used it.  He was a philosopher, and it is possible that he took and used a phrase that is commonly found in social philosophy. &ldquo;Social function&rdquo; is a phrase that is commonly found in books on social philosophy.  If you want to distinguish between the various functions&mdash;I can scarcely get a better word&mdash;or activities of various kinds of classes, you can hardly, in our civic life, describe them by a better phrase than &ldquo;social functions.&rdquo;  A judge has one social function.  A bank clerk has another social function.  It is quite clear that you could pass laws which might deal with the position of judges, but which would not apply to those who were not exercising that particular social function, so that the term used was not borrowed from Lord Balfour or anybody else.  It suggested itself because it is appropriate and had been used in this connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disqualifications, these are necessary for truth.  In matters of this sort, you hold up the ideal to be aimed at.  The right of liberty has to be preserved, but a wrong use of liberty must be guarded against.  Equality, as expressed in the first part of this Article, is true, but for people to try to use it to debar the legislature from passing laws which would take account of a difference of social function would be clearly wrong. You have to make this reservation. Deputies say that this Constitution ought to guard against all possible dangers.  It cannot do that.  I agree that, when dangers can be met, they should be met, but there are dangers you cannot meet without running the risk of meeting other dangers.  It is vain for anybody to think that you can, by a Constitution, prevent, as I said here the other day, the passing of unjust and unfair laws.  You cannot. Deputy O'Sullivan gave an example of how an Article of the American Constitution regarding the question of colour was got round.  What should that prove?  The futility of trying, by mere paper enactments, so to speak, to prevent people getting round a provision by ingenious methods.  We can <Col N="1593" /> only try to face what is normal and reasonable.  We cannot hope completely to prevent people by ingenious methods from getting round anything we may write down.  We indicate here the ideal to be aimed at.  I think it is perfectly right.  Nobody has suggested that there is anything wrong in it except Deputy Rowlette.  I pointed out to him that the principle to which he referred would not, in fact, be true in the sense in which it is being strained. I want to make quite certain that if we state a principle, we shall state it in terms that can be maintained as accurate and true.</P>

      <P>We have several instances of it here.  Even if the President did not borrow the phrase from Lord Balfour, it is only natural that he should use it, seeing that it was used by a man given to tight rope walking.  The President promises to look into this Article and I gather that he intends to meet any anxiety there is, so far as political discrimination is concerned.  I have watched in vain for any pronouncement from him that he will do anything to allay the anxiety caused amongst a large number of women as regards economic discrimination.</P>

      <P>The President must know that, at present, these people are much more exercised as a practical proposition with the dangers of economic discrimination on account of sex than they are by the fear of political discrimination.  Many of them do want a Constitutional safeguard, not a mere legal safeguard, for their political position, but they are much more afraid of what may happen in practice as to the taking away of opportunities of work.  They take Article 40 and, being sensible people, they read the different provisions of the Constitution together and see certain pointers in them and in the speeches of the President&mdash;what he puts into his speeches and what he leaves out.  He is willing to meet them on the question of political discrimination but I see no effort on his part to make clear that there is to be no economic discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> Taking Articles 40 and 41, and that extraordinary Article, 45, they will naturally assume an effort will be made to drive them out of employment. As late as to-day, I heard that certain bodies are already taking steps in that direction, believing that they are carrying out the excellent principies laid down in Article 45.  It is easy to lay down general principles, as the President knows, but once you lay down general principles of that kind, you have practically to legislate them out of existence in the next paragraph, so that, undoubtedly, the dilemma presented by Deputy Rowlette is a practical one.</P>
    <P>These women are not all of the class who hold advanced views.  Many of them are moderate, conservative women who hold views which are by no means advanced.  They are, however, gravely perturbed about the economic possibilities&mdash;more so than they are about the political possibilities. Steps are to be taken so that the inadequate strength of women shall not be called upon for too much work.  How are you going to provide, say, for a woman with a family who has not a husband?  Are you going to provide not merely a pension for her, but a sufficiently adequate pension, so that she will have no temptation to work or to supplement it by doing work?  If you provide a pension of that kind, are you further going to take steps to see that she will be prevented from doing work?  Is it only against the women who, from economic necessity, are compelled to do work, that Article 45 points?  Suppose the State is in a position to make adequate provision for women in that position, it will cost the State an immense sum.  Let us take another case: the case of a woman with a large family who has a husband.  The husband does not work.  As the President knows, that occurs very frequently. What is the State to do there?  Is it to provide that family also with a pension? Supposing the husband does not work, is he to be put in jail for not working, and is the family to be supported in his absence?  The President may say that these are only pointers. It seems to me that women who are <Col N="1596" /> uneasy about this have great justification for their uneasiness, and that the tendency of Articles 40, 41 and 45 can only mean one thing&mdash;more and more prevention of women getting positions of employment.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any other meaning.  I think a great deal of the trouble arises from the rather amateur metaphysical habit of the President putting down general principles&mdash;vague, philosophic general principles such as the 18th century one about all men being equal.  He knew that was wrong and he tried to qualify it.  He gets into all sorts of trouble in his efforts to satisfy some vague philosophic urge, activism of some kind, but certainly not based on any sound thought-out system.  The President has here a number of Articles dealing with private property. As I said on the Second Reading, each sentence if taken in the abstract is perfectly sound.  Both the principle and the reservation are perfectly sound.  But what they all mean, or what they commit anybody to, is what I cannot grasp.  Suppose, for the moment, I was a Communist in this country, what is the first thing I would do?  I would set out to condemn the proposition that private property is theft.</P>

      <P>Having done that, I would act on the principle and the reservations here and carry out the full Communist policy in practice. However excellent these principles may be, and so far as I can see every one of them taken individually seems to be sound, what I fear is that as a piece of legislation they carry us nowhere.  I fear they will have the further effect that once you lay down principles such as you have in Article 40, Section 1, paragraph 2, and such as you have in Article 45, that a number of people will think that all the necessary work is done: that they can lay down their hands and need do nothing else.  When we come to Article 45 we may have an explanation of what it means.  So far as the position of women is concerned, and taking the whole drift of the Articles I have mentioned&mdash;40, 41 and 45&mdash;and also the President's attempt to explain them&mdash;to explain them as distinct from repeating them&mdash;I cannot understand how those who are interested in employment for women can be anything except perturbed.  The readiness of the President to meet the political discrimination, and his silence so far as the economic discrimination is concerned, will naturally strengthen that particular perturbation.</P>

      <P>Can we deal with these Articles one by one now after we have had these general disquisitions? I say that there is not anywhere in the Constitution any suggestion that a woman is to be prevented from going into any type of employment, not a single suggestion.  That is all that I am going to say about the general thing until we come to each particular Article.  There is no reference to women in this section.  If, at the moment, you had a society in which you had men only, this section is necessary, but, of course, you have people who take it out of its context and apply it in a special connection. If we make the first statement at all, the second is necessary.  There is no reference to women in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with the <Col N="1598" /> greatest care and with an impartial mind to the statement of the President in reply to what was said by Deputy Costello and Deputy Rowlette as to the alarm which has been caused in the community by this Article.  I am afraid that the statement which he has made will do nothing at all to allay that alarm.  The President, no doubt, has said that he will make provision afterwards for the part of the Article that is dealt with by the amendment of Deputy Mrs. Redmond.  But there is a further portion of that Article, paragraph 1 of Article 40, covered by Deputy Rowlette's amendment.  It proposes to delete the qualifying phrase following the opening statement that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  He proposes to delete the words that:</P>
      <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
      <P>Now, in the last 40 or 50 years a great many occupations have been thrown open to women.  The number has increased year by year as the industrial life of the country has developed. What is there to prevent the Legislature, if this qualifying clause is allowed to stand, from enacting that women shall not in future be admitted to certain named occupations.</P>

      <P>What I am interested in is this, and the President has not answered it: If that phrase there is allowed to stand in the Constitution, what is to prevent the Legislature, from within the Constitution, legislating to drive women out of occupations in which they are already engaged?  Is it not open for the Legislature to say that, having regard to the <Col N="1599" /> differences of capacity, such-and-such an occupation should be carried on solely by men, and that women should be excluded from it?  That is my criticism of this thing, and I take it, from the President's last remark, that he intends to allow that phrase to stand and that he is going to refuse to accept Deputy Rowlette's amendment.  As I say, once that Article is allowed to be inserted in the Constitution, the Legislature, any day, can pass legislation to exclude women from any or all of the occupations which they now share with men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the President to reconsider the wording of that very dubious clause which says: &ldquo;This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;  Perhaps I am thick-headed, but yet I did read ethics when I was young, and I must say that I found great difficulty in understanding what was meant by the words &ldquo;moral capacity.&rdquo;  I am really rather proud, however, that I guessed what the President meant.  I guessed that he meant the difference in mental capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that is what I guessed was meant, and I also guessed that, in referring to physical capacity, the President was not really applying it to the difference in physical capacity between men and women, but perhaps to the difference in physical capacity as between men and boys&mdash; the question of age and so on.  When you come, however, to the question of social function, that seems to me to indicate a difference of sex, and perhaps the President can explain that. I think that, perhaps, the President was carried away by a desire not to found a platonic republic, so to speak, in which there would be no differences, physical or social, recognised between men and women; and, of course, there was also the desire to preserve the family as the unit and to preserve all the other adjuncts of our present Constitution. I feel sure that the idea of the President was that this Article was <Col N="1600" /> the cradle, so to speak, of the family, but I do wish he would reconsider the wording of those three lines, to which I have referred, which, to a very ordinary person such as I am, are ambiguous.  I am not speaking with any desire to obstruct, or to make vexatious criticisms just for the sake of criticism, but I do think that these words are ambiguous and that they will be misinterpreted by ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, Sir, that from the very beginning I cannot get myself into any sympathy at all with the criticisms that have been made on the ground that this has reference to sex.  As I have said&mdash;and I cannot put it in any stronger way than this&mdash; if we happened, for the time being, at any rate, to be a community entirely composed of men&mdash;a community in which there were no women&mdash;and if we wanted to state this principle and to apply it, we would have to state it in the form in which it is stated here, or in some almost exactly similar form. Surely nobody is going to suggest that the phrase &ldquo;social function&rdquo; only has reference to the sexes?  We ought to understand, in general, the meaning of these terms, and I am surprised at anybody confounding the terms &ldquo;mental&rdquo; and &ldquo;moral&rdquo; in this connection.  As a matter of fact, I think that, in the old Royal University, there was a subject known as Mental and Moral Philosophy.  In other words, the two were kept separate, and were regarded as not meaning the same thing.  The terms &ldquo;mental&rdquo; and &ldquo;moral&rdquo; mean different things, and we should not confound them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, leaving that aside, and coming back, to the question of this second part: let us deal with it this way.  Suppose that we eliminated it, what is going to be the result?  Is its elimination going to prevent the Legislature from doing certain things, or is it not?  If its elimination is not going to prevent the Legislature from doing certain things, then it must be held that it is contained, in the first part, that the Legislature may do these things.  If the leaving of that out would prevent the Legislature from <Col N="1601" /> doing these things, then I say that this Legislature should not be prevented from doing these things, because it must be permitted to do these things if it is to function properly.  It must be permitted to take cognisance in its laws of the different capacities in its citizens; otherwise, legislation would become impossible.  There is no halfway in this.  Either you have to take the whole thing out&mdash;if you are to reason closely at all&mdash;or you have to leave the whole thing in; and from either point of view, if you leave it all out, then obviously the Legislature can do these things because there is no question of prohibition of any kind. Therefore, I think that the people who are arguing along those lines are arguing on a completely unsound basis, and I think that they have not a leg to stand on in their criticism of that Article.</P>
    <P>These words were not chosen haphazardly. They were chosen with very great care, and they were chosen in order to rectify the wrong use and the wrong statement of certain principles, which contain a germ of truth in them, but which can be wrongly and falsely applied.  What we have here is that wherever in this Constitution you have statements of principle, such as, for instance, the liberty of the citizen, that liberty must be upheld when it is rightly exercised, but the community must protect itself against the improper use of that liberty.  Who is going to say that the community should not protect itself against the abuse or the wrong use of that liberty of the citizen?  Are we, then, in order to try to face life and truth as it is, to leave the principle out altogether?  I say that we should not.  I say that we are doing a good thing in holding certain things up as a virtue to be aimed at and then indicating where the wrong practice or the misapplication or the misunderstanding of the virtue becomes an abuse.  That is what is done here.  It is necessary either to put in all these qualifications or to wipe them out.  I can understand Deputies saying that they should be wiped out, although I do not agree with that; but I think we are doing useful work in clarifying these principles and enabling them to be understood <Col N="1602" /> properly.  I think we are doing useful work in holding up what is the virtue to be aimed at, then indicating that these principles can be wrongly applied and can be abused, and making it possible for the State to take the necessary action to prevent the abuses.  As I have said, I think that the opponents of this Article, in their criticisms, have not a leg to stand on, either from the point of view of women's rights or any of the other points of view they have put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to two attempts by the President to explain this, and I do not know if I find myself in a different position to anybody else in this House in that the matter has become more and more clouded, the more the President has spoken.  He gave me one clue to his attitude on this, but not an explanation of the matter that follows.  Apparently, the President believes that he has met arguments based upon the language used here and the decisions this language may give rise to, by dealing with one matter&mdash;the matter of sex disqualification that may be read into this.  The President evidently feels that he has met that argument by saying that if we were dealing entirely with a male community here, we still would have to write in this Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, we must remember, comes from the President who drew up this Constitution, not merely not putting in equality for the sexes into the Constitution but putting in equality for nobody.  The President is quite right.  Not merely was there no question of discrimination of the sexes, but there were no constitutional rights with regard to citizenship introduced at all.  There were none, and there are not any yet.  Anything that is in the way of a right dependent upon citizenship, is to be a matter of legal determination.  So far as this Constitution stands in regard to anything in the way of a constitutional right, if there be any such in the Constitution, no man or woman can take it to himself or to herself as a constitutional right dependent upon citizenship because as the Constitution was introduced, when you look at <Col N="1603" /> Article 16, you find that every thing with regard to the determination of citizenship shall be a determination of law.  Having that outlook, the President can rightly say: &ldquo;Oh, I can deal with the sex matter, because even if this was a male community in its entirely, we would have to write in these things in the same way.&rdquo; The President says that not merely has he definitely to allow for inequalities but he has to command inequalities.  There is nothing in the Constitution attaching to citizenship which forbids it.</P>
    <P>Let us leave this matter of sex out and let us consider the question of differences&mdash;differences made as amongst citizens.  Will the President tell me is there any difference between the first phrase in this Article 40, sub-section (1) as it stands and another phrase as I shall put it?  The phrase in the Draft reads: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  Can we rewrite that to say: &ldquo;All citizens shall not be held equal before the law except in so far as they are human persons&rdquo;? Is that a correct exposition of the Article?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, later.  I just want to get that clear.  We start off with that clear declaration about all our citizens&mdash;in the interests of &ldquo;truth and light,&rdquo; which is the President's phrase.  Let us say that all our people are befogged with phrases <Col N="1604" /> about citizens being equal, dug up from ancient philosophies.  Let us assume that all citizens are not equal except in so far as these words &ldquo;as human persons&rdquo; will regulate the matter.  Let us see what that means. Possibly an explanation will be given later but I do not know what it means now.  Having said that, even having put it in a positive form, which does seem harping back to ancient philosophies, we go on to state:</P>
      <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose we had put the first phrase in the form I have suggested and then continue on in this form: &ldquo;Consequently, the State in its enactments must have regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;  Is that what the President thinks is required for truth and light?  Is that what the President would consider as the real situation in the country?  One of the things that rather amazes me is this.  If this phrase, &ldquo;all citizens shall be held equal before the law&rdquo;&mdash;omitting &ldquo;as human persons&rdquo;&mdash;is wrong and will lead to wrong judicial decisions, why has it been adopted in so many of the Constitutions of the world?  Again, I cannot say that I have searched any big number of Constitutions in regard to this point but, in any I have searched, I have failed to find any which contains this interpolation, &ldquo;as human persons.&rdquo;  I wonder can the President say if there is one which has that phrase in it?  I do not know of any but I do know of many which have the simple phrase: &ldquo;all citizens shall be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  That has been brought into some of the newer Constitutions. It is certainly in some of the very ancient Constitutions and in some of the not-so-ancient Constitutions. It has stood the test of judicial decisions and has not occasioned any embarrassment in the passing of laws. Is there any example anywhere of the use of these words and, if not, why was it thought necessary to put them in here?  The President asks: &ldquo;Suppose we leave out the second paragraph.&rdquo;<Col N="1605" /> I want to say, suppose we leave out the phrase, &ldquo;as human persons,&rdquo; what is the situation then?  Does it mean in the passage of ordinary laws here, that men and women or that all men, indifferent to age and everything else, must be put on the same footing because if that is going to be the case the President will say that clearly that should not be so?</P>
    <P>Again, when I look for examples in other Constitutions, I find that if there is a declaration of equality in a Constitution which recognises any differences, it is done in this form: that the State shall pay attention to the differences so as to bring the people on a footing of equality.  That is not what is here.  Would the President face this point: cannot the Government take that phrase in paragraph 2, as has been suggested by Deputy Rice&mdash;if there is a Government that wants to get women excluded from certain professions, to get men of a certain age excluded from certain walks of life, or to get men over a certain age excluded from certain walks in life&mdash;and say: &ldquo;We cannot merely do that under the law, but we have a constitutional pointer that it should be done.&rdquo; It may be that it is merely the tendency of the phrase that is wrong but undoubtedly that tendency prevails through all these fundamental rights.  The President told us that he deliberately abandoned the phrase &ldquo;without distinction of sex.&rdquo;  The explanation he gave must have been excogitated here in the House because I do not think anybody could have seriously thought over the matter and then delivered himself of that explanation. He withdrew it, he said, because it was a relic of the time when these rights were not given.  Why not withdraw all these other phrases that are relics of the time in which the rights to which they relate were not given? After all, the liberty of the person&mdash; freedom of speech, the freedom of the Press&mdash;these things are only relics of the time when they were first put in. They were put in as signs of the victory which had been achieved for these rights.</P>
    <P>The President may tell us with regard to the liberty of the person that that day is long past, with regard <Col N="1606" /> to the free expression of opinion that that day is long past, and with regard to the freedom of conscience that that is certainly long past.  Why do we carry in these phrases, these relics of a time when these rights were not enjoyed and wipe out this phrase about distinction of the sexes which, if it is a relic of another time, is not so old as is the case in some of the other phrases which have been carried in? That is the tendency which I complain of in the Constitution.  There are many Constitutions where there are detailed particulars as to what limitation may be put upon a general principle, and where that limitation is left for the determination of ordinary law, but there is no Constitution that I can remember which has the limitations phrased so as to direct more attention to the limitations than to the enunciation of the principle.  The principle is generally shot out in a clear-cut fashion; the limitations are put in apologetically.  In this Constitution it is the limitations that are blazoned forth; the principle is almost hidden. There is much more emphasis put on the limitation, on what must be done so that the right will not be abused. Naturally, attention will be much more riveted on that, and naturally if this matter ever comes for interpretation before a court it is a necessary consequence that the principle will suffer a great lessening under this Constitution in comparison with others where it is shot out as an important matter.</P>
    <P>The simplest example of what I am saying is this phrase that we have here.  I think the majority of the Constitutions contain nothing more in regard to this one phrase&mdash;there are undoubtedly limitations&mdash;than this statement: &ldquo;all citizens are or shall be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  There is none of this interpolation; there is a direct phrase.  This phrase is put in here, whatever it means, and it certainly has the effect of lessening the importance of the clear-cut declaration.  Unless it has a meaning, and a meaning that has some sense and value, this interpolated phrase should be dropped. You will then get a clear-cut phrase, but you have already weakened the principle by putting in those three <Col N="1607" /> words, which are meaningless, I think, to most people in the House.  I complain then that in paragraph 2, Article 40 (1) there is too definite a point with regard to what ought to be looked upon as an accidental matter&mdash; something that will be met from time to time.  Here is this definite statement directing everybody's attention to the fact, and more or less ordering that laws, when they are being made, must have regard to those things.  The majority of the laws do not have regard to those things.  One can say that inside certain areas covered by laws there will be attention paid to this type of thing, but there is a vast area outside in which that is not required. This, in regard to all law, calls attention to that.  It directs everybody's attention, first and foremost, to this matter of distinction, and makes the distinction far more important than the principle.</P>

      <P>The difference between this Constitution and the old Constitution is that the old Constitution did not and could not have stood the test of time.  It set forth certain principles which were wrongly stated and were inaccurate and could not stand up to the stress of practical application in life.  We had an apology being made for it here at one time when the matter of amending it was being discussed.  The apology was that that was done at a certain time after the war when all those fine principle were being talked about; that there was a certain amount of window dressing in it, and when it came to confront the realities of life all that window dressing, all those frills&mdash;I think that was the word used&mdash;had to be abandoned. The attempt in this Constitution is to state principles which are accurate, and to design it so that it will stand up to the practical test of rigid application&mdash;the test of life, as I have said. The others were not true; they were false, and things that are false will be proved to be false in application afterwards in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the phrase that Deputy McGilligan wants us to take, that all citizens shall be held equal before the law, is in itself inaccurate.  It <Col N="1608" /> is not true.  Even a judge, if there are two people of different moral capacity, is not going to deal with them in the same way.  The whole question of the moral capacity will be taken into account.  A child, for instance, although he is a citizen, will not be held responsible in the same way.  But that is not the precise direction in which I was anxious to avoid misunderstanding.  We could run a certain amount of risk in that direction.  The direction in which I was anxious to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding and misinterpretation was in the question of legislation. The broad principle that all people are equal is manifestly absurd, because they are not.  Then there is the question of equality before the law, in the sense that there would be even-handed justice dealt out, which is, perhaps, the nearest sense in which the phrase could be applied. I say that not only must permission be given to the Legislature to do those things, but it would be clearly wrong to have legislation which would affect one section in the same way as another section, even though those two sections had quite different social functions, quite different capacities. Deputy McGilligan, when he started, said &ldquo;Let us phrase this differently.&rdquo; I am sure he knows perfectly well that there is a difference between a positive statement and a negative one. What is here is that citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  You cannot put that in the negative form and say that that means all citizens shall not be held equal, except as human persons.</P>

We are not concerned to consider whether in other respects also individuals shall be held equal before the law.  We have here a very definite positive statement on one respect in which they certainly shall be held equal before the law.  The other part is absolutely necessary to prevent its being carried over into a wider field and misapplied, and the two together have simply the effect of giving you an accurate statement of principle which is inaccurately put down in other cases.</P>

      <P>At the opening of this debate, I asked a question of the President as a practical lawyer: What is the purpose or intendment of this particular clause of this Article?  I have not yet heard any answer to that question. I do not know what it is intended to effect.  I do not know what it is intended to mean, and anything that has been said up to date has not enlightened me in any way on that matter.  The President said the old Constitution set forth a number of principles which were wrongly stated. It is a remarkable thing that he borrowed a very large quantity of the statements of principle that were embodied in the old Constitution.</P>

He says that this Constitution attempts to state general principles as a headline. Does he intend this Constitution to <Col N="1610" /> contain an exhaustive enumeration of all the general principles that ought to guide us in our legislative, social and all other activities of the State?  If he does not intend that this Constitution should contain an exhaustive enumeration of high-sounding general principles, how is he going to select which principle is of importance and which principle is not of importance, and as between these principles which are of importance, how is he going to select which one is more important than the other?  Why should he not set out in the Constitution the Ten Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount?  Why select one or two principles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Why have we not got an enumeration of the principles of Christian charity or of the principle &ldquo;thou shalt not steal&rdquo; embodied? Here we have a principle that, as far as I could gather, the President himself does not particularly know what it means, what is its scope or intent. If he does, he has not succeeded in conveying to the House what precisely it does mean.  Leaving aside the consideration of what it means, I want to know what it is intended to effect as a practical proposition.  The nearest he got towards satisfying my mind of what it was intended to effect <Col N="1611" /> was inequality of the administration of justice.  Surely that could have been effected by a very much clearer excursion into amateur metaphysics than appears in clause 1 of Article 4. If this has any practical application whatever I await with interest the President telling us what is intended as a practical proposition.  He indicated, as far as I could follow him, that it was desirable to set forth a headline and, he took as the headline, the liberty of the citizen.  I will not use the phrase he misled himself into using &ldquo;the liberty of the citizen.&rdquo;  It is an extraordinary and a remarkable thing that while we have this very vague statement of the inequality of the human being, with limitations tacked on in the second paragraph, that when we come to the statement of principle of human liberty we find the solemn words of Article 6 of the old Constitution omitted, &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable.&rdquo;  I assume, because the liberty of the person is not inviolable the President left them out.  He said he was setting forth and holding out principles, but when I look at clause 4 of the Article, where the liberty of the citizen is held up, we find, so far from being held up, the words in the original Constitution, &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable&rdquo;, are left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in practice, that general principle, that the liberty of the person is inviolable, was transgressed, as the President by interpretation would seem to suggest, by Article 2A, the so-called Public Safety Act, he had an unique opportunity to copper fasten the inviolability and liberty of the citizen and to prevent any legislature from again enacting Article 2A.  He did not do so, as we heard earlier in the debate this evening.  If, as I think, this clause of the Article dealing with so-called equality of rights of all citizens as human persons means anything as a practical proposition then, having regard to the impediment contained in the second paragraph, it is going to do damage.  The President said that the clause would have to be inserted if we were dealing with a Constitution for an entirely male community. <Col N="1612" /> The President sometimes in the course of frivolous moments has either seen or read of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, <i>Princess Ida.</i>  Perhaps he would in his spare moments, when relieved from the task of drafting the Constitution, draft a comic opera consisting entirely of males, on the lines of <i>Princess Ida</i> and, as an interlude or a prologue, he might draft a Constitution for an entirely male community.  We are not dealing with a male community. We are dealing with a community comprising males and females.  I am not a statistician, but I have a sort of recollection that in this country, as in most countries, there are more females than males, and therefore we are passing a Constitution for a country in which there are more females than males.</P>
    <P>But we find a clause in the Article intending to cut down the statement of general principle in the first part, providing that the State in its enactment is to have regard to the differences of physical capacity, and in a subsequent declaration to the inadequate strength of women.  As a mere effort in the construction of a document anyone is entitled to assume that the second part of the Article enables a law to be passed, and specifically declares it not to be unconstitutional, which will take account of the physical difference and capacity arising solely from sex.  The President says that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent women getting work equally with men.</P>
    <P>I agree.  But there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent a law being passed, the object of which would be to prevent women from getting work equally with men, and having the same equality of opportunity of getting work as men.  That is the objection to this clause, that it is an incitement or an invitation to a future Legislature to do what I have indicated.  It is open to that construction no matter what the President may say.  That construction is strengthened by the phrase in the Article dealing with the inadequate strength of women.  If it is to be open to that construction, and if it has given rise to grave fears amongst a certain section of the community, then I think the President or <Col N="1613" /> his advisers are not so devoid of ideas as not to be able to meet and allay these fears.</P>

      <P>I do not know if there is any use arguing again on this question.  I suppose there is no use in doing so.  Because of the attitude the Opposition has taken, it is clear they do not want to see the position. The Deputy taunted me with taking out a certain phrase.  If there is one thing more than another that the Deputy should have kept away from, it is on this question of the inviolability of the person.  I think the phrase in the old Constitution was &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable.&rdquo; With that in one part of the Constitution, the Deputy as Attorney-General advised the Government that they should bring into the same Constitution a previous Article, Article 2A, which not merely runs a coach-and-four through the Article, but is in violent contrast and conflict with it.  The second part is &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable.&rdquo;  Here is a summary of Article 2A, if the Deputy would like to have a look at some of his provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a summary of it here in case I had difficulty in remembering what its provisions are. At any rate, the fact is that you had in the old Constitution phrases like, &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable,&rdquo; and you had Article 2A side by side with that.</P>

      <P>What I am trying to prevent in the Constitution is having that sort of window-dressing which was in the old Constitution. Wherever we have made statements here, side by side with them we have put the limitations which are absolutely necessary.  If the Deputy were <Col N="1614" /> going to be Attorney-General and anxious to see peace and order preserved in the community, would he like to have to deal with a Constitution in which you had nothing else but &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable&rdquo;?  He would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he would not&mdash;not for one moment.  I can imagine that if the Deputy were advising a Government who were bringing in a Constitution with that phrase, &ldquo;the liberty of the person is inviolable,&rdquo; he would be the first to enter a <i>caveat.</i>  If he would not be the first, I am certain he would be hotfoot after the Department of Justice.  Let us be realists and try to act fairly with regard to these matters.  There is a certain value in the statement of these principles, so long as we state them accurately. There is a certain value in having them in the Constitution, provided they are put in such a way as will not prevent the Legislature from functioning as it ought to function in the interests of the community as a whole. That is the defence I have for putting in these words.  They are met with in other Constitutions.  Their omission would be the subject of question. We have put them in in the only sense I can see in which they are accurate and true.  If the Deputy says: &ldquo;They give such freedom to the Legislature that the courts will not be able to interfere with the Legislature,&rdquo; I can only say that, as long as the Legislature acts properly, the courts ought not to interfere with the Legislature; as long as it carries out the functions necessary for the life of the community, then the courts ought not to interfere.  For the courts to interfere in such a case would be harmful and would be to the public detriment.  As I have said, there is really no use in arguing the matter further.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That lines 1 and 2 of Section 1 stand part of the Article.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think this whole section of Article 40 would be better away.  I am against having either titles of nobility or orders of merit.  I think it is very difficult to draw a hard and fast distinction between the two.  I think orders of merit are open to the same objection as titles of nobility, even if you can succeed in distinguishing between the two.  Inevitably if they exist a certain number of them are given to undeserving persons, and we can get along very well without them.  People should be rewarded for their services to the community by the general regard and respect of the community, better than in any other way.  But apart from the question of principle, the section seems to me very badly drawn.  There are two sub-sections, the first saying that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.  Orders of merit may, however, be created.  I object to the sub-section.  There is the failure to distinguish between titles of nobility and orders of merit.  The second sub-section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No title of nobility or of honour may be conferred on any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is taken almost word for word from the old Constitution, but, none the less, that does not make it a satisfactory piece of legislation, because how are you going to stop foreign Governments from conferring titles of nobility or honour on one of your citizens?  You cannot legislate for foreign Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested in one of the amendments that if it were desired to do it at all it would have to be done by prohibiting <Col N="1618" /> a citizen from accepting such an honour.  I think it will be recognised by anybody who looks attentively at this section of Article 40 and considers it, that it is unsatisfactory from the purely mechanical point of view.  First it does not accomplish what it sets out to accomplish, and in the second place, the real effect of the whole section is not to rule out titles of nobility so much as to give an impetus to the founding of orders of merit.  I personally think that the founding of orders of merit is undesirable.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to prohibit these things it is quite clear that it is not sufficient simply to eliminate this Article, because that would leave it open to the Legislature in future to do it.

      <P>We are not beginning the world to-day, and we are not starting off with this Constitution. There was a certain position which we have taken over, and there was a prohibition in regard to the first part in the old Constitution.  If we omitted, under these circumstances, putting a similar clause here, it would be suggested that it was omitted for a special reason.</P>

      <P>The second part was able to cover a lot, under the circumstances. The second part was intended to be sufficient, and, in practice, I think it was found to be sufficient too, but the form in which we have it here is very much more definite.  I want to say that I agree with the Deputy with regard to the words &ldquo;accepted by&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;conferred on.&rdquo;  Perhaps I will deal with that first.  I agree it is an improvement on the position to put in <Col N="1619" />&ldquo;accepted by,&rdquo; and I accept that amendment.  We will see it is incorporated. I do not know whether we are accepting it precisely in that form, but I think we can, almost in identical terms.</P>
      <P>Governments do not do those things without consulting each other.  There is a certain courtesy that is observed between Governments in a case like that, and if there was a proposition to confer any honours on one of our citizens, we would be communicated with.  If by any chance, through some oversight or otherwise, there was a neglect to inform us of that, we would let the Government in question know what our constitutional position was. That was how it was operated in the past, but I agree with the Deputy that it is better to have it in the form which he suggests, and I am accepting that suggestion.  In the first part there is a positive prohibition, so the Deputy has no fault to find with that except that it is unworthy of the Constitution. I think I have told him that the omission would be misrepresented or misunderstood, so it is necessary to have it.</P>
      <P>The next point has reference to orders of merit.  &ldquo;Orders of merit may, however, be created.&rdquo;  Deputy McGilligan took an unwarrantable liberty with language when he said: &ldquo;Orders of merit shall, however, be created.&rdquo;  It does not mean that at all.  It is quite possible, for example, that we might take up the line, if a law was suggested by anybody, that it would be inadvisable; but in a number of republican countries orders of merit have been established, and they have been found useful.  I am not saying that there are not abuses.  In fact, our trouble with all this is that the right things can be wrongly used, and you have to ask yourself the question whether you are making it possible to use the thing at all, whether abuse is so likely that you forego the possibility of using it rightly because it might be used wrongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel, as different views might be entertained on this matter, that we should make it clear in the Constitution that this was not prohibited. <Col N="1620" /> There might be the impression that even orders of merit were not to be created or could not be created, so this is an effort to leave the position open in the respect in which it seems right that it should be left open.  We do not know the circumstances in which it might be considered desirable, in the interests of the community, that orders of merit should be created.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says there is no clear distinction between titles of nobility and orders of merit.  I am not in a position to say straight off that you might not get them to shade into each other, but I think there is, roughly, a clear line of demarcation.  One indicates classes of society and the other indicates something that is present, that does not indicate any gradation as regards society.  I would say, roughly, that that is the way it strikes me.  I think there is not likely to be confusion between orders of merit and titles of nobility.  I think, in France, titles of nobility cannot be conferred.</P>

The question is whether, in regard to things that have been found useful, we should deny the use of them for all time and exclude them.  I must not be understood as advocating this.  I do not see any reason why we should establish such an order, but I do not want it to be argued from this context that if at any time it was required in the interests of the community to establish such orders, that they could not be established.</P>

I should like to say that nobody who is familiar with France would deny that the situation there with regard to the use of orders of merit, such as the <i>Legion d'honneur</i>, <Col N="1621" /> is a crying scandal and they have done infinitely more harm than good. I think there are plenty of cases where it would be hard to establish a sharp distinction between orders of merit and titles of nobility.  What would the President consider the English order of merit or title of nobility, whichever it is, Dame Lloyd George?  Which would that be?</P>

      <P>If so, how are you going to distinguish between Dame Lloyd George and Sir Somebody, who has been made a Knight because of useful services at some time?  I think the distinction is really impossible to sustain.  Here is a question that I think might be reasonably put with regard to the second clause: What is the position with regard to the Irish citizen who is serving in the British Army and wins the Distinguished Service Order in some frontier scrap in India?  Is the President going to forbid him to accept that?  Under the old Constitution, if I remember rightly, the prohibition was against the conferring of orders for services in some way connected with the internal affairs of the Irish Free State.  That was more reasonable.  Are you going to say if an Irish citizen goes into the British Army and distinguishes himself on active service that he is going to be punished in some way for accepting the Distinguished Service Order, unless he applies for permission first from the Government of this country?</P>

      <P>Some of us are inclined to agree with the President.  I see a difference between titles of nobility and orders of merit.  I do not quite agree with Deputy MacDermot in thinking that the line of demarcation is not very clear, but as regards the second sentence, I am rather dubious about it.  Does the President think that he is marking a claim, that if he did not put this into the Constitution it would not be possible in future to establish orders of merit?  Does he not think that the insertion of it here is rather a suggestion, or a promise, that at some future date such orders will be <Col N="1622" /> established?  I am very dubious about the value of such orders.  I know the abuses attaching to them and I agree with Deputy MacDermot there.  I think that one of the advantages which the great Republic across the water has is that it has not got such orders.  They lead to infinite intriguing and wirepulling, and I should be very sorry to see such a practice introduced into our little State.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I asked myself the very same question, because it is only in the context of &ldquo;all citizens as human persons shall be held equal,&rdquo; as a rule, that you have this question of whether you shall or shall not have titles of nobility, and so on.  It breaks the whole sequence of the Article.  To be quite frank, the reason I put it in was mainly because the omission of it would be seized upon by people to suggest all sorts of things.  The second part is, I think, right and proper and so far as the first part is a prohibition, I do not think there can be any harm in it.  With regard to the second part, that orders of merit may, however, be created, it <Col N="1623" /> might be omitted.  My own impression would be that that would not debar the Legislature from establishing at any future time such orders, if it were thought desirable and right to do so.  Whether in this particular form it is an encouragement or not depends on whether you try to interpret a lot of these second paragraphs as indicating something as a positive suggestion, whereas they rather indicate something to prevent a misunderstanding by too sweeping an application of the first part.  What I want to secure is that titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.  I do not think there is any likelihood of the State doing that, but still, some people might think there was and they would like to have the prohibition.  I think that those who do not want it, but who do not think it is necessary to put it in, ought to give way and agree that it should be stated&mdash;in other words, that we should hold to the position that titles of nobility shall not be conferred.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part, dealing with orders of merit, I have an absolutely open mind, and if I am assured by the lawyers that it would not debar the State in future from creating such orders, I would be quite happy to omit it.  I want to make certain that this context will not suggest that orders of merit could not be created.  I will consider the point if there is any disposition on the part of members of the House to omit it. The second part of the Article would read: &ldquo;No title of nobility or honour ....&rdquo;  and that would exclude any possibility from outside.  It has been said that after &ldquo;titles of nobility&rdquo; we should put in &ldquo;or of honour&rdquo; in the first section and that in the second section we should say, &ldquo;no title of nobility or honour may be accepted by any citizen without the prior approval of the Government.&rdquo;  I think that is right.  To deal with the question which Deputy MacDermot raised, of an Irishman in some foreign service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I say it.  Suppose it was proposed to confer a title of nobility or of honour on an Irishman in a foreign service&mdash;the service of Spain, for example.  It could not be accepted without the prior approval of the Government by that citizen if he wanted to remain, so to speak, a citizen and to avoid penalties, if there were any penalties or sanctions to be imposed later so as to make good this provision.  The Government of the day then would have to use its common sense and to see whether it was to the interest of the community as a whole that this honour should be accepted by that individual, or whether it was just and right or not.  It would lie with the Government of the day to make up its mind as to whether it would agree that an Irish citizen should accept such an honour or not. That is the situation as it will be, if you pass this, I take it.</P>

      <P>That would be a matter for law.  It would depend on whether occasions arose in which it was necessary.  I take it that if there was any attempt on the part of individual citizens to ignore this constitutional provision, you could impose sanctions by law afterwards, but there is no need to anticipate that.  We may not have any occasion at all to use such sanctions, and, if we do not, it is all right.  In case we should, we will be able to do it.</P>

      <P>No doubt the comity of Governments would prevent any situation of this kind ever arising.  I cannot contemplate the Government of any country proposing to confer a title on a subject of this State, if it is known that this State desires that titles should not be conferred; but I want to point out to the President that there is no provision in this clause to provide any sanctions in the event of such a thing occurring.  There is a prohibition, if you like, against a citizen accepting a title, but what is to happen if he is offered a title by a foreign State and accepts it?  There is no provision here for legislation to <Col N="1625" /> provide sanctions in the event of such a thing occurring.</P>

In some cases, we do provide for implementation, so to speak, by law, but the hope is that no case like this will arise.  It it does, we are quite at liberty to make the desire of the people, as indicated in this Constitution, effective by way of sanctions.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Costello that this whole subject is very trivial in comparison with most of the rest of the Constitution. I have no desire to press my amendments, but I think the President is under a misapprehension if he supposes that the case provided for in the sub-section of clause 2 is not likely to arise.  I think it probably has arisen dozens of times since the formation of this State.  It arises in connection with the British Government, because there is the problem of double citizenship.  I am sure there are plenty of people who possess Irish citizenship and who received rewards of this kind from the British Government during the period since the founding of the Free State.  However, I am quite prepared, as I say, to withdraw these amendments and let the President consider the matter between now and Report Stage and, if he sees fit, to drop the section or to alter its form.</P>

He is on an equally sound democratic basis in Section 2 (2), but I dislike entirely this proposal to create orders of merit which may, presumably, be conferred <Col N="1626" /> by the State.  There is nothing in that scheme of conferring honours or titles in other countries that should inspire us to follow their example.

I do not think that the Labour movement has been enhanced or that its prestige has been increased by conferring honours of that kind on working-class people. We all heard of the notorious Honours Fund during the war period.  It is still supposed to be of substantial dimensions. I am afraid that the proposal to create an order of merit here will lead to the same kind of flunkeying and purchasing of honours that it has led to in other countries.  In the case of Great Britain, and even in the case of this country, people got titles of nobility for very little service so far as the ordinary citizen could discover. In the main, titles of this kind have been handed out to Party camp followers and to people flunkeying after the Government in power in the hope of getting something of this kind from them.  Titles of this kind have been used in the most unscrupulous way for company promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike this whole proposal to create an order of merit, which often does not mean an order of merit at all.  Oftentimes the system does not ensure that these orders are conferred on worthy people.  It often means that the greatest party hack, the greatest &ldquo;yes-man,&rdquo; the greatest rubber-stamp in a political party puts out his hand and gets a title in return for that kind of servile loyalty or as a return for a cheque to the party funds.  I do not think that there is anything to commend a proposal of this kind.  We have managed to get along for 15 years without an order of merit, and I <Col N="1627" /> do not know that a set of circumstances is likely to arise which would prevent the functioning of the State or prevent the people from continuing to lead a normal life in the absence of a provision of this kind.

      <P>I have already indicated that there is no proposal in this Article to establish an order of merit. What is done here is simply not to debar the Legislature from having such an order, if it so desires.  We cannot foresee the circumstances.  I do not want to be put in the position of arguing in favour of orders of merit, but orders of merit need not have any reference to political services.  They may be on the cultural side&mdash;awards of merit to scientists and so forth. The only reason for putting in this provision was to make certain that if, at any time in the future, it was thought desirable to institute an order of merit for any purpose, scientific or otherwise, it would not be expressly excluded because of the context of these provisions.  Early in the debate I indicated that I was ready to consider the elimination of that provision provided I was satisfied that its elimination would not debar the Legislature in future, if it were considered in the interests of the community to establish an order of merit to stimulate work for science or in any other direction, from doing so.  It is all very well to talk in general terms, but we have to take account of the things that inspire effort.  We have got various degrees to indicate a certain standard of excellence.  If the State were anxious to confer an order indicating a certain standard of excellence or performance in science, literature or art, I should be slow to debar it from the start and say that under no circumstances should a recognition of special service be possible by the State.  If I am assured it is not necessary, I shall be only too glad to omit the provision, as I should be glad to omit the whole thing if there was any reason for doing so.</P>

      <P>The United States, <Col N="1628" /> with a population approximating 120,000,000, has, apparently, contrived to build up a gigantic structure for its citizens in a short space of time out of relatively undeveloped resources. The name of that country is respected all over the world and this has been achieved without conferring an order of merit on any citizen, whether in the domain of science, education or literature. If they managed to reach their present degree of commercial, industrial and social eminence, dealing with a population of 120,000,000, without this provision, a small country of 3,000,000, such as this, ought to be able to struggle on without conferring orders of merit.  No matter what the intentions of the Legislature may be, no matter what the intentions of the President or Taoiseach may be, inevitably these honours are conferred upon persons for all kinds of reasons&mdash;a number of them quite unworthy.  In the main, wherever you find this method of conferring honours, you find that the political camp follower pockets the bulk of them.  Look at the position in Great Britain&mdash;a country which we will be tempted to emulate because of its proximity.  You will find that, in the main, these titles have gone into the pockets of people who could use influence with the Government of the day or subscribe to the depleted Party funds of the Government of the day.

      <P>Deputy Norton is a man who suffers from the congenital incapacity to distinguish between titles of nobility and what are described here as orders of merit, because he took orders of merit as being the same as titles of nobility. He made a most unfortunate reference to the United States.  Everybody knows that in the United States they have no official titles of nobility or orders of merit, but, nevertheless, it is full of captains and colonels and knights-at-arms who have assumed titles.  You have governors, senators, ex-senators, and when men cease to be presidents they still are entitled to the courtesy title of president.  Therefore, by a popular usage they have created their own titles of honour in the United States.  This Article does not suggest that we propose to create titles of honour.  Suppose the Deputy were to carry his objection to its logical conclusion and were to put down and include in the Constitution a positive prohibition of the creation of orders of merit, what might the position be for meritorious service in the Army?  You could not even confer a military order for valour, which would be a meritorious service.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether membership of the Royal Irish Academy, which is looked upon as an insignia of merit: whether even that might not be prohibited.  The position is this: that people do generally recognise where there has been exceptionally meritorious service not merely in political life but in every class of life: they, the people themselves, apart altogether from formal creation by the State, do create badges of merit.  Even the presidency of a learned society or of a professional organisation or an association&mdash;even the chairmanship of the Labour Party, is in itself an order of merit, and what the Deputy is urging here is that we should prohibit <Col N="1630" /> people from indicating that they held such an honourable post as that of the chairmanship of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I do not think that I have ever heard so much mush talked about orders of merit as I have heard from the Minister for Finance in the last few minutes.  He talked about people in the United States calling themselves governors. I wonder if the President, who has a diplomatic representative in the United States, has ascertained from him whether people there are entitled to call themselves governors if, in fact, they are not governors, and to call themselves colonels if, in fact, they are not colonels.  What the Minister has said is, of course, a justification of the dangers behind all this.  He talked about shovelling out these orders, and said it is not desirable to prevent people from sharing in these orders of merit and badges. That is the mentality that is behind this.  If the Minister for Finance had any power to create these orders of merit, and to confer them, I imagine that the only danger threatening the ordinary simple citizen would be that he might be knocked down by the avalanche of orders which the Minister for Finance would create.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> In Section 6, sub-section 1º, i, to delete all words from and including the words &ldquo;The education&rdquo;, line 5, to and including the words &ldquo;with law&rdquo;, line 14.</P>
    <P>This raises a very important principle. I intend to deal shortly with the principle embodied in the amendment, but if I do so that is not to be taken as any indication of the importance that I attach to it. We find here a statement of the general principle that the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of certain rights &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;  The first is the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  If the Article had stopped there it would have received my full support, but the tag that is put on to it constitutes, in my view, a grave menace.  The principle that is enunciated at the opening of Clause 1 of this paragraph 6, is that the education of public opinion is a matter of grave import to the common good, and that the State shall endeavour to exercise certain powers over the organs of public opinion, the Press, the radio and the cinema.  In that there appears to be ample opportunity for any act of a future Legislature gravely to infringe the right of the free expression of opinion and the liberty of the Press. I draw attention to the fact that that limitation on the general statement at the opening contains within it the germ of serious possibilities.</P>
    <P>I think the tag at the end of this statement is entirely unnecessary.  The liberty of the Press, and the right of free speech, have in constitutional law a certain well-known and well-defined meaning.  The right of the free expression of opinion and the liberty of the Press all have developed in England through a long series of development, largely of judge-made law.  The result has been in the end to secure a very wide measure of free expression of opinion and the liberty of the Press, and the limitations on that are well known.  A limitation on the liberty of the Press and on the right of the free expression of opinion would, in my view, be amply safeguarded by the general terms used in <Col N="1632" /> the introductory clause to this particular sub-Article of the Constitution, the right to be exercised &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo; Those wide general terms having been used, there was, in my view, no necessity for the addition of this tag on sub-clause 1, paragraph 6 of the Article.  The fact that such a tag is there, coupled with the general terms &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo; lends, in my view, a powerful support to the argument that any future Government may advance to cover its tracks when it is, in effect, making an attack on the liberty of the Press or the right of free speech.  I think this addition ought not to be put in and should be strenuously and seriously fought.</P>

      <P>I think, Sir, that the provision contained in this section, with regard to the Press, and interference with the Press, if it is considered to undermine the authority of the State, is a very dangerous provision. The liberty of the Press has been established in most countries of the world for a period of about three centuries.  Three centuries ago, or very nearly that length of time ago, a great writer used these words: &ldquo;Give me liberty to know, to utter, <Col N="1633" /> and to argue, freely, according to conscience, above all other liberties.&rdquo; That was at a time when the liberty of free printing was challenged by the Government of another country.  Here you have a provision now in which the right of the Press may be interfered with if it is considered to undermine the authority of the State.  Who is to determine that?  Who is to determine whether or not articles published in the Press, attacking some policy of the Government, should be held to be undermining the authority of the State?  We have had, in this country, many controversies as to fundamental rights.  We have had many controversies as to whether or not a Government was exceeding its powers.  Is the Press, if it takes a view on that, differing from the view of the Government, to be pilloried or to be interfered with, and to have its liberty checked because, in the view of that Government, the Press is interfering with the authority of the State?</P>
      <P>I think that this is a very dangerous provision.  Any provision that tends to interfere with the liberty of the Press is a very dangerous provision.  The Press, after all, is conducted, as we know, by very responsible people, and they are guided by the wisdom and common-sense of the citizens at large, who are the readers of the newspapers and whose views they have to respect. I think that here we are introducing a principle of a very dangerous character, if a Government are to be entitled to challenge the right of the Press to criticise them, and if they are to be entitled to base that attack on the liberty of the Press on a case that the Press are undermining or interfering with the authority of the State.</P>

      <P>Here, again, Sir, we are dealing with the same class of question as we dealt with before&mdash;the question of a right statement and a wrong statement: the question of liberty rightly used and liberty abused. It is also a question of things that are not always easy to reconcile, and these are the rights of an individual, from the individual standpoint, and the social rights.  These rights have an <Col N="1634" /> individual aspect and a social aspect, and we have got to see to it, in so far as we can, that from both points of view these rights be co-ordinated properly.  Is anybody going to deny in this House that, when we are depending upon the knowledge, the information of an electorate to provide us with a legislature and to decide matters that affect the common welfare &mdash;the welfare of the whole community&mdash; permission should not be given for the wilful and wrongful misleading of the public on these matters?  I would ask Deputies to take these provisions as they are here and tell us exactly what is wrong with them.  Some speaker on the other side has suggested that we should stop at the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>

I say that the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions cannot, in fact, be permitted in any State.  There are opinions which go to the very root. Let us suppose, for example, that we had for to-morrow the question of social order generally.  If we believe in order, are we going to permit the free expression of such opinion as that it is inconsistent with man's nature that he should be governed at all?  Are we going to have anarchical principles, for example, generally propagated here?  I say no.</P>

      <P>I say it is.  I say that you should not give to the propagation of what is wrong and unnatural the same liberty as would be accorded to the propagation of what is right. Every State has to protect itself against the abuse of liberty that otherwise would be rightful liberty. We want to protect rightful liberty, but in the interests of the community as a whole we want to see that that rightful liberty is not abused.  Therefore, I say that you cannot let the first part of this stand by itself&mdash;the part which merely declares the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  That cannot be allowed and, in fact, is not permitted in any State that I know of.  There are obvious limitations on that. Deputy Rowlette, if I understood him correctly, would suggest that there should not be any.</P>

      <P>Then who is going to determine it?  We may differ as to where the line can be drawn, and I hold that it can be drawn in this manner, and we will hear Deputy Rowlette and other Deputies argue to the contrary. I hold that the line should be drawn in the way it is expressed here:</P>
      <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any objection to it?  Should they be used to undermine public order and morality?  Is it right that we <Col N="1636" /> should not try to ensure that they shall not undermine public order or morality?  Is it right that we should not endeavour to ensure that these powerful organs for the formation of public opinion should not be abused to the extent of undermining public order or morality or the authority of the State?  Is it not necessary that there should be government and authority? It is not a question of the interests of the persons who are for the moment exercising that authority.  It is a question of authority in general.  Is it not a fact that in every State there are laws to prevent the undermining of public order, morality and the authority of the State?  What we say in this Article is that the State should endeavour to ensure that these powerful organs of opinion, under the control, for the most part, of very few individuals, should not be used for a purpose which is contrary to public order, public morality or the authority of the State.  We go on to say that the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with the law.  That is the position as I understand it at the moment. The only thing that may be said about this clause is that it is frank and open, that it says definitely that the State ought to try to do things which the State does as a matter of fact.  I am anxious to hear from Deputy Rowlette, or from any other member, what are the arguments against the State endeavouring to ensure that these things should obtain. I think, that apart from suggestions of various kinds, this statement of the position and of the rights of the State is an ample and reasonable statement.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;  I am not criticising the provisions regarding public order or morality.  They are correctly there.  The State is not something Divine or superhuman.  It is not something imposed on us from above.  We do not accept in this country either the Fascist doctrine, the Hitlerite doctrine or the Communist doctrine.  We believe that the State is the creation of the people.  It is the creation of a democratic people and every citizen of the State has a perfect right, or should have a perfect right in a democratic State, to suggest that changes should be made in the State as he thinks fit.  That is what is made criminal and is declared to be inimical in this section of the Draft to the well-being of the State&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall not be used to undermine the authority of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any criticism of the State, any criticism of the Government, any criticism of the Executive Council could be regarded by a corrupt judiciary, by a corrupt Government, as undermining the authority of the State in so far as the authority rested on those persons.  Where is the freedom of democratic expression of opinion there?  You purport to preserve the right of free expression of opinion, but the degree of rightfulness is to be governed by the following sentence, that it must not undermine the <Col N="1638" /> authority of the State.  I shall go this far, that I think it should be declared illegal and inimical to the authority of the State for anybody to attempt to upset the State by force of arms.  I do not know whether the President agrees with that or not now.  He did not always agree with it.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the President will agree with me in the view that it should be made criminal to attempt to upset the authority of the State by force of arms.  I think it should be but I do not see that provided for in this clause.  I do not know whether it is provided for elsewhere or not but, so far as I have examined the Draft, it does not appear in it up to the present.  It may be covered by later sub-sections of this section.  I am not sure.  The first words of this paragraph are: &ldquo;The education of public opinion being however a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure,&rdquo; etc.  That is to say that the education of public opinion is to be a matter for the State. What more undemocratic principle could find its way into any Constitution? What more could Mussolini or Hitler say than the education of public opinion is to be a matter for the State?  I suggest that such a provision is incompatible with the Constitution of any democratic State. Public opinion, if it is to be free, must be self-formed and must be formed by the free thought of the people.  It must not be a matter of propaganda by the Government, as suggested in this Draft.  There is foreshadowed here a complete control of the organs of public opinion&mdash;the radio, the Press and the cinema&mdash;a control that might be as complete in the hands of any Government of the future as exists in Italy, Germany or Russia to-day.  Is that what the President envisages for the future of this country?  I do not <Col N="1639" /> think it is what he envisages, but I say that if this clause passes into law, as it at present stands, it makes such a development possible and makes for the end of all democratic government in this country in our own lifetime.</P>

      <P>These words seem at any rate to do no harm.  They merely amplify the provisions relating to public order and morality, and I cannot see that they do any harm.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Rowlette in disliking the whole trend of the sentence beginning with &ldquo;The education of public opinion,&rdquo; which suggests that the State should not merely adopt, as its normal attitude, the punishing of offences when they are committed and the taking of steps that seem proper to prevent the repetition of these offences, but that it should start out on a sort of advance campaign before any offences are committed.  That sort of propaganda is unfortunately suggested by the wording of this paragraph.  It has been suggested to Deputy Dr. Rowlette and to me, and I think it will be suggested to most people who read that sentence, whether or not it is so intended by the Government.  What does that sentence give to them that they have not got elsewhere?  They have got public order and morality covered some lines before the sentence to which we are objecting.  They get sedition covered in the sentence after the clause to which I am objecting.  It is not at all apparent to me what they <Col N="1640" /> gain by this paragraph.  If, however, they are determined to have it in, I think that the objection to it would be very greatly diminished if the President would accept my amendment, No. 122, which makes it plain that, in talking about undermining the authority of the State, you do not intend to rule out criticisms of the Government of the day.  However little the President may intend to rule out criticisms of the Government of the day, the words as they stand are open to that construction and Deputy Rowlette is quite right in saying that it is conceivable that the judiciary might, in certain circumstances, so interpret the words.</P>
      <P>While I should like to see the whole of that sentence disappear from this&mdash; I cannot see that it does any good and it may do harm&mdash;I do say that, if that sentence is retained, at least those words should be put in, explicitly permitting free criticism of the Government of the day, subject, of course, to considerations of sedition and the preservation of public order and morality.  I hope that the President will consider this matter carefully, because there has been a lot of propaganda going on in the newspapers for some time that I have considered most undesirable propaganda, leading up to this sort of interfering grandfatherly attitude on the part of the Government that it is impossible to read into this sentence.</P>

      <P>What has happened in this case is typical of what is happening in regard to a number of these Articles.  Quite gratuitously there has been read into it something which on the face of it is not contained in it at all.  Because there is an effort in this Constitution to be frank and fair and open it is being attacked. If we had said nothing, but allowed this thing to be hidden away in some judgments of court, then it would have been all right; but for goodness' sake hide it away; let us fool ourselves with the idea that everybody is free to express any opinion he chooses no matter what is affected by it.  We have decisions of courts.  Now, we may be starting on quite a new system of jurisprudence in this country.  In the past very long period quite a different philosophy of life was behind the system of jurisprudence.  We may be starting a system of jurisprudence which is of a different character.  Those who bow down and adore the system of jurisprudence across the water may feel shocked at that, but it is bound to happen because the whole philosophy of life of our people is not the same as the philosophy of life of the people across the water.  In this Constitution, instead of relying on judgments in English courts and so on, hidden away and known only to the lawyers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We all know that. We know that the lawyers know all about them, but they want us to go out and flaunt a principle like this&mdash; that the free expression of opinion is allowed in this country.  They know perfectly well that, as a matter of fact, it is circumscribed in a variety of ways by decisions which say that it must be rightful and proper liberty, so what is the harm in putting it down here so that every citizen who reads this Constitution will see at once that there are limitations on this expression of opinion?  We have arguments based on something that is not here.  The <Col N="1642" /> only thing that has come close to what is here, and seems to justify the attack that has been made on this section, is something said by Deputy MacDermot &mdash;that possibly this clause about undermining the authority of the State might be abused, although the courts are there to determine whether it is or not; whether rightful liberty would not, in a democratic country, include the right to criticise the actions of individual Governments.</P>
      <P>In order to make a case, Deputy Rowlette has to come along and posit a corrupt judiciary.  I think that in a country where we have laid it down here as a foundation that we shall have an independent judiciary, when a person has to posit a corrupt judiciary in order to make a case, he has a very poor case indeed.  There is nobody who wants more than I do to see this Constitution of such a character that democratic institutions and rightful expression of opinion will be preserved, and I will welcome any help I can get from anybody to make it so, but I am not going to follow people who are reading into this something which is clearly not there on the surface of it. Will any Deputy deny that the education of public opinion is a matter of grave import to the common good? Is it or is it not?  If it is, should the State not in fact endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press and the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty, should not be used to undermine public order?  Already a Deputy has said that it should not be used to undermine public order and morality, and should be prevented from so doing. That is conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this broadside attack against the alleged lack of democracy in this Constitution is now brought down to this point, that possibly instead of interpreting rightful liberty, in the sense in which it is clearly here, to mean that criticism of Governments&mdash;legitimate criticism which is necessary for democracy &mdash; should be preserved, it might somehow be interpreted that criticism of the Government was criticism of the authority of the State.  I do not think one needs to be a metaphysician to see the difference between the two.  I am <Col N="1643" /> prepared to admit that there might be some sort of point in the suggestion that it might possibly be done if there was an unscrupulous Government&mdash;we must posit that to start off with&mdash;and an unsorupulous Parliament to make the law&mdash;we have to posit that also&mdash; and in addition to that an unscrupulous judiciary which will not pay any attention to the phrase &ldquo;rightful liberty,&rdquo; but is going to play with the Government of the day, with the corrupt and wrong Legislature of the day, in ignoring that particular clause, and straining the idea of the authority of the State into criticism of the Government. I would oppose just as bitterly as anybody else here any suggestion that legitimate criticism of the Government should not be permitted. Although I do not think it is necessary, again, as in many of those cases in order to prevent any possibility of misunderstanding, I am prepared to take Deputy MacDermot's amendment, or at least to put in the substance of it. I take it that if we want to modify its drafting form we can do that.</P>
