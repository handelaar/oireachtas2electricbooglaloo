      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what response he has had to his circular letter addressed to the public authorities at the beginning of the bathing season last year in which he requested them to prevent public impropriety or indecency arising from the fact that sufficient public shelters had not been provided for the sexes; further, to ask the Minister will he request the said authorities to allocate separate bathing places (1) for women and children; (2) for men and boys; (3) for mixed bathing, and thereby help to maintain public propriety and public decency and prevent the undesirable present conditions under which men and women dress and undress together in public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular letter referred to in the question dealt with, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of suitable life saving apparatus and the maintenance of such apparatus; the provision of bathing machines or shelters for bathers where not already in use; the making of by-laws for regulating the use by bathers of bathing strands and bathing machines and for preserving order and decency in connection with public bathing.  To enable the local authorities concerned to take the necessary steps to carry out these suggestions, Sections 92 and 93 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1907, must be declared in force in their districts where not already declared in force.  These sections have already been or are being brought into force in seven county health districts, one borough and one urban district.  It rests with the sanitary authorities to make by-laws regulating bathing places in their districts, subject to confirmation by the Minister.  Bathing by-laws are being brought into operation in four county health districts, one borough and two urban districts.  The course suggested in the concluding portion of the question is generally followed.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  By order dated the 8th March, 1937, the 31st March, 1937, was fixed as the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act.  Boards of health are allowed by Section 12 of the Act to prepare and submit within six months after the appointed day purchase schemes.  Up to the present no purchase schemes have been submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan (for Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that plans were prepared by the Cavan County Board of Health for the erection of a surgical hospital, a new sanatorium, and the extension of the sewerage system to the county home; whether he is further aware that some of these plans were under consideration for more than four years; and if he will state what has caused the delay in giving sanction to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that plans were prepared for a new sanatorium and extension of the sewerage system. In the case of the surgical hospital, only a lay-out of the site originally chosen by the board was prepared by their architects.  This site was not suitable, being too limited to permit of buildings of the extent proposed to be erected thereon, and it had to be abandoned. The selection of a suitable site was rendered difficult owing to the <Col N="5" /> irregular nature of the ground around Cavan.  A lay-out of the new site selected has been prepared by the board's architects and is at present under consideration in the Department. Owing to the configuration of the site, the lay-out requires careful consideration with a view to avoiding expensive underbuilding.  In none of the cases referred to is it correct to say that plans have been under consideration for more than four years.  The plans for the new sanatorium were received in July, 1936, and, after examination, considerable revision was necessary.  The amended plans are at present being considered, and a decision thereon will be given as soon as possible.  The plans for the extension of the sewerage system have been approved.</P>

      <P>Since 1931, there were, according to the registers maintained under the Factory and Workshop Acts, 29 new factories and seven new workshops established in County Clare.  Twenty-two of the factories were creameries in various parts of the county.  Of the remainder, two were sawmills at Clooney and Ennistymon; a factory for the manufacture of laces, elastics and inside soles at Ennis; a factory for the production of whiting at Ennis; a furniture and joinery factory at Clonroadmore, Ennis; and a bakery at Ennis.  The remaining factory was an electricity station at the Ennis Mental Hospital. I have not information at my disposal which would enable me to state the numbers employed by these factories and workshops.  Each of the 36 new factories and workshops was inspected once and 12 were inspected twice by inspectors from my Department.</P>

      <P>In regard to the first part of the question, I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to officers who have served throughout the entire period of their employment by the State in an unestablished capacity.  There is no power under the Superannuation Acts to grant pensions to such persons. Their service can be reckoned only towards the grant of a gratuity under Section 4 of the Superannuation Act, 1887, to the provisions of which I would refer the Deputy.  If pensions have been refused in the cases which the Deputy appears to have in mind, it is obviously because they retired <Col N="10" /> from unestablished posts and lacked the essential element of established service.</P>

All such goods must be produced and declared to the customs officers on the arrival of the passenger and where the amount of the duty is trifling payment may be waived.

    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the board may by order amend a production order in respect of a production period by appointing an additional quantity of bacon (in this section referred to as the additional quota) to be produced during such period, and in such case the board shall, not later than three days after the making of the amending order, cause to be served on each licensee of licensed premises upon whom a copy of the production sub-quota certificate in respect of such production period was served a copy of the amending order and thereupon the production sub-quota for such premises in respect of such production period shall, for the purposes of this Part of this Act, be increased by a quantity of bacon which bears to the additional quota the same proportion as the sum of the home sales sub-quota and the external-sales sub-quota (if any) for such premises for the sale period and the external-sale period respectively next immediately preceding the date of such order bears to the sum of the sales quota for such sale period and the external sales quota for such external-sale period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill, as it stands, three quotas are covered&mdash;the British quota, the home quota, and the external sales quota.  The British quota is fully provided for in this way: That, when the board comes to make an allocation, they, first of all, allocate to each person what he is entitled to as a British export quota&mdash;that being, in the first instance, allocated by me. Having done so, they take what they estimate to be the total number of pigs remaining in the country, after filling that quota, and that is allocated amongst the curers in the proportion to which they are entitled on their allocation of home sales.  This amendment will ensure that, in the allocation, whether pigs are plentiful or scarce, the surplus over what is required for the export quota will be allocated in the proper percentage amongst the export curers.  It is, in fact, the principle <Col N="23" /> that is understood, and, indeed, underlined in this Bill all through, and this amendment is designed to make it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the curer gets what he is entitled to get for the export quota, and then the remainder is divided in the proportion of what he is entitled to get under the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, the point to which I was going to refer a moment ago is peculiarly apt in this connection. As I was saying, the Minister, at the conclusion of the discussion on amendment No. 9 on the last occasion, had just announced a very material concession. On the last occasion, the Minister guaranteed a minimum of 300 cwts. a month, and that means that any minor curer, who wishes to remain in business, will have the Minister behind him to see that he is not squeezed out or trampled upon.  Now, we have this question of the allocation of the quotas, and I say that here is a very serious danger.  The allocation of the quotas is a matter for the Bacon Marketing Board, and if the Board, in pursuit of a plot to destroy the small curers, desire to do the small curers an injury, they can so arrange the quotas, from time to time, that, when prices are low in England they would allocate to the minor curers an undue proportion of the quota, thus forcing them to send their produce to England in the hope of extracting whatever bounty they could get either from the Treasury or out of the hypothetical price then prevailing; and, at the same time, if there were a scarcity of pigs, as there is at the present time, the curers could force up the price here and raise the price of pigs in such a way as to make the entire business of the minor curers uneconomic.  Therefore, in view of the fact that the Minister has accepted the principle that the small curer must be protected and must be guaranteed an opportunity of continuing in business, I would ask the Minister now to go a step further than he went on last Thursday, and to say that the small curer, who has a small production <Col N="24" /> quota, shall be entitled to sell that production quota on the home market. Perhaps the Minister is inclined to share my view on that matter.  If he is so inclined, I think there is no need to waste the time of the House in discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a rather difficult matter to raise on this Bill. The export quota was fixed under the Export Act of 1934,, and, in the beginning, when the export quota was being allocated, the various curers were asked to make application.  At the time, the applications somewhat exceeded the quota we had from Great Britain, and they were all cut down, in consequence, to a certain percentage of their applications.  I forget at the moment what that percentage was.  Now, as time went on, some of them surrendered part of their export quota, and it was offered to those who were applicants for an additional export quota.  There was a period&mdash;I think it would be almost two years ago now&mdash;when every curer had got as much of an export quota as he wished to have.  It was a rather difficult time for exporters, and some of them were exporting at a loss.  A circular was then sent out from the Department saying that the export quota in future would be based on that particular period, and from that time it has been based on that performance. Very few of the small curers have got an export quota at all, and what they have got is very small.  I, in meeting these small curers, discussed the matter with them more or less on the lines of what the Deputy has raised.  They all expressed a wish to keep what they have, and also said that they would like to take more if there was more on offer.  I think, whatever the quota is, we shall have to make it a permanent thing, because there are ups and downs in the trade, and if a firm undertakes to do so much per month, it must do that amount whether it is gaining or losing.  We could not alter it from time to time to suit the needs of individuals.  Possibly if a small curer came along and said that he was retiring from the export business we would be prepared to release him, <Col N="25" /> but I do not know that we could allow him to come back again into that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not devise a plan whereunder a person who received an export allocation below a certain minimum figure would have the option to reject it in any given period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would have to reject it for all time then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question.  I quite see that where you are dealing with a large exporter who makes a very material contribution to the full export quota, you could not allow him to withdraw from his commitments and return at a later period.  You could not allow a man, say, who has an export quota of 1,000 pigs per week to come along and to say: &ldquo;I do not want any export quota for this month,&rdquo; but suppose you had a man who had an export quota for only 20 pigs and that he said: &ldquo;I would prefer not to have any quota for this period,&rdquo; that would not dislocate things so much at all for the other curers who would have to fill up that gap in the full quota. The Minister thinks that we are going to get 15 minor curers qualifying to be small curers.  There are 30 minor curers, therefore we must anticipate that 20 of the minor curers will become small curers under the Bill. Most of these have no export quota. Suppose half of them have been getting export quotas in the past and that they would be eligible to get them in the future, that we fix a minimum quota and that we say that any man who gets an export quota for 20 pigs or less will be entitled to refuse it in any given export quota period after giving due notice.  That might mean in any quota period that refusals to accept the quota would result in a drop of 200 pigs in the total quota.  I do not think that that would dislocate export arrangements at all, because it would be perfectly easy to fill that gap through the big curers or the medium curers or, indeed, through the Bacon Marketing Board themselves.  They could buy 100 pigs, get them cured and fill the quota in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that it would not be <Col N="26" /> a good thing to provide for that because it would give these small men an ultimate sense of security.  It might even result in the small men coming eventually to the Bacon Marketing Board and saying: &ldquo;We would sooner do a local business and retire from the export business.  Better wipe off our names altogether as far as the export business is concerned.&rdquo;  If we were able to get them to do that voluntarily it would result in considerable administrative economy, as it would mean that much of the vigilance that it is now necessary to exercise over these small curers would not be necessary in future.  I think, however, that it is vital to avoid any suggestion that the curers can be coerced into that path. It might, however, happen that in many cases, after an experience of a few quota periods, they would come voluntarily to see that their interests were better served by disposing of all their production locally.  I do not want to rush the Minister into this thing but he might turn the suggestion over in his mind.  If the quota allocated to any curer is less than 20 pigs per week I suggest that he should have the right to reject that quota in any given quota period and to retain his right to get another quota for a subsequent period, having again the option to accept or reject.  If that plan is acceptable I think it might be useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy ought to realise the difficulty of working out a scheme of that kind.  Perhaps we might assume that we should try to fill the full export quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise we are threatened with the loss of portion of it.  Before I allocate the quota, I must get an application from curers for so much.  If a curer does not fill his quota there is power under the Export Act to inflict a penalty.  We have not inflicted a penalty so far. What we did was to say to the defaulting curer: &ldquo;If you fall down in this period you cannot come up in another period.&rdquo;  That was better than any penalty we could get through the courts.  If two or three small curers <Col N="27" /> came along in a certain period and said that they wished to withdraw from their quota, we would have to ask the larger curers to take up the quantity for which these small curers had defaulted.  We could not compel them to do so, because they had exported all that they had undertook to supply.  If it was a losing business it would be difficult to get them to undertake more unless we could say to them: &ldquo;If you undertake this you will have it permanently.&rdquo;  That is the only way we could get them to do it. This is a matter that does not come under this Bill, and it is very hard to discuss it here, but I understand the Deputy merely wants an expression of an opinion on the matter.  If a small curer wants to get out of the export business we shall certainly facilitate him, but I am afraid he cannot get back again later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The small curer has also to get a home-sales quota.  There is no production unless he can get a home-sales quota of 300 pigs per month.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, suppose a small curer has an export quota of 40 cwts.  Under this legislation we say that he must get a quota of 300 cwts. He then exports 40 cwts. and sells 260 at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He must get a home-sales quota and sell the remainder at home?  But suppose you take a man who heretofore has applied for a small export quota under the other Act&mdash;not under the Pigs and Bacon Act at all but under the Regulation of Exports Act.  Now he wants to stop applying for the smaller share under the Regulation of Exports Act.  He has got his production quota of 300 pigs a month guaranteed.  Now he goes to the Bacon Marketing Board and asks for a home-sales quota of 300 pigs a month, and they say to him: &ldquo;You have heretofore shipped 40 pigs a month.  Therefore we will not give you a home-sales quota in excess of 260 pigs, because we think you ought to go on exporting the same proportion that you exported heretofore.&rdquo;  What I would like to ensure is that the small curer <Col N="28" /> will have the right to say: &ldquo;The Minister has promised us 300 pigs a month.  You must give us a market wherein to sell them.  I am not exporting, and it is the Minister's wish&mdash; though he does not mean to enforce it, it is his preference &mdash; that the very small man would drop the exporting business.  Therefore we demand as a right from you a home-sales quota wherein to accommodate our 300 pigs.&rdquo; I do not see any provision in the Bill to provide for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>The point there is that the board sometimes have a production quota period of a month &mdash; sometimes even longer&mdash;and the board put it to me when they saw this Bill circulated that compelling them to allocate sub-quotas before half the period has expired may not give them the latitude they wish. They were anxious, in fact, to have that provision cut out altogether, but in discussion with them I said it might be unfair to small curers and others who had not the same facilities as the larger curers in that way, and there should be at least some safeguard.  As a compromise I am putting in this&mdash;that they may go to within ten days of the end before allocating the sub-quota.</P>

      <P>There is this difficulty; of course at certain periods of the year you can get an extraordinary price in New York for Irish bacon, and sometimes it becomes extremely profitable to sell it there.  But there is this difficulty. Are you making a provision here that in the event of your giving to a curer an external sales quota whereunder to get a share of that New York trade, you will also give him an additional production quota?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we have divided up the visible supplies of pigs between the British market and the home market, the proposal here is that we assume there is a surplus of pigs, and allow that surplus to be cured for shipment to America.  Otherwise, you have got to face this difficulty: If there is only sufficient pigs to supply the British market and the home market, you must either drop part of your British quota&mdash;and we should not do that in order to get a fortuitous market in America&mdash;or we must create in Ireland an artificial scarcity by taking off the home market the amount <Col N="33" /> of bacon required for New York, but which was originally intended to meet the ordinary demand of the home market.  What is the Department's policy in regard to that matter?  Is it their intention, where that happens, to direct the curer to import his pigs? This is a very difficult problem, and I should like to know what is the Department's attitude.  Does the Minister understand my point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole theory underlying this Bill is that we first contemplate the visible supply of pigs.  We subtract that from the British quota. Is not that so?  The balance is for home sales and external sales quota. Now, supposing the balance is barely sufficient to supply home sales, and we then create an external sales quota for a particular curer to ship bacon to New York, that means that we must take the external quota of pigs out of the home quota pig supply.  That is going to create an artificial scarcity of bacon within Saorstát Eireann.  Is not that so?  Are we going to allow that artificial scarcity of bacon to obtain in Saorstát Eireann, or are we going to say to the curer who gets an external sales quota: &ldquo;You must get pigs in Fermanagh or Tyrone, because there are not enough pigs here&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Deputy assuming that that external sales quota must be met?  There will be no compulsion on curers to send bacon to America.  If there is likely to be a scarcity at all, or if a better price is offering in New York than the price at home, instead of creating a scarcity will it not have the effect of raising prices?  Obviously, if there is sale at home, no one will send bacon to America and will be under no compulsion to do so.  It will be a matter really of commanding a higher price. If the Deputy expressed it that way, I think he would be right.  How would prices at home be kept stabilised if we were faced with a demand from countries like the United States for our bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not <Col N="34" /> quite follow the situation.  What might happen is that for three months it might be immensely profitable to land bacon in New York.  An intelligent forecast of that situation, by having a good representative in New York to give warning in time, might enable a man here to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;I want a special sub-quota for three months for New York.&rdquo;  For a few weeks there might be an inflated price for a limited quantity of bacon.  If the British market and the home sales market are capable of absorbing all the pigs in a given quota period, and if you suddenly take from the home market 1,000 pigs and ship them to New York, which on its merits is a very good thing to do, because you get an extra profit for our people, you might completely dislocate the home market and create an artificial scarcity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not more likely that bacon curers having regular contracts with wholesale customers in Saorstát Eireann would simply demand higher prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand it.  It is not the manufacturer who will quarrel with his wholesale customer.  He will not ask the Minister to transfer part of the home sales quota over to the external sales quota.  He will go to the Minister and tell him that he has got a share of the British quota, and a share of the home sales quota, and that he wants a special additional external sales quota.  He then goes into the market here to get pigs to supply that special additional quota.  He continues to supply his customers here and his British customers, but he goes into the open market, or wherever he can get them, for extra pigs to fill the quota for despatch under the external sales quota to America.  If there is a growing pig population in this country it is all to the good.  The more external sales quota we can get the better.  That is one of the alternative markets that has materialised <Col N="35" /> from time to time.  But no provision was made for this, and if you want to keep that market you must sacrifice part of the home sales.  That was an awkward situation, but they devised a way of getting around it, and very sensibly it is now proposed to make regulations for dealing with it.  Now that we are making the regulations, let us face the difficulty.  We ought to consider whether it would not be right, either to create some reserve of pigs when fixing the home sales quota, out of which this demand could be met, or deliberately say we will have to bring in pigs to meet that demand.  It is not right or fair to deny home producers of pigs the additional price that a temporary scarcity entitles them to.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, taking the long view, experience has taught us that from the producers' point of view it does not pay to have pigs fetching 90/- per cwt. in February and 45/- in October.  If we allow the system of having a temporary acute scarcity to reappear, as a result of the external sales quota, we are going to get back to the worst feature of the old dispensation of alternating acute scarcity.  Surely the whole purpose of the legislation was to avoid that.  I remember the year before last about 600 pigs a week going to America for a short period.  There was a short period during which a sky-bottom price was obtainable in America.  It was during that period that the full impact of &ldquo;A.A.A.&rdquo; had hit hogs in America, and there had been an immense slaughter of hogs, as a result of which there was a fearful shortage of bacon for a time, and we filled the gap.  It upset the whole machinery.  Does the Minister not agree, therefore, that if we do not make provision for the extra external supplies quota we may have an alternating scarcity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to be clear about this question.  It is very difficult to forecast the number of pigs that will be produced in this country in the coming year.  An attempt is made to calculate the number in November, before the year comes in.  We must make some calculation as to what we think we can afford to export to Great Britain.  When making the forecast <Col N="36" /> we try to allow sufficient pigs for home producers and the surplus for export to Great Britain.  There are regular markets in New York and Paris and a few small ones that are regular and good.  I think these small external markets ought at all times to be maintained. I regard them as being just as important as the British market. Taking what the Deputy mentioned now, supposing we found suddenly that there was a market for 600 pigs a week, I think it should not be filled unless we were perfectly sure that we had home consumers supplied.  That would be the policy which would direct us.  With regard to allowing curers to bring in pigs, that question has to be looked upon, to a great extent, in the light of existing circumstances. Certainly, I would not like to see that established as a continual policy, but if, by bringing in a few hundred pigs at a time when they were very scarce, we might ease the situation somewhat, I do not see any objection.  We will never import very many pigs and we cannot rely upon that source to fill up any deficiency to any extent.  It is a very small matter.  It might suit certain curers nearer the Border to get over their difficulties but, to get over a general shortage in the Free State I do not think it would count for anything. If the Deputy asks me what I think the policy should be, I would say that we should try and fill any quotas we have.  At the moment, we have only a quota with Great Britain.  But, supposing America were to adopt the quota system, and we undertook to export so much bacon per annum to the United States under the quota, I think we would have to maintain it. Perhaps it is lucky for us that they have not a quota.  There is a small market there that certain curers would very much like to maintain and not lose under any circumstances.  Beyond that, however, I think that a great deal would depend on whether we have a surplus of pigs here for home consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is this interesting fact&mdash;that we are coming to the point when we can make a great fortune for our pig producers by exporting Irish bacon at fancy prices.  There does come a time when you have to make up your mind whether you will reject your foreign markets and refuse to supply them, or supply them and create a scarcity at home. When confronted with a scarcity at home, you have to ask yourself two questions.  Shall we scourge the home consumer, or shall we see that he gets a fair deal, and at the same time extend the foreign markets?  When you ask yourself that question, you say: shall we bring in pigs or shall we bring in bacon?  We could have got in New York last spring 1/4 per lb. for Irish bacon delivered on New York quay.  We could have brought in Danish bacon and sold it here to our own customers for about 11d per lb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is an Irish bacon market we are supplying.  We are driven eventually to the point of saying: shall we reject our foreign markets and restrict the production of our farmers?  Shall we forbid them to expand, or shall we tell them, &ldquo;Expand to your limit and, whatever happens, so long as you are profiting by expanding and making further money, enriching the community, bringing in wealth into the country and into your own pockets, go straight ahead; that is good work, and the Government will look after the Irish consumer.&rdquo;  If the situation ever arises and you want the home consumer to hold up your hand to maintain the business, the consumer will swing into line and help by any reasonable contribution you ask of him.  So long as you keep a flexible, open mind on this question, you can carry on and develop your foreign trade and enrich the community as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we going to do when working the external sales quota? There is a British quota and a home quota and the external sales quota. What are we going to do?  We must face the question.  Whose bacon is to go to America?  Is it the British? Because if it is, we are going to lose the British market for so much as is sent to America.  Is it our own people's bacon?  If it is, it will raise the price at home to a fancy price, and some people will have to go without bacon. Are we to bring in pigs?  Or shall we say that, if we sell a thousand sides of bacon in New York, thereby creating a shortage here in Ireland, we will bring in bacon to fill that shortage, and turn to our producers and say: &ldquo;We have been left short of one thousand sides of bacon, or 500 pigs, in this period; we had to bring in bacon to fill it; be sure you will have sufficient pigs this time 12 months to meet the demand&rdquo;?  Or, will we go to Ulster and buy Ulster pigs and bring them in here and establish a system that our own producers will be held down and prevented from increasing the production of pigs; so that eventually Irish factories will be working to get markets not for the pigs of our own people, not for the pigs of the residents of this State; that we will be working and getting a market abroad for the pigs of Ulster and Great Britain?  That is what we are doing to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in his judgment it might be a practice on the Border to buy a few pigs across the Border.  300 pigs were delivered at Waterford yesterday from Lisburn.  It is too long a journey for the pigs, and the pigs are no better of it, and the producers here will be no better of it. Actually, at present our factories are making a market, taxing our own people here, to sell the pigs of the Northern Ireland farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if you bring in pigs, the tendency will be to prevent our people producing pigs hereafter.  I would sooner bring in as much bacon as the consumers would want from time to time, and, by propaganda and example, induce our people steadily to increase their pig production.  I do not think we ought to be bringing in pigs to compete with our own pig producers here.  I regard agriculture as the most important industry in the country, and I consider that the development of agriculture is of infinitely more importance than the development of anything else.  I would <Col N="40" /> much sooner see our people producing those goods for which they can find a market abroad.  The more stuff they sell abroad, the more international trade we have, the better we will be.</P>
      <P>I would much sooner see our people producing the stuff themselves to supply foreign markets rather than buying the raw materials abroad, bringing them in here and slaughtering them, putting a handful of salt on them, and sending them out as bacon. There is ten times as much work and as much employment given and ten times as much increase in national wealth in rearing a bonham from the sucker age to the bacon pig age than in curing the pig.  If the interests of either are to be jeopardised temporarily by the unforeseen situation arising out of this amendment it should not be that of the pig producer, because from the point of view of Ireland and the people and from the point of view of employment, every pig that is produced is worth 20 sides of bacon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Dr. Dillon Dr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is calculated to standardise production.  If the supplies forthcoming are not equal to the demand, I would much prefer that the bacon would come into the vacuum created so that the bacon curer will co-operate in encouraging the farmer to supply the market. Remember, the curer does not care a fiddle-dee-dee where he gets his pig so long as he gets his profit for converting the pig into bacon.  As a matter of fact, it may pay him better to get his pigs in Northern Ireland.  But we can put pressure on him to pay the farmer a better price for his bacon. Curers in this country at the present time are buying cheap pigs in Northern Ireland.  I do not think it is a good thing to let in pigs at all. I want to see that every pig that is killed in the Saorstát is a Saorstát pig, and that Irish bacon comes from an Irish pig.</P>

If the scarcity is not avoided the consumer will suffer.  If it is avoided either the consumer or the processers will suffer.  The latter would lose some of the fictitious profit that would accrue to them.  If either is to suffer, I want the curer to suffer, not the producer, because the producer is an infinitely more important person than the curer.

      <P>I have said that I got 82/- a cwt. for bacon pigs in Ballaghaderreen. The Minister says that the man who paid that price broke the law. The fixed price that day, I think, was 73/- or 75/- a cwt., delivered in the factory.  The Lisburn pigs crossed the <Col N="43" /> Border for killing in Waterford, and as soon as they set foot on the Irish Free State soil the price of pigs fell by 15/- a cwt. in Ballaghaderreen and in other Irish towns.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister want to put a penalty on people for failure to export bacon up to the amount of the external-sales sub-quota? Why should there be a penalty for a failure of that kind?  I can understand you putting a penalty on a man for failing to fill his British quota, because if an individual fails in that respcet the nation will suffer, as the British will cut down the quota on the next occasion.  But an external-sales sub-quota is an entirely different transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a firm comes and undertakes to fill a sub-quota.  That firm gets an allocation on that understanding, and we must see that the firm fills the sub-quota. An individual is not bound to undertake and is not bound to apply, but if he applies he must fill the sub-quota allocated to him.</P>

All he will say is: &ldquo;Go ahead; if you can sell 100 pigs in New York, you are free to do so and we will give you an external-sales sub-quota.&rdquo; Suppose another man makes a similar request.  If 50 curers all send 100 pigs to New York &ldquo;on spec,&rdquo; they are perfectly free to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that you cannot do any harm. I do not know how this trade with New York is run in detail, but in the case of butter, I have seen instances where a creamery had a connection with a very good customer; another creamery comes along and undercuts, with the result that the first connection is broken.  The second man who has undercut gets in, but he is not satisfactory and eventually the whole business is lost.  The same may happen here.  You may have a good connection with a buyer in New York and a bacon curer here.  Another curer here may intervene and quote a lesser price and eventually the whole trade may be lost, just as in the case of the butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

You may think it the right thing to do, but others may have a contrary opinion.  If the Department <Col N="47" /> or the Pigs Marketing Board are going to poke their noses between the purchaser and the vendor, between our curers and purchasers in America, will that be a wise thing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The curer is perfectly entitled to do business if he so wishes, but if he makes application and signs an undertaking that he will, if granted a certain quota, export so much during the coming period, he is compelled to do it, but there is no more regulation beyond that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe you will have to amend that.  I have seen cases where men exported bacon to New York and they found that the bacon got knocked about so much that they had to tell the consignee that they could not go on with the business.  Maybe the type of boat in which the bacon was sent had not proper accommodation and it was delivered in a bad condition.  I can imagine a fellow here taking an external-sales quota for two months, and at the end of the first month, finding that the bacon was being so knocked about in the hands of the shipping company that he was losing money on it, and he would be anxious to chuck the whole thing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 13, line 47, to insert before the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the nature of the business carried on by such person,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three or four amendments which I think I would like to speak on together.  This deals with the question of ascertaining the basis on which compensation will be paid.  As the section stands, it is very restricted.  The Arbitration Board, if such is appointed, would be compelled to grant compensation strictly on the amount of bacon produced within a certain period.  It has been pointed out to me by some of the small curers that other considerations should be taken into account, and this is put in to give the arbitration board some latitude in that they must take the nature of the business carried on by such a person into account.  One person may have engaged in it as a side line, being a grocer, and another person may have been almost <Col N="51" /> solely dependent on it during certain periods of the year, and I think it well that they should have power to take these matters into consideration when assessing the compensation to be paid.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which I might deal now is that, as the section stands, even if we found it difficult, and perhaps impossible, to compel even one factory out of the 31 to disclose its figures during a certain period without going to the High Court or some such authority, we should have to go through that procedure, and this second amendment is put in to provide that if the chairman of the board is satisfied, after examining the accounts of two-thirds, or three-fourths, or of all the factories except one, that the average net profit for a certain period is such an amount, he will certify it and the arbitration can proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be taken as conclusive as a basis on which the arbitration board could proceed to compensate.  They must get two figures before they can proceed: firstly, the number of pigs produced by the person in a certain period and we are adding to that &ldquo;the nature of the business carried on,&rdquo; and, secondly, the average profits derived by all bacon factories over a certain period.  Having got these figures, the arbitration board will make up its mind as to whether it should give 20 years' compensation or 15 years' compensation.</P>

I am, as a matter of fact, contemplating a further amendment, which I hope to introduce on Report Stage, which will, perhaps, cover the amendment which Deputy McGilligan has down later.  His amendment suggests the 36 months ending on the 31st day of March, 1938.  I should like to accept that amendment, <Col N="52" /> but we could not get reliable figures over all that period.  We could get them for the year we have already got in the Bill and for the year ending 31st March, 1938, and I shall be quite prepared to bring that in on Report and to let the average production be taken as the average of the two years.  There is an intervening year for which we cannot get the figures.  In the first year we have mentioned we have the figures from the Revenue Commissioners who collected excise duty at the time, and for the other year we would have figures from the returns made by minor curers to the Bacon Marketing Board on the business done up to 31st March last; so that instead of taking the three years Deputy McGilligan suggests, we could take the year already in the Bill and last year, and get the average of the two years.</P>

    <P>It is agreed now between both sides of this House that any tendency towards monopoly in the bacon curing business is, from the national point of view, undesirable, and that it is perfectly legitimate to take any steps that may be necessary to prevent such a development.  I take the view that no steps we can take here can be absolutely guaranteed effectively to prevent the development of monopoly if we are concerned to maintain, at the same time, the system of private enterprise and capital.  I regard it as vital to the best interests of all those interested in the production of pigs and bacon that the system of individual enterprise and capitalism should be maintained, because I am convinced that that system will yield to the producer, the processor and the consumer the maximum return that can be got out of the business of producing and manufacturing pigs into bacon.  Therefore, I think we should take reasonable precautions to prevent monopoly developing and at the same time take occasion now to warn potential monopolists that, if they succeed in circumventing the precautions taken by this House to prevent monopoly and effect a monopoly in spite of the Government of the country, whatever Government is in office will take over that monopoly for a sum substantially less than its intrinsic <Col N="55" /> value, and operate it on socialistic lines as a State monopoly.</P>
    <P>Monopoly is hateful, but if you have to have monopoly, if you cannot prevent monopoly, a monopoly in the hands of a Government is less hateful than a monopoly in the hands of an exploiting individual, because, at least, a Government is responsible to somebody and an exploiting individual is responsible to nobody and is free to knock out of the consumer and producer as much as he can.  I have, therefore, put down this amendment, and amendment No. 32, which I cannot move&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or discuss.  However, I do not think the Rules of Order prevent those who have the amendments before them reading it secretly, provided they do not utter the sacrilegious words which my proposed amendment contains.  Taking this amendment as moved and adopted, and amendment No. 32 as being set on the Paper, although it cannot be moved and cannot be adopted, it is a formal notice from this side of the House that if we are responsible and have the right, as we would have if we were in government, to put down that amendment, we would put it down in the event of a monopoly being formed. That is notice to the monopolists.  If the Minister will say that the spirit enshrined in that amendment corresponds closely to his own feelings in this matter, then all orders of monopolists in this country have full and fair notice that, if they succeed in their purpose of creating a monopoly, on that day their entire property will be taken from them at a fixed price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say all that on the section.  I can advocate a public charge but I cannot move for a public charge.  No monopoly will be tolerated and, whatever Government is in office, it should be understood that we will take all and any measures to correct monopolies.  The point I want to make clear is that the only way we can do that is to warn them beforehand, <Col N="56" /> because the fundamental law of this country does not permit the confiscation of any man's goods, whether he be a good citizen or not.  It is not confiscation if you warn a man in due time that if he, by his own action, converts his property into a particular kind of menace to the community, the community will take over that property, telling him now what it will be worth to the community when the occasion arises for them to take it over.</P>
      <P>That is not confiscation, because there is no necessity for this man or any group of men who are forewarned creating a monopoly.  They need not create a monopoly.  They can continue to compete amongst one another and preserve the system of individual enterprise.  If they do not do that, and if they attempt, by monopoly, to enrich themselves, they should realise that they will destroy the greater part of their own property and that they do that with their eyes open, knowing what they are doing.  More than that I do not think that this House or any Government ought to be expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is moving an amendment for which there is no great necessity, as will be realised when we consider the powers under the Principal Act.  Sub-section (1) of this amendment reads: &ldquo;Any licensee may, with the consent of the Minister, sell or otherwise convey his licence to another licensee.&rdquo;  That is perfectly clear in the Act.  One licensee can sell to another licensee only with the consent of the Minister.  Sub-section (2) of the amendment is the really important portion of it.  It says: &ldquo;No assignee of a licence under this section shall, unless with the approval of the Minister, cease to operate the licensed establishment acquired with the licence under such a transaction as is referred to in sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo; I assume that what the Deputy is getting at is this&mdash;that he does not want a big concern to buy out a small concern and take over the quota.  That is impossible.  If a small concern is closed, whether bought by a big concern or not, the quota goes into the pool.  The big concern cannot take <Col N="57" /> over the quota attached to the small concern unless it continues to run it. It must continue to operate the factory if it wants to avail of the quota. If it closes a factory, it has no right to the quota.  The quota is, in these circumstances, thrown into the pool and distributed amongst all the curers. That is the position as the law stands, and there is no necessity for the amendment.</P>
      <P>The third part of the amendment is consequential&mdash;that the money involved shall be payable out of the funds of the licensee to whom the assigned licence has been transferred.  Seeing that the position is that if a firm goes out of business, the total quota attached to that business is distributed, according to certain proportions, amongst all the others, it is only fair that they should all pay proportionately to the firm that is going out.  If the largest firm in the country gets 25 per cent. of the quota of the firm going out, then they should pay 25 per cent. of the cost of going out.  If the smallest firm gets only .5 per cent. of the quota, they should pay only .5 per cent. of the cost of the firm going out.  By putting this charge on the Bacon Marketing Fund that is exactly what will happen.  The levy will be raised on each factory according to its production, and it will pay exactly what it ought to pay.  I think that the system provided for in the section is very fair.  There is no danger of the position contemplated by the Deputy because it does not pay a large firm to buy out small firms.  Take the largest firm in the country, for example.  Under the present system they would only pay 25 per cent., but if they were to buy out another firm directly and close them down, they would have to pay 100 per cent.  There is no danger from the direction from which it was apprehended by the Deputy.  I agree that it would be a very dangerous thing if there were any possibility of a large firm buying out small firms and having the quotas transferred to their own factories.  That is a thing we should have to deal with, but I think it is adequately dealt with in our legislation as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite <Col N="58" /> mistaken in imagining that the danger I envisage could not arise.  Suppose a large curer buys the premises and business of a small curer, as he will be under this Bill&mdash;a man who is a minor curer and who will have graduated into being a small curer&mdash;and carries on for six months.  Suppose the quota of the larger curer is 1,000 pigs a week and the quota of the small curer 50 pigs per week.  He buys out the small man and carries on the business under the name of, say, William Smith and Son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose William Smith and Son are doing 1,000 pigs a week at Tralee and they buy out Henry Brown and Son, who are operating in a neighbouring town.  They paint out the name of Henry Brown and put up the name of William Smith and Son.  They now operate the two establishments as William Smith and Son. After six months, they produce 1,025 pigs in Tralee and 25 pigs in Henry Brown's old premises.  Then, they produce 1,049 pigs in Tralee and only one pig in Henry Brown's premises.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to prevent them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to pass two barriers before getting to that stage.  In the first place, they could not change the name from Henry Brown to William Smith without the permission of the Minister for Agriculture. If a firm is registered as Brown and Co., another person could come in and buy the shares.  That may be a defect in the original Act.  The name would, however, continue to be Brown and Co.  The ownership of the factory could not be changed without the permission of the Minister. If they were to get over that obstacle, they could not transfer a single pig from one factory to another.  The <Col N="59" /> board must, under the Act, allocate on the basis of the production in 1934 at the premises in Tralee or the other premises.  They allocate each time, and it does not matter in the least whether the same man owns the two factories or not.  I think that at present we have one owner with two factories, but he cannot expect to transfer from one factory to the other under the present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister makes that positive statement, and says it is correct, of course I accept it, but it astonishes me to learn that, in pursuit of an agreement between two factories, part of the actual production of pigs cannot be moved from one premises to the other, provided the ownership of the premises is in the one individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  In fact, I think that even if the board were willing to connive at that it would be an illegal thing for it to do. In fact, I am certain it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I invited the Minister to look into it because I believed it had been done, and it was because I thought it was going to be done to a greater extent in the future that I pressed the amendment.  But, let us consider carefully the difference between the classes of persons mentioned in Section 36. Remember there are two very distinct classes of persons.  One is the man who is a minor curer and who, for one reason or another, elects not to become a small curer at all but to go out of business because he does not want to conform to the Department's regulations, or because it is too expensive to put his premises into proper repair, or it may be because he does not care to do the kind of business which is spread over 45 weeks of the year.  Now, that man is going out because the Minister and the Executive Council have made up their minds that, for the protection of the pig industry as a whole, it is desirable that Irish bacon should have <Col N="60" /> the reputation of being manufactured in factories which have reached a certain standard of perfection.  If the community chooses to make a regulation of that kind with a view to making the industry as a whole, right up from the birth of the pig to the sale of the side of bacon, more profitable for those concerned in it, it is fair to say that the person who is being squeezed out, in order to attain that standard of excellence, is entitled to look for compensation, because his being squeezed out is going to improve the demand and the price of bacon right up from the sow to the bacon slicer.</P>
      <P>But, once you have done that, you come up against an entirely new type of person, the person who has qualified, but who, for some domestic reason, wants to get out of bacon curing. Perhaps he wants to retire from the business to go into some other venture, but in any case he wants to get out of bacon curing.  It is perfectly legitimate for that man to sell his business as he would sell anything else.  But, suppose he does not want to sell his business, to put up the shutters or to close down and to clear out, under this Bill he is apparently entitled to apply to the Bacon Marketing Board for compensation. He is in an entirely different position from the other fellow.  I do not object for a moment to his being entitled to sell this business, provided the Minister is satisfied that the person who proposes to buy it is going to carry it on in the district. If he does not propose to carry on the business in the district, there is no use in his buying it because he will not get a licence.  If no existing curer is prepared to buy the business, then let the Minister give the licence to some new man who is prepared to come into the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should those curers who are having their business guaranteed to them and who are getting very valuable concessions under this Bill be put in a privileged position such as no other business in Ireland is put in, the privileged position that when they want to retire from business they are going to get a fixed price for it, without selling it at all or doing anything other than putting up the shutters.  Is that desirable?  Under my amendment <Col N="61" /> we would guarantee permanency to every small curer in the country. From the point of view of the labourers employed in the factory, we guarantee them their jobs, and we guarantee to the neighbouring people who produce pigs a market.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposal, we are tempting the little man to put up the shutters, to dismiss his men, and to tell the neighbours that he will not take their pigs any more: that he is going to the Bacon Marketing Board to get compensation because he is clearing out.  Does not the Minister think that immense pressure will be brought to bear on such a man?  I can imagine some of the big men going to him and saying, &ldquo;We are prepared to do this for you: if you put up your shutters, throw in your hand and close up your factory, we will give you 50 per cent. over and above the arbitrator's award out of our good will just to get you out of business.&rdquo;  In that way you may get every factory in Ireland closed except the big concerns.  Under my proposal the big concerns, if they want to get a man like that out, must buy him out in the ordinary course of business, having given the Minister an undertaking that they will carry on the business in the old factory.  What is to prevent the bacon ring saying on the day that this Bill passes into law: &ldquo;Let us get a super-salesman and instruct him to go around the country and say to each small curer `Throw in your hands, put up your shutters, sack your men, and apply for compensation to the arbitrator, and we will give you a bonus such as the landlords got under the Wyndham Land Act: we will give you 10 to 20 per cent. more than the arbitrator's award.' &rdquo; In the event of such a thing happening, what can the Minister do to prevent the disappearance of the entire bacon trade into the hands of four or five men?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That only applies to <Col N="62" /> minor curers who become licensees. The Minister may direct the Board to allocate any quota that he wishes to specify, and I think that is quite a good deterrent for what the Deputy has in mind.  The Deputy, I think, will see that this section, taken with Section 37, was put in to cover cases of more or less the same type.  You have three classes.  You have, first, the factories which do not even qualify to become minor curers.  They can be compensated under Section 36. Then we have those who were minor curers for the past two years and who may not qualify to become licensees. We are providing that they may be compensated at that stage.  Thirdly, we had the factories&mdash;there was at least one&mdash;which went out of business although licensed at the time when they had to make certain reconstructions. They had to incur a good deal of capital expenditure under the Act. It is to cover that class that Section 37 was put in.  It is not intended to apply in the wholesale way that the Deputy speaks of.  The Bacon Marketing Board under this might, perhaps, close down a factory where there were obviously too many factories in a particular city or town, and, having done that, issue new licences to some persons to move to another town.  I am not very keen on this section having general application.  If it were to apply to cases that were going out as a result of this legislation, I would not be quite satisfied.  I may perhaps be able to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to deal with this.</P>

      <P>No.  I propose to raise the principle contained in the amendment on the section, because it may be that the Minister and ourselves are at one on it.  I am withdrawing the amendment in Deputy McGilligan's name, reserving the right to introduce it on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not want, to precipitate a split in the Fianna Fáil Party and I think that, by a little tactful argument on the section itself, we might be able to arrive at a substantial agreement.  If we do not succeed in arriving at a substantial agreement, then we can lock horns on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it must be remembered that there is a very big difficulty here.  I can quite understand Deputies arguing on the principle of this, but there is a very big difficulty. There is the question of departing altogether from the scheme of the Principal Act.  Under the Principal Act we have a Pigs Marketing Board composed partly of producer members and partly of curer members, and a chairman.  According to that Act, three curer members shall be elected in accordance with the Act by the Bacon Marketing Board, and three producer members shall be nominated in accordance with the Act.  The curer members are persons who are ordinary members of the Bacon Marketing Board, and the producer members are persons who are representative of pig producers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put a person representing the minor curers on that would be out of line with the legislation.  There might be an argument for putting a person to represent them on the Bacon Marketing Board, if it is felt that the minor curers are not adequately represented on it.  They are not adequately represented at present, but they will be.  At present the case is that you have a certain number representing curers who produce between them about 80 per cent. of the production. There are not very many of these curers, and then there is the large number of minor curers &mdash;16 or 17 of them&mdash;although the quantity of bacon produced is very small.  Accordingly, the number of people in the small category would be very large, as compared with the people in the other category&mdash; perhaps three times as large&mdash;but the smaller curers under the Principal Act would have only two representatives as against three representatives for the others.  We could alter that <Col N="65" /> representation in many ways, such as by amending the Principal Act by changing the limits obtaining at present with regard to those under 23,000 cwts. a year in the small curers' category and so on.  That, however, would be a rather cumbersome way of amending the Act, and I think that the best way to amend this would be if we were to agree that these smaller curers should get better representation on the Bacon Marketing Board, and then they would naturally have their influence in getting representation on the Pigs Marketing Board.  I think that is the best way to do it, and besides it would be more in line with the Principal Act.  If I were to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage, it would be along these lines.  I think that one or two small amendments would be sufficient if we were to follow along those lines, but I am afraid that, if we were to follow the lines suggested by Deputy McGilligan, a large number of consequential amendments would be necessary, and, as I say, it would be altogether out of line with the Principal Act.  I would be prepared to bring in an amendment on the lines I have suggested, but it must be remembered that it could not apply until the next elective period, which would be about 1938.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Well, you can do either of two things: You can raise the smaller class from one to two, or from two to three, and so on, as the case may be, on the Bacon Marketing Board, or you can say that it shall consist hereafter of two from one class and one from the class of small curers who have been minor curers, and make them a new category.  I see the Minister's difficulty.  The difficulty is that, <Col N="66" /> in the Principal Act, the representatives on the Bacon Marketing Board elect representatives on the Pigs Marketing Board, and if we were to put direct representatives on the Pigs Marketing Board, it would upset things.  I forget how many representatives the Bacon Marketing Board can put on the Pigs Marketing Board.</P>

      <P>Well, I would not be surprised if the Minister brought in an amendment designed to put these minor curers, who are to be small curers, in such a position as to have a representative for themselves on the Bacon Marketing Board.  If that were done, I think that the point raised by Deputy McGilligan would be substantially met. I cannot say that with certainty, but I imagine that Deputy McGilligan's point would be met.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The other amendment, proposing an enlargement, would be different, however, and, in fact, it might be more resented by the small curers.  It would be all right for the minor curers, at any rate, but I cannot guarantee as to the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, I think, Sir, it is wiser to withdraw Deputy <Col N="67" /> McGilligan's amendment, and when Deputy McGilligan has perused the report of what has just now passed it may be unnecessary to put down an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 40 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, Sir: this deals with the elections of curer members of the Pigs Marketing Board and the nomination of producer members of the said board.  Now, I am in a difficulty, because the rules of procedure in this House preclude Deputies from referring to persons who are not here to defend themselves. We have two producer members on the Pigs Marketing Board for the past two years.  During that time, in my judgment, the interests of the producers have been absolutely jettisoned time after time.  On one occasion at least, the producer members of the board came out and publicly admitted that they had consented to the price which had been fixed for pigs&mdash;a price which, they admitted, was wholly unsatisfactory considering the price of bacon.  Deputies must remember that if one member of the Pigs Marketing Board says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to any proposal, then the determination of the question must be made by the chairman of the board.  I quite see that the producer members might never be able to do more than to throw a decision into the hands of the chairman, but that they are always able to do, and if they found that the chairman consistently sacrificed the interests of the producers to those of the curers, they could, quite legitimately, go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We will no longer accept the responsibility which you put upon us by your nomination of us as producer members of the board.  All we can do for the producer is to throw the decision into the hands of the chairman. We are of opinion that the chairman is not doing substantial justice to producers, and we shall no longer remain members of the board.&rdquo;  They never have done that.  I say they have most notoriously betrayed the interests of pig producers on divers occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I ask the Minister: is he satisfied that both the gentlemen whom he nominated as producers' representatives on the Pigs Marketing Board have experience of raising pigs?  One gentleman comes from the Midlands and the other comes from Cavan.  I do not know anything about Cavan and I do not know whether the Cavan gentleman is a pig producer or not. As regards the gentleman who comes from the Midlands, I have no reason to believe that he has any long experience in pig-producing, but unless he is a gentleman who has some knowledge of the production costs of fattening pigs or a gentleman who has some knowledge of how the industry is carried on, he is not a fit person to sit on the board.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister whether he is satisfied with the work these gentlemen have done, and if not, whether he will take steps to put on the board experienced producers who will not be afraid to voice the views of the average producer in the country and who will not be afraid, when the chairman has made a decision that, in their opinion, militates against the interests of the producers of the country, to throw up their jobs and to protest in public against the sacrifice of the interests which they were nominated to represent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that they were experienced pig producers who had a very definite knowledge of costings and of pig-production.  As a matter of fact, one of the gentlemen referred to had actually spoken publicly over the wireless and in many other places on that very subject of the costings of pig-feeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many a man spoke over the wireless who knew damn little of what he was talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. But it was for that reason principally that these men were chosen&mdash;that they <Col N="69" /> did devote attention to that subject and had a good knowledge of the costing business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that the section was put down in this form and this change made is, not that I was dissatisfied with the representatives, but a three-year period makes it awkward in this way.  First of all, we had three representatives and they were all there for one period.  You may say that you must have some continuity and that you must leave at least some of three on the board in order to carry on the tradition whatever it may have been.  I think it is not a good thing that a man should be led to think that he has a life interest in the job, as then he may not be so assiduous as he should be in representing the producers. That is why it is proposed to reduce the term of office to two years. We can take on one man at one time and two at another time.  In that way you will have continuity and at the same time new blood coming in.  That is the amendment of the section which is proposed, and I think the House will agree that the term should be shortened for that reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I must say that on a few occasions I felt, as the Deputy <Col N="70" /> feels now, that they had not put the producers' case as strongly as they might, but after inquiry from the chairman I did not feel that I was entitled to treat these men as schoolboys and say: &ldquo;I will put you off if you do not do your business.&rdquo;  After inquiry from the chairman, I must say that I was satisfied that they had done their best for the producers.  The Deputy is working on the assumption that the curers could pay more.  We are all inclined to think that, but we can only find out definitely when the Prices Tribunal reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a meeting of pig producers in this city, and two at least of the producer members of the board were present.  One of them admitted that they had not considered the cost of feeding stuffs, and the meeting proceeded on the assumption that they had objected to the prices fixed for pigs when somebody suddenly called out: &ldquo;If you did not consider the price of feeding stuffs, how could you have objected to the price fixed?&rdquo; Then the member said: &ldquo;I fought it as long as I could, but in the end I had to agree to it for peace sake.&rdquo;  If the Minister is not satisfied that some of these gentlemen have no practical experience in pig production, will he take steps to change them?  I entirely agree with the Minister that the man who is in the habit of producing only 12 pigs may be just as useful as a man who is able to rear <Col N="71" /> 200 pigs.  In fact, I would rather have a big producer, a medium producer, and a small producer on this board representing producers as a whole.  Is the Minister satisfied that any one of these gentlemen has no practical experience of pig production at all?</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this Part of this Act the weight of a carcase of a pig shall be ascertained by weighing such carcase when it is eviscerated and not later than one hour after slaughter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill the pigs must be weighted immediately after slaughter, because under the Weights and Measures Act no curer is entitled to deduct the customary 3 lbs. which he has deducted up to this; that practice must stop.  The weights and measures <Col N="73" /> authorities will allow them to carry on, on the understanding that this Bill is coming in.  When this Bill is passed they will have to pay on the full weight, and they must have the pig weighed hot.  Certain curers put it to me that, if they were to avail of this section as it stands, that is, to wait for the hour, probably the producer would be deprived of the price of about 1 lb. of pork, and that any curer could weigh within half-an-hour.  In that way the producer will be better safeguarded. We are, therefore, changing &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; to &ldquo;half-an-hour.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 58 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a pig is offered for sale at licensed premises or premises registered in the register of minor curers upon terms that the price thereof is to be determined after slaughter, it shall not be lawful for the licensee in respect of such licensed premises or the person registered in respect of such premises to purchase such pig except upon such terms.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any person being a licensee or registered minor curer purchases any pig in contravention of this section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been, not exactly evasion, but some inconvenience, and even perhaps I might say illegality, practised on producers from time to time by certain factories.  Where the producer sends his pigs to the factory to be purchased direct, the factory has agreed to take the pigs only on the <Col N="75" /> live weight basis.  This amendment would have the effect of compelling the factory to take them either on the dead weight or on the live weight basis, as the producer decides.  I think Deputies will agree that that is a good provision, especially when pigs are plentiful.  Of course, at the present time I need hardly say that the factories are very anxious to please, and will take them either on the dead weight or the live weight basis, as the producer may decide; but when pigs are plentiful, as they may be in the autumn, the factories will be more particular about the pigs they take.  They will be more inclined not to take pigs at all if they can avoid it, but have agents out buying them lower than the fixed price. This is one amendment; there are other provisions coming along which will have the effect, in the first place, of compelling the factories to take pigs from any producer if the producer so opts, and under this amendment they are compelled also to take them by dead weight if the producer asks them to do so.</P>

      <P>At the moment pigs would only be purchased when there is a general surplus. This section gives power to purchase pigs where there is a surplus in a particular area or in a particular county.  The amendment goes further and says that the board may purchase &ldquo;in a particular case in a particular area.&rdquo;  It may be necessary for the board at times to purchase pigs to get over a difficulty, although there is not a surplus.  As some Deputies are aware there was a position in Donegal, in Monaghan and in some Border counties during last autumn, and the previous autumn which did not obtain in any parts of the South.  There was not a general surplus, not even a county surplus, and if the factories in Donegal had played the game properly there would not have been any surplus.  What was really happening was that agents were going around buying pigs and selling them to the factories.  It was impossible to control that position under the Act as it stood.</P>

God knows what they may do with them.  They can either sell them direct to the factories or send <Col N="77" /> them there to be cured on their account, export them as live pigs, or do all the other things mentioned in the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>The only comment I have to make is that I do not see why the Minister does not avail of the machinery already there.  This section is designed to achieve a very pious purpose but, at the same time, it finishes for all time the pig dealers of this country.  This is giving the board permission, by its agents, to deal in pigs, whenever pigs are available for purchase, by persons other than the factories.  The House has heard the Minister say that the board has power to sell to the factories, to get the pigs killed on their account or to export them.  Why does the Minister not avail of the machinery of the Pig Dealers' Association?  It includes a couple of hundred men, all of whom have their own connection in the British market, and can place every type of pig that is brought into a fair.  They will sell a fat, heavy pig in one place, a pork pig in another place, a half-finished store pig in another district, and a forward store in another area. It does not matter what type of pig is brought to a market, the pig jobbers will be able to dispose of them in the best markets through one or other of the connections they have got in the trade.  They are anxious to do it, and they can do it more efficiently and cheaper than any other machinery.  We are now going to set up the Pigs Marketing Board to do that work.  We all know what happens when Government Departments try to handle the extremely complex and difficult business of foreign trade.  They generally make a mess of it.  We know the lamentations there have been about the Government's experiments in selling eggs, in selling butter, in selling cattle abroad, and in selling fowl.  Practically every commodity which they have sought to sell in foreign markets has resulted in catastrophic losses and ludicrous confusion. Some of the eggs that they sold to people in Spain are still unpaid for.  A pair of chickens was exported to Belgium at one time and they did a tour of Europe before they found a refuge, I think, in Folkestone.</P>

Why does the Government not use the pig jobbers?  I am satisfied that if there was a temporary surplus in a district, or if a factory was dishonestly paying people less than they were entitled to, the pig dealers would be prepared to go and create a market in any centres where the Minister agreed that the pigs should be taken from the people at a fair price, or dispose of them to factories or export them, whichever way would get the best price for the producers.  Why does not the Minister do that?  What hatred has he for the pig dealers?  I have a long experience of cattle dealers and horse dealers, and I say without hesitation that you can always trust a pig dealer, less often you can trust a cattle dealer but you can never trust a horse dealer.

      <P>Let us not name our supporters in this House because that would lead us farther astray than Claremorris and some of the embryos that Fianna Fáil gathered to their bosom there.  I put it to the Minister that these pig dealers could make a material contribution to the industry, that they are an excellent body of men <Col N="79" /> and that the effect of this section will be to destroy their business and to bankrupt some of them.  They are there ready to do the job.  They are good citizens.  As the Government is always pleading the desire to create employment, why do they not leave these men their employment. They are quite prepared to earn their own living.  They do not want to be helped by anyone. They are prepared to co-operate with the general policy laid down by the Oireachtas.  Why attempt to destroy them, and to send comparatively inefficient people to do their job?  Has the Minister considered the possibility of having what he wants done under this section being better done by seeking the co-operation of the pig dealers? I have reason to believe that if he asks the pig dealers he will get all the co-operation he wants.  I am convinced that if he goes that way about his work it will be better done than it could be done under this section.  Has the Minister consulted the pig dealers in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy on the Second Stage that we had tried that matter out in Donegal, that we had got the genuine pig dealers together, that we had advertised live pig markets in Donegal, issued special quotas for the export of live pigs by these dealers, and made arrangements with some of the factories in the South to take pigs from them.  They tried that, but they were not very successful. They continued to go to the markets for some time, and eventually the markets fell through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a distinction between them, because if I <Col N="80" /> were to say that this was aimed at pig buyers the Deputy would say they were not the people he had in mind. This is aimed at alleged pig buyers who formed a ring, bought pigs below the fixed price, and sold them to the factory.  I had the genuine pig buyer in mind, and that is why this particular amendment appears with the words in it, &ldquo;if authorised by the Minister.&rdquo;  I do not want the board, if they had any intention of doing so, to take over the buying of pigs entirely in this country.  Therefore, I agreed to put in this amendment, that in particular cases, and for a limited time, if the board could convince me that they had a good case for operating this section, I would give them that permission, but it would be limited both in area and time.  I think the Deputy need have no fears, because I personally would, and I believe the Department, as long as they can prevail on any other Minister who might be there, will advise him to resist the board if they were to ask for powers to do all the buying themselves.  I can assure the Deputy that this power will be only used in a limited way and that the genuine pig buyer will be permitted to carry on, as he is at present, making a living.  I might also say that when I put that matter to the board the board said to me that in all probability they would put this business through the genuine pig buyer, if such is to be got in the particular instance.  I think the Deputy need not have any fear about that.</P>

      <P>This again raises the question I referred to as the alleged dealers.  This section enables a producer to send pigs direct to the factory, if he so wishes. If he notifies the board that he has pigs which he wishes to have consigned direct to the factory, the board may, under this section, authorise the factory to accept them.  I am offering this amendment because the words &ldquo;produced by him&rdquo; might possibly be interpreted as meaning produced to the factory.  I do not know exactly what the word &ldquo;produced&rdquo; in the section would mean, but it is better to make it clear that it would not be possible for an agent to go out and collect pigs, bring them in to his own premises, and then deliver them to the factory.  It would destroy the whole effect of the section if that were permitted. We therefore provide that the pigs must be on the premises of the person for at least four weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us is it, or is it not, true that the hypothetical price fund is now being used largely to help the Exchequer to pay subsidies.  The original purpose of the hypothetical price fund was dual: (1) to make the price of pigs to the producer artificially attractive in the spring for the purpose of inducing the producer of bacon pigs to keep small potatoes, and such-like fortuitous food supplies, over from the date on which they came to hand until the spring, when they could be advantageously used from a community point of view in the production of pigs.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it has been largely used for subsidising exports of bacon to England when the bounty provided by the Exchequer did not equal the tariff paid on bacon.  I submit that that was pure robbery of the producer, as every penny of the fund was taken from the producers in the autumn, because they were paid an artificially depressed price and they never got an artificially increased price.  At the present moment, they are only getting 75/- for Grade A1 pigs; that means that they are getting an average price of between 70/- and 72/- for all the pigs delivered at the factory.  Bacon is <Col N="84" /> being sold at present in Saorstát Eireann at 116/- to 120/-.</P>
      <P>If the curers are getting 120/- for bacon, they ought to be paying from 95/- to 100/- for pigs&mdash;say, 95/-.  If they are getting 120/- for bacon, they ought to be paying 95/- for pigs at least.  If the hypothetical price fund was functioning, there should be added to that economic price of 95/- about 10/- from the price fund.  So that the pig producer who should be getting 105/- a cwt. at this time for his pigs when bacon is being sold at 120/-, is, in fact, getting only 71/- a cwt. Few Deputies understand the hypothetical price.  It is based entirely on the money that was taken from the pig producer last September, October and November, on the clear understanding and promise that if he kept in pig production and brought pigs out in the spring, he would get it all back.  Has he got one penny of it back?  I say he has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that perhaps the Deputy is not approaching this as another person might approach it.  I do not say that he is right or that he is wrong.  If there is a certain amount taken in the home market the price is regulated by supply and demand.  If the curers get 120/-, taking the quantity available into account, then the Pigs Board take that into account, that the price is 120/- per cwt., and they also take into account the cost of the production of pigs at certain times of the year when the price was 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. better than it was last spring.  They have fixed the price at the moment at 75/- and if at the moment bacon is 120/- then they say: &ldquo;We can afford to take the levy off that&rdquo;; and that is the difference between the hypothetical price and the fixed price.  If we had no exports at all, if we had nothing but the home market probably that is the way it would operate.  You fix a fair price the whole year round and then levy off the bacon curers when they are getting good prices and pay them back when the prices are lower; that is how it operates.  However, exports come in and complicate matters. I gave the figures here on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, <Col N="85" /> and I showed as well as I could make out the figures, that the difference between the subsidies paid on the exports last year and the tariff collected was somewhere between £60,000 and £80,000.</P>
      <P>That amount is taken out of the hypothetical fund.  But we have a similar position as in the butter business, and that is that even if the curer were paying no tariff going into England, the price he is getting is a good deal lower there than here, and, therefore, he is compensated for the exports. That is because the export market is not as good as the home market; the amount that is paid equalises the tariff.  The difference between the tariff and the subsidy going out is comparatively small.  I was making inquiries about this matter a few days ago.  I think the amount collected on this fund would be well over £500,000 a year, and the amount paid out is nearly the same.  There is only £60,000 as a levy to bring the amount paid in subsidies up to the amount paid in tariffs.  Up to this it has not all been paid out of the exports on bacon.  This money is paid out during the short intervals during which they have appointed a price higher than the hypothetical price.  In the majority of cases they paid out of that hypothetical fund on all bacon produced whether it was exported or sold at home.</P>

      <P>It is well that Deputy Donnelly should know that his rasher of bacon has a levy on it every morning to compensate producers for their <Col N="86" /> losses on the British market.  I do not know the Deputy knew that before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly is neither wise nor relevant.  It is well to realise that the exports are at present being subsidised out of the levy on bacon purchased by the Irish consumer.  We are paying in rural Ireland to-day 1/3 a lb. for salty bacon so that the British consumers can have it for 11d. or 1/- a lb.  At what level are we going to stop raising prices to the Irish consumer in order to sell bacon at cheaper prices in Great Britain?  I am advised that we may expect soon to be charging in the West of Ireland 1/6 a lb. for bacon. Up to what level does the Minister think it is wise to force the price on our own people in order to subsidise the price to Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Minister again and again that with or without his knowledge the curers have formed themselves into a ring, and I now publicly allege that the Bacon Marketing Board sent to the minor curers a circular saying that they were not charging their customers enough, because these minor curers were charging a price that had not been fixed by the ring.  I want to remind the House that the Bacon Marketing Board has no authority to fix the price of bacon.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister expect me to produce it?  The Minister is in a position to get what I could not get.  I cannot produce to the Minister <Col N="87" /> written proof of all that is going on in the bacon industry.  It is with the greatest difficulty I managed to get the information I got, and it is because I am able to use it to put the wind up these fellows that I have some hope here that we can have some control over them.</P>
      <P>I cannot get at the secret archives of these bacon curers, who seem to think they can do what they like. I am not in their confidence.  On the contrary, they do not like me at all and I see no prospect of their changing in regard to me.  This much I do know&mdash;that whatever I find I will checkmate them, and if I am ever responsible for the control of Irish industry they will have to obey me and toe the line.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to tell us how far he thinks it right that the hypothetical price fund should be used to pay bounties on the price of bacon. I think it ought to be used exclusively for the purpose of raising the hypothetical price over the fixed price. Remember, it is in time of plenty, when we have a great number of pigs, that the levy is collected&mdash;you collect it on, perhaps, 1,000,000 pigs in the autumn&mdash;and it is in the time of scarcity that you distribute it, so that the levy gathered off 1,000,000 pigs is distributed on, perhaps, 500,000 pigs. There ought to be double as much bounty paid out in spring to producers as there is collected from them in the autumn.  They are not getting it and in that sense the producers are being robbed.</P>

We devised it for the purpose of securing for the farmers a better price in spring out of the moneys levied in the autumn.  Those moneys that we intended should be given back to the producer are now being stolen away and handed to the curers in order to subsidise them in the export market.  Is that fair?

If we did not pay the subsidy our producers could not get the prices they are getting.  It is all because the English market is a bad market, if you like to have it that way.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £7,726 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Pinsean Créachta agus Mí-ábaltachta, Pinsean Breise agus Pinsean Fear Pósta, Liúntaisí agus Aiscí (Uimh. 26 de 1923, Uimh. 12 de 1927, Uimh. 24 de 1932, agus Uimh. 15 de 1937), Pinsean Seirbhíse Míleata (Uimh. 48 de 1924 agus Uimh. 43 de 1934), Pinsean, Liúntaisí agus Aiscí (Uimh. 37 de 1936), agus chun Síntiúisí agus Costaisí Iolardha ina dtaobh san, etc.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £7,726 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, and No. 15 of 1937) Military Service Pensions (No. 48 of 1924, and No. 43 of 1934), Pensions, Allowances, and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936), and for Sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Estimate for £7,726 covers the amount which it is anticipated will come in course of payment during the present financial year in respect of pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Army Pensions Act, 1937, and the Connaught Rangers Act, 1936. The amount is made up as follows:&mdash; Wound and disability pensions and gratuities under the new Act, £2,948; <Col N="95" /> allowances and gratuities to dependents under the new Act, £2,094; Connaught Rangers pensions and gratuities, £2,684.  The part of the Vote which relates to the Connaught Rangers is really a revote.  It was included in last year's Estimate but we had not the matter cleared up and we have to renew the provision in the present financial year.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell me whether, under the various Acts under which this money is being distributed, a case of this kind is covered &mdash;a man who fought in 1916 and who, as a result of sickness obviously contracted as a consequence of his service in 1916, coupled with the subsequent imprisonment, dies and leaves a widow and children.  They already have a pension under some previous Act.  Do the terms of any of these Acts operate to increase that pension for the widow or the provision for the children?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister vouchsafe us any explanation of why it is deemed desirable to give Mr. Buckley £2,000 as a present?  I can understand the pension; I can understand paying the debts contracted during his term of office, but for what is the £2,000? Is that to provide him with a holiday after his heavy labours while in office? Is he threatened with a nervous breakdown from overwork?</P>
