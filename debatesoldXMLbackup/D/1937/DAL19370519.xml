      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has approved the proposal to acquire as a housing site Fethard military barracks; whether he will state what is causing the delay in proceeding with the proposed housing scheme at that site, and whether, having regard to the urgent need for housing accommodation, and the large number of unemployed men in the town, he will take steps to expedite the inauguration of this scheme.</P>

      <P>Subject to compliance with the provisions of the State Lands Act, 1924, I have approved of the acquisition of a site at Fethard military barracks for housing purposes. When the procedure under the Act of 1924 has been complied with, there will be no avoidable delay in having the houses erected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to a statement made at a recent meeting of the nurses' organisation to the effect that a nurse in a certain public hospital in Kerry had completed 23 years of night nursing without change of duty, at a salary of £60 per annum; and if he will inquire if similar conditions prevail in other public hospitals under his control, and take steps to remedy such conditions where they exist.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  I am, however, aware that in Cahirciveen hospital a nurse was continuously employed on night duty.  When this case was brought to the notice of the Department, in October, 1934, representations were made to the board of health, and steps subsequently taken by the Department to secure the appointment of an additional nurse. Under present arrangements, none of the nurses will be required to do continuous night duty.  I am aware that similar conditions exist in certain public hospitals, and have been making efforts to induce the local authorities concerned to alter this system which I regard as quite improper.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the non-contributory pension awarded to Mrs. Jane Davis, Aughrisbeg, Claddaghduff, County Galway, under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, has since been withdrawn, and a demand made upon her for the refund of £14, the amount of the pension paid to her subsequent to the 4th February, 1936, and if he will state for what reason the pension has been so withdrawn, and whether it is his intention to restore it as from the date of withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The pension was withdrawn because Mrs. Davis ceased as from 11th February, 1936, to comply with Section 19 (b) of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.  The answer to the last part of the question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, is he aware that the qualification mentioned is that Mrs. Davis should occupy the farm that belonged to her husband; and is he aware that she no longer occupies that farm, simply for the reason that she changed over to another holding that had been created by the Land Commission and to which nobody else would go because of the <Col N="697" /> nature of the land and because there were no turbary rights, and that, in fact, she is in the same position, as far as being an occupier of agricultural land is concerned, as she was before she changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 (b) of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1936, provides that the widow of a man who was, at the date of his death, a smallholder, shall be entitled to a pension if and so long as such widow is resident on the holding by virtue of the occupation of which her husband was a smallholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary now telling us that, because a woman gets a pension by virtue of the occupation of a holding such as that, she can be deprived of that pension if she changes over to another holding created by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is the legal position.  I quoted the law for the Deputy.  The Deputy, of course, knows that the Act has been amended in the meantime, and her claim to a pension could be examined again under the amending Act.  Under the 1935 Act, however, she could not continue to draw the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Parliamentary Secretary does admit that her pension was stopped simply because she changed from a holding she occupied to a holding, of no greater valuation, newly created by the Land Commission, and that her pension is stopped because of that reason and she is asked to pay back £14.  If that is so&mdash;and I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that that is so&mdash;can the Parliamentary Secretary state that the amending Act will not only make this woman entitled to a pension but will cover the period in respect to which the pension was stopped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out to the Deputy that the pension was stopped in this case in accordance with Section 19 (b) of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act of 1935. <Col N="698" /> It is not a matter of administration at all.  It is a matter of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it would not be unfair to summarise the speeches <Col N="705" /> that were made from the opposite benches last night into the single point that we should have been represented at the Imperial Conference at present being held in London.  It was suggested by speakers that there were matters in which we were interested being discussed at this conference, and that accordingly so long as we remain associated with the States of the British Commonwealth we should have been there.  Now, I am not going to deny for one moment that there are matters in which we are interested being discussed, but there are matters which affect us much more nearly and directly which will not be discussed there, matters which are clearly matters to be settled between Great Britain and ourselves, matters in which the other States of the British Commonwealth would be slow indeed to interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clearly understood by the people when we were being elected in 1932 that we proposed taking advantage of the situation&mdash;whatever advantages were to be got from it&mdash;for the benefit of our own people.  It was in that spirit that we sent a delegation to Ottawa in 1932, shortly after we were elected.  But what did we find? Whilst our representatives were on the way, the British Government imposed penal tariffs on our produce, with a view to compelling us to hand over moneys which we were satisfied were not due.  Indeed, when they arrived there, the question had to be decided as to whether, in view of the imposition of those tariffs and the change in the situation from the time they had left, our delegates should not immediately return.  They would have returned were it not for the fact that they had gone to Canada not on the invitation of Great Britain but on the invitation of the Canadian Government. I want to say that, so far as our delegates were concerned, the Canadian Government did everything in their power to ease what was a very difficult situation.  Our delegates were treated as if they were delegates from a country that could not be depended on to keep its word; that we were outside the Pale; that we had no regard for treaties or agreements, and, therefore, that it would be idle <Col N="706" /> to make agreements or treaties with the representatives of such a people. Now, that was a humiliating position, and it would not have been tolerated at all were it not for the fact that the invitation on account of which our delegates had been sent was an invitation from a Government and a people with whom we had no quarrel of any kind.</P>
    <P>It may be that certain advantages might be derived for our country by our being represented at the conference going on in Britain at the present time, but there would have been very grave losses in doing it, and I do not think that it would make either for the settlement of the outstanding disputes between Great Britain and ourselves or for peace between the two peoples that our representatives should run the risk of being put in the same humiliating position in which they were put at Ottawa.  Besides, our being there would be open to very grave misunderstanding.  Those who are meeting there at the present time are representatives of Governments who have settled whatever disputes existed amongst themselves.  There is no outstanding point of difference between them; there are no disputes to be settled.  They are there in a common effort to do certain things which will be for the general benefit. If we went there, it would be assumed that the position between Great Britain and Ireland had reached such a point that we also could sit in as people who had settled their own differences, people who, having settled their differences, were then prepared to co-operate in their mutual interests. But that is not the situation, and we must be quite clear that that is not the situation.  There are outstanding matters between Great Britain and ourselves which will have to be settled before there can be, between the people of this country and the people of Great Britain, the co-operation and the good feeling which I at any rate would wish to see brought about.</P>
    <P>Before I go into the details about those matters in dispute, I want to repeat what I have said many a time &mdash;that, from the time at which I had first any responsibility placed upon <Col N="707" /> my shoulders in regard to the relations between Great Britain and Ireland, I have uniformly sought to bring about good relations between the two peoples on the only basis on which those good relations could rest, and that is justice and fair play between the two peoples.  You have no other foundation on which you could secure goodwill and co-operation between the peoples except that. There has not been justice done to our people, and until that justice is done it is vain for any individual to hope to bring about between the peoples of the two countries the relations which every right-minded person would like to see brought about.</P>
    <P>Now, what are the outstanding things?  There are three outstanding things as far as the people of this country and the people of Britain are concerned.  There is first and foremost the fundamental question of the partition of our country.  On no plea that I can see can the partition of our country be justified.  Deputy MacDermot has frequently tried to make a case for it by suggesting that that was due to something here, and was not the result of British action at all.  I deny that; I deny it absolutely. I say that the partition of our country would not have been dreamt of were it not for the action of British politicians.  What is the basis for the plea that this country should be divided?  We will suppose there were some people in Ireland who wanted it.  What is the basis which they can make for the claim for the partition of our country? Unfortunately, I have no statistics that I can rely on except those of religion.  I regret that very much, because fundamentally, in my opinion anyhow, this is a political and not a religious question, but it does happen that very largely those who are Protestant are Unionist and those who are Catholic are for the independence and unity of this country, for the political separation of Great Britain and Ireland.  Those form the only basis, the only statistics, available for a comparison.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position? The position is that there are in this country roughly 75 per cent. who are Catholic.  There are only 25 per cent. Protestant, and the number of Unionists is less than that in the whole island.  Therefore, those who make a plea for the partition of this island make it on the basis that 25 per cent. of the population are entitled to cut themselves away because they differ politically from the majority.  The protection of the minority is the plea that is put forward, and it is always suggested that it is a homogeneous minority.  Homogeneous in what area?  Let us examine it.  There is no area in which there is anything like homogeneity. In Belfast City, which would probably be the centre of it, you have over 22 per cent. of the population which are not Unionist and are against Britain.  Again, on the figure that I have taken&mdash;the only thing that I could get in the way of a figure which would even approximate to the position, and that is the figure in regard to religion&mdash;there are some 95,000 Catholics in the City of Belfast.  Twenty-two per cent. of the people of that city, which is the central point of it, are Catholics, and they desire the unity of this country. In Belfast you have a population of Catholics which is bigger than that of the City of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in itself, ought to dispose of this suggestion of homogeneity.  There is no such thing as a homogeneous body in the North of Ireland.  The question of coercion is also referred to.  We made it clear time after time&mdash;we made it explicitly clear in our correspondence with Mr. Lloyd George in 1921&mdash;that there was no thought, so far as the majority of the people of this country were concerned, of using force to coerce the people of any part of the country. Who are they who talk about coercion? Is coercion not being used within the Six Counties?  Coercion is being used in that area on 33 per cent. of the population. Thirty-three per cent. of the population there are being coerced into <Col N="709" /> obeying the laws which are being enacted for that area.  We hear that Partition was originally justified because of the protection it would afford a minority&mdash;a minority of 25 per cent. of the whole island.  Here is a minority of 33 per cent., and they are being coerced at the present time. Therefore, I say that the partition of the country has not protected minorities, but has inflicted very grievous damage upon 33 per cent. of the inhabitants of that area.</P>
    <P>Six counties were cut off.  On what grounds?  The only ground was that this was the largest area which they could hope to hold permanently with the aid of a majority in one little part. There was no justification in cutting off East Down, South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh or Derry City.  There was no justification whatever for that.  All these areas are contiguous to the boundary of the areas in which there is an overwhelming majority against Partition.  There was no justification whatever for cutting them off save to give to the majority in the North-East the biggest area they could hope to hold.  I want every Deputy to realise&mdash;I have a map here showing the position&mdash;that it is only in that little portion of the Six Counties &mdash;less than half of it&mdash;that you have any population which could be said to be Unionist.  The Unionists are in a majority in about half the area and, in the adjoining portions, the population is almost half and half.  Consequently, there cannot be any satisfactory settlement between Great Britain and Ireland so long as that unjust position is allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can make the case again.  As I understood him on more than one occasion here, he made the case that we were the people who were responsible for that position and that, if we were reasonable, it could be remedied.  I say that this division of our country was made in a foreign Parliament.  It does not correspond with any reality.  Even the Boundary Commission, set up by the Treaty, referred to the will of the inhabitants. The will of the inhabitants of these areas was never ascertained.  Consequently, there is no use in anybody saying we should go over to the Imperial Conference, sit down there and act with the British as the representatives of the people of South Africa, Canada and Australia are acting. There is a fundamental question there which has got to be settled somehow. Otherwise, you cannot have that co-operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The figures I have are from the 1926 Census, and, as I stated, they are the figures of the number of Catholics and others.  In Derry City which is on the Border, there are 27,000 Catholics and only 18,000 others. There are, therefore, one and a half times as many Catholics as there are members of other denominations, and yet that city has been taken away and put into the partitioned area.  In Belfast there are over 95,000&mdash;the nearest thousand would be 96&mdash;Catholics and 319,000 others.  In County Tyrone there are 73,000 Catholics &mdash; the nearest thousand is 74&mdash;as against 59,000 others.</P>

      <P>I am making a speech at those who want to know why we are not there.  The figures for County Fermanagh are 32,000 Catholics to 26,000, to the nearest thousand, others. These are figures that tell their own story, and this map tells its own story. As it is unjust that that division should take place, I say, fully conscious of everything that it implies, that you cannot get the same sort of co-operation between the people of this country and the people of Britain, so long as that injustice remains unsettled.  That is one point, the partition of our country, and that is one of the reasons why we are not there.  If they say, &ldquo;We have done this thing and we cannot coerce Ulster,&rdquo; I say, why coerce half of the Six Counties?  Let it be fair, and, if there is to be no coercion, let there be no coercion all round.  There is coercion being used against our people in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is the land annuities, the financial dispute.  We hold, and we have given the basis of our case, that these moneys and, in particular, the land annuities, are not due to Britain.  We say that Britain handed over these moneys in the 1920 Act. They did it deliberately and voluntarily and there has been no retraction of that handing over.  There is no question of a retraction of that gift, as it was called, and I will read for the House what Mr. Lloyd George said about it in a few minutes.  There is <Col N="712" /> no taking away of that money in the Treaty.  That money, in justice, belongs to our people and I do not care how you approach the question of the land annuities&mdash;whether you approach it from the general point of view that this was Irish land which was originally taken away from our nation and given to adventurers and that it, therefore, is right that if there is to be restitution we ought not to bear the cost of the restitution, or from the point of view that there was a Treaty signed, and that that Treaty would naturally leave to this part of the partnership the revenues that were accruing from it, or from the point of view of the narrowest interpretation you like of British law itself&mdash;there is not the slightest doubt in my mind, anyhow, and I say this to Deputy MacDermot at this point, that for us to surrender these moneys, one penny of them, understanding the position as we understand it and believing it to be what we believe it to be, would be unconditional surrender on our part. I say deliberately that so long as this Government is in office, not a single penny of the land annuities money will be paid over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I want to go a little further into this land annuities business. Under the 1920 Act, as we have often pointed out, these moneys were handed over to the Parliaments in the North and in the South.  I have here an outline of the financial provisions of that Act.  It is Command Paper No. 645 of 1920 and this document sets out the anticipated receipts and expenditure of Ireland on the basis of the Estimates for the year 1919-1920. It was later supplemented by a memorandum when the financial year was completed and the two calculations should be based, not on the Estimates, but on the actual Exchequer issues and the actual revenue.  In the first of these memoranda, we have this statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to these revenues...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> that is, the revenues which would come in from death duties, stamp duties, etc., into the Exchequers of the two Parliaments</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Bill places a new source of income at the disposal of the Irish Parliaments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A new source of income&mdash;there was no question now, mind you, of a debt between some private individuals. This was to be an income of the Irish Parliaments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The annuities payable by the tenants who have purchased their holdings under the Land Purchase Acts by way of interest and sinking fund on the purchase moneys amount to £3,262,000.  These annuities are at present collected by the Irish Land Commissioners.  Under the Bill, clause 24, the annuities will be collected by the Irish Governments, but will not be handed over to the Imperial Exchequer.  They will be retained and paid into the Irish Exchequers, while the Imperial Exchequer will assume the liability of making equivalent payments into the funds out of which the interest and sinking fund on the stock are paid.  This free gift...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a British Parliamentary Paper and the term &ldquo;free gift&rdquo; is not mine.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...includes not only existing annuities but those in respect of all sales already agreed upon, although not actually concluded.  Consequently, the £3,262,000 a year will grow as pending sales are disposed of.  The annuities include instalments of capital and, ultimately, as they fall in, the total will begin to diminish and will finally cease about 65 years after the last sales.  The money derived from these annuities will meet the additional expenses incidental to the severance of the two Irish Governments from Great Britain and from one another.  For initial expenses, a sum of £1,000,000 addition will be given to each Irish Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the interpretation by the British themselves of the clauses of the 1920 Act and we ask them to show us where that gift, as they called it, was ever taken back.</P>

      <P>I am going to read this at the moment.  Not merely was it issued in this White Paper, but Mr. Lloyd George, speaking in the House of Commons, on December 22nd, 1919, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is proposed that there should be a grant to each Government of £1,000,000 to cover the initial expenses of setting up the machinery of Government in the two areas. There ought also to be some provision of a permanent character, and the Government propose to provide this surplus out of the land annuities in Ireland....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As this has been typed for me, there are some omissions there.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proposal of the Government is that these annuities are to be handed to the Irish Governments as a free gift for the purpose of development and improvement in Ireland; that these Governments should collect the annuities themselves and retain them, and that the Imperial Government should undertake the burden which is now cast upon it of paying interest and redemption of the stock.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Acceptance of that is not the question.  It is a question of British law.  Great Britain handed this money over, and there has been no retraction.  That was the position when the Treaty was signed.  There is nothing in the Treaty which suggests that these moneys should be paid over to England.  When we put it up to the British Government to show us on what <Col N="716" /> basis they could claim these moneys, the only basis they could show us was two agreements which they said were binding upon us in honour.  One of these agreements was made in 1923, and the other in 1926, the second, they stated, being a confirmation of the first. It is just as well, as Deputies are so obstreperous about this thing, for them to be told that the terms of these agreements were never ratified by Parliament.</P>

I have been talking about the situation, and intended to keep to the situation between Great Britain and ourselves. I say that these agreements were never ratified by Parliament and therefore are not internationally binding.  We have therefore this situation: when the dispute started we tried various means, we had negotiations, and when we met the British in negotiation we got to the point that, if we admitted, although we do believe these moneys are not due, that these moneys were due, then they might graciously consider taking off something&mdash;a mitigation, I think, was the word used&mdash;they might graciously consider a mitigation of this debt. This is not a thing to be laughed over; it is a very serious matter.  This is a burden for our people.</P>

Let me give you some figures to show what the nature of the burden upon us is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very tattered one.  Let us get some idea of the nature of this burden on our people and the reason why our Government, apart altogether from the matter of the principle involved, could not, if they had any regard for the interests of our people, submit to it and agree to make these payments.  The British, in settlement of the American debt, by an agreement made by the present Prime Minister of Great Britain with America, were to pay something like £33,000,000 per year.  We will take our payments roughly at £5,000,000.  On the basis of the £33,000,000 which Britain agreed to pay and which Britain said she could not pay, because it would impose too heavy a burden upon her people, let us have a look at the burden imposed on our people and ask ourselves, as long as that burden is being imposed, whether it is right that the representatives of our people should go over and act with the British as if there were no difference whatever between them.</P>
      <P>Take the basis of the British revenue and our revenue.  Great Britain's debt to the United States could only be 4.3 per cent. of her revenue.  She could not bear that.  I am not saying it was not true, but the plea was made that the payment of that 4.3 per cent. of her revenue would impose a burden beyond the ability of her people to bear, unless the people were to lower their standard of living and suffer a considerable amount of hardship.  Our payment to Great Britain is 18.6 per cent. of our revenue.  Therefore, 4.3 per cent. for Great Britain is a burden too heavy for her to bear; but 18.6 is the burden which gentlemen on the opposite benches say we should undertake, and which Great Britain insists on taking from us.</P>
      <P>If you take the basis of Great Britain's total external trade, the annual payments of the American debt would only amount to 2.4 per cent. of Great Britain's total external trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £5,000,000 there is 8 per cent. of our total trade.  Again I make the point that if 2.4 per cent. is too much of a burden for Britain to bear, then on what basis is 8 per cent. not too much of a burden for us to bear?  If instead <Col N="719" /> of taking the total trade we take our exports and the British exports for comparison, the payment of the American debt would only be 7.5 per cent. of British exports.  They would have only to allocate, so to speak, 7.5 per cent. of their export trade for the payment of the debt.  That would represent its burden upon Britain. But upon us it would represent 22.8 per cent.  It would be a burden of 22.8 per cent. on us as against a burden of 7.5 per cent. on Britain. The position then is that Britain cannot pay 7.5 per cent. and that we can bear 22.8 per cent.  The national income of Britain has been estimated and our national income has been estimated on the same basis.  On the basis of the national income the payment of the British debt to America would only be 8 per cent. whereas, in our case, it would be 3.5 per cent. That is 3.5 per cent. of our national income would have to be devoted to paying this £5,000,000 a year to Great Britain whereas only 8 per cent. of the British national income would have to be set aside to pay their debt to the United States of America.  If we take the burden per head of the population we find that in the case of Britain it would only represent a debt of 14/8, whereas the burden which we would have to bear per head of the population would be £1 13s. 4d. So that instead of having a burden of 14/8 as Great Britain would have, our burden per head of the population would be £1 13s. 4d.  Let me summarise this.  On the basis of revenue, our burden would be four times as heavy as the British burden; on the basis of external trade, our burden would be over three times as heavy as the British burden, and on the basis of exports, it would be over three times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports for the year in which this comparison was made, the year 1936.  On the basis of national income the burden would be over four times, and on the basis per head of the population it is more than twice the British burden.  I simply sum up <Col N="720" /> by saying that if that burden was too much for the British to bear without lowering the general standard of their people, how much more severe is the burden which we are asked to bear? If Deputy Dillon has any point to make about emigration or the standard of living here, he should be with us in resisting the payment of that money.</P>

      <P>Now there is another matter to which I want to refer.  The question of defence was raised and so also was the question about ports. We have been asked by some people on the Opposition Benches whether we are taking any stock of the international situation and of the question of common defence.  We can have no real plan of defence for this country so long as there are parts of our territory which are capable of being occupied by the British at Britain's will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Rhynana is ours <Col N="721" /> completely and absolutely.  It is being fixed up with Irish money and is completely under Irish control.  Our ports, we claim, should belong to us.  We have no desire to see our country used in any way as a basis of attack against Britain.  We want to be a completely free people in charge of our own territory.  We want to participate in none of these wars.  We do not want our country to be used as a basis of attack against Britain. If we had this territory ourselves and if our independence as a nation was completely recognised, it would be our duty to do everything in our power to see that no foreign country would get a footing here on our soil. If that were the position, we at the present time would be organising our people and using our resources to see that the position of our independence would be maintained.  The British have an interest in seeing that no foreign Power would get a foothold here.  Of course they have, and, quite independently of us, they would naturally be anxious to see that such an event as the occupation of our territory by a hostile country should not take place.  It is obvious that they should strengthen us and support us in preventing an attack from outside.  They would have an interest in coming to our aid and we would have an interest in accepting their aid, provided it was quite clear that that aid was used for one reason only and that was to prevent foreigners violating our territory and getting a base upon it.  Under these circumstances, it is quite obvious that you would have the combined strength of the two peoples used to prevent such an attempt.  But there is no such situation now and naturally a large section of our people will say, &ldquo;Why should we bother if the present conditions continue?  We are in the position of inviting foreign attack.&rdquo;  So long as the British occupy certain points along our shores and so long as there is here an agreement which seems to give them a right to claim whatever facilities they want, is it not clear that it is not our will that would be effective in keeping <Col N="722" /> a position of neutrality but the will of other people?</P>
      <P>Consequently there is not a position at the moment in which you could properly organise for national defence.  It is a serious matter and the proper foundation for national defence is the exclusive control of our own country.  We will then have a clear strategic objective towards which to organise our country so that it would be impossible for an outside Power to get a base of occupation here.  It is quite obvious that the people in Britain, for their own safety and not to protect us, would have to give us the assistance which we, for our own sakes, would be anxious to call for, provided it was clear that the whole object of it was to maintain the inviolability of our territory.  We have in this matter of the ports a serious element in the dispute between Great Britain and ourselves.  I point this out because I want to show to those who ask why are we not at present participating in the Imperial Conference in Britain, that these are things which are essential if there is to be between the peoples of the two countries the goodwill and harmony which I, and every member of the Government, sincerely desire.  I do not think there would be anything gained by going further into these matters now.</P>
      <P>I say it must be the object of national policy in this country to get rid of these points of difference.  I think I could say now what I said in a communication to Mr. Lloyd George in 1921.  I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Thus we are ready to meet you in all that is reasonable and just. The responsibility for initiating and effecting an honourable peace rests primarily not with our Government but with yours.  We have no conditions to impose, no claims to advance but the one that we be freed from aggression.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hold that the occupying of our ports against the will of our people is, in fact, an act of aggression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We reciprocate with a sincerity to be measured only by the terrible sufferings our people have undergone, <Col N="723" /> the desire you express for mutual and lasting friendship.  The sole cause of the ancient feuds which you deplore has been, as we know and as history proves, the attacks of English rulers upon Irish liberty. These attacks can cease forthwith if your Government has the will.  The road to peace and understanding lies open.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the President's attention has been directed also to volume 3 of the Parliamentary Debates, column 2499, where the then President of the Executive Council, now Deputy Cosgrave, moved:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £3,133,577 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1924, for making repayment to the British Government in respect of annuities under the Land Purchase Acts, 1881 to 1909.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Are we to understand from the Minister that this money is the payment made by the tenants for their land, and that there is nothing out of the Central Fund?

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The actual sum due to pay the <Col N="725" /> annuities is much greater than the sum which comes in.  At the recent negotiations which took place in England we came to a provisional arrangement which binds us, or in which we accepted liability for the payment of a certain sum pending a settlement regarding the major question.  That sum in all amounts to about £160,000 over and above the amount we will get in annuities. We considered at the time that it was a fair bargain.  It does not prejudice or make weaker our case, and it leaves open the question of the ultimate settlement of the difference between the actual sum collected from Land Commission annuities payable to us here and the actual outgoings in order to provide interest on the land stock and the Sinking Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Johnson then intervened and he asked:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May we take it that this sum of £3,133,000 is the same sum as was paid into this fund a year ago for the preceding year?  Is there any substantial change in the amount?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only as far as the sum I have mentioned, £160,000...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has the President's attention been drawn to the fact that the then President of the Executive Council referred to the &ldquo;recent negotiations in England&rdquo; and the liability and the bargain and brought it all before Dáil Eireann?</P>

I made the statement that there is not in the Records of the House any Record where that agreement was put to the House and voted upon and that is in the Records of the House as something ratified by the House.  It is not to be found because it is not there.  Even the case made by the opposite benches, by their lawyers, did not contain reference to that document as a document. We had to wait until we got a dispatch from Mr. Thomas at the time calling attention to it when we asked him: &ldquo;On what do you base your claim?&rdquo; and the claim was based on two documents, one of which, I repeat, was not revealed to the Irish people for nine years and the other of which was not revealed for nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £46,002 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Coigríche agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin (Uimh. 16 de 1924).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £46,002 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The total provision for External Affairs for 1937-38 amounts to £76,502, as compared with £81,458 for 1936-37.  The receipts for this Service are estimated at about £20,200, leaving the net expenditure at £56,302.  The reduction is mainly due to more favourable rates of exchange in France, Italy and Switzerland, owing to the de-valuation of the currencies of these countries. There is nothing in the Estimates for the current year requiring particular notice.  The provision, one might say, is normal.  Since the financial year 1932-1933 the amount received from American estates in which the Consulates have been concerned is approximately £175,000.  I am just reading a short note on the work that is being done in connection with estate work by our representatives, particularly in the United States.  These figures do not represent the total amount of money accruing to Irish persons each year from American estates nor the extent of the Department's work in regard to estate moneys.  The Consuls give advice and guidance in regard to the best legal advice and help in tracing next-of-kin.  The Department's activities in the matter of estates are not confined to the United States. Inquiries have been received and advice given in respect of estates in Canada, Argentine, Columbia, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, and the total number of estates handled in the past six years approximate to 4,000, or about two a day, involving sums varying from £10 to £20,000, and, in a few cases, the estates were for much higher sums.</P>
    <P>Speaking on my own Vote, I dealt with a most important aspect of our External Affairs, namely, our relations with Great Britain.  If it had not been so, most of my statement would have been taken up with regard to these relations.  However, having just spoken on that matter, it is not necessary to go over this again.  I am glad to be able to announce that the Italian Government has appointed a Minister to Dublin.  This appointment adds another of the Great Powers of the world to those which have Legations in our capital, and I cordially welcome the friendly gesture.  As is the normal usage, this gesture will be reciprocated <Col N="730" /> in due course by the appointment of a Minister to the Quirinal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European situation generally, there is little that I can add to what Deputies already know from the Press.  Our attitude with regard, in particular, to the Spanish Civil War has been motived by our desire for peace, generally, and to prevent, as far as possible, the conflict in that country giving rise to a general European conflict.  On previous occasions I have defended our attitude here with regard to non-intervention, and I do not think it is necessary to go back on that now or to explain our position in regard to it.  With regard to the position in Europe generally, as I have said, it is one concerning which nobody can foresee the end.  It may be, as is thought fairly generally, that there is less tension at the present time than there was some months ago. However, it would be very unwise to make any prophecy in that regard. With that, then, Sir, I shall leave the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an element of humour, Sir, in that introduction. We want this information, not about the future&mdash;although I have no doubt that that information would be quite as trustworthy as anything that the President could give us about the past&mdash;but we want this information about the immediate past.  We want something more than a vague expression&mdash;I do not know whether it was the expression of an opinion or the expression of a hope, because I do not think anybody could make out what the President meant it as&mdash;namely, that the tension was not quite as great in Europe at the present moment as it has been for some time past, and that, so far as the future is concerned, it might be worse or it might be better, and he would be a wise man who would venture to say, and if he were a wise man he would say nothing.  For a statement on general European affairs I think that that would be hard to beat.  However, at the very beginning of the President's statement on international affairs generally he dropped one or two interesting sentences.  I gathered from him&mdash;I am not quoting him, but I am <Col N="731" /> giving what I gathered from the tone of his speech&mdash;that the only international relation that is worth anything, so far as we are concerned, or that was worth spending any time discussing, is our relation with Great Britain, and that because he had finished the last Vote by the speech that he meant to make on international affairs and so discussed our relations with Great Britain, he did not intend to say very much now. Well, coming from the President, and having regard to the high and mighty attitude that the Fianna Fáil Party have taken up as regards our immediate neighbour, that is certainly a contribution to the debate, but it was about the only contribution that the President made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a matter in connection with which the people are entitled to look for a certain amount of enlightenment from the Minister on Government policy, and, indeed, on more than Government policy.  The ordinary man is not in a position to know from the Press what is the position in Europe at present, and especially what is the position so far as it affects our interests or what our attitude is towards it.  That is the reason why I asked the President that question yesterday.  I said that I understood quite well why he might not make a statement on his own Estimate, since anything might arise on that and he might well make the plea that he would wait in order to see what questions would be raised, but that we did expect him to break from his usual practice and give us some kind of a résumé on the European situation that we could follow.  However, I am glad to see that his conscience was bad enough to trouble him on certain matters, and although nobody can say that he threw any light on these matters, he at least mentioned them. I should say it is quite clear from his statement that he regards the Ministry of External Affairs to a certain extent as a joke, as a thing of no importance: that the only reason why he is here at all now is that he happens to be President and also happens to be Minister for External Affairs and, therefore, is called upon <Col N="732" /> to defend this Vote.  Beyond a few book-keeping accounts he refuses to give us any information.  That is why I asked him yesterday in opening the discussion on his own Vote to be prepared to do so.  He ought to know that the ordinary member of the House, the ordinary person in the street, is not in a position without such preliminary statement to discuss this Vote with a reasonable chance of a fruitful discussion&mdash;this more than any other Vote.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, there are a certain number of items in this Vote that will give us an opportunity of discussing certain matters.  First of all, there is the Vote for the Minister himself.  Secondly, there is provision for the various representatives abroad.  Two, especially, will give rise to discussion.  I understand what has really happened is this: I am now taking the President's own statement that what he meant as the preliminary statement on this External Affairs Vote, he gave instead as the concluding statement on the previous Vote.  Let us take realities instead of mere form.  We may take it, therefore, that his concluding statement on the previous Vote can be regarded as the introductory statement to this Vote.  There are, therefore, two provisions in this Estimate that especially fall for consideration.  There is the cost of our representative in Britain and the matter I want particularly to be discussed&mdash;not the amount but the question of our representative to Spain or, let us be quite accurate, to President Azana.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, let us be quite clear.  The President knows, though it may not be clear in the Constitution or other things that he brings in here, that diplomatic representatives are accredited to the heads of States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Azana is the <Col N="733" /> head of that State.  It is to him our Minister is accredited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite accurate. It is the first time we have heard that accurate statement from that side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the President would show us the inaccuracy in substance and not in theory? What does Azana represent in Spain? Which side?  Is there any difficulty in understanding that he represents the side that, up to the present, was known as the Caballero side?  Does the President deny that?  Is this one of the usual pettifogging distinctions by which he tries to get over the real facts?  Our representative is accredited to President Azana, to the Red Government in Spain, and now for the first time we have that acknowledged by the President. Before this he tried to ride off by stating that our representative was accredited to Spain, and now he quibbles on the question as to whether it was to Azana or his Premier the accrediting took place.  Now, we have at last a clear acknowledgment of the statement that it is to President Azana our representative is accredited and not to Spain, not to the geographical unit of Spain.  Let that be quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object, and we have always objected, to that man being kept there accredited to that particular Government or that so-called head of the State.  Our objection is as strong now as it was months ago.  We can only look, in the light of all the events that have taken place and in the light of what has taken place recently, to this Vote as an expression of solidarity on the part of the Government with that particular cause.  We have an opportunity here of deliberately challenging this particular matter, and we do so.  Again and again we asked the President to show some tangible evidence of at least real neutrality in this matter by withdrawing that representative to the Red Government, to the Valencia Government, to President Azana, who is head of that State, and the President has always, continuously, deliberately and consistently <Col N="734" /> refused, not merely to meet our wishes, but what I believe to be the wishes of the majority of the people of this country.  I wonder does he deny that these are the wishes of the majority.  Still he keeps him on there.  As I say, I can only read that consistency on his part&mdash;a consistency so very rare coming from that quarter &mdash;as a determination to flout the wishes of the people and to show his sympathy with that particular Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, the Vatican has made its views quite clear.  The President has never done so.  Again and again he says: &ldquo;My views are well known; my sympathies are well known,&rdquo; but he has never gone beyond that, nor has any Minister gone beyond that in public or in private, not even the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He will shelter behind the Vatican, not taking into account the peculiar position of the Vatican State, which is a very different State from a secular State like ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, we have aligned ourselves and put ourselves behind this propaganda that is going on that this is a struggle between Fascism and democracy and the ready use that is being made in various countries of the Fascist scare. We have put ourselves as far as we can behind that particular piece of propaganda and helped it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question which <Col N="735" /> arises on this Vote.  Our views on this matter are perfectly clear.  I regard this as one of the most important issues that could have been raised.  I regard the conduct of the Government as peculiarly reprehensible in this particular matter.  There are issues involved which, I am convinced, are much greater than any of the issues we have discussed in this House.  Unfortunately, we have no lead in the right direction from the Government.  Any lead, in so far as there was a lead at all, any indication of a lead, has been in the opposite direction, in the wrong direction. In pursuance of our policy of so-called neutrality, which is certainly very favourable to one side so far as our gestures go, and not to the other, we entered into certain arrangements with other powers in Europe. When the President was making that eloquent introductory statement of his, he might have availed of the opportunity to point out to us what was the result of the measures that were taken, and how far those measures have been effective.  He contented himself with repeating that we passed certain measures, and took a certain line of conduct, in the hope that that would save a European conflagration. He was in favour of strict non-intervention, neutrality.  I am speaking now of neutrality in so far as interference or material help is concerned. We have given the other kind of help already, in so far as our official attitude is concerned.  I am confining myself now to material help.  We are a party, with other nations, to a certain convention on this particular matter.  Is the President in a position to inform us how far and to what extent that has been observed? What steps has he taken, what steps has the Government taken, to enlighten themselves on what is happening? Have the various parties to that agreement observed it, not merely in the letter but in the spirit?  The only thing we are thrown back upon is the papers.  The President invited us to go to the papers for information. Do you want to know what is happening <Col N="736" /> in Europe?  Do you want to know what our attitude is towards what is happening?  Go to the papers.</P>
    <P>I gather that there is by no means unanimity, by no means agreement, as to the extent to which the policy of non-intervention has been effectively carried out.  Is it a fact that help has gone in to the one side in Spain, to the Red Government in Spain, under cover of foodstuffs?  The charge has been made.  Has the Government made any attempt to see whether or not there was any foundation for this charge, or are we still relying on the goodwill not merely of the Governments of the different countries, but on the good faith of the different merchants of the different countries so far as those things are concerned?  How far have the commitments into which we were persuaded to enter really been carried out?  Surely that was a matter on which the President might have enlightened us, once he had mentioned Spain.  Furthermore, the question has been raised&mdash;here again we are parties to this particular agreement, and that is the reason I raise the point&mdash;as to what constitutes a blockade.  The President is Minister for External Affairs.  So far as this House is concerned he is our authority on that international law.  Perhaps he will tell us what the modern international law on blockade is, and how far that international law has or has not been violated.  Has the President, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, made any inquiries on those particular matters, or is he still taking up the line that I gather he took up to the moment we passed these measures, and that was so clearly and definitely outlined by the Minister for Education speaking from those benches on this particular matter&mdash;that it would be absurd to think that we or our representatives at an international conference could raise our voices on any of these matters?</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been our position as yes-men before we entered into certain commitments, before we passed certain laws enforcing certain agreements, and passed them on the foot of those agreements, our position now is a more serious one.  We undertook <Col N="737" /> certain obligations then.  We undertook them not merely for ourselves, but by implication we undertook also to see, as far as we could, that other people observed those obligations.  Are we in a position to say that that has been done, or is it one of those matters on which we shall be told: &ldquo;Oh, well, we are a poor, small nation off the coast of Europe.  In reality we have no interest in any other country except Great Britain, and consequently we know nothing about any other country except Great Britain&rdquo;?  That, undoubtedly was the attitude taken up by the President in his opening statement. He had already finished with Great Britain in the last Vote, as he said&mdash; he had started with Great Britain in the last Vote and devoted all his energy to Great Britain&mdash;and there was nothing more to be said on foreign affairs.  Has he no interest in what our colleagues in this agreement are doing? The real basis of complaint is that despite the obvious and clear will of the Irish people, in spite of the life and death character in regard to our civilisation, of the struggle that is going on there, the President still insists on having our representative accredited to President Azana, the head of the Red State in Spain.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>That this House, after several months' discussion and consideration, should be asked to pass a Vote of this kind is nothing less than an outrage. That particular portion should have been deleted before it came before the House, and steps should have been taken in the course of the last couple of months to withdraw our representative. What good is he doing?  Is he giving us information as to what is occurring?  The Minister himself, in his introduction, stated that one of the matters which was engaging his attention&mdash;or, apparently, it was engaging his attention because he mentioned it &mdash;was Spain.  He was asked previously on several occasions by means of questions in this House, had he any information from our representative there. Surely he had an opportunity now to put before this House such information as he had from that representative. Why did he not do it?  What other means has the House of knowing what <Col N="738" /> that representative was doing?  Has he given any information on what is occurring there?  As usual, the President leaves the House in ignorance of those matters, and is determined to do it, for the simple reason that the President has no respect for parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The presence in the South of France of the Irish Free State Minister to Spain may be a foolish extravagance.  I, at any rate, have not got sufficient information to enable me to judge as to whether he is performing any duty there that is worth while.  I am inclined to suspect that he is not, and that the President of the Executive Council and Minister for External Affairs would be doing a sensible thing if he recalled him, especially in view of the fact that there is no Minister from Spain in this country, but I feel obliged to protest once again against the suggestion that this is a matter of fundamental importance. To me it seems a trivial matter. The presence of a Minister, even in the country itself, let alone outside the border of the country, accredited to a particular Government, is no sort of certificate of merit for that Government, or no indication of solidarity with that Government.  If the Opposition are going to accuse our Government here of solidarity with the Reds in Spain, they will also have to accuse, if not the Vatican&mdash;they seem to make a special case for the Vatican&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I do not say they are completely equal.  I can conceive a special case being made for the Vatican, although, mind you, it is not true, as suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan, that the Vatican have spoken out more definitely about their sympathies in the actual civil war than our own President of the Executive Council has. You may impugn President de Valera's sincerity if you will, but he has, at any rate, said quite openly on more than one occasion that his sympathies, and <Col N="739" /> the sympathies of the Government, and the sympathies of the Irish people, are with General Franco.  If you are going to accuse our Government of solidarity with the Red Government in Spain, you must similarly accuse the Belgian Government, the Polish Government, the Governments of the Republics of South America, and every other Government that has a representative accredited to Spain.  It seems to be considered that, over and above being a sort of certificate of merit and a sign of solidarity, it is in some way a help to the Red cause to have Ministers outside Spain accredited to the Red Government.  I do not believe that that is at all the feeling of the Reds themselves.  I have read statements made some time ago&mdash;statements over a considerable period&mdash;indicating the resentment of the Red Government in S p a i n at foreign representatives accredited to them living outside the borders of Spain.  To such an extent did they resent that, that at one period &mdash;I do not know if it is still so&mdash;they refused to receive any communications from foreign Minister living outside the borders of Spain.  They regarded it as an insult to them that these Ministers should not be at Madrid, in the first instance, and then at Valencia.  I take it that those foreign representatives accredited to President Azana who are on the borders of Spain are there for their own purposes and because it is considered in the interests of their countries to be there.  I do not think that there is a spark of sense in suggesting that any one of the countries which have representatives at St. Jean de Luz or at Hendaye is thereby indicating sympathy or solidarity with the cause of President Azana and the Red Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that practically everybody in this House sympathises on the whole with the Franco side in Spain, though when a Deputy complains that it is a falsification to say that there is any question of Fascism involved in the struggle, he is not facing facts. Since we last discussed this subject in the House, General Franco has declared quite frankly for a Fascist system of Government.  He has suppressed <Col N="740" /> all parties in his area except the Fascist Party and, when he wins &mdash;as I still believe he will win&mdash;there is no doubt that a Fascist system of government will be established in Spain.  There is not the slightest doubt either that the Government then established will be greatly under the influence of Italy and Germany.  Certain dangers to European peace arise from that state of things.  The balance of power in the Mediterranean will be changed&mdash;and dangerously changed so far as the British Commonwealth is concerned.  That is the reason why the bulk of those classes in Great Britain who would be temperamentally pro-Franco and who are constantly attacked by the Opposition in Great Britain for being pro-Franco are getting more and more divided in their sympathies because, while they detest the destruction of religious institutions, the destruction of property, the destruction of art treasures, the destruction of churches and the murder and pillage that have been associated with the doings of the Red side in Spain, they are also extremely frightened as to what may happen if and when a Fascist Government is established there strongly under the influence of Italy and Germany.  However, that is really a side issue.  I mentioned that only because it was suggested just now by Deputy O'Sullivan that it was an outrage to talk of the question of Fascism being involved in the Spanish struggle at all.  It is involved, but there are other issues which, with us here in Ireland, outweigh that particular issue.  It remains true that we, here, are overwhelmingly in sympathy with the Franco side as against the other side.  I repeat that the presence at St. Jean de Luz or Hendaye of a representative accredited to President Azana may be a foolish extravagance but it is fantastic to represent it as any sign whatever of sympathy or solidarity with the Red cause.</P>
    <P>I desire to say a few words about the relations which the President has described as the most important of our foreign relations&mdash;the relations with the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I do not propose to travel over the ground I travelled last night <Col N="741" /> in speaking on the Estimate for the President's own Department.  The President has indicated that, in his view, satisfactory relations with the Government of Great Britain and with Northern Ireland depend upon the abolition of the boundary and upon the unconditional surrender of the British Government in the financial dispute between themselves and us. The long speech which the President made to-day on these subjects may have been, in his view, and in the view of his supporters a dialectical triumph, but never can dialectic have been more barren.</P>
    <P>The speech produced in me a feeling of profound depression, because it is not by wrangling over the rights and wrongs of doings in the past we are going to arrive at a satisfactory settlement of our differences with Great Britain.  The President started off by saying that some Deputies, such as myself, were in the habit of making a case for Partition.  I deeply resent that statement and I think I could stigmatise it in very offensive terms if I desired to be offensive.  I have had, I fancy, more political experience of one particular kind than the President himself has had&mdash;that is, the experience that consists in going as a missionary to try to convert hostile audiences.  I have frequently spoken on Partition and, indeed, on other subjects connected with the doing of justice to this country, to English audiences and to North of Ireland audiences both in recent times and in times far past.  One thing, at any rate, I have learned, that if you are going to do any good at all you must make an attempt to see the other man's point of view.  You must not be content with repeating over and over again your own case and shutting your mind altogether to a consideration of the other man's case.</P>
    <P>I have often asserted that the British have a very great responsibility for Partition&mdash;that, historically, they have the main responsibility for Partition.  But what interests me is not the past but the present.  I maintain that, in the present, the maintenance of Partition is due to the state of feeling in Northern Ireland.  If relations with Great Britain cannot be made satisfactory except by the abandonment <Col N="742" /> and desertion by the British of their kith and kin in Northern Ireland, then I venture to predict that relations never will become satisfactory. The only fruitful line on which to proceed in this matter of Partition is to realise that our nation is composed of the Northern Unionists as well as of us down here and that, even down here, there is a minority&mdash;a small minority, it is true, but still an important minority&mdash;who share the traditions, the loyalties and the reactions that are experienced by the people in the North.  The true statesman is he who, in moulding his policy, takes into consideration all the various elements of which our nation is composed and seeks to build up something in which it would be possible for them all to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The British are in a very difficult position about this question of Partition. I do not deny that they can be of some help to us.  They can give us some moral assistance.  They can cease to be quite as enthusiastic about the Ulsterman's peculiar form of loyalty as they are apt to be, and they can cease to pat them on the back and to praise them for a course of conduct which, in fact, is putting a barrier between ourselves and Great Britain; but more than that is not to be expected of them.  No British Government would stay in office, no Socialist Government even, who are, of course, criticising the policy of the present Government on Irish matters, as on other matters, could afford to force, or allow to be forced, the Unionists of Northern Ireland into our State against their will.  You may deplore that.  You may say that it is unreasonable, and you may say that it is, in your view, the duty of the British to force the Northerners in against their will, or to allow them to be forced in against their will, but whether you think it their duty or not, it is something there is no hope of their doing.</P>
    <P>The logical conclusion of the sort of attitude of mind that the President exhibits in this matter is that the British indeed might be brought some day to allow the Nationalist areas in the North, the areas the President mentioned as being predominantly <Col N="743" /> Nationalist, to be united with ourselves, but then what would be the result?  Simply that the remaining predominantly Unionist parts, possibly being unable to maintain their existence with a separate Parliament, would be re-absorbed into the United Kingdom Parliament and would cease to be a part of Ireland at all except upon the map.  That is the logical conclusion of the line of thought to which the President adheres so firmly, the line of thought which forbids him to look into the other man's mind and to make any concessions to the other man's point of view.</P>
    <P>The same sort of barren results must follow from the President's attitude in regard to the financial dispute.  I have always thought that the President had a case and I have always said that the President had a case with regard to the land annuities and the other moneys in dispute, but we must not conceal from ourselves that the British have a case, too.  Sometimes difficulties are created, not by a conflict between manifest right and manifest wrong, but by a conflict between apparent right on both sides.  I dislike being forced into the position of expressing the British point of view here, but it is really necessary that it should be done when our leaders close their minds so completely to that point of view.  The British, after all, did sign an agreement.  The President alleges that that agreement was a secret one.  That is a matter into which I do not propose to enter, but, secret or not secret, the British had no desire that it should be so.  The British requested that it should be published.  The British made that agreement with a Government which was not thrown out of office immediately after it had made it, but a Government which was twice reelected after that agreement was made and after the results of the agreement, even if not the full terms of the agreement, were perfectly well known to the Irish people.  Surely from the British point of view it is asking a great deal that they should throw over that agreement as worth nothing at all?</P>
    <P>There would be much more hope <Col N="744" /> of achieving something on the other line the President took, of the difficulty this country might have in paying such large sums; but there again, there is a good deal to be said for the British point of view which has not been said.  We are, in fact, paying those sums now.  The President says we are being robbed of them. Let him have his way.  Let us call it that, but, at any rate, they are being paid.  Are we being ruined by that payment?  Perhaps the Opposition say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but do the Government say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?  Did the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech not maintain that, owing to the excellence of his financial policy, even if we were paying the £5,000,000 a year in tariffs, it was evident that the country was well able to bear that strain?</P>
    <P>Can we really compare this payment truthfully with the war debt to America?  I suggest that that comparison is extremely misleading.  First, it is misleading because the war debt of Great Britain to America was bound up with the question of a number of other war debts.  In their correspondence with America, Great Britain did not deal with that as an isolated debt from herself to the United States unconnected with the other war debts.  As a matter of fact, it would have suited Great Britain extremely well if all war debts had been paid.  She would have been very much the gainer, and she lost much more by the repudiation of war debts than she gained by the repudiation of her debt to America.  Then you have to consider that the various countries that owed moneys to America had to act together, to a greater or lesser extent.  The payments that were required from European countries as a whole to the United States could no longer be made.  It was a sheer impossibility.  They could not be made in gold because there was not enough gold in the world to do it, and they could not be made in goods because of United States tariffs, and there was no other way to make them.</P>
    <P>Now, these difficulties did not apply in our case.  There were no tariffs against us in Great Britain.  The presence of the British market made <Col N="745" /> it possible for us without any technical difficulties, and indeed without any unbearable burden on this country, to make those payments.  After all, the British could argue that if it is impossible for this country to make such payments, the whole scheme of the Wyndham Land Act should never have been accepted by this country, as it was accepted.  I am not saying that, as against all these things, there is not a great deal to be said on the Irish side: there is.  The President has said some of it.  He has, I think, strained some of the arguments more than they could bear to be strained, but whether that is so or not, one thing is certain&mdash;he never shows the slightest indication of seeing that the British have a case, too.</P>
    <P>He is asking a great deal of them. He is asking them, in the case of Northern Ireland, to do something that the whole instinct of every Englishman would revolt against.  My experience is that there is practically no Englishman, except somebody connected with the diehard Ulsterman, and getting his ideas from that source, who would not be delighted to see Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State come together, but that is very different from expecting them to force the North in or to abandon the North. You might apply that well-known and hackneyed quotation from Tennyson to the situation: &ldquo;Their honour rooted in dishonour stands and faith unfaithful keeps them falsely true.&rdquo; It may have been wrong and unjust on the part of the British to create the situation in Ulster, but now that it has been created, and now that those people are there, they cannot hand them over against their will just as if they were cattle, so far at least as the more or less homogeneous districts of Northern Ireland are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious, when you come to consider what the feelings of the Unionists in Northern Ireland must be, that they attach supreme importance to two things, and they never have had any indication from the present Government that anything would be done to secure them in these matters.  The first is that <Col N="746" /> trade&mdash;their agricultural products, their linen trade, and their ship-building&mdash;should be safe against tariffs imposed by Great Britain.  The other is that they want the King as an integral part of any Constitution they come into.  There has never been the slightest indication that the President is prepared to make any concessions to them in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another matter that the President has referred to as standing in the way of good relations is the presence of British naval maintenance parties in certain of our ports and the claim that the British have, under the Treaty, to occupy such ports in case of war.  Of course, I frankly admit that my point of view about the British Navy differs fundamentally from the President's.  I regard the navy as our navy.  There are plenty of Irishmen in it; there have been plenty of Irishmen in it; there are Irishmen going into it at present. The Royal Navy, in my view, is ours, just as I regard the King as King of Ireland, and not as an external authority.  So that there is that difference in theory between us.  Apart from that, I have always been inclined to consider, speaking as one pretty ignorant in these matters, that the value of these maintenance parties in Irish ports was probably over-rated and I should be glad to see them withdrawn for that reason if it assuaged any hard feelings some people may have over there.  But, actually, would that settle any problem?  Is not that something that is mixed up with the problem of Partition, too?  If the British withdrew all claims on Berehaven, Cobh and Lough Swilly, would not the President still have to say: &ldquo;What about your troops in Northern Ireland?  What about the whole gross injustice and injury of Partition?  How can you expect that we would co-operate with you in time of war so long as that injustice continues?  Supposing we see an opportunity of Great Britain being defeated in war, can you expect that if the Power which may defeat Great Britain promises to give us an united Ireland we shall not assist that Power&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Once again it seems to me that the <Col N="747" /> difficulty of Partition is the fundamental thing.  It is the fundamental thing; it is at the bottom of everything else.  Until you can cure Partition, you cannot have satisfactory relations with Great Britain.  It is we who have got to cure Partition.  The British cannot do it; they can give a little help&mdash;not much.  The King, if we were to make him an integral part of our Constitution, could give us a great deal of help.  But the main task has to be done by ourselves and is not going to be done by Party dialectics. It can only be done by looking into the other man's mind and making such adjustment of your point of view as will make it possible to satisfy, to some extent, his point of view.</P>
    <P>The President accuses me of making a case for Partition.  Why it is he who makes a case for Partition; in every speech he makes, he makes a case for Partition.  I venture to say with confidence that if I went to-morrow to address an Ulster Unionist audience with a speech on Partition, I would come away having made some impression, having converted a few, having shaken others, having gained a certain amount of sympathy from nearly all.  I venture to say with equal confidence that if the President went to address an Ulster Unionist audience he would come away having hardened the hearts of every one of them against a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>After the very laconic and extremely halting observations of the President in introducing this Estimate, I think the taxpayer would be justified in asking himself why he is taxed to the extent of £76,502 for a Department of External Affairs in this country.  He would be justified in asking himself, as was publicly asked during the beginning of the history of this State, in the early stages of the development of the State, what was the necessity for a Department of External Affairs?  So far as the President, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, is concerned, he has not this year, nor any year since he took that office, given any indication that he knows the slightest thing about the work of this Department or has the smallest interest in its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I think there is no Parliament in the world in which matters of foreign affairs are dealt with so casually as in this Parliament here.  There is no people to whom such little information is given in reference to their external relations as the people of the Irish Free State.  If it is that the President is too busy to conduct the affairs of this Department, then I think he ought to get somebody who can devote the time and who will have the necessary interest in the activities of the Department. It is perfectly obvious to me that the President has no interest whatsoever, good, bad or indifferent, in matters of foreign policy.  On every occasion when Estimates for the Department of External Affairs have been introduced here since 1933 I have protested against this policy of introducing these Estimates for the Department with a few words and a wave of the hand and, perhaps, a request to ask questions.</P>
    <P>In striking contradistinction of the way in which matters of foreign policy are dealt with in this Parliament and, say, the Canadian Parliament, I should like to direct the attention of Deputies to the fact that in each year the permanent head of the Department of External Affairs for Canada presents to the political head, the Minister of External Affairs, a complete and detailed report of the activities of the Department for the preceding year. Each of the activities is dealt with, and, subsequently, the matter is discussed in the Canadian Legislature in complete detail.  We used to have a practice here some years ago of giving to the Dáil, and publishing to the public, a report of the activities of our representative at the League of Nations.  We have not had any such report since the present Government took office.  So far from having a report even of our activities at the League of Nations, we never get in this House any proper information or details as to the activities of our representatives abroad, or of our civil servants at headquarters, in reference to matters of foreign policy or external affairs.</P>
    <P>In this report presented by the Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs to his Minister each year in <Col N="749" /> Canada, there is a complete and detailed account given of the activities of the Department.  We find here that the activities of the Department of External Affairs in connection with their work abroad are set forth in detail.  The work of the Canadian Legation at Washington is dealt with and a summary of its activities at Washington is given.  We do not know what our representative in Washington is doing or, so far as we have been told by the Government, if he is doing anything. We have the greatest confidence in our representative at Washington, and I am sure he is not wasting his time.  But so far as the ordinary taxpayer in this country is concerned the slightest information is not given as to what our representative is doing at Washington or whether he would not be better employed at home in some other capacity.  We find in this report of the Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs at Ottawa a full account of the activities of the Legation at Washington.  They keep in close touch with the legislation passed by the United States Congress. Reports as to these activities and matters of that kind are set forth in this detailed summary for the year 1936.  You will find there a full statement of the Legation's activities.  I quote from this now for the purpose of getting the President, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, to do something of the same kind in connection with his Department and so give information to the Dáil and to the people of this country as to what our Legations abroad are doing.  In this report I find this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the year, the Legation has kept the Department at Ottawa informed on the attitude of the United States on the major questions of foreign relations, with particular reference to neutrality policy and legislation, international commercial policy and the Inter-American Peace Conference.  Attention was also given the monetary, financial and fiscal policies of the United States, and the agricultural situation was closely followed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I give that information for the purpose of indicating to the President something of the work done by the <Col N="750" /> Canadian Legation at Washington. What is being done by our Legation at Washington?  Is our Legation there doing anything?  Is our representative there doing anything?  So far as the President has told us our representative at Washington is doing nothing. Personally, I am perfectly sure he is very active.  But the President has not sufficient knowledge of his activities to tell the House and country what these activities are.  The activities of the Canadian Legation in Paris are set forth in the same way.  From this report we find that that Legation takes a very deep interest in the internal situation in France and its impact upon the European situation.  Their Legation in Paris advises the Canadian Government of the European situation which is viewed in the light of the information acquired by that Legation. What is our Legation in Paris doing? Have we got anybody there in Paris who is looking after our interests or who is competent to look after our interests?  If so, we hear nothing about it from the Government.  As long as the President is endeavouring to carry on the dual position as President and Minister for External Affairs we will be in that position.  I referred on another occasion to this Department of External Affairs as the Cinderella of the Departments.  I am afraid under the present arrangements it will continue to be so.  Again, the activities of the Canadian Legation at Tokyo are dealt with and, in other respects, a complete summary of the Department of External Affairs and the activities of their Legations abroad are furnished to the Canadian people and the Canadian Legislature.  We were told something about the work of this Department on Irish estate work. This Department is costing the country £76,502 for the purpose of enabling the next of kin here to be found in the case of Irish people domiciled in Canada or in the United States.  In other words, for the purpose of putting money into the pockets of American attorneys.  I agree that the Department of External Affairs can do something to prevent citizens of this country being exploited by American attorneys.  It is quite true that some American attorneys specialise in <Col N="751" /> finding lost heirs and charge immense sums for doing so.  But it comes as a complete surprise to me to hear that that work is of such paramount importance that it is the only item that occupied more than two or three sentences in the President's opening statement on this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I left the most important part of this report till the last.  It is placed in the position of first importance in that report.  It has to do with the trade relations between Canada and the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  In this report there is a paragraph which I propose to read for the purpose of bringing home to Deputies here the importance of the work of the Department of External Affairs and how, if properly directed, very great advantage could be obtained for this country. The most important activity of the Department of External Affairs in Canada was, according to this report, their activities in connection with the preparations for the revision of the Ottawa agreements made in 1932. Here is the paragraph to which I refer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The activities of the Office of the High Commissioner during 1936 have ranged over the whole field of relations between His Majesty's Governments in the United Kingdom and in Canada.  Special reference, however, should be made to one or two fields of activity which might be considered as of more than ordinary importance at the present time.  In the first place, a considerable part of the work of the High Commissioner's Office has been concerned with economic and trade relations between the two Governments.  Special negotiations between the two Governments have taken place with a view to placing the trade relations on a satisfactory basis on the expiry of the Ottawa agreements in 1937.  For this purpose the Ministers of Finance, Trade and Commerce, and Agriculture, with other officials, spent some weeks in London during the summer, and following the meeting of the League Assembly at Geneva, the Prime Minister made a visit to London in this connection when the discussions <Col N="752" /> between the two Governments were carried a step further.  Special reference must be made in the second place to Canadian publicity activities during the year.  A Publicity Committee was established under the chairmanship of the High Commissioner and consisted of members of the staff and representatives of the Departments of Trade and Commerce and National Revenue at Canada House to co-ordinate and supervise Canadian publicity activities in the United Kingdom.  It has been realised that by centralising and controlling the working out of a definite plan, the results achieved so far have been entirely satisfactory.  In this connection no occasion has been missed by the High Commissioner to speak before the various Chambers of Commerce in London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Edinborough, Glasgow and other cities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a summary of the activities of the Canadian High Commissioner with special reference to the problems that will be presented to Canada and the United Kingdom when the Ottawa agreements come up for revision.  It is felt to be of such paramount importance to the trade relations between Canada and Great Britain that no less than three Ministers and the Prime Minister visited Great Britain in connection with the preliminary discussion in reference to the meeting this year when the Ottawa agreements come to be revised.  The reason is obvious why Canada attaches such importance to the relations between themselves and Great Britain.  What is our High Commissioner doing?  We see in the papers how our High Commissioner flies over here to Ireland and back again to England occasionally. He goes by rail, by boat and by every possible mode of locomotion.  What is he doing flying back to the Coronation? Did he represent this country at the Coronation?  What has his activity been during the last twelve months? It is well known that he is a man of great industry, great energy, but we have not been told a single word about what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Are we going to let slip again this year the opportunity that was let slip <Col N="753" /> in 1932 at Ottawa to get beneficial trade agreements for this country? Let us look at what the results have been for Canada and this country during the last four or five years when the Ottawa agreements were in operation. In 1930 Canada exported to Great Britain goods to the value of £38,000,000, and the imports from Great Britain during that year were £29,000,000, leaving a trade balance in Canada's favour of £9,000,000 approximately. What was our position during that year, before the present Government came into power?  In 1930 we sent to Great Britain £43,000,000 worth of goods and we imported from Great Britain, in domestic commodities alone, £34,500,000.  There was a trade balance then in our favour to the extent of £8,500,000.  In 1936 Canada's exports to Great Britain had risen, as a result of the Ottawa agreements, to £75,000,000, nearly double the 1930 figure, and the imports from Great Britain into Canada in that year came to £23,000,000, so that as the result of the Ottawa agreements the favourable trade balance of £9,000,000 in 1930 had risen in 1936 to £41,000,000.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Ottawa Conference we were too proud to make any agreement that would be beneficial to this country, and in 1936 what was the tragic story here?  We had, as I have already stated, a favourable trade balance in 1930 of £8,500,000 in our trade with Great Britain.  In 1936 we exported £20,400,000 worth of goods and imported £21,000,000 worth, so that the favourable balance in our favour in 1930 had been converted into an adverse trade balance of £600,000 last year.</P>
    <P>Remember, the Ottawa agreements come up for revision this year.  What is our High Commissioner going to do about it, acting on the instructions of the Government?  What has he been doing in the last 12 months?  How has he been earning the salary the taxpayers pay him and which we are asked to vote to-day?  So far as the President is concerned, he talked about the work of the Department in connection with the finding of heirs. If he had any conception of his responsibility would he have devoted most of his speech to the work of finding lost <Col N="754" /> heirs and putting money into the pockets of the American attorneys? Other members of the Commonwealth of Nations have for months been making preparations in advance for the revision of the Ottawa agreements. Why was our country not doing something towards securing beneficial trade agreements?</P>
    <P>The President said we went to Ottawa, not because we wanted to consort with the representatives of the Dominions or Great Britain, but because we were invited there by a friendly Government.  Is he going to make any distinction between the Ottawa Conference and the Conference that may be held in London?  The Ottawa Conference was held perhaps for the sake of convenience in Canada, or perhaps it was for the purpose of making it clear what Canada's status was in this matter.  I think that was the real reason why the Ottawa conference was held in Canada and not in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Is the President going to make any distinction between the Conference in Ottawa and the Economic Conference that will be probably held this year or sometime afterwards to revise the Ottawa agreements, if it is held in England?  Is he not going to bow his crested head and go to England, when our representatives went to Canada in 1932 for an Economic Conference? Is he going to make an excuse of Partition, or that he is being treated with injustice by Great Britain, or that he does not want to put his hands as deeply into the pockets of our ancient enemy as he possibly can?  I would have thought that one of the most patriotic acts would be to go to Canada, to South Africa, to New Zealand or London and put his hands as deeply as he possibly could into the pockets of John Bull and extract as much British gold as he could extract.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are not going to have anything to do with the Conference this year, but it is as well that the taxpayer who is asked to pay the salary and expenses of the High Commissioner's Office should know that the President, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, <Col N="755" /> declines to give any information as to what the activities of the High Commissioner have been or will be, or as to what are the prospects of our getting any benefit from the revision of the Ottawa agreements this year.</P>
    <P>The President spoke casually about Spain.  He said: &ldquo;There is no necessity for me to deal with the matter of our policy of non-intervention or to defend it,&rdquo; and he left it at that. There is no question of the policy of the President on non-intervention in Spain.  The policy of non-intervention has been adopted practically unanimously here.  The President is not called upon to defend that policy. We on this side were the first to plead for the policy of non-intervention in connection with Spain, and for the President to waft aside one of the principal items occupying public attention at present&mdash;our relations with Spain&mdash;merely by saying that as he has already defended his policy, there is no necessity to refer further to Spain, is rather an insult to the Deputies and to the people.  The people want to know, first of all, can the President, from the information his officers ought to have at headquarters, or through our diplomatic representatives abroad, or through the information supplied by the British Foreign Office to the President in his capacity of Minister for External Affairs, give the people any clear information as to what the position in Spain is?</P>
    <P>We do not ask the President to divulge any secrets contrary to national peace or contrary to the public interest, but we are entitled to get some information of the state of affairs in Spain and in Europe as a whole. Every foreign Minister in every Parliament in Europe gives, in one of the principal debates in the year's legislative programme, an account of the foreign policy of the country and the general situation externally.  We are not to be told anything, except about the finding of lost heirs and other matters that we can find out for ourselves in the newspapers.  We do not pay £76,502 for the purpose of <Col N="756" /> being told by the Minister for External Affairs, to whom that sum is voted, that we can find out all our information by buying the newspapers. The House is entitled to have a little more information from the Minister on matters of external affairs, particularly in regard to the European situation, than can be discovered from even a very intelligent and close perusal of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>To return to Spain, Deputy O'Sullivan has dealt with our attitude on that and our grievances against the President in connection with the Estimate he moves to-day.  We want to know, and we are entitled to know, something about the political situation in Spain or the war situation in Spain. At least we are entitled to know what is our Minister doing there.</P>
    <P>The President, in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs, must be aware that the general public in this country, irrespective of politics, are taking a very keen interest in matters in Spain.  They are taking a very keen interest in our attitude in connection with Spain.  I have no intention of going over the ground that has been already gone over as to whether or not we ought to withdraw our representative from the present Government or from the present President of the Spanish people, whichever way one likes to put it.  I am not going over that ground at all, but I think that the President, when he was introducing this Estimate, knowing as he ought to have known, unless he has been so immersed in his Draft Constitution for the last 12 months that he is not cognisant of the state of public feeling, that the people are expecting to know at least what our Minister is doing at St. Jean de Luz, or wherever he is at the present moment.  What has he done since he was sent there, and how long is it intended to keep him there?  In the debate on the Bill relating to this which took place here some months ago, it was suggested that that was only a temporary measure, and that, instead of being at Valencia, he was at St. Jean de Luz merely for the purpose of giving assistance to Irish people who wanted to come back.  At least, we <Col N="757" /> are entitled to be told, without trenching upon the vexed question, and it is a vexed question, as to whether our representative should be accredited to the Red Government or to the Franco Government or to neither of them, what is that man doing in France purporting to represent this country to Spain? What has he done to help any of our nationals in any difficulties they may have had on one side or the other in Spain?</P>
    <P>The real issue in this matter is not whether Franco is right, or whether his opponent is right, in Spain.  I think that we have not sufficient information before us really to form a proper or an adequate view of the political situation in Spain at all. The one thing that does outstand in connection with the Spanish situation is this, that whatever Franco may stand for&mdash;whether, as Deputy MacDermot suggests, he stands for Fascism and whether somebody else may stand for anti-Communism&mdash;the one thing that is quite clear and outstanding is that the so-called Government in Spain stands for Communism. Our case is not that we should not have a representative either to Franco or his opponent, but that we should not, by our action in sending a representative to either one or the other, give grounds for anybody to say that we have the slightest sympathy with the Communist fight that is going on in Spain.  When it is quite clear that the so-called Government forces in Spain are fighting the cause of Communism, then we ought not to have our Minister accredited to that kind of Government or to the State of which that is the Government at the moment.  That is our attitude.  It is not a question of non-intervention; it is not even a question of sending our representative to Franco.  It is not a question of our having sympathy with Franco, but it is a question of our not having sympathy with Communism. That is the sum total of our attitude and policy in connection with Spain.</P>
    <P>There are many matters in connection with this Vote that I would like to speak on.  I have on frequent occasions on this Vote pleaded for the setting-up of a committee of foreign <Col N="758" /> relations, or external affairs, which would be representative of all sections of the House.  I have stated that it was my firm conviction that foreign policy, leaving aside for the moment our relations with Great Britain, was a matter on which we could have in this House a common policy.  We had an opportunity, during the course of the last financial year, to put that into practice.  That opportunity was not availed of.  I have got tired of protesting against the way in which this Estimate is being treated.  My own inclination was to let it pass without speaking on it, but I felt it would not be right that we should let it pass without some protest.  I have always taken the view that the Department of External Affairs is one of the most important Departments of the State.  I have been desirous from the time that I have had any connection with the Government of this country, that this Department should be put on a proper basis, with proper staff, with proper dignity in the service of the State, and with a proper place in the Government of the State.  But it has been treated for years as the Cinderella among the Departments, and the President has further put it back into the kitchen.</P>
    <P>We may talk about our status.  We may put down platitudes, nonsensical platitudes I call them, in this Draft Constitution about Éire affirming its adherence to the ideals of international co-operation and peace.  But what are we doing to give effect to that?  We have in this Draft Constitution highfalutin phrases about Éire affirming its adherence to the principle of international peace and international co-operation, but we may test the sincerity of these utterances by looking at what has been done by the President in the past in connection with his duties as Minister for External Affairs.  So far as we know, he has not given the slightest thought or work or any attention whatever to the cause of international peace.  Last year he gave utterance to the pious expression of his desire to do anything he could for international peace, but, of course, he could do nothing.  Well, if he can do nothing, at least let him not pretend that he can by putting it in that Constitution.  So far as we <Col N="759" /> know, nothing has been done by the Department of External Affairs to further the cause of international peace.  We could be a force in international politics, and we could uphold the dignity and advance the prestige of this State through our representatives abroad, and through activities properly directed by a proper Department of External Affairs.  In many respects the present Government have been failures, but in no respect has the President certainly been a greater failure than in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>The discussion on the Vote for External Affairs can, as has been properly stated, be divided into two main topics or two main groupings of sub-heads: (1)  Our relations with Great Britain and the Commonwealth, and (2) our relations with all the world other than these.  But there is one subject which, with all respect to Deputy MacDermot, I do consider for this people, whether or not for the world as a whole, is a matter of fundamental importance, and that, of course, is the question of Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that that was not a question of fundamental importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our representative at Spain is a smaller point.  I still do assert that the question of whether we have a representative in any way connected with anybody who also is connected&mdash;I put it at that remove&mdash; with the Government until recently presided over by Caballero is a matter of fundamental importance for the people of this country, possibly not for people outside of it.  But the more a man is thinking in terms of the Irish people, I think the more he will become conscious of the fact that it is of fundamental importance.  A man who has less thought and is less at home amongst the Irish people will have a different viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to find that in any discussion on the Spanish situation anybody who, even in a half-hearted way, becomes an apologist for the Government is driven to work back to the argument about the Vatican.  It is the last trench.  I wish we could have this matter about the Vatican cleared up. <Col N="760" /> There is an assumption in this House that the Vatican has taken no steps more than, say, Britain has, with regard to the recognition of the Franco Government.  There is also an assumption in this House that in international matters the Vatican, either because of its position or because of its Treaty situation is in exactly the same position, or that there is no different situation, from that of Great Britain. Are these three assumptions correct? I have seen it stated&mdash;I have not very recent information, but I have seen it stated&mdash;that the representative of what used to be called the Government of Spain, to the Vatican, has in fact departed from the Vatican, and that the representative who used to be accredited from the Vatican to what, I suppose, we ought still to call the Government in Spain&mdash;that is, the people recently presided over by Caballero&mdash;has also gone, and that there are at least junior diplomatic representatives exchanged as between the Burgos Government and the Vatican.  Whether that is so or not, I cannot say with accuracy, but the statement has been made, and has been made with authority.  Now, the President must know what the situation there is, and I say that it would be a good thing for us to be given some information as to the actual position by one who has access to official documents and who must be aware of the actual state of affairs, so far as they are revealed in such documents.  Are the old-time representatives, who used to be exchanged between the Caballero Government and the Vatican, still at their posts, or have they been withdrawn? If they have been withdrawn, have they been replaced, or are there mere empty buildings there?  Are there any exchanges between the Burgos Government and the Vatican?  These are points that, I am sure, could easily be cleared up by the President, and when these points are cleared up&mdash;and I suggest that they can be easily cleared up&mdash;we can advance to another argument.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the President is going to avail himself, in the same way as his Ministers have previously availed themselves, of the <Col N="761" /> argument of the Vatican, but will the President inform us whether or not there is anything in the Lateran Treaty which prevents the Vatican having the fullest liberty in connection with international matters that any government has, or is there not a clause there which says that in the matter of intervention in ordinary international affairs the Vatican is not to intervene unless invited to do so by both parties or by all parties to a conflict?  If that is so, is there any reason why this State, or anybody in this State, should seek to make an equation between the question of whether the Vatican has not recognised the Franco Government and this country has refused to do so?  Apart from these matters, which can be cleared up without any great conflict of argument, I suggest that it is clearly a fact that, no matter what self-denying ordinance the Vatican accepted with regard to intervention in international matters in the ordinary way, the Vatican has clearly the right&mdash;the right was not, indeed, given, but merely recognised in the Lateran Treaty&mdash;to exert its moral influence to the fullest extent, while it might not intervene through diplomatic usage in the ordinary way.  What has the Vatican done?  Is there any suggestion that the language used by the Vatican has been lacking in clarity so far as this trouble is concerned? Can anybody have any doubt as to where the Vatican stands in regard to the conflict?  Has not the language used by the Vatican been extremely clear?  Can any comparison be made between the language used by the Vatican and the fumbling utterances, through the President's own Press, and by himself and his Deputies and Ministers here and elsewhere, in regard to this whole struggle?</P>
    <P>The Vatican might easily have withheld even from observation on the matter, because, despite what Deputy MacDermot originally indicated he believed, and what the President, apparently, believes up to this moment, nobody at all can fail to make the distinction between the position of the Vatican in regard to the Catholic world and the position of this secular <Col N="762" /> State.  If the Vatican were as completely free as Great Britain or this country to intervene in the ordinary way, internationally, the Vatican also has a responsibility towards the Catholics of Spain, and the repercussion from Vatican action at this moment on the Catholic community in Spain might be a very serious thing. It might be exactly what would retard Vatican action.  Yet, notwithstanding that, it has not retarded Vatican comment. Over and over again, here in debate, an attempt has been made to get a proper viewpoint on this country's relations with the parties in Spain.  On the 26th of August of last year a reason was given, in an official communication sent to the Press, as to why the Government in this country was not breaking off diplomatic relations with Spain.  We had addressed a note to the French Minister in Dublin accepting the principle of non-intervention, and towards the end of the statement there was the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To those public bodies, however, and to others who have requested the Government to sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Government, the Government of Saorstát Eireann would point out that diplomatic relations are primarily between States rather than between Governments and that the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries would serve no useful purpose at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, certainly, was mealy-mouthed, to say the least of it.  The only comment that was added to it&mdash;and I gather that it was not part of the communication to the French Minister &mdash;was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Saorstát Eireann, in common with the whole Irish people and the Christian world, are profoundly shocked by the tragic events that have been taking place in Spain and by the excesses by which these events are reported to be accompanied.  Their sympathy goes out to the great Spanish people in their terrible suffering.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very neutral type of statement. We have a condemnation of excesses but no indication, so far as there was a Government mind at all <Col N="763" /> in this matter, as to on which side it was alleged these excesses had taken place.  A month earlier than this, at a time when one of the organs of the Press in this country had definitely taken up a position and indicated that, in their view, this fight was a fight between Communism and the combined forces of the Right, for control in Spain, the President's Party organ indicated their viewpoint in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That country is now divided into two camps in which the most unrestrained passions and the most intense hatreds prevail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They speak of two camps.  That was in July; but in August, as far as the Government were concerned, they deplored the excesses by which the events were reported to be accompanied. A little later, we had statements that were queried here in the House&mdash;notably one from Deputy Hugo Flinn.  The President, it will be remembered, tried to explain away Deputy Flinn's statement afterwards; but evidently Deputy Flinn himself was not satisfied and decided to cut the Gordian knot by writing to the newspapers to say that he never made the statement.  That was after the President had explained the statement. That is what I call fumbling. Whether it was deliberate, or whether it was due to a characteristic inability to take up a position and adopt a viewpoint, I do not know.  At any rate, I was making this comparison. I assert that this country is free to take any standpoint it likes in this international matter.  This country, knowing that its viewpoint would certainly be of importance to the people in the country and was not going to have any serious reactions on the Catholic community in Spain, on one side or the other, was, I suggest, in a different position from the Vatican State.  As far as this Government is concerned, they talked about the two camps in Spain and deplored the excesses that were taking place in that country.  His Holiness the Pope, speaking of the grave peril of Communism threatening the whole world <Col N="764" /> in reference to the Spanish conflict, referred to it as &ldquo;this rising tide of ferocity which is sweeping away churches, priests and worshippers&rdquo;; and the <i>Osservatore Romano,</i> the organ of the Holy See, dealing with the outrages perpetrated by &ldquo;the Spanish barbarians&rdquo;&mdash;that is their phrase&mdash; says: &ldquo;It is time to drop the mask and show to the world the naked face of these destroyers of Christian civilisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Pope later received a group of refugees from Spain and declared that &ldquo;the highest members of the sacred clergy, bishops and priests, consecrated virgins, the laity of every class and condition, venerable grey hairs and the flower of youth, sacred and solemn tombs have been assaulted, violated, destroyed in the most ruthless and barbarous ways in an unbridled, unparalleled confusion of forces, so savage and so cruel as to have been thought utterly impossible for human dignity, let alone for human nature, even the most debased.&rdquo;  That comes from a country with which an attempt is made here to put us on a footing. Our attitude in relation to the Spanish conflict is defended by a comparison with the Vatican.  There could be any number of quotations given indicating that whatever may be the situation in international politics of the Vatican, certainly, in so far as the Vatican was always free and had in no way submitted to any limitation on its right to exert its moral and spiritual authority in regard to conflicts, nobody could say that there was the slightest doubt about what the viewpoint of the Vatican was and the side which it would like to see prevailing.</P>
    <P>We have got a representative in Southern France.  What is he doing? The question which I asked the President on that matter drew from him a series of replies.  It is quite clear that this man has no staff worth while.  He is not there with any intent to do any serious business.  It was not even pretended that he had headquarters at St. Jean de Luz and agents throughout Spain, at least that is not what was told to us.  As far as the President's reply was concerned, it would indicate that he has been kept there as a mark of the President's stubbornness, <Col N="765" /> that that man was not going to be withdrawn as the accredited representative of this country to Spain. Even although he can do nothing, he is kept there in flat defiance of every expectation of the people.  Of course, we have got to take everything in proportion. A representative of this country in Spain, in the course of a great war, cannot do very much and we do know that this representative, or rather his office, did this in any event: they got such of our people, as were found in Spain, out.  They got them out through an agency, and the agency was the British Office and the British Fleet, and the President thanked the British Fleet for their efforts.  If the President would tell us that that is the only type of agency that is of any force or effect in that country, and that it is for that reason he cleaves still to the British Government, because of the aid they are able to give our people, whether they take a different viewpoint or not, then there is an arguable case for that, but that has not been put up as the case on which we stand.</P>
    <P>In other respects, this situation with regard to Spain has been allowed to develop in a peculiar way.  There is great complaint made in Great Britain of the fact that the broadcasting of any event from Spain is, in the minds of the majority of the listeners&mdash;at least those of them who take trouble to write to the newspapers&mdash;tinged with sympathy for the Caballero forces.  This country does not go in so much for broadcasting in that matter, but in any event in regard to a recent episode in the Spanish war, the British broadcasting authorities did see fit, not exactly to mend their hand on a particular broadcast, but at least to admit, or to recognise, that another viewpoint had been put forward, and that viewpoint had been very authoritatively stated and was allowed to be stated through the columns of the English <i>Times.</i>  An attempt was made to raise hysteria in England over the bombing of Guernica.  For days afterwards the columns of most of the English newspapers were filled with the stories current about that incident, and the English <i>Times</i> gave a column to a completely different version under the <Col N="766" /> heading of &ldquo;The Other Side.&rdquo;  That version has been referred to in at least two debates in the British House of Commons, but this country never noticed that there was another viewpoint. There had been not a very lengthy announcement with regard to that particular bombing from the Station here.  There was something done, but there was never a hint that there was another viewpoint and that that viewpoint was published in the columns of the English <i>Times,</i> as from a man who had visited that area.  If that particular individual's story is anything like correct, it revealed for the first time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should have raised that matter on another Estimate, the Estimate for Broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had raised it on the Broadcasting Estimate, I would be told that in international matters the source of authority was the President, as Minister for External Affairs, and that any line taken in international matters would be from the President as Minister for External Affairs.  I suggest that it is in order to refer to the matter here.  Whether we relate it to broadcasting or not, the President might think that it might be possible to clear up the errors that have been promulgated through the foreign Press or that have crept into this country.  It certainly does appear to <Col N="767" /> be a fact that the main places attacked in what was described as that outrage were three buildings given over to the manufacture of small arms.  As far as this country is concerned, it has hardly heard of that.  As far as Government intervention of the use of wireless is concerned, no hint of that has ever been given.</P>
      <P>Similarly, too, this country has played some part with regard to non-intervention. Just exactly what that part is, it is hard to say.  The view held by a member of the Government in regard to the non-intervention matter was given here by the Minister for Education, speaking on the 19th February of this year, as reported in Volume 65, No. 5, column 753.  The Minister was annoyed at the thought that anybody should complain that our representative on the Non-Intervention Committee should have discovered what was on foot before that committee; and should have taken care to get the matter explained, or should have a point of view.  Answering an interruption as to what his previous statement had to do with Spain, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has got to do with the statement of Deputy McGilligan that our representative at the Non-Intervention Committee should have got up there in front of the representatives of Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, England, and the 20 other nations represented, and asked questions, demanded that certain things be done, and, presumably, be satisfied in the name of the Irish Free State Government before he gave his consent to the proposals submitted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I suggest that what the Minister for Education was there pouring scorn upon was the attitude that one would expect the representative of any country to take on a matter affecting the policy of his Government.  I cannot conceive it to be the Government view that a representative of this country on any committee should go there in such a shrinking and cowardly way that he would expect openly to be defended in these words, pouring scorn on the view that our representative &ldquo;should <Col N="768" /> have got up there in front of the representatives of Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, England and the 20 other nations represented, and asked questions, demanded that certain things be done, and, presumably&rdquo;&mdash;this is the crescendo of scorn, the height of the scornful utterance&mdash;&ldquo;be satisfied in the name of the Irish Free State Government before he gave his consent to the proposals submitted.&rdquo; Surely he should?  It is not for our representative to go there blatantly to make trouble, but how can a Minister here use this sarcasm about the Irish Free State representative presumably being satisfied before he gave his consent to the proposals submitted?</P>
    <P>It may be that that is the viewpoint taken&mdash;that there is a definite recognition of the fact that this country does not count a whole lot in international matters, and particularly does not count at all in international matters when it comes to a display of sea power.  But that might have been broken to the people a little more gently than by this crude utterance of the Minister for Education in this debate.  It certainly must be a shock to the people in the country, when they are paying to have an odd representative go here and there to an odd international gathering, to find that the view taken of him was that he was really going to be something in the nature of a nuisance to the Government that sent him there if he decided to get an intelligent grasp of what was on foot, and, as far as his limitations allowed, to be satisfied with whatever proposal was put up before he agreed to it.</P>
    <P>It may be, however, that things which we do not have a great deal of power in regard to may work out strange international doctrines, and that consenting to a matter, even in a big crisis like this, without recording a point of view, may be disclosing a weakness and may further be preparing for a downfall when the matter becomes one of importance to this country in other circumstances.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what is the view of this country with regard to the blockade that was said to be in force&mdash; or at least that an attempt has been <Col N="769" /> made to enforce&mdash;around Bilbao at the moment.  The British have certainly taken up the line that while they will not have their boats used in an attempt to get men or munitions into any quarter of Spain, once it comes to food it is a different matter.  It is not so long ago since this country, quite properly and in conjunction with the majority of the nations of the world, tried to impose sanctions against Italy. We had a Bill here.  It is on the Statute Book at the moment.  We definitely prohibited, under certain penalties, the export of food to Italy.  Have we a viewpoint on these matters?  Why is there a change?  Has our representative a view as to whether the British viewpoint&mdash;largely based on the fact that she will not grant belligerent rights to either of the parties in Spain &mdash;is correct in regard to the blockade? Does the President think that it is of any importance to this country that General Franco has been insisting &mdash;and insisting in accord with old Spanish pronouncements and views&mdash; that the limit of territorial waters around Spain is not the three-mile limit, which Britain is so keen on having, but a six-mile limit?  Has our representative any view on that, or, even if he has accepted in some sort of tacit way the view with regard to the three-mile limit around Spain, has it been declared that that does not prevent another viewpoint being taken later?  I thought I noticed a sign of assent from the President here to-day when Deputy MacDermot said that General Franco recently had shown himself to be a Fascist.  I should like to have a reference from Deputy MacDermot or the President to the evidence which demonstrates that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the President indicated any view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the President will indicate a viewpoint on it sooner or later.  I take it that he does not, at any rate, want to be bound by an assent to Deputy MacDermot's view for the moment.  That statement has been made.  I myself felt that there was something of that tendency in the announcement that was made of a certain reorganisation of political forces behind General Franco as <Col N="770" /> declared to the people of this country from our broadcasting station recently. If those matters are going to be broadcast, surely there ought to be some care taken to find out what the exact situation is.  Unless there is a clear-cut statement by a man himself adopting a particular point of view, the evidence should be given upon which the statement is made that he has adopted that viewpoint.  Is it not an outrageous thing to have a statement, even tinged with a tendency of that type, broadcast to the people of this country when General Franco himself at the moment of this re-forming of his political forces definitely announced that he was going to have no Fascist State in Spain, in so far as he could guard the event?  That is the Spanish matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I think I can corroborate every word which Deputy Costello has said with regard to the general viewpoint on this side of the House.  Nobody need have any doubt about the policy of non-intervention, and there would be no doubt in the country if that matter had not been confused in some way in order to try and confuse the issue, which was a straight one between this side of the House and the Government on the question of the withdrawing of our Minister.  I have tackled that from only one point of view to-day, because I believe now that the matter has come to a point where it can hardly be confused any longer.  The big point of difference between us is not the question of non-intervention.  Even those other matters affecting the blockade and other things could be passed over. The matter upon which this country should, through its Government, declare itself in the one way that counts &mdash;not through fumbling statements&mdash; would be the definite withdrawal of a man who is certainly doing no good where he is.  He probably may not be able to do any good on either side, but with his presence in St. Jean de Luz and the attachment that he has with the Government until recently presided over by Caballero there is the international position that it is Caballero we recognise at the moment.  As long as that situation exists there will be a conflict between the two Parties, <Col N="771" /> and there is no doubt where the sympathies of the people lie.  The only thing to have explained away is this confusing item brought in with regard to the Vatican.  I am leaving it where it is.</P>
    <P>As far as the rest of our international affairs are concerned, there is in the first place our situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> Great Britain and the Commonwealth. After that, there is our situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> everybody else.  There are two points I should like to raise with regard to everybody except the Commonwealth. In Geneva recently there was instituted an inquiry.  It was popularly known as the Inquiry in Raw Materials.  There was an inquiry which was started after the speech made by the then Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain about two years before.  This is a committee which was set up in order to try and see if there was any peaceful way of resolving the conflict likely to arise between Germany, in the main, and other countries on this question of colonies&mdash;colonies regarded only as areas from which raw materials were drawn.  The committee was appointed by the League Council. It was set up on the initiative of the British Government.</P>
    <P>There had been a preliminary discussion, and somewhere about the early days of March the memorandum was under discussion.  It then appeared that that memorandum&mdash;I am quoting from the London <i>Times</i> of March 9&mdash;&ldquo;had lumped together Great Britain, the Dominions and the Crown Colonies under one head as the producing unit of the British Empire.&rdquo;  It is strange that objection was taken to that by two persons&mdash;Sir Frederick Leith Ross and, next morning, Sir Henry Strakosch&mdash;on behalf of the British Government. They were at pains to point out the autonomy of the Crown Colonies and the completely independent position of the Dominions.  It was rather objected that the memorandum was of no value, produced in the way in which it was, and that there should be a new division of the areas of the world, recognising the political and international status of the people whose countries were being inquired into.  I do not find anywhere that any objection <Col N="772" /> was raised by any representative of ours to that, as it is described, &ldquo;lumping together&rdquo; of Great Britain, the Dominions and the Crown Colonies as one unit for productive purposes.  I should like to know if that was done, and, if not, why some statement was not made by a representative of ours in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>The second point&mdash;it is a familiar one &mdash;occurred during certain of the debates in the British House of Commons in regard to the Spanish blockade.  A point was raised before Christmas as to what were called &ldquo;British ships&rdquo; carrying munitions in defiance of the international agreement. There was a question, first of all, as to whether protection would be given to such Dominion ships or British ships when carrying munitions, and, secondly, whether any penalties would be imposed on so-called &ldquo;British ships&rdquo; acting in defiance of the non-intervention agreement.  That matter was canvassed to some extent in a debate before Christmas, but, quite recently, when the non-intervention matter had advanced still further, it was amazing to find&mdash;in the year 1937 &mdash;that British legislation carried the phrase &ldquo;British ships other than the ships of the Irish Free State&rdquo;.  I do not know if the use of that term has been noticed.</P>
    <P>It is a term that used occasionally to creep into treaties, memoranda and documents proceeding from the British at conferences at which we met them. Every time it did appear, attention was called to it and, although it was difficult to get, from the angle of the terminology they find it necessary to use, a suitable phrase, in nearly every case it was found possible to get some way by which distinction was made between ships or nationals, as the case might be, of this country and those of Britain.  I do not know whether the President saw that phrase or not or whether his attention was called to it or whether any letter or representation has been addressed to anybody on the other side about it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these two things are straws which show the way the wind is blowing at the moment.  International <Col N="773" /> matters, so far as this country is concerned, used to be divided into two parts.  It was almost an easy matter to decide just what part was under discussion or the subject of thought at a particular moment by finding out what was the venue, so to speak, of the discussion.  If it was in London, we were dealing with internal affairs and the reaction of these internal affairs on the British Commonwealth.  If it was taking place in, or if the memoranda were addressed to or from Geneva, it was pretty certain that the question had to do with this country <i>vis-a-vis</i> countries other than members of the British Commonwealth.  Recently, it seems to me that this country has been so preoccupied in trying to get political advantage out of what had in previous years been done on what I might call the London front that the Geneva situation has been entirely neglected.  Certainly, no memoranda proceeding from the secretariat there and falling into the error of dealing with the British Empire, the Dominions and the Crown Colonies as one unit, would have passed without comment. I have the feeling that, so far as international matters are concerned, everything has been let go.  Very little attention is paid to the relationships of this country except in regard to the one matter of our relationship with Great Britain.  Even our relationship with members of the Commonwealth other than Great Britain has been somewhat neglected.  That position I cannot understand when I think of the position we have got into with the British in our external relations.</P>
    <P>In December of last year, this House was hurriedly summoned to pass certain legislation.  One of the pieces of legislation we did pass recognised the King.  That was legislation which admitted an act of abdication and forbore to let the situation develop which would have resulted from that abdication, which took place without any drive from this country.  This Parliament was asked to meet to patch up the differences.  We had to fill a particular gap and, boldly, we stepped into the gap and, by legislation which nobody can call coercive legislation or legislation under duress&mdash;certainly no such <Col N="774" /> statement was made about it at the time&mdash;we recognised the King for certain purposes.  As if that were not sufficient, one of the most defiant of the old-time Republicans associated with the President was sent down a few days later to the town of Boyle to indicate what the new situation was.  Here are his words, as reported in the Press of 14th December:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We deliberately kept a connecting link between the different parts of the Commonwealth of Nations because we believed it is in the best interests of the country to do so and for no other reason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is so clear a statement that it is hardly possible it came from the President. The negative and the positive of it must be regarded.  There was no question of duress, force or anything else.  It was, according to this statement, a free choice&mdash;a free choice in the best interests of this country.  That marked a change because about three years earlier&mdash;almost to the month&mdash; the President went forth to declare a viewpoint against a statement made by the then Dominions Secretary.  As reported in the Press of November 15th, 1933, under the heading of &ldquo;A Challenge,&rdquo; the President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the British Government say their form of Government,</P>
    <P>that is, the Irish Free State form&mdash;</P>
    <P>republic or monarchy, is a matter exclusively for the Irish people to decide, that the British Government will not quarrel with them over their choice whatever it may be?  The Irish people will understand, however, that if they choose a republic, they cannot be a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations or enjoy its privileges or advantages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report proceeds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President went on to say that he had no doubt what the choice of the Irish people would be if an issue based on such a statement was put before them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The previous part of this statement, which was alleged to be a challenge, ran along the lines of &ldquo;we do not care <Col N="775" /> about aggressive action of an economic type.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The viewpoint I take the President to have had up to the time of this swerve, made for him by the Minister for Lands at Boyle after this Act was passed, was that stated by him in 1933, and the statement then was distinctly and clearly: &ldquo;So long as you threaten us with aggressive military action, this country is opting, if it can be called opting, for a particular form of Government under duress.  Tell us we can do what we like, that the form of Government, republic or monarchy, is a matter for ourselves, even though it means that we leave the privileges and rights of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and I know the way the people will opt.&rdquo;  The hint there was: &ldquo;Even offer us the British Commonwealth of Nations, with all its rights and privileges, on the one side, and a republic on the other, and we will have the Republic.&rdquo;  I say there is a distinct swerve from that in this statement made by the Minister for Lands after this Bill was passed.  On 12th December we opted to have a King, and on the 14th, the Minister for Lands is sent to Boyle to say: &ldquo;We did; we opted for him because we believe it is in the best interests of the country to do so,&rdquo; and, he might have added, &ldquo;it was to get rid of all that nonsense of three years before and for no other reason.&rdquo; There was no question of aggressive military action by the British.  The President, faced in December, 1936, not even with taking a step provocatively and on his own initiative which would <Col N="777" /> have put this country out of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but rather than let a situation develop which would have ended by our being out, decides in the best interests of the people of this country that he is going to keep the link with the Commonwealth. That being the situation, and it has not been denied that that is the situation, the question naturally arises, when the people with whom we thought it to be in the best interests of this country to keep in association are meeting in London, in order to develop the whole association, to get the best out of it: Why do we swerve again from our viewpoint of December? We have accepted what the President in 1933 thought was the test.  It was the awful test.  It was then brought forward in 1936, without any hint of military aggression behind it.  In 1936 there was no such reason operating so far as the Minister for Lands is concerned, speaking for his President, and there was only one thing operating on the mentality of the Government&mdash;the interests of the people of this country &mdash;and they drove us to make our choice of staying within the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where did the interests of the country demand that we should be at this moment?  There is no longer the political nonsense to be talked; there is no longer the hint to be made that we are in this association because Britain would attack us with her war forces; and there is not even the hint that what was operating on our mind was anything in the nature of aggressive economic designs upon us.  There was the statement that we would at one time have been prepared to take a republic, with the recognition that, being a republic, we could not be in the Commonwealth and we should lose certain rights and privileges attaching to being in it, but there is no question of hostile action to be taken against us, in the way of penal tariffs or anything like that.  We clearly made our choice in December of last year, and, having made our choice in December of last year, and sent, as I say, the most defiant of all the Republicans down to Boyle to proclaim that it was in the interests of the country and for no <Col N="778" /> other reason, we now have to take a new swerve.</P>
    <P>The thing, however, is being narrowed down.  I remember the time when it was proclaimed to be treachery to all the ideals of the people of this country for anybody to have thought in terms of the monarchy.  The monarchy was not a symbol of organisation, or association, or co-operation; it was the symbol of all the wrongs done to this country, and it was around that symbol, and the acceptance of it, that the whole break over the Treaty occurred.  The President is now in the position that he has accepted that, but he will not go to London, even although he said to-day there are matters being discussed there in which we are interested. In my part of the country, at this time of the year, one hears the Orange bands practising.  They are getting ready for the 12th July, and they work up to a crescendo of music about the 12th.  After that, when some one of the bands, feeling lonely for the earlier performance, takes out one flute and plays a few notes on it, the populace gets excited.  They do not know what has happened.  It is almost the beat of the tom-tom sounding through the village.  We had dropped the practice. Our 12th July, so to speak, had come and gone on 12th December of last year.  Why is not the President having a bang at the drum or just a tootle on a single little flute at this moment?  Is it because of the election?  The President to-night admits that matters in which we are interested are being discussed in London, and the President will not take part in that discussion, although in the interests of his country he has kept the association, and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>There is on at the moment, of course, a process of piecemeal settlement.  The President talked to-night about the annuities. He dragged in Partition and the secret agreement, revealed in these two volumes on the desk in front of us. The President never stops to think that, three years ago, he might have still talked of secret agreements and of paying money to Britain, while he was carefully concealing himself behind the backs of the unfortunate civil servants whom he sent to England to make an <Col N="779" /> agreement whereby the annuities were paid.  But remember that he has now done that three times.  It is futile to be talking about the enormous harm done to this country, and making these amazing calculations about the debt to America and so on, when three times he has sent across people to make agreements, and it was clear, the moment an agreement was entered upon, that there was one line beyond which the British were not going to move, beyond which apparently he never attempted to get them to move, and that is, their own terms: &ldquo;Every penny withheld from us through the annuities dispute we are going to get.&rdquo; Year after year for three years he has made his agreements.  If there was a secret agreement, it was one agreement. Three times the President has done the same thing.</P>
    <P>We have now got, as the last resort, this laboured effort to-day about Partition. The situation apparently now is that no matter what our association with the Commonwealth may be, no matter how well we have got over our old antipathy to the Crown, no matter how distasteful it has been to the President to accept that people had more foresight in 1921 than he had, that they saw a situation which could be developed for the good of the people of this country and did develop, and that it took until the late winter of the year 1936 to get from him a declaration that it was in the interests of the people of this country to remain in a particular association&mdash;notwithstanding that he has been brought to that point, he now decides that he has to make the whole matter pivot upon this&mdash;as long as there is Partition we are going to sulk.  Even although there are matters of importance being discussed over there, we are told that our representation over there in London at this moment might lead to grave misunderstandings, and we are not at the same time prepared to co-operate even in other matters that are of mutual interest.</P>
    <P>The President has gone further than that in this inconsistency.  I remember years ago there used to be a thing spoken of called the All-Red <Col N="780" /> route between Canada and this country.  There was a time when Canada was no longer interested in that, and, Canada being no longer interested, the British Government were no longer interested in it.  It was revived recently, and the old All-Red route is now a fact, or rapidly approaching being a fact.  People who read the comments of the English Press about their preparations for war got presented to them in a very pictorial way that one of the new matters being contemplated with regard to defence was wireless.  You had the statement one time, backed by a little map, that the wireless defence of the British Empire had to consist of certain stations, and they were supposed to be placed in a more or less quadrilateral way.  Later, it was recognised that we were going to have a particular base along the Western coast.  Some time later we got a hint of an oil refinery here, the economics of which are somewhat suspect.  Of course, the practical use, from a war viewpoint, is enormous and is quite clear.  It seems to me to be a pity, if this country is obsessed by, or if the mentality of the Government is in any way concentrated upon, the possibility of war, that quite close to where the centre of industrial activity is, through the power-house at the Shannon, there should be placed two other things&mdash;we are told now possibly an ammunition factory&mdash;all to be a target for aircraft in this country, if we ever get involved in a war.  When there is one great point of vulnerability around the city in a particular gas container, that would be tolerated in no other city, the President decides to have another target in the nature of this refinery fairly close to that.</P>
    <P>What are these touches that we have with Great Britain?  It may not be that our motive in swinging in certain things has been to help the British, but what we do is going to be of enormous help to them.  The whole policy, of course, is stated by the President when he said this: &ldquo;We have definitely stated that we will not permit our territory to be used as a base of attack upon Britain and we will do everything in our power to defend our own <Col N="781" /> territory.&rdquo;  Some time after, the Minister for Finance, in a pathetic way, said: &ldquo;What more could the President be expected to say?&rdquo;  The text of that speech, when it was being impressed on the Minister, was that some touch ought to be got with the British Government of a friendly type, and the Minister referred to that statement and said: &ldquo;What more could the President be expected to say than to make the declaration that this country was never going to let its shores be used as a base of attack upon Britain.&rdquo;  Taking that, and throwing in these things, that we have accepted our association in the political line and it is said we did that principally in the interests of the people of the country and for no other reason&mdash; nobody will say it was duress or force; it was a deliberate choice&mdash;thinking of all that, and of the various bridges that have been crossed, we arrive at that particular point.  Then, at the end of it, when there is a collection of the representatives of that association meeting in London to get the best they mutually can out of the association, we sulk and we will not go there.  Is there any reason for it?</P>
    <P>The President has very nearly got us into a position that long ago he thought would be the proper situation for this country to adopt.  It is a notable thing that in all the last half-dozen books produced about the British Empire, or British Commonwealth, whichever it is called, the stress is always on this&mdash;that what used to be called the Dominions are now free and independent communities.  They move in their own spheres of influence, independently of any other; no coercion; no one Government speaks for the lot; nobody advises the King, who is the representative of the whole lot, at least for certain purposes.  Inside what these books always describe as their home areas, they move freely.  But every one of these books takes this peculiar swerve, that the same cannot be said of the Commonwealth as an international person; that when action is required it will be action in an emergency; that whenever action in an emergency comes, there is only one Government close at hand to advise, and that is the British Government. <Col N="782" /> Although these people have certainly been converted&mdash;some of them were a very obstructive type of Unionists or Imperialists&mdash;but no matter how much they have been converted to the viewpoint of the Dominions as international persons in the limited home field, they certainly all still very tenaciously cling to the idea that, once it comes to facing towards the outer world of international matters, then the Empire has got to be considered as a unit and, in these circumstances, there is only one Government and one source of authority, one real authority.</P>
    <P>That may be in accord with the President's view.  The President's Party organ seems to be leaning gradually on an ancient professor of constitutional law who was very strong in that point of view, having been converted after many years of effort to a recognition of the internal position.  Remember, the President long ago did opt for what he called a Monroe Doctrine for the British Isles.  He will remember the interview he gave to the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> in which he made a comparison between this country and Cuba:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The United States by the Monroe Doctrine made provision for its security without depriving the Latin Republics of the South of their independence and their life.  The United States safeguarded itself from the possible use of the Island of Cuba as a base for an attack by a foreign power by stipulating: &lsquo;That the Government of Cuba shall never enter into any Treaty or other compact with any foreign power or powers which will impair or tend to impair the independence of Cuba, nor in any manner authorise or permit any foreign power or powers to obtain, by colonisation, or for military or naval purposes or otherwise, lodgment in or control over any portion of said island.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President was reported to have said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why doesn't Britain make a stipulation like this to safeguard herself against foreign attack as the United States did with Cuba?  Why doesn't Britain declare a Monroe Doctrine for the two neighbouring islands?  The people of Ireland so <Col N="783" /> far from objecting, would co-operate with their whole soul.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that what the President really meant, only expressing it differently, when he said that we would never permit our territory to be used as a base of attack upon Great Britain and that we will do everything in our power to defend our own territory?  I started off by saying that I thought that in the peculiar concentration upon one very narrow point of our international relations <i>vis-a-vis</i> Great Britain, we seem to have no proper policy or plan with regard to international relations.  It may be that there is a plan.  The President may be harping back to the Cuban status idea.  The President may have given a promise that Ireland would never be used as a base of attack on Great Britain.  He may be working on his own plan, because even the President cannot pride himself from his previous record on his consistency. Supposing we have something like Cuban status or something like the Monroe Doctrine declared by ourselves. Supposing we have taken up that position.  Was there anything that made us, as we did last December, do what we did except the interests of the people of this country?  Keep all these things together and let the President give us some argument in support of his policy.  Why did the President in December last year make agreements with the British and have these agreements signed along the dotted lines for the payment of the land annuities?  The President could possibly get some basis of agreement on economic matters with the British.  It is interesting to hear how his attitude in not endeavouring to do so could be defended.  But I suggest now to the President that he has burned his boats or has burned so many of them that the loss of any further little craft does not matter.  He might get some advantage for the people of this country so as to enable our folk to live here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should possibly want to be very careful in wording what I am now going to say, lest the President may resort to his ordinary device of abuse when he feels it necessary <Col N="784" /> to answer certain questions.  I think Deputy McGilligan has already asked that our Government should recognise a state of belligerency in Spain and give belligerency rights to the contesting parties.  Have our Government recognised that Spanish territorial waters extend only three miles out?  If our Government recognises that, I would like to know why they do?  With regard to our relations with the British, I understand that the President in his statement referred to Partition.  I understand he referred several times to the presence of the British in our ports.  It is generally recognised in every part of the world that a Government has continuity, and it is by reason of the fact that a Government has continuity that States are able to come to agreements in the form of treaties.  Otherwise, if a treaty made by one Government may be overthrown by a popular vote in a few months time, then it is obvious that no Government can forego any of its rights which they are not able to assert in the event of another Government coming into power in another country with which they made agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, just about nine years ago, discussing with the officials of the Department of External Affairs certain matters with regard to the ports in which the British now have care and maintenance parties.  These officials at that time made no secret of the fact that the British Government anticipated that these ports would be handed over within the space of ten years' time. Now, I presumed at that time that that would take place automatically at the end of ten years.  We know that the reason why the British maintain those care and maintenance parties there is that we are geographically within their lines of defence, within the lines of defence of a country depending upon sea-borne supplies of food which might be interfered with in time of war.  Now, presuming that these places would be handed over to us, I naturally recognised that in the handing over to us, the British would require, possibly, to know that these ports would be maintained and in a condition to be of service in preventing interference by hostile craft in our <Col N="785" /> seas in time of war.  But when the present Government came into power they said they were not going to be bound by any agreement made by their predecessors unless that agreement had been ratified here in the Dáil even though these agreements were made in terms that did not stipulate about that ratification.  That was the origination of the whole ramp about secret agreements. We know that the agreement about the land annuities in 1923 was notified to the Dáil here and the Dáil, having been informed that such agreement had been made, proceeded to vote moneys.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will allow me, there is a point on which I should like the House to be clear.  It is not usual or, indeed, permissive in discussing the Estimates to reopen on one Vote a matter already decided on a previous Vote.  The House might have taken any one of many subjects for which the Executive Council has joint responsibility on the Vote for the Executive Council.  The matter principally discussed was the relations between this State and Great Britain.  It would obviously be an abuse of procedure if, when a Minister had concluded on one Vote, the whole matter could be reopened on the following Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir. There is this peculiar overlapping here, but I wonder would I be in order in referring to one or two matters somewhat analogous.  I refer to an order, No. 804, which was published by the Government in 1932.  It will be remembered that in certain negotiations which took place between our Government and the British, various matters were referred to in some of them.  Our Government gave a direct negative to the British <i>vis-a-vis</i> in certain matters.  In other matters it was agreed there was a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I refer to such matters as the road fund, coinage and currency.  Under the head of receipts under certain articles of the Peace Treaties which deal with ex-enemy debts and properties, we have this note: &ldquo;It is understood that the validity of the agreement of 1925 is not contested, but that a further discussion <Col N="786" /> is desired.  To this the United Kingdom representatives would readily agree.&rdquo;  Then under the head of &ldquo;Dead Notes&rdquo; it was stated: &ldquo;When the Irish Free State introduced their own currency notes in 1928 the necessity for legislating afresh on the matter raised the question of notes which had been outstanding so long that they might be regarded as lost and as never likely to be presented. The allocation of the value of these notes, when written off, between the two Governments might well form the subject of further discussion.&rdquo;  There was agreement between the two Governments on the matter of the Post Office dormant accounts.  As regards all those points in which it appears we put forward a claim to certain moneys, which was not wholly contested by the British, I do not see how I can discuss them without referring to the fact that ever since that time the British Government have been collecting all, and more than all, the moneys that they claim due.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy cannot do so, the fault does not lie with the Chair.  The question of this State's relations with Great Britain has been debated to-day.  It cannot be reopened now.  If there are other matters upon which the Deputy desires to ask questions, the Chair will not rule stringently, but the main question must be taken as closed.</P>

      <P>Surely, these are largely matters of a departmental nature and they ought to have been raised on the Vote for the President's Department.  I scarcely think that the Vote for the Minister for External Affairs is the appropriate place to raise them.  They relate more particularly to the Department of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>Surely the Department of External Affairs is the channel through which all our external business is done.  I would assume that, inasmuch as it was proposed in 1932 that certain negotiations between the Government of the Irish Free State and the British Government should take place, this Vote for External Affairs is the appropriate <Col N="787" /> Vote on which to discuss the matter.  With regard to the Road Fund, the papers relating to a conference from which I have already quoted state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is agreed that the Irish Free State are entitled to a share of the Road Fund.  The dispute is as to the method of apportionment; the Irish Free State claimed that the past decisions of the Road Board as to allocation of grants had been unfair and should be retrospectively revised, but the Treasury regard this as inadmissible.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It had already been agreed to submit the question to the arbitration of Sir Henry Strakosch.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would not have dreamed of raising these points on any other Vote.  It is proposed, in connection with these various things, that there should be negotiation and, in one case, arbitration. I want to know what has been done about them since.</P>

      <P>I submit they are all aspects of our relations with Great Britain which, as the Chair has ruled, were fully discussed on the previous Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are certainly connected with our external relations, and if we are not allowed to refer to them on this Vote, I do not see where they can more appropriately be introduced. We have not only the estimate for the Office in Dublin here, but we have also the estimate for our representative in London.  The Minister is down, though his salary is not indicated. If we are to be excluded completely from making any reference to possible contingent negotiations between this country and the Government of Great Britain, then we reduce the Department of External Affairs to a mere negligible quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how we can discuss this matter at all without such reference. For instance, in the Bill passed last December amending the Constitution in respect of external relations, there is a change proposed.  It is stated that all our external relations will be done by or on the authority of the Executive Council.  That does seem to me to imply certain changes.  It <Col N="788" /> would, to my mind, imply a change with regard to passports.  It would, presumably, imply a change with regard to the credentials of Ministers Plenipotentiary sent by this Government to other countries, and it would imply also a change in the credentials of the representatives of other countries accredited here.  I would like to know if the form of the new credentials has been drafted and decided upon, and I would like the House to be notified as to the form of words now being used.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while I am speaking on that, I am reminded that the last we heard of the policy of our Government was that in strict accord with the Geneva decision we could not recognise the King of Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia.  I have seen it stated in the papers that a new Italian Minister is to come here.  Are we going to reverse the policy as it was and accept credentials from his Majesty the King of Italy and the Emperor of Abyssinia?  What I got up to deal with, I am afraid, concerns almost exclusively the relations between this country and Great Britain and if that is to be excluded, I cannot continue.</P>

      <P>We are accustomed to be asked on each occasion when this Estimate is brought before the House for adoption, to give a lengthy report of world affairs.  That is, in effect, what it would amount to, if we are to meet the wishes expressed by Deputies like Deputy Costello.  I was listening very carefully to the extracts which Deputy Costello quoted from a Canadian report, which he held up to us as a model.  I was just wondering if we brought in a report of that sort and presented it to the Dáil what would be the remarks of Deputies on the opposite benches.  I believe they would immediately say to us that we were telling them things they knew full well; that we were telling them of the ordinary routine work that was being done by our representatives in foreign countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, our representatives, whether they be in Paris or Berlin or Rome or the United States&mdash;wherever they are&mdash;must keep us informed of the policy of the State to which they <Col N="789" /> are accredited, and they do that. Would it add very much to the information which Deputies have if I were to tell them in a report that our Minister, say in Washington, kept us informed of the policies of the American Government in regard to world affairs in so far as it was possible for him to find out what their policies were?  In fact, the things that would be of most value to us as a Government, and to Deputies if they wanted to get information that would be most valuable, would be just the very things I could not give in a report.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in the very nature of things we can hardly say more about our representatives than that they are representing us, and that they are available to be called upon by us at any time to perform services for any of our citizens and for the State as a whole: to initiate conversations with regard to trade where there is a question of trade or with regard to any other matter.  They also send us information of the happenings in a country in so far as that information is capable of supplementing and adding to the reports which we get by following the ordinary Press.  That is, in fact, the type of summary that I would have to give if I were to follow the example which the Deputy has held up to us, and, frankly, I do not think it would be worth while collating and printing a report of that sort.  It would not add to the information which Deputies have.  Now, the Department in its information is very much like any other news-gathering centre.  Rumours come in first.  After that, you get confirmation, or the reverse, of these rumours, and from day to day the situation changes.  You try to keep in constant touch with it, but it changes for us in the same way as it changes for the ordinary reader who tries to keep himself informed on world affairs by following the Press.  There is very little in general that you can say about it that is going to add to the information which the ordinary person gets. Frankly, I do not think it would be worth while presenting that in the form of a report.</P>
    <P>We are also told that in other Parliaments it is usual, on the Vote for External Affairs, to have world affairs <Col N="790" /> discussed.  Yes, undoubtedly, world affairs as they impinge immediately upon the particular State in question, but not a roving debate over the whole world situation.  It is that situation as it immediately affects the particular State in question.  If it is Great Britain, it is the question of her relations with France Germany or some of the nations about which public interest is excited.  In our case it is quite clear that if we had to publish and give the House a very long report, the debate here would be concentrated on exactly the same points that it was concentrated on to-day, and these are matters on which we have already spoken to the House on several occasions.</P>
    <P>Nobody is going to say in this House that our relations with Great Britain are not well known.  I was mocked when I began to speak of the position with regard to Partition. &ldquo;Who are you telling that to; do we not know all about it?&rdquo;  That was the complaint that was made on one of the things that most affects us, and most affects our relations with Great Britain.  I was supposed to be doing a completely unnecessary work when I referred to that, and yet it is fundamental, as far as our relations with Great Britain are concerned.  When I spoke on the question of the annuities I was told I was flogging a dead horse, or something of that sort.  Yet again it is one of the most important things in regard to our external affairs, a thing that immediately concerns us.  The question of our ports and defence was brought up.  Is there anyone who will say for a moment that it was necessary for me to give a report on the position with regard to our ports?</P>
    <P>The position in Spain was brought up.  Was there any necessity for me to deal at length with regard to the position in Spain?  We have had several debates on it already, and there was no material change in the situation.  A policy of non-intervention is not equivalent to a policy of disinterestedness and carelessness with regard to what might be the results of the conflict in Spain.  I am glad to have it explicitly stated from the opposite benches&mdash;it was by no <Col N="791" /> means so clear some time ago&mdash;that the policy of non-intervention is now accepted by them as the proper national policy, and that they are now prepared to stand by it without hesitation. I think it is the best policy, as I said before, in the interests of Spain.  I think it is the best in the interests of world peace, and because we are standing by this policy of non-intervention we do not want to do things on either side.  The policy of non-intervention means this, that whatever our sympathies may be on one side or the other, the States of the world should keep their hands off, that they should cease giving munitions to the parties on one side or the other, and should not interfere.  As far as I have been able to hear about it, the cry from the Franco side has been: &ldquo;Let foreigners not come here to Spain and we will settle this matter ourselves.&rdquo;  The appeal from the Spanish people has been to get those foreigners out of Spain.  They have said that if it were not for those acts of intervention on the one side or the other the thing would have been finished long ago.</P>
    <P>Our representative, with the representatives of a number of other countries, is at St. Jean de Luz.  He is there able to keep in touch with both sides.  From that point of view he is nearer to and has greater facilities for getting into communication with the Franco side than with the other.  We have not formally withdrawn him.  I did not think that a formal withdrawal of our Minister was going to help conditions in Spain, or was going to help the situation from the world point of view.  In so far as our influence has been of any value, our representative has worked consistently for this policy of non-intervention; that it should be, in fact and in truth such a policy and not a mere verbal agreement.  So far as Spain is concerned Deputies know perfectly what is happening.  They know what our representative is doing and what the representatives of other countries are doing.  He is getting for us such information as he can get and is keeping in touch with both sides.  As regards minors, there was the question of trying to get minors, who had gone <Col N="792" /> away without the consent of their parents and were engaged in the conflict on one side or the other, out of the area of conflict.  We succeeded in the case of those on one side in getting them out to a position behind the fighting lines.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult at first sight to say what are all the things that a representative in another country does. If we want to maintain our international status we have to do what other nations do in that regard, and we are only doing what is, so to speak, the minimum that is required.</P>
    <P>It is not right to suggest that the Department of External Affairs is the Cinderella Department.  I admit that it is not a very big Department as regards numbers and personnel, but it is one of the most important Departments of State.  Through it are canalised all our dealings with outside countries.  All communications with outside countries are canalised and done through the Department of External Affairs, so that it will not happen that one Department will be going on one line of policy and another Department on another.  The work is being co-ordinated, each knowing what the other is doing.  It is a most important Department, and I think the fact that the President of the Executive Council has himself taken over that Department&mdash;let us forget about the person who is occupying the position at the moment&mdash;is an indication of that.  The fact that he has taken on the Department of External Affairs&mdash; you have the same position in a number of other countries&mdash;is proof of the importance of the Department, from the point of view of the estimation of the Government.</P>
    <P>So it is all nonsense to say that this is the Cinderella Department and that it gets no attention.  I will admit, quite frankly, that, obviously, if I am to do other work, I cannot give as much time directly to the Department of External Affairs as I could give if I had that duty solely to perform.  That is quite true, and I admit it.  The time, and so on, that I spend in connection with other Departments, I would give to that Department if I were dealing with that Department alone.  That does not mean, however, that I am not <Col N="793" /> satisfied that everything that should be done in that Department is being done. I am.  I was very fortunate to have officials in that Department who have been working there and who have been acquainted with the work of the State since the State was founded.  It was an old Republican Department which was carried on, and I am perfectly satisfied that the fact that I cannot attend to a number of details, to which I should attend if I were Minister for that Department alone, is not detrimental to the Department, and I am quite satisfied that the work of that Department is not suffering from the fact that I might not be able to attend to all these details.  I get every piece of information that I should get in connection with that Department, and I get every piece of information, particularly, in connection with our relations with Great Britain, inasmuch as the most important part of the work in External Affairs is in connection with Great Britain, in which the Government, as a whole, has an immediate interest, since that is the biggest external relation that we have to deal with.  Any information in that regard comes, of necessity, directly and immediately to me.</P>
    <P>We are asked what our High Commissioner in London is doing.  The Deputies who ask that question know perfectly well what he is doing.  He is there, not merely in the capacity of a diplomatic representative, but he also combines in himself, with that, the position, so to speak, of a trade representative. He is the one member of our external representatives who is in direct and immediate touch with some of our Departments, because of the extent of our trade relations with Great Britain.  Nobody suggests, I think&mdash;certainly no Deputy in the House, and I doubt if there is any person in the country who does not know fully what, in general, is the type of work that our High Commissioner in London is doing&mdash;that he should be withdrawn.  I do not think the suggestion would come from any quarter that he should be withdrawn or that he was not worth his salary, or that that particular office was not worth the money that is being spent on it.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, in a debate like this, <Col N="794" /> if we leave aside the ordinary details of expenditure, once we begin to discuss our external relations, it is inevitable that the whole weight of the debate will be concerned with our relations with Great Britain.  Deputy McGilligan tried to make some point as to inconsistency when he said that there were matters of great importance affecting this country being discussed in Great Britain at the present time, and that we are not there.  In my statement on my own Vote, as President of the Executive Council, I admitted that we are interested in these things; but we are interested in other things even more than we are interested in the things that are being discussed at present.  Trade treaties and so on, are going to be bi-lateral. They are bi-lateral agreements.  As far as we and Great Britain are concerned, any of these trade treaties that are made, from time to time, between the several States, are, by their very nature, bi-lateral, and if there is any question of our trade relations with Great Britain, the mutual interests of the two countries will put us in the position of being able to make such trade agreements, and it is not necessary to go to the Imperial Conference in order to have matters of that kind brought forward for discussion.  The fact is that the relations between us and Great Britain are such that the other States, besides Great Britain, would hesitate to interfere.  They would say: &ldquo;Keep us out of your difficulties; these are difficulties peculiar to yourselves, and we have no quarrel with either of you.  Just keep us out. These are quarrels between two particular units, and we do not want to be brought into them.&rdquo;  I must say that I would find it very difficult to resist an appeal of that sort, or to base a claim as to why they should come in. They will probably have this interest&mdash; but it is not necessary for us to go and point it out to them&mdash;that, as far as they are concerned, and so far as the position of the States of the British Commonwealth in the world as a whole is concerned, the more unity there is and the more definitely all the groups co-operate, the better it is for them. Consequently, for their own interests, and apart from any wishing well as <Col N="795" /> between Great Britain and ourselves&mdash; Great Britain being the mother country from which many of their citizens derive&mdash;they would probably have an interest in both of our countries from that point of view.  Apart from that, however, in their own interest, they would like to see any differences that exist between Great Britain and ourselves fixed up, but what they would say is: &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, try and fix up your differences yourselves,&rdquo; and they would be very slow, I think, to go farther than that, and either to suggest solutions or to press for a particular type of solution.</P>
    <P>There are no deviations as regards the main lines of our policy&mdash;the main lines of the policy for which we have been working.  As I have said, I think that the central aim of anything I have ever done, in so far as there has been a question between Great Britain and ourselves, was to try to arrive at a foundation on which good relations between the two countries could be permanently founded, but I know, and everybody here must know as well as I do, that it is only on the basis of fair play and justice that you can get those good relations established.  Everybody knows the position that we had in this country, and you could not get these good relations between us so long as you had the Oath in the Constitution and the number of other symbols that were in the Constitution.  They had to be got rid of, and the clearing away of them was absolutely necessary in order that the site should be cleared before any proper edifice of good relations could be placed upon it.  I think, for instance, that this new Constitution, so far as this part of the country is concerned, does clear away a number of the things which would make good relations between the two countries impossible.  It does clear away a number of these obstacles to good relations between the two countries, and that is why it is devised.</P>
    <P>The people in this country, just as the people in other countries, will differ as to what is the best possible policy, in the interests of their country, for foreign affairs; and what I have been trying to do in this Draft Constitution is to put that thing outside of <Col N="796" /> the machinery of the State and the machinery of Government, so that it could be dealt with and we could differ upon these matters of foreign policy without differing at all upon the institutions, so to speak, of this State.  I am perfectly certain that the new Constitution will mean a tremendous advance towards laying the foundations for good relations between the two countries.  If we had that situation which is envisaged in that Constitution for the whole of this country&mdash;if we had the question of the ports settled &mdash;then the question of our relations with Great Britain would be a matter for a difference of opinion amongst our people, just as, for example, the question of whether the United States becomes a member of the League of Nations or not is a matter for a difference of opinion amongst the people of America.  It would be no longer the same type of difference.  When you examine it, all it means is that we have tried to get down to a basis of justice in which any relationships our people may have with other countries will be relationships into which they will not be forced by threat of military action or anything of that kind, but relationships which they will undertake freely because it is in their interests, the interests of the people generally.</P>
    <P>Some statement made by the Minister for Lands has been referred to, and it is suggested that he made that statement on behalf of the Government. Not every Minister who speaks goes out as if he had got a special commission to speak on behalf of the Government.  There was no question of that.  I have not got his exact words here, but my recollection of what he did say was that what we did was done in the interests of the country and was done for no other reason.  A more general statement as the basis of any action could not be made.  Should not everything we do as a Government be done in the interests of our people?  If we, for instance, make a Coal-Cattle Pact with Britain, in whose interests are we doing it?  At the time we made this pact there was a very heavy pressure on our people and it was necessary to that extent, whilst that <Col N="797" /> pressure was there, to make this agreement so that the pressure would not become altogether intolerable.  Is there a suggestion that, because we made this agreement, we accept the situation?  We do not.  Our protest about what is being done by the British in that matter has continued and will continue so long as moneys are being extracted from our people which we think are not due and should not be paid in justice.  There is nothing inconsistent in that.  No more fundamental reason can be given by anybody for the action taken in that particular case.  When we enter into a Coal-Cattle Pact or any other pact, it is because of the fact that the interests of our people demand that the thing should be done, but it does not mean&mdash;and we have been careful to point out that it does not mean&mdash; that we accept the situation as being a just one or that we have ceased to protest against it.  Our present action is also in the form of a protest.  Our refusal to go to the conference is also in the form of a protest, so that it would be made clear in the most definite way that we protest against the taking of moneys from our people which are not, in our opinion at any rate, due.  The taking of them, in our view, cannot be defended.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are any special points brought out in the debate that need to be further dealt with.  The debate covered such a very wide field that it is very hard to deal with it.  I was asked about the position of the Italian Minister.  That will be made clear when the formal reception takes place.  We are receiving the representative of the other country in the same spirit as the gesture, the friendly gesture, in asking us to accept the Minister, was made.  There has been some reference to an explanation by me of a statement which was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. Here in a debate somebody quoted, or purported to quote, a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I asked somebody here if he could give me a copy of the statement.  I took that statement and I interpreted it, assuming that it had been made, as I thought that ordinarily it should be <Col N="798" /> interpreted, and I said that, even on that statement, the case that was being made by the Opposition was not tenable.  Is there any inconsistency between that and the fact of the Parliamentary Secretary's stating afterwards that he never made that statement?  I did not say that the Parliamentary Secretary had made it. There was a report, which was alleged to give that statement.  I asked to see it, and I interpreted the report as it was given to me.  There is no inconsistency in doing that and in his saying afterwards that the statement was not made at all.  Some of the old orators made up speeches for delivery which they never made afterwards.  If there was a question of the interpretation of a passage from such a speech, that I interpreted it, and that it transpired afterwards that the speech had never been delivered, there would be nothing inconsistent in my having interpreted the speech given to me and the statement afterwards that the speech was never delivered.  However, these are very small points indeed, and I do not think it worth while spending the time of the House in going over them further.</P>
    <P>With regard to broadcasting, there is a peculiar confusion of thought. The broadcasting station acts independently. It has an independent news-gathering method and it gives out the news it gets, just as a newspaper or any other independent body gives out news.  We do not control, in that sense, the news service.  It publishes certain governmental communiques when they are sent along but they are always acknowledged and definitely given as governmental communiques. I do not know whether the view of the Opposition is that whenever there is any news statement issued by the broadcasting station, which may not correspond exactly with the information we may have, it is our duty to go out and correct it.  These things correct themselves.  The news of one day very often corrects the news of the day before, and unless there was some very blatant and dangerous statement broadcast, we would not interfere ordinarily.  If my attention were called to some misleading statement issued by the broadcasting station, <Col N="799" /> which I found to be misleading, if it affected our external relations in any way, either by getting our people to believe that things had happened which had not happened or the reverse, and if I thought it of sufficient importance, I agree with Deputy McGilligan it might be advisable to issue a Government communique on the subject.  No matter of that kind has so far been brought to my notice. I do not watch these announcements every evening myself.  I do not know whether the Department make it their business to watch all the statements issued from the broadcasting station to see if they are accurate in regard to international affairs.  I think it would be a rather heavy task and it is only in cases where the matter would be brought to our attention that we would ordinarily take cognisance of what was issued by the broadcasting station.  I agree that if it touched external affairs, and if the matter were sufficiently important, we should take cognisance of it and try to correct <Col N="800" /> any wrong impression.  It should obviously be a matter of very great importance before we could do that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I do not remember every point which was made, but I think that the main points were with regard to our relations with Great Britain, and with regard to the question of Spain.  In regard to Spain, the Opposition has repeated a point of view which it has expressed before. I would only repeat the point of view which I have expressed before, and there would be no use in doing that.  With regard to Britain, I have given a full account in the previous speech.  With regard to our Ministers, they are doing what the Ministers of other countries do.  With regard to giving a report, I think that, very largely, it would be waste, because the things you would like to know, and that would be some information if you could be given them, are of their nature the sort of things we would not be at liberty to give.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £8,612 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Síntiús mar chabhair do Chostaisí Chumann na Náisiún, agus chun Costaisí eile mar gheall air sin.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,612 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations, and for other Expenses in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>Since the House last had occasion to discuss and vote and estimate to provide for the continued membership by Saorstát Eireann of the League of Nations, there has been very little of interest to report.  The Assembly of the League had two sessions, at both of which this country was represented by a delegation. The first of these sessions took place in July, 1936.  The second of these meetings of the League Assembly took place in September, 1936, when the ordinary session of the 17th Assembly was held.  The session was attended by a relatively small delegation from Saorstát Eireann, and its most notable achievement was the appointment of a special committee to study and report on the vital question of reforming the Covenant&mdash;a question which had been raised by most delegations, including our own, at the previous session in July.  That committee is now at work.  In proposing this Vote, I am, therefore, proposing we should await that decision before committing Saorstát Eireann to any new policy with regard to her membership of the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>As the House will recall, when speaking on the External Affairs and League of Nations Estimates last year, I expressed the view that, falling the ultimate amendment of the League Covenant in a direction which I indicated at the time or until we could be sure that no reform was going to emerge as a result of the almost unanimous demand for a better League, it would be unwise for a State placed in such circumstances as ours to withdraw from Geneva.  It is too soon to prophesy what the Committee on the Application of the Principles of the Covenant, which has already met twice in the last six months, will recommend. In the meantime, the Government desire to co-operate loyally in such useful activities as the League of Nations initiates or directs.  In this regard, I wish to inform the House that, during the last year, Saorstát Eireann has participated fully in the various work; social, economic and otherwise, of the League.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this head, we have become parties to a number of international agreements designed to improve and strengthen neighbourly relations among States, such as the International Conventions on the Stamps Laws in connection with Cheques and with Bills of Exchange and Promisory Notes.  The question of our accession to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age will shortly be submitted to the House for approval.  As a result of our adoption of similar League Conventions in previous years, we have, in the last year, been able to negotiate certain agreements and administrative arrangements with various States <Col N="803" /> members of the League.  For example, we have concluded a bilateral agreement with Great Britain whereby fiscal permits in respect of motor vehicles touring in the two countries will be abolished as from the 1st June next. That arrangement was made possible by the fact that we were already parties to the League of Nations Convention of 1931 regarding the taxation of foreign motor vehicles.  Another such consequential arrangement was made during the year with the other parties to the Drugs Limitation Convention of 1931.  That arrangement was essentially of an administrative character and was, therefore, not brought before the House.  These are some of the social and similar activities of the League in which we participated. Some of the Deputies, speaking on the other Vote, seemed to suggest that there was some want on our part in not co-operating with the League as we used to do formerly.  As everybody knows, the present position of the League of Nations is, more or less, a parlous one.  What the future is going to be is very difficult to tell.  The tests which the League had to face were extremely difficult, and these tests have certainly shaken the League to its foundations.  I do not wish to say anything at this stage with regard to what our future attitude to the League will be.  That will largely depend on the direction in which the Covenant will be amended.  I have spoken on a former occasion as to the dangers inherent in the position as it stands for a country like ours.  Unless these dangers are satisfactorily removed, it is quite possible we may have to recommend that it would be in the interests of this country to withdraw from the League.  Personally, I hope that will not happen.  I was one of those who believed there were great possibilities in the League.  I believed that, for small nations particularly, the League of Nations was valuable and could be used by them as a safeguard, provided the general spirit of the Covenant was acceptable and the obligations of membership were such as small nations could properly bear. I do not want to enter into a purely hypothetical discussion on these matters <Col N="804" /> at this stage.  We have simply to wait and see, while doing our best ourselves in getting the Covenant amended in the direction we think proper.  If we fail, and if the amendments are not of the kind we think right and wise, then the only thing that would be left to us would be to recommend the House that we should withdraw.  As I said, I hope the changes will be of such a character as will commend themselves to us and enable us to recommend to the House a continuance of our membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the President expressed at least the hope that such amendment as might be proposed in the League Covenant would be of a character which would enable us to stay in the League.  I should rather say that he hoped that they will be of such a character as will not drive us out of the League.  I think that that is what the President meant.  He did not mean that the amendments would be ideal but rather that they would not be of such a character as  make our continued membership impossible. I should like to have that made quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather sorry the President did not indicate how exactly he would like the League reformed.  He was quite right in taking up the line that here is an institution in which all States of Europe are interested and in which they ought to be interested, whether they are in the League or not.  He especially stressed of what importance the League might well prove as a protection for small nations, and I think that was realised for many years by small nations.  He spoke of the test to which the League had been put and the failure to stand up to that test, that failure leading to a consideration of certain amendments in the League Covenant.  I should like the President to be so good as to indicate in his reply exactly in what direction he thinks useful amendments might go in amending the League Covenant.  I do not want detail, but he might indicate the general lines.  He referred to his statement here last year and, speaking from memory, I can say that I am not quite clear in what direction he saw a future working possibility for the League&mdash;whether it was in loosening <Col N="805" /> its powers or making them more stringent.  Perhaps the President will indicate along what lines the mind of the Government is running on this important matter.</P>
    <P>I think he possibly was inclined to over-stress the dark side of the picture.  Undoubtedly, the League did get a grave shaking, possibly in prestige more than in actuality, a shaking in prestige ultimately affecting its real influence, but I should be very sorry to think that an institution of that kind would be too readily scrapped by the nations of Europe because it has failed to act up to the highest hopes they had of it, whatever those hopes may have been.  What I am rather uneasy about at the moment is that, all through Europe, I notice a number of people very much bent on peace and determined to have a European war, if necessary, in order to enforce peace.  I think the President, if he studies the European Press, and even the Press off the shores of the Continent of Europe, will find a very fair amount of that going on, and I should be very sorry to think that the League might be used as an organ, not for preserving peace, but really for declaring and waging war.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of the League, it seems to me, to a large extent ends once a general war of that kind starts. Its <i>raison d'être</i> has come to an end for the time being, at all events.  Its main purpose should be to smooth out the preliminaries that lead up to that breach, but once the arbitrament of war comes and you have Europe divided into two hostile camps, whether you call one the League off Nations and the other the Anti-League of Nations does not very much matter.</P>
    <P>I think the really useful work can be done in the preliminary stages of trying to avoid the war atmosphere that very often is being worked up; and I am afraid that we have had instances in the past six months or the past year of a war atmosphere being worked up in different countries.  It was not by any means confined to one country.  Of course, I am very well aware that every country takes a noble line in the cause of peace.  It, and its allies, are arming purely for the cause of peace and the other side is threatening war. <Col N="806" /> That is the propaganda that goes on, but you are facing a rather dangerous situation in a war atmosphere of that kind and it is a pity that the League is not being utilised more to stem or to damp down such propaganda.  What I often see, however, is that strong supporters of the League idea in certain countries are amongst the most vigorous advocates of a course that may easily lead to war, and I find that very hard to reconcile with a genuine desire to preserve peace.</P>
    <P>I can understand a certain amount of impatience&mdash;and there is a motion down on the Order Paper for a long time which has not been moved&mdash;on the part of people with what they call the failure of the League, but I always ask myself, however natural impatience of that kind may be: Is it wise to give it expression? I say that at the moment, instead of giving expression to impatience of that kind, however natural it may be, a much more useful function would be fulfilled for Europe and, therefore, for ourselves, rather by stressing the opposite point of view&mdash;the necessity of keeping a body of this kind going, no matter how near to extinction it may seem or how moribund it may appear in the eyes of many.  As long as it is not dead it seems to me that there is always a possibility of reviving it. I think people have very little knowledge of the relations of States either at the present time or in past times, and of the motives that move States, and very little knowledge of human nature, if they think that an institution of this kind could work smoothly from the very start.  It must receive sets-back.  I do not see how they are to be avoided, but that is no excuse for despairing of good work for the League in future, or for despairing of a better League.</P>
    <P>It is, as I said this time 12 months, an extremely slow and arduous work. It requires, if you like, a great deal of faith, but the possibility of a breakdown, and what may follow a breakdown, seems to me so appalling that one is almost compelled, whether one will or no, to have faith and to work, at all events, for a better understanding between the peoples.  Cynicism is <Col N="807" /> extremely easy.  A man can get a reputation for being hard-headed, worldly-wise and all that sort of thing by pointing out that such and such a nation is looking after its own interests.  The necessity of recognising that that is so is the very foundation of the League. If nations acted altruistically there would be no necessity for the League. It is the fact that nations can be relied on to act selfishly and egotistically that an instrument like the League is necessary and may do good work.</P>
    <P>When some people point out &ldquo;Well, it broke down in the Italian affair,&rdquo; I wonder what they would have considered success in the Italian affair. I am speaking of the number of people who point to that as the great instance of League failure.  If you just try to get at the back of their minds to find out what many of them&mdash;I do not say all&mdash;mean, you find that they mean that it was a pity that Europe on that occasion did not drift into a universal war, at least between the big Powers, into which the small Powers might be pulled.  That is what is at the back of the minds of many, and, once that stage is reached, I think there is an end of the League.  You will have to fight that out, and, after the war, start a new League, if you can.  Many people look on the Italian failure, as they call it, as proof of the gross incompetency of the League&mdash;and it is condemned from both sides, firstly, because it went so far, and, secondly, because it did not go far enough.  In the case of the side I am arguing against&mdash;those who say that it did not go far enough&mdash;what they really complained of was that they had not a war and that the League was not used as an instrument of war.</P>
    <P>That brings me back again to what I stressed before.  One of the principal dangers that I see to the League and its continued success very often are the advocates of the League.  They have, strange to say, a warlike mentality. Their idea is that on peoples who are not yet accustomed to bear international sanctions or international interference, who, in other words, are not prepared to acknowledge any kind of limitation of their sovereignty for the general good, war should be immediately <Col N="808" /> waged.  That is not a solution of our troubles.  We must realise that there may be failure after failure; but again and again, against the spectacular failures of the last couple of years, there is to be put the great difficulties that, in its initial years, the League was able to surmount, and the number of wars it prevented.  You may say to me: &ldquo;Yes, wars between small peoples&rdquo;; but we know perfectly well, without going beyond our own lifetime, how wars between small peoples can very quickly become world wars.  Therefore, a most useful work was done by the League, and it is a mistake to overlook that.  I know it is passing through a period of lack of prestige at present, lack of authority if you like; all the more reason, I say, why a State like ours should throw its lot in and try to make a better situation.</P>
    <P>I admit we are but a small State; but, as the President knows, some of the most useful work was done in the League by small States; work altogether beyond their material strength and beyond their military power.  The work they were able to do was tremendous.  We did enjoy a very peculiar position in the League. We were a small State, always capable of taking up an independent attitude; and actually so doing.  At the same time, owing to the fact that we were a member of another League of Nations, if I might so put it&mdash;the British Commonwealth&mdash;and, owing to the fact as well that though we were only some 3,000,000 people in this country, there were millions of our fellow-countrymen in America and Australia, undoubtedly, that gave us a position of importance in the League altogether beyond the material strength of this country.</P>
    <P>I think we can still be a useful factor in building up the League.  I do not expect spectacular results immediately &mdash;it would be a mistake to look for them.  So far as I am personally concerned, I prefer a slow, steady advance rather than an effort suddenly to forge an instrument which would be absolutely all-powerful in the morning. If you try a thing of that kind, you are liable to promote the very result you are anxious to avoid.  Therefore, <Col N="809" /> I should like to see ourselves playing a part still in the building up, realising that it is a slow business; that if we can advance slightly it is as much as we can hope for at present, but at least having all hope and looking forward and not backwards.</P>
    <P>We got a certain amount of hope from the President on this.  It is his hope that we shall be able to remain members of this institution.  However much we may regret some things done from one point of view or another&mdash; there are various opinions on that&mdash; however much we may realise that certain Powers at one time or another seemed to lead the League, still we should recognise that there is useful work to be done.  I speak of certain big Powers as more or less leading the League.  That does happen; it is inevitable that it should happen.  Wherever you have an Assembly of that kind, you will get some kind of unacknowledged leadership; but the leadership is not always the same.  I do not think, for instance, that two years ago, so far as there was leadership in the League, it was exactly the same as ten years ago, or eight years ago, when I was more intimately acquainted with the working of the League than now.  That will change.  You cannot deprive great Powers of the influence they have owing to their strengthened position; but at least there is this, that there is no place where small Powers can make their influence more effectively felt than in the League.  For that reason, I hope we shall not see the necessity for withdrawing.  I know we are committing ourselves sometimes to things we may not like; any kind of co-operation involves us in that.  If you think you can stand alone, having nothing to do with anybody, of course you need not commit yourself to the resolution of any group.  But, if you think that from co-operation something useful can be got, then the time will come when you may have to sacrifice your own personal opinions of the moment in the cause of the general good.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I again express the hope that this State will be convinced that there is a future for this institution.  I cannot see much hope for the future <Col N="810" /> peace of Europe if there is a definite collapse of an institution of this kind, because the forces which lead to the collapse of an institution of this kind are forces which will bring about war. The only substitute for it is rival groups of Powers.  Whether that will more quickly lead to war or stave off war, no one can tell.  Nobody can say that the system of balance of power is an instrument for the long observance of peace.  I do not think it is.  In the long run, I think it is bound to lead to a break-up.  I cannot see any useful alternative, if peace is to be preserved, to a League of this kind, whatever its faults are, and I realise the weakness of it as much as anybody else.  That is the situation which faces every nation in Europe.  I think we are interested, and ought to play our part in the making of a better League, if possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the President to outline somewhat the improved arrangement between this country and Great Britain for motor cars touring the two countries.  How far is that going to be an improvement on the existing arrangement through the Automobile Association? Is there going to be a similar arrangement with Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the President when introducing the Vote confined himself to the most general speculation as to whether it might be reasonably hoped the League would survive at all or not, generally leaving us under the impression that he hoped in a general kind of way that it would. In so far as he hopes for that, I think everyone on this side of the House would cordially concur.  But I feel that there devolves on every nation which believes in the League and is a member of it a heavy responsibility, quite regardless of whether their material resources are great or small. At this time, when the reorganisation of the League of Nations is contemplated by everybody, I think we ought to be asking ourselves the question, when that reorganisation comes to be put in force, what are we going to aim at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we are driven to choose between two clear alternatives, because <Col N="811" /> at present it does not seem possible to achieve both of them simultaneously. One ideal would be universality, and the other, efficiency in the settlement by mediation or by force, if needs be, of threatened international conflicts.  If we aim at the ideal of universality, we cannot do so seriously, because it is hard to imagine that, in our day, the United States of America will be prevailed upon to become active participants in the League of Nations.  If, on the other hand, we aim at strict efficiency, I do not see how you can escape from giving the League some power, some authority to constitute itself, or to appoint a judge in international affairs and to join in a pledge to support the verdicts of that tribunal whether it be the League itself or a league appointed to apply whatever sanctions may be necessary to enforce its judgment. If you accept that idea you have got to face this question&mdash;how far can you hope to induce the nations of the world at this stage of the world's history to recognise that, taking the long view, it is better to engage in war, if war was necessary, in order to consolidate the principle of international justice, even when one's vital interests are not directly affected by the issue in defence of which the League of Nations asks its members to go to war.  Frankly, the matter is one which I have thought over and find extremely difficult to resolve. But I think we are running away from the issues as a Parliament and a country unless we do face these two alternatives, and unless we make up our minds which of them we are going definitely to support.</P>
    <P>It would be a ghastly catastrophe for the world if the League of Nations disappeared altogether, because a great many people forget when they discuss the League of Nations that it has functions quite other than its political functions.  The international services which have been created and maintained at Geneva have conferred immense benefits on humanity.  If it had no political function at all the League would still do a great deal of good to the nations of the world.  Even if it abandoned, temporarily, all political <Col N="812" /> functions there is the fact that it brings together at Geneva, at regular intervals, the representatives of a large number of States to discuss matters of social policy, scientific research and things of that kind.  It also creates an international life which induces a better understanding amongst the nations of the world, and it is a constant force operating against the poisonous detachment with which economic self-sufficiency threatens the world.  Here, I am speaking personally. I would like to see the world accept a rule of law similar to that which every nation accepts within its own bounds, and once that law has been accepted, that force, if need be, should be used by every civilised unit to punish any nation which attempts to break the law.  I recognise the immense difficulties that would be encountered all over the world in inducing people to accept that point of view.  But I believe that if it were accepted, and if you could get even a restricted number of nations to accept it, that that is the surest road to enduring universality.  If you take the easier road and make the League of Nations a purely consultative body and secure universality, there sooner or later some great catastrophe will occur, and the considerations provided by the League's constitution will follow the authority which you will then have, and in the wave of disillusion which is affecting the world, your universality will be blown away.  On the other hand if you will progress through universality to efficiency, by the time you would achieve universality, you would have established definitely the rule of international law and it would be no more probable that the League would then disintegrate than it would be probable that a civilised State would find itself, overnight, in a state of anarchy.</P>
    <P>It is one of the advantages of the American system of Government that it can discuss these general questions in a general way.  Both sides, the Opposition and the Government and other interested parties share their joint knowledge and their joint view and arrive in matters of foreign policy at something like a unanimous policy.  Here, no such facilities exist <Col N="813" /> and I think it is a matter greatly to be deplored that we cannot evolve a method of discussing such matters with the Government or rather a method of the Government discussing such matters with the Opposition and other sections of this House, and thereby establishing broad general principles upon which we would have common views when acting with regard to matters such as we are considering now.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the President this question&mdash;the League of Nations, even though constituted as it is, is going to be inevitably more or less coloured in its outlook by one group of nations or another.  The world, now faced with a nightmare of tariff reform and economic nationalism, is beginning to realise that one of the most potent sources of international discord is the strangulation of international trade. You have the Oslo group of nations; You have the <i>de marche</i> of Mr. Cordell Hull, and you have the British Commonwealth of Nations all flushed with the idea of devising a plan whereby the channels of international trade can be freed.  On the other hand, you have the States which believe in economic self-sufficiency, Italy, Germany, and, in fact, all the dictatorial war-like States.  I am now assuming that we are going to play our part in world affairs.  In that conflict on which side are we going to be?  There is no doubt in my own mind nor in the minds of my colleagues on which side we think this State should be.  We believe we can co-operate with the Oslo group or with the Cordell Hull group.</P>
    <P>It is not so clear where the Fianna Fáil administration stands.  Are we going to range ourselves in world affairs on the side of those countries who believe in the <i>fata morgana</i> of economic self-sufficiency?  Because if we are, we are going to range ourselves on the side of war.  A league of nations which does not take cognisance of the fact that there can be no effective international co-operation without international trade is simply sticking its head in the sand.  To judge from the internal policy of our Government, it would appear that they share the view of Herr Hitler <Col N="814" /> and Signor Mussolini that no State is safe unless it is a self-contained economic unit.  I take the view very strongly that no State is safe if it does constitute itself a self-sufficient economic unit.  Because the only way such States can get on is behind an ever-rising tariff wall.  The world must range itself into these two parties, those who will believe in international trade and those who believe in creating national self-sufficiency. Those behind the tariff wall must make up their minds to the fact that when you have built the wall the only means of sustaining it is to buttress it up with bayonets and to buttress it up with dead bodies.  That is an absolute certainty, and the more often that fact is repeated in public the better, in my opinion, it is for the world.</P>
    <P>The President may reply that really our intervention in international trade can make very little difference, because the attitude we take up in economic affairs is going to affect practically no country but Great Britain.  There I do not agree with him at all.  I believe we can make ourselves felt, and I believe that through the Commonwealth of Nations, if we would only use our position in it, we can carry more weight at Geneva or in any international centre than any other small nation in the world.  At present we are deliberately paralysing ourselves. I am anxious that our Government, whether President de Valera or somebody else presides over it, should play their part.  I believe they can do it (1) by rebuilding the League of Nations and (2) by helping to remove the standing menace to international peace of economic nationalism.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be useful if the President would now say on what side we may expect to find this country in the conflict between the States that stand for economic self-sufficiency and those that stand against it, and I think It would be useful if the President would now say whether the Administration for which he is responsible held itself ready to co-operate in any discussions the purposes of which were to remove economic obstacles from the way of international co-operation, <Col N="815" /> which is vital to the true rebuilding of the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>Those are a few points to which I attach very considerable importance, but before I sit down I should like to say that I can see the real League of Nations emerging as a completely new departure.  One of the great arguments of the economic self-sufficiency man is to say that you cannot allow the Japanese, because they are taken as the prototype of the low standard of living, to dump their products in your country, or else the standard of living of your people will be forced down to the level of the Japanese.  I believe that out of that dilemma the new League can be born, because if we could get a group of nations that would de liberately set out to clear up the channels of international trade it would mean a general lowering of tariffs, and it would mean a much larger interchange of goods than has obtained so far.  But, if that were to be done effectively, each nation would rightly insist on maintaining a certain standard of living below which it was not prepared to allow its people to sink.</P>
    <P>To do that, the only way I can see practically possible is something on the Solverein principle.  If you can get a group of States to say: &ldquo;So far as labour conditions are concerned, we are prepared to delegate to the International Labour Office power to operate within our jurisdiction; we will ask the International Labour Office to fix conditions of labour in certain groups of industry for the Solverein, to which we are prepared to subscribe; we will take steps to enforce those conditions; we will give facilities to the International Labour Office to inspect our methods of enforcement, and similar enforcement and similar inspection will operate in every other State member of the Solverein,&rdquo;you could then get something approximating to a true equality of conditions of employment, conditions which would remove one of the stock excuses for tariff subsidies, export bounties and the like.</P>
    <P>Secondly, you would have to say: &ldquo;This Solverein, once established, is open for admission to any other State <Col N="816" /> which conforms to certain conditions which have been established by the International Labour Office.&rdquo;  Given these conditions, we are prepared to trade with them, and if they trade with us on the terms common to all States members of the Solverein, I believe out of that would emerge a group enjoying such obvious advantages that the scope for further co-operation in a wider field would very early manifest itself and that the immense advantage that the nations of that Solverein would enjoy would attract, if not the Governments of other countries, then the peoples of other countries very rapidly, and if you had crazy Governments still desiring to torture their people for false causes, without any propaganda at all the picture of peace and developing prosperity and the rising standard of living that that Solverein would present to oppressed and exploited people would induce those peoples to agitate in the spirit of the nineteenth century for a restoration of liberty, reason and decency within their own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Along those lines I believe there might emerge something which would be even a more effective League of Nations than we can hope to build on the shaky foundations that exist in Geneva.  However, whatever path we travel in this matter, almost everyone in this House has a common ideal, and that is to get back to some institution which would defend and protect the rule of international law.  The sooner all of us get down to determine what Ireland's contribution to that pilgrimage is going to be, the better, and the more effectively we can make the voice of Ireland heard in the councils of the nations of the world.</P>

I am informed that the arrangement made does not run counter to any arrangement made with the various automobile associations; that, in fact, we have been urged by these associations to regard it as the type of agreement which we should make with continental countries. It is a better arrangement than any previously in force, because it has resulted in the complete abolition between <Col N="817" /> this country and Great Britain of motorists' fiscal permits, which were formerly demanded at the respective ports of the two countries.

I am afraid we are far away from that, and the history of mankind in various nations seems to indicate that it is going to be very slow indeed in coming, because the unity of countries, as we know them to-day, has been largely got by one particular group securing domination by force, and then being able to impose its will on those who otherwise would not voluntarily have submitted to the rule.  It is a sad thing, but I am afraid it is the position.  Now, I have to confess that I was one of those for a number of years who thought in the direction of strengthening the League: of getting the League to take powers which would be sufficient to enforce obedience to the Covenant on those who might be inclined to disregard their bond.  I thought it a pity that the famous Protocol, for instance, had not gone through, but later experience has convinced me that it would be unwise to try to work in that direction because the temptation would always lie for the strong Power to resist.  The small nations which would be involved in carrying out such sanctions were likely to be crushed by their immediate neighbours who were recalcitrant and against whom sanctions were going to be imposed.  In other words, there was going to be a very unequal burden on the various States, and in a policy of that sort it was the weaker States that were going to get the worst of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that is the conclusion I have been forced to by the <Col N="818" /> facts of the situation, as I saw them, when they emerged very clearly a few years ago.  Consequently, I have turned rather in the other direction, and come to the conclusion that the best hope for the future of the League is to try to get in, even on the most tenuous terms, a number of the States in Europe.  If we could get them in to co-operate, even on slender bonds, it would be very much better than that there should be one group which accepts, as if it were a complete League in itself, responsibilities of a very stringent type, whilst there are other States outside the group.  As Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has indicated, it is quite obvious that if that situation arises you are going to have a group which is associated narrowly and tightly within the League on one side as opposed to the other States on the other side.  The result is that if these outside States are powerful and strong and combine together, you are going to have the type of situation which Deputy O'Sullivan, I understood, was deploring and suggested that we should do everything in our power to avoid.  That was why, when this matter of the League was before us on a former occasion I indicated that the direction in which I would like to see the League progress was to get agreement on those things, and to try to make them universal, on which we were not going to have the likelihood of conflict: things of such a character that the States should be likely voluntarily to accept the rule and not to stand up against us in any one instance.  If I remember, the Opposition said if that were the type of League of Nations I had in mind, it would not be worth being a member of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Tenuous&rdquo; was the word I used, and I am afraid it would be better for me at the present moment to leave it equally tenuous, for the simple reason that the implementing of the idea that I had in mind, when one comes down to it, is going to be difficult, but we will play our part in it, I hope.  Harking back <Col N="819" /> to the previous discussion, I indicated perhaps a little bit more than I am doing now&mdash;the direction in which my mind is running.  I remember I was challenged by the Opposition and told that if that was the type of League of Nations that we were going to have it would be better to have no League at all.  I disagree.  I think that the first thing that we have got to do is to try to get all the important States in Europe into a group, meeting together, associating together even for relatively trifling purposes to start with.  I think it is very much better that we should have what I may call a certain degree of universality for relatively trifling objectives than that we should hold out the big objective, namely, that of preventing war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that you can find one objective, however trifling, on which you can get all the nations together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  If that is the situation, that there is nothing on which you can get the nations to come in and agree upon, then it is vain to be talking about a League of Nations, because we have not got it.  You have got alliances.  You can have partial groups co-operating for certain purposes, and by their co-operation very often endangering the peace because they would be regarded as a block opposed to the block that are outside it.  Those who are outside will inevitably come together and form themselves into another block.  Now, if it should happen that Deputy MacDermot is right, and that even on simple matters we cannot get the nations to come in, then I say we are in a desperate condition, and there is no use in talking about a League of Nations because we will not have got any.  But if we are to get a League of Nations.  I think the best thing to do is to work in the direction in which we are operating of trying to get them in even on tenuous terms.  There is not much hope, perhaps, in getting nations together even for simple objectives, but if that is so it is vain to ask them to come together for the supreme objective&mdash;that is, to prevent war.  If, by meeting, we could get rid, bit by bit, <Col N="820" /> by contacts, of the various disputes and difficulties which divide States, that would be a useful purpose.  It is a purpose which the League of Nations that I have in mind would try to effect. The idea that we cannot at the present time build up a League of Nations which would have sufficient authority to prevent war by coming in and saying: &ldquo;Very well, there is a dispute between nation A and nation B: that dispute must be submitted to arbitration or to a judicial decision, and if it is not then we are going to enforce a settlement.  At any rate the nation that submits to it will be assisted by us against the nation that will not accept the settlement of that kind,&rdquo; is, I think, gone for the present.  Perhaps it may be for several generations. There is no use, therefore, in looking for something which we know to be hopeless.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has suggested that there is another type of division amongst States, namely, those that will accept the policy generally of what we may call free trade, and those who will insist on seeing that they are reasonably self-sufficient.  I can only say for ourselves that I cannot see this Government accepting a policy which would undo the work that the Government has been doing in trying to build up industries here in order to give reasonable self-sufficiency. If any policy were suggested which would mean the undoing of that work, we could not accept it.  We have had free trade operating in this country over a number of years and we saw the result of it.  It was bringing our country into the position in which we were becoming, largely, a ranch for supplying cattle and food to another country which, in return, was giving us manufactured goods.  That is a policy to which I, certainly, can see no possibility of our agreeing as a general solution.  That is the very situation that we have been struggling to get out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is, in the protection of our own industries here, no aggressive nationalism, about which some people have been talking.  There is nothing aggressive about that.  It is simply the natural desire, first of all, to give <Col N="821" /> employment to our people who would otherwise be idle or be compelled to follow where work was to be found, or otherwise to give us the necessary strength to subsist if there were a situation created here in which the supplies which are necessary for us could not be got, as a result of a war or some other catastrophe of that sort from outside.  Reasonable self-sufficiency is a natural thing, and it is a thing to be aimed at, and I think that the world, as a whole, would be better for that policy.  I resent any suggestion that a policy of that sort can be classed as aggressive nationalism. In answer to Deputy Dillon, I would say quite frankly that, if that were the alternative that were offered to us&mdash; that we should go back to the old position and discontinue our present policy of building up reasonable self-sufficiency here&mdash;there could be but one answer from this side of the House, and I think it would be the answer that would be given by the majority of our people also.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything to be gained by going further afield, Sir. I have indicated broadly my hopes. We certainly would like to see the League of Nations re-founded and re-built, and we would do everything in our power to get it re-built on the only foundation which we think is possible at the present time.  I cannot say whether that will be done or not.  If it were not found possible to re-build it on such a foundation as I have indicated, our attitude towards the League would have to change and we would have to say that the obligations inherent in the situation were obligations which, in the interests of our people, we could not undertake.</P>

I refer to the provision which declares our adoption of the principle of third-party arbitration in international disputes.  I should like to ask the President whether he would not think it worth while to work for as wide an acceptance of that principle among other countries as can be obtained, because, League of Nations or no League of Nations, I suggest that it is far more worth while to secure the acceptance, generally, of a principle like that, than to bring together a whole lot of representatives of countries, with absolutely conflicting ideas and conflicting notions of international morality, in order to do nothing whatever except to quarrel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I made a representation to the Minister, on the Second Stage or on some stage of the Resolutions, directing his attention to the matter of the owners of stallions. He replied that the only effect of this would be to put money into the pockets of a very restricted group of persons.  The Minister must know that that is not true, and he must know that his own colleague, the <Col N="823" /> Minister for Agriculture, shares my view.  It is not the sum of money that will be saved.  It is to remove the disparity between revenue practice here and revenue practice in Great Britain.  So far as I am concerned, I do not mind whether the Minister induces the British Treasurer to impose taxation under Schedule A on stallion owners, or whether he does it himself, or what method is adopted. All that I want is uniformity.  So far as Great Britain is concerned, it does not matter a thraneen to her, because for her the horse-breeding industry is comparatively a trivial business, whereas for us it is of immense importance.  It is the preservation of the famous stallions in Ireland that is so important, because, when a great race is run and won, the first thing that international commentators remark is the breeding of the winner, and the breeding in horse-racing circles, apparently, is judged predominantly by the identity of the sire.</P>
      <P>Now, if the sire of a winning racehorse is an Irish sire and is attached to an Irish stud, that in itself constitutes an immense and invaluable advertisement for Irish horse-flesh, and the result is that you have people coming from all parts of the world to buy horses in Ireland.  If the present revenue position continues, some of these sires will be brought to England.</P>

I asked him for information when the Resolution was reported, and the Minister replied. The Minister said on that occasion that the situation was that the British could do what they liked and that we would do what we liked, that my proposal would only result in putting a few pounds into the pockets of a few racehorse owners in this country, and that he could not see his way to levy taxes on the plain people of this country in order to recoup wealthy horse owners.  My chief concern is to make identical the revenue system in <Col N="824" /> the two countries.  If I have not correctly stated the facts would the Minister be good enough to intervene and tell us what the real facts of the situation are?  I have stated them to the best of my knowledge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and with greater facility than the Minister has displayed so far in answering more relevant questions.  In 1934 the Minister and his colleagues were conducting an economic war, and in 1936 in pursuance of an agreement, whereunder the land annuities were to be paid to the British Government, he induced the British Government to take the tariff off horses and to put it on hens. He did that for the purpose of coming to the aid of the horse-breeding industry. He said publicly that it was going to take £50,000 off horses and put it on hens in order to save the horse-breeding industry from extinction. Now, he released the horse-breeding industry from that serious burden and the result of that has been that not only has that £50,000 been saved for the horse breeders every year but a substantial additional sum has been secured for them by getting a free market for horse flesh.  Horses are now the only live stock that can be exported to Britain without tariffs of any kind upon them.  My submission is that having put this substantial burden on hens, in order to relieve the horses, we ought to exploit the advantage we have got for the horses to the <Col N="827" /> utmost limit.  To do that we ought to bring back into this country the most famous sires that are available.  Up to this we could not do that, because so long as the tariff was there a mare which had a foal in this country and which came over to a sire here, had to pay an immense duty on the foal when she was going back to England.  That difficulty has been got rid of but, in the meantime, a new difficulty has arisen and that is that the British Revenue Commissioners have been directed by the House of Lords in Great Britain to leave to horse breeders or stallion owners in Great Britain, the option of having income-tax levied on them under Schedule A or Schedule D.  In this country the Revenue Commissioners have reserved the right to determine whether income-tax will be levied on horse breeders or stallion owners under Schedule A or Schedule D, and in practice they insist that where a man derives a large income from fees for the services of a stallion income-tax shall be levied in the same way as on ordinary income and not on the valuation of the farm. The result of that may well be that such breeders will keep their stallions in England.  A man may have an income of £10,000 or £15,000 a year in fees by having two or three famous stallions.  If he finds that he would have to pay much more in income-tax in this country he will move those stallions to England, whereupon all their progeny will be reported by the racing and sporting newspapers, when they win races, as being English-bred horses, with the resultant publicity and advantage to the English horse-breeding business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those stallions were induced to stand in Ireland, and the stud farm were maintained in Ireland, a great deal of valuable employment would be given directly on the stud farm, and indirectly to farmers all over the country, who would share the reflected glory of the classic race winner which was returned as an Irish-bred horse.  This concession would not cost the Exchequer of this country more than £20,000 or £30,000, so far as I am aware, but it would make a contribution to the horse-breeding industry <Col N="828" /> as a whole out of all proportion to what it would cost the Exchequer.  It would have this additional advantage, that, although the Exchequer might lose money now, it would get back all that it lost and more in the employment that would be provided directly and indirectly as a result of this policy.  That is the case I make.  I outlined it as succinctly as I could on the Resolution.  I did not press the Minister for a copious answer then, because I felt it was a matter which he might wish to look into more closely, and it was clearly forecast at that time that he would deal with it more fully on this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was calling attention to the fact that it is customary in this House, when a question of this sort is raised, to put down an amendment. Deputy Dillon said he did not put down an amendment because it would have been ruled out of order.  I suppose, at any rate, the action of the Chair when Deputy Dillon endeavoured to raise this matter on the Report Stage of the Resolution dealing with income-tax and surtax&mdash;of which the present section of the Finance Bill is a duplication&mdash;had at least that salutary effect on Deputy Dillon that he did not wish to offend against the rules of order.  I have already called the attention of the House to the conflict of opinion which has arisen between Deputy John A. Costello, Deputy Richard Mulcahy, and Deputy Dillon, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to what type of amendment it would be in order to put down to the Finance Act, but a much more serious position than that emerges.  The deputy-leader of the Opposition is actually at variance with the leader of the Opposition as to the type of amendment that might be put down to the Finance Act. Deputy Dillon comes along here and thinks that, when he shoots a question across the floor of the House, I or any other Minister should be sufficiently versed in the twenty volumes of decided cases on income-tax law to be able to give him an answer, and to be able to give him all the relevant <Col N="830" /> figures.  If he had actually wanted this information, if he had actually wanted to read a discussion on the matter, he could have referred to the debate which took place in this House on 19th June, 1934, on the Finance Bill of that year, a report of which appears at column 608, volume 53, of the Parliamentary Debates.  Notwithstanding Deputy Dillon's very decided views as to what type of amendment would be in order, the Deputy's leader&mdash;or is he still the Deputy's leader, because I notice that he scarcely ever appears when the Deputy is prepared to speak in the House&mdash;had this amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;I move,&rdquo; said Mr. Cosgrave, &ldquo;amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before Section 7 but in Part I of the Bill to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;In order to remove doubts it is hereby declared and enacted that income derived from fees charged for the service of stallions kept at a farm for stud purposes shall be treated as income coming within the terms of Schedule B and not of any other Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1918.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, the Deputy who has risen here to-night to ask me for information actually spoke in that debate.  I do not know whether the Deputy would like me to repeat what I said in reply to Deputy Dillon, himself on this matter.</P>

      <P>As I say, the Deputy &mdash;who, apparently, during the past two years has allowed his very vigilant mind to fall asleep in regard to this matter&mdash;comes in here to put me some hypothetical questions, and wants me to say whether such and such is the position.  I would refer Deputy Dillon to his speech on that Finance Bill&mdash;it was not so long as usual&mdash;which started <Col N="831" /> at column 621 and finished towards the end of column 624, when I began to reply to Deputy Dillon in these terms: &ldquo;I do not know whether it is really worth while taking Deputy Dillon seriously.&rdquo;  I have had no reason to change my opinion, or, shall I say, nothing has induced me to take a more serious view of what Deputy Dillon had to say on that occasion, and which he has tried to repeat to-night.  Just as previously his speech was full of misconceptions and error with regard to the position, so, again, to-night.  For instance, the Deputy said that latterly a new position had arisen.  I do not know if the Deputy was conscious of what he was saying but he seemed to imply that, since the import duty which was formerly imposed on horses imported into Great Britain from this country had been removed, the House of Lords had given a decision which changed the schedule under which a stallion was assessed.  I may have followed the Deputy imperfectly but I understood that that was what he said.  If he did not say that, he wished, at all events, to convey that, some time in recent years, the House of Lords had come to a decision which had altered the whole position of the British stallion owner as compared with the Irish stallion owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the fact that you had taken the tax off the horse and put it on the hen had altered the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose anything will cure Deputy Dillon of the delusion under which he labours in that regard.  He happened to think that it was rather epigrammatic to say, &ldquo;Take the tax off the horse and put it on the hen.&rdquo;  All I can say is that in that regard he has discovered a hen in a mare's nest.  It was made quite clear by the Minister for Agriculture, when the Estimate for his Department was under discussion, that there was no truth in that statement, which is being repeated so often by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact that the statement does not happen to be true will not deter Deputy Dillon from <Col N="832" /> repeating it <i>ad nauseam.</i>  We shall hear of this tax, taken off the horse and put on the hen, during the whole course of the general election.  After that, so far as Deputy Dillon and this House are concerned, there may be silence.  I could not possibly get the drift of Deputy Dillon's argument in regard to this question of stallions.  He said that the fact that stallion owners were chargeable to income-tax here under Schedule D would prevent good stallions being kept in this country.  I cannot see the grounds upon which Deputy Dillon bases that statement. It could only be made by a Deputy ignorant of the income-tax code, because where a stallion stands does not matter; it is where the owner resides that determines whether or not the owner of the stallion will be assessable to our income-tax from the profits he derives from the keeping of the stallion.</P>
      <P>What is the position?  If a resident in Ireland owns a stallion which stands in England, he is chargeable with income-tax here on the profits derived from that stallion.  What advantage will it be to the horse-breeding industry of this country to relieve that person of income-tax&mdash;to relieve him of income-tax at the expense of the poorer taxpayer and, in many cases, of the indirect taxpayer?  That is what Deputy Dillon is pleading for&mdash;that a person who is wealthy enough to maintain a stallion standing in England should be relieved of tax.  A person who can do that must have a considerable amount of capital.  All the labour consequent on the maintenance of that stallion would enure to the benefit of persons resident in England.  The profits might be very substantial.  The profits which might be secured by keeping a stallion of the reputation of &ldquo;Blandford&rdquo; might amount to £14,000 or £15,000.  That person, residing in this country and keeping a stallion standing in England, is to be relieved of the burden of paying income-tax upon an income which may amount to £14,000 or £15,000, an income, at all events, that would quite easily run into four or five figures.  It is not demonstrable that any advantage would enure to the people of this country because of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> What is the other position, which is the commoner position?  That a person who resides in England, if he keeps a stallion here in Ireland, which has the reputation of being an Irish horse, is not chargeable to income-tax according to our law at all, and is possibly not chargeable to income-tax in Great Britain either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that the reason he wanted to debate this point was that a person who resided in England and owned a stallion was not chargeable under Schedule D, but was chargeable under Schedule B.  That is the justification Deputy Dillon has advanced for raising the question here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What benefit and what advantage will the people of this country derive if we relieve a stallion owner who resides here of a particular duty and obligation which is imposed on every citizen&mdash;that of paying tax upon the income he actually enjoys?  Are we to relieve him of that merely because he happens to keep a stallion?  If we do relieve a person of the obligation of paying income-tax simply because he keeps a stallion, why should we not relieve another person of paying income-tax because he keeps a threshing machine or because he is a road contractor, or because he is a dispensary doctor or because he has rendered some other public service?  Is it not quite clear that, once you grant a concession to a particular class of the community, other people will come along with just as good claims to exemption because of the nature of the services which they have rendered to the community?  I shall put it to the common sense and intelligence of the people of the country that a person who serves the community as a dispensary doctor or as a school-teacher or as a Civic Guard is just as much entitled to exemption from income-tax as a person who makes a very substantial income out of the keeping of a stallion.  That is the sort of proposition that is put up to us from the other side.  Mind you, it is only the really substantial people who are engaged in the horse-breeding industry who are involved in this.  It <Col N="834" /> does not touch the ordinary small farmer because the profits he might derive from keeping a stallion would not in most cases be sufficiently large to bring him under the income-tax code; but there are four or five people who do derive very substantial incomes from the keeping of stallions; and if you were to exempt these four or five people, it would cost £14,000 or £15,000, and that £14,000 or £15,000 would have to be found by their much less fortunate confreres in that industry.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask how is the horse-breeding industry going to be helped by a concession of this sort?  There are four or five big men who would benefit at the expense of the small men, the small farmers and the small income-tax payers, and the income-tax payers of other categories who are not so fortunate as to own a stallion and to make a substantial income out of it. As a matter of fact, the great handicap under which the horse-breeding industry admittedly lay during the last four or five years was caused by the import duties which were imposed on horses bred in this country and going into Great Britain, and on mares which came to this country for service here and upon which, when going back with a foal, a duty was levied on the assumed value of the foal.  That was the trouble and that was the difficulty. Now that barrier has been removed. It was one of the reasons which induced English residents who had stallions standing here to remove their stallions temporarily to Great Britain. Now that the import duty has been removed, I have not the slightest doubt that we will see the stallions which used to stand here returned to this country, because, mind you, the experience of their owners has not been too happy with them since they were brought to England.  There is something here in our soil, or in our climate, which is particularly advantageous to the horse-breeding industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say &ldquo;live stock,&rdquo; but we are talking about horse-breeding at the moment, and I <Col N="835" /> am anxious, even if the Deputy was not, to keep strictly relevant, and I have endeavoured to be.  I say that there is every reason to believe that we shall have the good class stallion back here again, but even if we do not, even if private enterprise in Great Britain does not send them here, I do not see any real fear that stallion-owners here, so long as they get the price for yearlings which they are getting now, have got this year and will probably get during August next, will go out of business here; but if they do, we have already made provision in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture to purchase first-class stallions and to let out their services at reasonable rates to the owners of Irish mares which will do everything which Deputy Dillon thinks ought to be done in order to enhance the reputation of Irish-bred horses. We are encouraging the horse-breeding industry under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture in a much more defensible manner than Deputy Dillon asks me to do it here to-night, because we are doing it in a way in which the great mass of small breeders will be benefited, and we are not giving a concession at a cost of £14,000 or £15,000 which will go mainly to the benefit of four or five people in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole object of the proposal is to prevent these owners changing their domicile.  I apprehend that if a man has a stud and a horse-breeding establishment capable of accommodating valuable sires, it is highly likely that he will maintain his domicile there, and, in fact, where some of the most valuable Irish sires are standing, their owners at present maintain their domiciles.  There are such establishments on the Curragh of Kildare and in County Kilkenny with which we are familiar.  The Minister says that this would cost the Exchequer £15,000 approximately and that about five persons would be affected.  That means that some of these persons may be affected to the tune of £5,000 a year.  With the extraordinary proximity of this country to Great Britain, the similarity <Col N="836" /> of conditions and the interchange of acquaintance between the two countries, what is more likely than that a man, in order to save £5,000 a year, would simply change his domicile and his establishment to Great Britain?  Ninety per cent. of his horses on which he depends for these high fees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister can speak when I sit down, but not till then.  I have pointed out that my solicitude is not only to keep the men who are present here still here, but also to induce others to come.  I have not heard the Minister for Agriculture on this subject, but I have reason to believe that he shares my view that it would be desirable, from the point of view of the industry, to make this concession, and that it would probably yield a satisfactory profit to the State as a whole, although the Revenue Commissioners may temporarily lose.</P>
      <P>I think that it would be well if the Minister for Agriculture would appear in the House and tell us what his view is on this subject.  It is evident that the Minister does not know very much about it.  It is a very great mistake to imagine that it is desirable from any point of view philosophically to wait until stallion owners begin to leave and then to express one's readiness to take action.  If it is desirable to take action, it ought to be taken now.  If it is not desirable to take action, then the State should not submit to being blackmailed into taking action by the threats of any citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think from the point of view of the public weal it would be good to take action now to keep these establishments we have in being and attract new ones. I believe it will be money well spent. I believe it would be an expenditure analogous to that at present being made by many local authorities, recommending this country for its tourist amenities and that to put ourselves on a financial footing with Great Britain in respect of the horse-breeding industry <Col N="838" /> would be good business from the point of view of the State.  If it did yield a few individuals £10,000 or £15,000, the community as a whole would be amply repaid for whatever they yielded up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has just stated that it would be an undesirable thing for us to wait until we were blackmailed into giving this concession by a threat made by some person or other to withdraw from this country and to change his domicile.  So that Deputy Dillon admits that there is something in the nature of blackmail in the whole of this agitation.  That is Deputy Dillon's gloss upon it.  I am not prepared to go so far as Deputy Dillon in that regard&mdash;not at all.  But, if Deputy Dillon thinks that there is an element of blackmail in this, I suggest to him there are two ways in which you can deal with the blackmailer. One is to stand up to him and have done with him for ever; and the other is to give in to him and endure him for ever.  Deputy Dillon is asking us now, at this late stage, to give in to the blackmailer.  There are Irishmen, people who have a natural obligation to pay taxes to this community, who are saying: &ldquo;If you do not allow us off income-tax, even though we enjoy a substantial income we are going to move to England,&rdquo; and Deputy Dillon's reply to that sort of threat is, &ldquo;Please give in to the blackmailer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Deputy a very pertinent question, which the Deputy evaded by becoming abusive, saying he was not going to stand for any categorical cross-examination by the Minister.  He took refuge, first of all, in a specious plea coming from Deputy Dillon, who has not hesitated, as we all know&mdash;we had an example of it on last Friday morning&mdash;to bandy the names of individuals about this Assembly when it suits his book, and when he thinks he has a fact to back up the bad case he is making.  Deputy Dillon said he had been several times warned by the Chair that names of individuals should not be mentioned in the course of Parliamentary debates.  Then when I asked him to pass over a note giving the name of one single Irish resident who <Col N="839" /> kept stallions and had changed his domicile because of the fact that we levied income-tax upon his true income, as represented by the profits from the keeping of the stallions, Deputy Dillon became abusive, as I said, tried to raise a smoke-screen, and stated that he was not going to stand for any categorical cross-examination by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This question was debated in this House in 1934, and the very arguments which Deputy Dillon advanced here to-night to justify the position which he has taken up in favour of four or five wealthy people, begging for a concession for them at the expense of the rest of the community, were advanced by Deputy Dillon's leader, Deputy Cosgrave, in 1934, when we were told the self-same threats were used, that if we did not give in on this question, these wealthy residents would transfer their domicile to Great Britain.  A lot of them, I think, are very glad to-day they did not do it, because they would find themselves out of the frying-pan into the fire with a vengeance.  We did not give in to the blackmail of Deputy Dillon's friends in 1934.  I asked the Deputy to give me the name of a single person who had changed his domicile since.  I do not know of any, and I follow these matters very closely.  This matter has been under review more than once, because Deputy Dillon's blackmailing friends are indefatigable. They were at Deputy Cosgrave in 1934 and have been at Deputy Dillon recently; and I suppose next year we will have Deputy Dillon making the self-same case on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I suppose in that regard Deputy Dillon is optimistic. That is what we were told in 1934&mdash; that those wealthy owners and their stallions would go to Great Britain. Deputy Dillon cannot give me the name of a single person who has transferred. On the contrary, there are rumours, possibly with some foundation, that the people who did go, not because of income-tax, but because of other circumstances in earlier years, when we were not even in power here, are thinking of coming back.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 form part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5, and in Part I, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall be and is hereby annulled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to repeal the provision that was inserted in the Income-Tax Code under the Finance Act of 1935, artificially raising for the purpose of income-tax the valuation of houses by 25 per cent.  The section in question enshrined, under the form of a mathematical nightmare, the Revenue Commissioners' extraordinary idea, and the extraordinary fraction of five-fourths was inserted into one of our statutes.  I have little hope that even consideration will be given to this amendment.  But it affects a very large number of people who unfortunately are not sufficiently vocal in their hardships to make themselves felt.  Representations have been made to me to draw the attention of the House and the public to the hardships that are being caused through the operations of this artificial tax because it is nothing else but artificial. It is a tax imposed on a limited class. It was always supposed to be very wrong in principle to impose taxation on one class and not on the general taxpaying community.  In this respect the justification for this extraordinary addition to the income-tax on property owners was made on the basis that the valuation of property was being made either on wrong principles or on principles that had long since gone out of date.  Even taking it on that basis the justification for this imposition of 25 per cent. additional is one that cannot stand examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that houses are being valued in such a way as to cause inequities. In this instance what happened was that in every case a flat rate of 25 per cent. increase was put upon property owners.  That imposition followed upon the taking away of one-sixth relief that had up to that <Col N="842" /> been given to property owners in respect of repairs to their houses.  The particular class on whose behalf I put down this amendment are really the small property owners and especially on people who bought their houses before this extraordinary conception of the Revenue Commissioners was thought of.  They bought their houses on the basis of the existing valuation, the valuation of their property under the existing code.  It may be that people who own large houses are able to pay these additional taxes, just as they would have been able to pay additional income-tax if it had been imposed upon them.  But people who receive their annual income out of property on low valuations of from £14 to £17 are very hard hit as I am informed, by the incidence of this particular tax.</P>
    <P>Property owners of that type of house are subject still to the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act.  They are subject to restrictions preventing them from increasing the rents of their houses or obtaining possession of them so as to enable them to sell in a free market.  They are prevented from doing this by the Rent Restrictions Act.  They therefore find themselves in this position, that they are limited in respect of the amount of increase in the rent that they can impose on their tenants.  But then this additional tax comes down upon the owners as additional income-tax.  This is imposing a tax on a particular class.  It is a tax that is not extending to the general income-tax paying community.  These owners of small houses cannot recoup themselves for the additional income-tax they are paying.  They cannot recoup themselves out of the rent their tenant pays.  On top of that they find it difficult to keep up their obligations, where such exist, to keep their houses in a proper state of repair because of the increase in the price of labour and material for house repairing.  Generally speaking, that particular class in the community who own small property valued at from £14 to £17 valuation, and who obtain their income from tenants occupying those premises, find their income gradually reduced much more in proportion than other people. It is impossible to justify this particular <Col N="843" /> artificial increase imposed under the Act of 1935.  The people on whom this tax presses most heavily are the section of the community who are not particularly vocal and in the nature of things cannot bring their grievances to such a point as to make their views felt.  I do not know what effect on the Exchequer the imposition of this tax on houses valued from £14 to £17 would be and I do not know what the acceptance of my amendment would mean to the Exchequer.  But I think the Minister ought to consider the cases of the smaller valuations or cases within the limits I have stated. The Minister ought also to consider the position of persons who have bought their own houses and which are within these small valuations.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly aware of the type of argument the Minister will put up. He will argue that if you have so many children you will not have any tax to pay.  But we all know cases where this will press very harshly on individuals. I have before my mind cases of people who are making their living out of small properties and small lodgings whose incomes have been much decreased. I have one instance of a case where a person owns a fairly large house and in order to get rid of the liability he purchased a new house, letting the old one.  He got a certain rent for the old house.  Then he found that his income was not increased, whilst tax was.  He was caught both ways.  I have no hope whatever that the Minister will accept or even consider this amendment but I did think that it was my duty to put it down and to direct public attention and, if necessary, harness public attention against this imposition, this method of raising additional income without increasing the rate of the income-tax, so that the Minister could say: &ldquo;Our income-tax here is only so much; look at what they are charging in England.&rdquo; I wonder what would be the amount of the standard rate of income tax if we added the various items that are tacked on to our income-tax code? What would be the standard rate of our income-tax if all these matters were taken into account?  It would certainly be considerably more than <Col N="844" /> the face value of the present figure. The Minister has taken away the old reduction of one-sixth for repairs that up to the time of the Minister coming into control of finance in this country had always been allowed.  This particular imposition is quite unjustified and this item, particularly, should be remitted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister's silence simply draws attention to the fact that he knows that this is just what I might call a scrounger tax. After raising the income-tax to the height at which it is over 1931, and after searching out every item of domestic use, every item that goes into the building up of a house and the keeping of a house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, what the people have to put up with is this, that the things that troubled them last year and the year before, and the year before, still keep troubling them.  Their troubles are piling up, increasing every year.  The taxes that the Fianna Fáil Government imposed on the people in 1932 have been increasing every year, particularly on those who are the heads of families, those who are supporting families and who are keeping a house. The Government, having hunted the heads of families in every possible way in which they could be hunted, from the point of view of imposing taxes on them, proceed to take a group out of whom they hope to get a little more, the group of people who own their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago we used to hear the Minister and his colleagues expounding on what a glorious thing it would be to have a country where every man owned his own house, together with the other sorts of freedom that they were so full of platitudes about. When they took over control, what did they do?  They set about taxing the class of people who were anxious to dig their roots deeply in the social life of the country in such a way that they could not be easily moved, the class of people who were a valuable asset because they could not be <Col N="845" /> hunted out of the country.  Amongst these were the owners of stallions, people who could not easily be dislodged, and they were seized upon by the Minister, who gave them another little squeeze in the taxation machine, down on top of the increased taxation on everything that went into a man's house, and everything that was done to the house by way of repairs and so on.  The value of the house was increased for the purpose of taking additional income-tax, taking it from the heads of families who were anxious to root themselves and their families more deeply than would ordinarily be done in the life of the country.  Such people in the normal way would be a valuable asset, but the Minister has them taxed almost out of existence.</P>
    <P>When asked by Deputy Costello, to remove this tax or to give some explanation of its continued imposition, the Minister simply sits in silence.  He knows the tax put on here is a tax put on by a financial scrounger who, having scrounged every penny and shilling that he could get from the poorer classes, the working classes, found that he had to scrounge further. We are perfectly aware of the protestations made by the Minister and his colleagues when they first put on £4,000,000 by way of additional taxation in 1932.  From one end of the country to the other it was explained that that additional taxation was coming out of the pockets of the rich.  But all that has slipped off the backs of the rich on to the backs of the poor, so much so that the Parliamentary Secretary had to say last year, &ldquo;Why should the working man be taxed?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Surely it is relevant to point out that the imposition of increased taxation by the raising of the value of the house is an imposition that has followed the introduction of taxation on every item that could possibly be thought of, on everything that goes into a house.  The main incidence of that taxation goes on the fathers of families, men of the working classes.  I think the Minister should <Col N="846" /> give the House some explanation why this pernicious tax is being persisted in.</P>

      <P>In rising to support this amendment, I would like to point out to the Minister that when this tax was originally imposed it was represented that a revaluation was imminent and that this was merely put on as a temporary expedient.  Now, as time goes on I am afraid that excuse becomes less and less entitled to be accepted as a pretext for a tax which, as has been pointed out, comes very unfairly on a type of investor which the Minister ought to be most anxious to encourage.  I take it the Minister is anxious to encourage people to own their own houses.  Certain inducements were held out to people in the past in order that they might invest in purchasing their own houses.  Those concessions <Col N="847" /> have been withdrawn and that has altered the yield of one class of investment as against another.  That, I submit, is not what the Minister ought to do as between one section of the community and another.  In fact, as I have before stated about this tax, it is really only penalising thrift and I would like the Minister to consider whether he can accept this amendment. We are, of course, aware that there are certain sections who, while it is charged to them, get an allowance for it so that it does not hit them so much; but it is the small class of investor who has purchased his own house owing to the concessions which were allowed and who paid a market price for it, that this tax bears most heavily and most unfairly on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I marvel at the hardihood of Deputy Mulcahy, who gets up here and makes a speech about the poor man, his cost of living and how he is borne down by the burdens which have been imposed on him by this Government.  The Deputy gets up and makes a speech of that sort in support of a proposal that wishes to make not the poor man but the property owner a privileged class in this community, because if a man does not happen to be a property owner, if he does not derive his income from house property and if he does not own houses: if he has to work for his living, say, as a locomotive driver, as a clerk, a civil servant, a doctor or professional man and does not derive his income or any part of his income from property which he owns he has to pay in certain circumstances income-tax, that is, if the allowances to which he is entitled under the income-tax code do not relieve his income from assessment. In that case he has to pay income-tax. But Deputy Mulcahy says that if there is a person who derives his income from the ownership of property then that person is to be charged income-tax upon a notional income which will be considerably less than the actual income he enjoys.  The Deputy gets up and talks about the poor man: the taxes on his table, on his clothes and on his boots, and the sum and substance of his argument is directed to this, to increase the burden on the <Col N="848" /> indirect taxpayer, upon the poor man and upon the middle-class man who is not in a position to own house property. That is the purport of Deputy Mulcahy's speech, and that is the end to which Deputy Costello's argument was directed last year.  We have been told in this debate that Deputy Costello was moved to put down this amendment because of the hardships which Section 3 of the Finance Act of 1935 had inflicted on certain individuals.</P>
      <P>Now the Revenue Commissioners deal with all classes of income-tax payers.  The case of every income-tax payer comes under the notice of the Revenue Commissioners' staff and of their inspectorate, and the Revenue Commissioners tell me that not one single case has come under their notice in which the section has worked inequitably: that is to say, not one case in which actual net income, taking one year with another, derived from house property, or which if the property were let could be derived from it, fell short of the Schedule assessment calculated in the manner required by Section 3 of the Act of 1935, the section which it is proposed to repeal.  The Revenue Commissioners have knowledge, directly or indirectly, of the position of every income-tax payer in this country, and they advised me that no one case of hardship or of inequity has come under their notice, and yet Deputy Costello gets up and tells us that he has been moved to put down this amendment because, he says, of the hardship of which he has personal knowledge.  Last year, on the Finance Bill, the Deputy made a speech in similar terms to that which he has made to-night.  He made this statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;By merely introducing that section thousands of people find that not merely have they to pay an increased income-tax, but that the asset which they had put aside in a thrifty way as a provision for themselves and their families had been depreciated by the action of the Minister in his rapacity to get in more taxation by a very considerable amount in market value.  The Minister has had 12 months' experience <Col N="849" /> of the working of this section.  We have been informed of the injustice which has been brought about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked him: &ldquo;Will the Deputy cite one case?&rdquo;  Birds of a feather flock together, and Deputy Costello's tactics on the 24th June last year were the same as those which Deputy Dillon adopted to-night because he replied to me in almost the self-same terms: &ldquo;I will not cite any particular individual's circumstances.  The Minister must know them as well as I know them.&rdquo; I said then and I say now that I know of no case of hardship occasioned by Section 3 of the Finance Act of 1935, and I challenge any Deputy opposite if he does not want to give me the name of an individual here to give it to me in confidence, and I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to investigate the case.  If the Deputies opposite cannot give me the name of one individual let them for goodness sake stop this political ramp and not try to create a privileged class in this community. First of all it is the wealthy stallion owners that they want to give concessions to at the cost of the general community. Now it is the property owners. They come here to create a privileged class of taxpayers in the community and then talk about the burdens on the poor man.</P>
    <P>The position is that this amendment has no merit whatever.  The fact of the matter is that so far as the middle class element in this community is concerned they are better off in 1937 as far as the payment of income-tax is concerned than they were in 1931, and so far as poor people are concerned, the people who live in houses with a valuation of £24, £20 or £14, they are much better off than they were before.  Practically none of them become assessable for income-tax under the terms of this section because they are exempt by reason of the increased allowances which we have made to them since 1932.</P>
