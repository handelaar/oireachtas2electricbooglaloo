      <P>asked the President whether in view of statements which have recently appeared in the public Press he will ask the British Government to submit the alleged Casement Diary, if still in existence, to joint examination by a representative of the Government of the Irish Free State and a representative of the British Government and to publish their report as to its authenticity, and, if spurious, as to the possibility of an honest mistake by those who made use of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether so long as the Irish Free State is associated with the nations of the British Commonwealth for purposes of foreign policy, he will take an equal share with such nations in Imperial Conferences by which Commonwealth foreign policy is determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Imperial Conference does not determine the foreign policy of the States of the British Commonwealth. Each State is free to determine <Col N="332" /> its own policy and follow its own line of action.  There is, therefore, not necessarily any such thing as a Commonwealth foreign policy.  In so far as there is at any time community of action, it is determined by common interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the Irish Government is not to provide facilities for the emigration of our people to the States of the British Commonwealth or elsewhere.  Its aim is to concentrate on utilising the resources of this country and so improving the conditions of life here that our people will not have to emigrate, but will be able to find a livelihood in their own country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether in view of the fact that by international law and custom the proper moment for recognising a new Government which has established itself in the course of a revolution or civil war is when it is judged to have attained stability and to have secured obedience over a clear majority of the country and the people he will consult with the other nations of the Commonwealth for the purpose of obtaining simultaneous recognition of General Franco's Government directly these conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions indicated by the Deputy are those which generally determine the recognition of revolutionary governments by other States.  The moment these conditions are fulfilled there will be no difficulty in the recognition of General Franco's Government by this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot say whether there will be <Col N="333" /> any question of recognition by groups of States simultaneously.  If such a suggestion is made it is more likely to concern a European group than a combination of European and non-European States.  Obviously European States have the more direct interest in taking the lead to insure stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether it is intended to hold a meeting of the Imperial Conference in 1937, and, if so, whether the Government of Saorstát Eireann intends to be represented at it.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - German Trade Agreement and Exports of Herring</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the German Trade Agreement for 1937 contains any provision for exports of matje herring to Germany from Saorstát Eireann, and, if so, what are the quantities provided for and the terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in the existing German trade agreement for the export to Germany of cured herrings during the period April to July, 1937.  The quantity of herrings to be exported under the terms of the agreement will (as in the case of other <Col N="334" /> Saorstát products) be contingent on the value of goods of German origin imported into Saorstát Eireann in the 12 months ending November, 1937. The terms of sale will be a matter for arrangement between Saorstát Eireann exporters and German importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, in view of the fact that one of the commodities which it is proposed to export to Germany under the agreement referred to is butter, and in view of the fact that there is now a scarcity of butter in this country, would the Minister open negotiations with the German Reich with a view to having them accept herrings in lieu of butter over the period outstanding? Deputies would do well not to laugh at this; there are men starving on the West Donegal coast because the Fianna Fáil Party betrayed them in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that men employed under rotational schemes in County Kildare are being required by the county surveyor to work longer than eight hours per day; whether he is aware that these men are employed on a day-to-day basis and do not therefore enjoy the privilege of working a short day in the week, and whether in the circumstances he will issue instructions that the men in question must not be employed for more than eight hours on any day.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position stated by the Deputy but the demands of employment have to be regulated so as to fit into the organisation for the supervision of road works in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he not consider it unfair that men employed for three or four days per week should be expected <Col N="335" /> to give the same daily hours of attendances as regular road men, seeing that the regular road men's hours of work are unduly prolonged from Monday to Friday because of the fact that they get a half-holiday on Saturday?  The temporary road men are unable to get that half-holiday on Saturday because they are deliberately unemployed on Saturday.  Does he not further think it unfair that those men should be required to give extra attendances each day for a concession which, under an instruction issued by the Government, they can never obtain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a difference of half an hour per day is enough to cause any great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that it is not half an hour per day.  In those particular cases it is often more&mdash;possibly three&mdash;quarters of an hour.  Will the Minister then have those people paid at an hourly rate instead of at a daily rate, so as to give them the advantage of the extra time which they work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it unfair to stand aloof in this matter, when at the same time the Department of Industry and Commerce is endeavouring to ensure, under the Conditions of Employment Act, that the normal working week will be 48 hours, or that the daily attendance will be eight hours?  In this particular case the men are working in excess of 48 hours per week, which is the maximum prescribed by the Conditions of Employment Act.  Surely there should be some consistency in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the days when they are working they work the same hours as the ordinary road employees. I think it would be a matter of serious inconvenience to the overseers, the county surveyors and assistant county surveyors, to have different hours for men working in the same gang.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>My information as to the prices of household and bakers' flours in Great Britain is gathered from ordinary trade journals and so far as these journals disclose, the prices would seem to be higher than those stated in the Deputy's question. The current list prices of household and bakers' flours respectively in Saorstát Eireann are 46/- and 52/- respectively.  It should be noted, however, that the actual selling prices of flour are often substantially below the list prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of factors which would justify a higher price for flour in the Saorstát than in Great Britain <Col N="343" /> but I am not satisfied that present Saorstát prices should not be reduced or that the Saorstát millers are complying with the formula suggested by the Prices Commission as a basis for fixing the price of flour and the whole position is having the close attention of my Department.</P>

May I further assure him that the figures set out in my question are accurate, and have been secured from persons who are daily selling those commodities in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Saorstát Eireann?</P>

      <P>As the reply contains a good deal of detail, some of it in schedule form, I do not propose to read it, but will have it circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The reply is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The quantity of creamery butter sold in Saorstát Eireann during the year ended 31st December, 1936, was 371,994 cwts.  Levy was paid on the whole of this butter.  During the same period 31,506 cwts. of non-creamery butter on which levy was paid were sold in the Saorstát.  No information is available as to the total sales of non-creamery butter in the Saorstát during the year, since no levy was payable on sales of such butter under an exemption licence granted by me <Col N="355" /> under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1935, and there is reason to believe that many dealers in farm butter failed to register under the Act and to pay levy on their sales.</P>
    <P>(2)  The ordinary rates of levy in force during the year on creamery and non-creamery butter were as follows:&mdash;</P>

The existing programme of instruction requires the work in infant classes to be done entirely in Irish only where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.  This principle was accepted and recommended by the National Programme Conference in 1926, which included amongst its personnel two representatives of the Catholic managers.  My Department is in constant touch with the inspectors, and their reports on infants' classes, in which all the work is done through the medium of Irish by teachers with the requisite qualifications, do not indicate <Col N="360" /> any material deviation from the normal intellectual training and development.</P>

The existing programme of instruction requires all the work to be done in Irish in infant classes only where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to validate the appointment of certain recruits, who have been admitted to the Gárda Síochána since the 8th August, 1933&mdash;that is from the date of the passing of the Gárda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. That Act, as well as the subsequent Acts dealing with the recruitment of Guards, provided that appointment to the Gárda Síochána, with the exception of officers, should be made by the Commissioner.  When this Act was passed in 1923 it provided for regulations as to recruitment.  These regulations were not made until June, 1924. In the meantime, about 800 recruits had been admitted to the force.  I have been advised that, where recruitment was carried on between the period of the passing of the Temporary Provisions Act of 1923 and the making of regulations in 1924, it is necessary to have legislation to validate the appointment of those recruits.  That is done under sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Bill.  Since the making of those regulations, cases have occurred of admissions to the Gárda Síochána where those recruited did not comply with the conditions set out in the regulations made in 1924.  It was held that those regulations were not mandatory but rather directory.  However, we have now been advised that they are mandatory, and that it is necessary to pass this Bill for the purpose of validating that recruitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but may I not mention it on this section which provides for judgments in the Circuit Court to be registered in a particular way?  Possibly, the Minister himself will agree that the matter I propose to deal with is important.  Under this Bill Circuit Court judgments for any amount, for sums as small as £5, can be registered.  But if a judgment is obtained in the District Court for £20 or £25, it cannot be so registered.  I do not know what view the Minister may take of the inferiority of the District Court as distinct from the Circuit Court, but at the moment, under this Bill, I understand that it will be possible to register any judgment in that particular way that is obtained in a Circuit Court.  For a like matter, however, a judgment obtained in a like way in the District Court cannot be so registered.  Consequently, I would appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to give the matter his consideration and to see if an injustice is not being done somewhere. If it is right that certain Acts should be repealed, as certain enactments are here repealed, for the sake of allowing certain judgments to be registered by way of mortgage, I think that that also ought to extend to the matters I have mentioned.  It has been pointed out to me by a legal friend as being a great drawback.</P>

      <P>Well, the position, as I said on a previous occasion, is that this Bill is based on a recommendation of the Bankruptcy Commission, and subsequently on a recommendation by a commission set up under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924. They made the recommendation embodied in this Bill, but they made no recommendation with regard to district courts.  Subsequently, recommendations were made by the Incorporated Law Society representing, I understand, the great majority of the solicitors of the country, and they again did not make any recommendation with regard to the District Court. I did raise the matter with the then President of the Incorporated Law Society as to whether this might be included.  He may have had his own view of the matter, but so far as the Incorporated Law Society is concerned, they made no recommendation in regard to this matter.  I had an open mind on the subject and I wondered why they should not have included it.  I understand, from whatever statistics are available, that the great majority of these decrees in district courts are small and that no hardship has resulted from this. However, as I say, I have an open mind on the matter, and if the Deputy could get his legal friend, who is interested in this thing and who has experience of it, to get in touch with the bodies concerned, I would have no objection, provided that there is nothing against it from the procedure point of view, to including it on the Report Stage if I am satisfied that there is any hardship from not including it in the Bill.  I did not see why it should be included since there was no recommendation and we were including the other; but if a case can be made for it, I have no objection whatever to including it provided, as I say, that there is nothing difficult from the procedure point of view.  Perhaps the Deputy's friend knows ways to get that thing going between now and the Report Stage, and I shall certainly try to meet the Deputy's wishes if a case can be made for it.</P>

If the Minister is prepared to inquire into it and to get his Department to inquire into it, I think it is desirable that they should do it.  If there is an injustice, and if there is an opportunity to remedy it, I think we ought to take advantage of it.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution of this Bill, Sir, will it be in order for the Minister to state briefly <Col N="373" /> what the attitude of the Government is on the waters of Lough Foyle.  This Bill makes provision in many of its sections for the provision of protection and enforcement of certain regulations in certain waters which are territorial waters, and also makes provision for the giving of protection and enforcement of certain regulations in extra-territorial waters.  I think, however, we are entitled to ask the Minister, if we want money from Dáil Eireann wherewith to enforce regulations in territorial waters what, in the judgment of the Executive Council, are the territorial waters of Saorstát Eireann, and very grave obscurity seems to exist in connection with Lough Foyle.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked whether it would be in order to discuss now the matter of jurisdiction over the waters of Lough Foyle.  Certain amendments were submitted by Deputy McMenamin with a view to initiating a discussion on that matter.  The amendments in question are Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6.  This is a measure of very limited scope, the purpose of which is to implement certain international conventions or agreements.  The definition of territorial waters does indeed come in, but only incidentally and for the limited purposes of this measure.  Those limits also are internationally agreed.</P>
      <P>The question to which the Deputy refers would have been in order on the Sea Fisheries Protection Act of 1933. It is obvious that on this Bill which deals only with a specific convention, it would not be in order to amend the definition of territorial waters.  Hence a discussion on the Lough Foyle problem may not, at this or any other stage of the Bill, be initiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that power should ever be used for the purpose of making a subscription in money to a charitable institution, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to state now that it would be the policy of his Department to insist that such a subvention would be given without any conditions attached or without any right on the part of the Department of Finance to control its expenditure. Without going into the merits of the Bill, which it would not be relevant to do at this stage, I see one danger in the principle enshrined in this Bill. That is, that once a Department of State comes to the assistance of any existing corporation or association, there is a grave danger of the bureaucracy, which it is impossible to dissociate from the administration of State moneys, intervening in the day-to-day administration of the corporation or association which the State assists.  Damage out of all proportion to the benefit conferred by any subvention given by the Government would be done if the Department of Finance acquired the right to control, directly or indirectly, the charitable organisation so assisted.  Unless the matter is clearly disposed of at this stage, I apprehend that in one of the myriad regulations that already exist concerning the control of public moneys, the Department of Finance might be compelled to claim some right hereafter to supervise the disbursement of any such grants as I have in mind.  While this Bill is passing through the House, I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that whatever precaution may be necessary should now be taken to ensure that it is not the intention of the Oireachtas that any such rights of supervision should vest in the Department of Finance, now or hereafter, or that any such right should vest in any other Department of State or local authority <Col N="377" /> which acts under the authority of this section.</P>

      <P>I do not expect the Minister to do more than indicate what his attitude would be to an amendment of this kind.  The object of the amendment is to place officers who are dispensing unemployment assistance in possession of information as to the assistance which is being dispensed through other channels.  I do not know how the Minister proposes to deal with that aspect of the matter.  He cannot have overlooked it.  He may, perhaps, intend to make that a condition of the grant.  In the opinion of some people, it would be much better to have this matter in black and white in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider the question before Report Stage and to say how he would regard the general principle of this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a point as to possible interference by the Minister for Finance in connection with the allocation of grants.  The Deputy is, I think, labouring under a complete misunderstanding as to the intentions of the Bill.  The Minister for Finance does not come into the administration of the Bill at all.  No State grants will be made available in connection with the subvention to societies which may establish or maintain such institutions as are contemplated by the Bill.  The Bill enables a local authority to give assistance, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, for certain specific purposes, set out in Section 2, to a charitable society which maintains an institution for destitute persons.  I do not think that there is any danger of the things which Deputy Dillon had in mind occurring, inasmuch as his entire argument was based on the assumption that State grants would be given to such a society.  That is not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the point raised by Deputy Dockrell as to the possibility of the overlapping of assistance from a society and from a local authority, I think that that is a matter that can very well be guarded against in administration.  The local authority making a grant to such a society or <Col N="379" /> organisation can easily ascertain, through the home assistance officers or unemployment assistance officers what assistance, if any, people who are being maintained or who are securing food or shelter in such an institution are getting.  I do not know whether it would be in order for the Deputy to move an amendment on the Report Stage.  As he will readily grant, I have not got much notice of the point he desired to raise.  However, I think it can easily be covered in administration without the necessity for amending the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Unemployment Assistance Acts&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the wholly inadequate rates of benefit originally provided for unemployed persons under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and to the fact that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially, this House requests the Executive Council to introduce proposals for amending the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 and 1935, with a view to providing from State Funds adequate maintenance for all persons unable to obtain remunerative employment.&mdash;(Deputies Norton, Corish, Davin and Keyes.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this motion moved by the members of the Labour Party.  At the same time, I am wondering if the House has forgotten that the Labour Party themselves were parties to the increase in the cost of <Col N="381" /> commodities which they now, apparently deprecate.  I am glad to welcome the change of front on behalf of the Labour Party.  They state in this motion that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially.  I agree with them, but those who have eyes to see and ears to hear must remember that the signatories to this motion themselves contributed very largely to the tragedy that has overtaken this country in the shape of unemployment, as well as an increase in the cost of commodities.</P>
      <P>Now, I want to point out that the position of the unemployed in Cork City can only be described as very bad, and very tragic in some cases.  Many men willing and able to work are unable to procure employment, and many of those persons, honest, decent, respectable working men, are not able to come within the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts because it has been suggested that they are not genuinely seeking work.  I know that great hardship has been inflicted on many of those persons who are justly entitled to the benefits which should accrue to them under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, but they are debarred from receiving benefit because of the reason I have mentioned.  Perhaps the Minister might, at some future date, devise some other means than those at present adopted to discover whether a man is genuinely seeking employment.  I must emphasise that great hardships have been inflicted through the operation of that particular clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure I will be joined by the members of the Labour Party and the official Opposition in the remark that none of us would agree to encourage the type of person who is not genuinely seeking employment.  In that connection I want to say that many of the unemployed, both in Dublin and Cork, do not quite understand the position by which public bodies are faced. Members of public bodies are frequently charged with neglecting their duty because they do not provide employment for unemployed persons.  I <Col N="382" /> will give as an instance, the cases of the Cork Corporation and the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  They were blamed for not having created work, for not having started large schemes of work.  Those bodies, as the Minister is aware, are governed by statute, and they are not allowed by statute to break up property or indulge in certain public works without an inquiry being held and certain preliminaries gone through.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Cork Harbour Commissioners I would like to give an extract from a report issued by a special sub-committee set up to inquire into the losses sustained by the Cork Harbour Commissioners over a period of years.  That special sub-committee was presided over by a member of the Minister's Party.  I will quote one or two paragraphs from the report to show that the revenue of the port has been seriously affected owing to the operation of the Government's present economic policy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The revenue of the port, which in 1930 was £96,964, had fallen by 1935 to £78,617.  This decline is due to reduced imports and exports, particularly imports of maize, flour, fruit, artificial manures, cattle-feeding stuffs, sugar, and exports of live stock, eggs and bacon.  Messrs. H. Ford &amp; Son, Ltd., also ceased to export cars and tractors, and the oil entrepot trade at Haulbowline was closed down.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those responsible for the management of the port of Cork could do nothing to prevent this decline, which was almost entirely due to national policy, over which they have no control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, we have the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When Haulbowline dockyard was working normally, it employed 1,000 manual workers from the Cobh and Passage areas.  As late as 1927, the local expenditure at Rushbrooke docks was £75,000 per annum.  All this has ceased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to the facts related in this document, and to inquire has the City of Cork got anything to compensate it for this loss.  As a result <Col N="383" /> of this policy in Cork, we have numbers of men unemployed; we have the workers in the Cork Harbour Commissioners' yard working for a considerable period on short time, something like a week about.  We have had them working a five-day week up to recently; the employers were then able to restore them to a full six days, and the position will be again reviewed at the end of June next.</P>
    <P>The operatives in most of the tariffed industries are, naturally, because of the high cost of living, looking for increased wages.  From time to time we hear of the turbulent character of some of these people who look for increased wages, but who can blame any worker, organised or unorganised, when he finds the cost of living going up from day to day, looking for an advance in wages in order to meet that increased cost of living?  It appears to me we are going to follow that very vicious circle begun during the Great War period, when prices were rising from day to day.  There was only one reaction to that on the part of the working people, and that was to look for still further increases in wages to meet the increased cost of living.  I think the Minister will agree it is the only natural reaction.</P>
    <P>When the purchasing power of the £ goes down to something like 14/- or 15/-, it is high time the workers in industries should look for increased wages, and, in turn, these increases are passed on to the consumer.  The position, as I find it to-day, is this, that we are creating a newly-rich merchant class who are exploiting the working class in a way the old ascendancy class never did.  It appears, also, that the newly-rich, the new ascendancy class, possess most of the vices and very few of the virtues of the much abused old ascendancy gang.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This policy has been operated by the persons to whom I refer, and who would be loudest in their condemnation of the operatives <Col N="384" /> in these various industries when they hear they are going to use the strike weapon to enforce their demands.  At a meeting of the unemployed workers in Dublin a few weeks ago, we had a gentleman named Mr. Eamonn Wall, described as a member of the Irish Labour Party, and he stated: &ldquo;It was all very well for them to read of after-dinner speeches by industrialists at banking concerns, etc.; to read of the introduction of the new Constitution and the abolition of the Seanad, but the unemployed knew there was no prosperity in the tenements.&rdquo;  There cannot be prosperity in the tenements so long as commodities, these essentials of life, are going up and up; and yet the rate of unemployment assistance remains the same.  I do not want, and I am sure the Labour Party do not want, to encourage the malingerers, the &ldquo;won't works,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;weary Willies,&rdquo; but there are numbers of honest, decent, respectable working people who are badly hit by the regulations as they now stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion very properly states that the retail prices of commodities normally used in working class homes have been raised substantially since the introduction of this Act.  I would be the last person in this House to suggest extra taxation either local or national, if I did not believe that dire necessity exists.  I am aware of the poverty that exists in Cork City amongst a number of very deserving people who would willingly work to-morrow if they got it.  I have known cases where men who went to work with the pick and shovel had to be fed by charitable organisations.  One or two organisations in which I take a very great interest and with which I have been connected for some twenty odd years have assisted men to get work and fed them for one, two or three days before they could work with the pick and shovel.  Because of these reasons amongst others, I suggest to the Minister that machinery should be set up to deal with cases of the character I have mentioned.  Nobody defends, as I said before, the position of the people who will not work, but the cases I have cited are <Col N="385" /> typical of many thousands of cases of working class people in the country to-day and I hope the Minister will see his way, even if he does not accept this motion, to initiate himself some legislation which will meet the wishes of the Deputies who have signed their names to the motion and the other persons in the House who are equally interested in the welfare of the working classes.</P>

      <P>This unemployment problem would be far worse at the present time but for the immense numbers of young people going to England; but even after the tens of thousands of boys and girls who have gone to England in the last eighteen months the situation is still very grave.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be well for the tariff enthusiasts of the Labour Party to remember that while you may put a limited number of persons in work if you put on a sufficient high tariff, there are repercussions of the economic policy of self-sufficiency to be found in the docks of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and every other shipping centre in the country.  It is noteworthy that the cruellest suffering from unemployment in this country is <Col N="386" /> to be found in the big ports where men have been thrown out of work in the docks and in the warehouses and in those branches of occupation which were connected with our international trade.  Another occasion will offer to compare the values of international and internal trade, but it is relevant to refer to these matters so far as to point out that one of the by products of economic nationalism is the unemployment of large numbers of men, many of them family men, who had been earning good money doing useful work for the community.  That is something that a lot of people forget when they talk of a tariff of 75 per cent. on this or 100 per cent. on that or of a quota on this or a quota on that.  While you may produce a little factory here or a little factory there, you may at the same time throw out of good and remunerative employment men who have never until that hour known a day's unemployment in their lives.</P>
      <P>I am concerned in regard to the substance of this resolution, because I come up against it every day of my life.  I see working people buying the necessaries of life every day, and I have frequently been shocked when I reckoned up the amount of taxation and excess charges paid by a working man's wife on her weekly supply.  I have frequently seen a labouring man's wife coming in to spend her husband's wages on a Saturday night, and on £1 worth of goods, if she bought clothes for the children as well as food for the house, I have found that 5/- of her £1 was going directly or indirectly to the Treasury.</P>

The tragic thing about the situation with which we are trying to deal is that the vast majority of the Fianna Fáil Party are so benumbed by their own propaganda that they do not know the facts, and they are afraid to learn them.  Does Deputy Moore realise that if a workingman's wife goes on Saturday night to buy 1 lb. of butter she pays 5d. tax upon it, approximately?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that where she bought household requirements and drapery, 5/- out of every £1 went directly to the Treasury.  People should not forget that.  People in this country are losing sight of the fact that every reactionary government in the world is a tariff reform government, every government which is inspired by the worst vices of the capitalist system.  In my opinion the capitalist system is the best system under which we can live, but it has its vices.  Every Government which comes under the control of the vicious element of the tariff system knows that through the instrumentality of tariffs it can lift the taxation off the direct taxpayer and shift it over to the backs of those who pay indirect taxation.  The indirect taxpayers are the poor, and you can so cover up indirect taxation that the poor do not know they are paying it. All that happens is that they tighten their belts and do with less.  They do not realise that their food and their standard of living is being cut down by the taxes they are made to pay, and which they are paying to relieve the wealthier sections of the community who are much better able to afford to pay.  Some people will say that most of the increased taxes of one kind or another are being laid on the backs of the poor for the simple reason that the rich would not pay them.  If anything like the amount of money that is being dug out of the poor was levied on the wealthier element the Dublin Chamber of Commerce would make the welkin ring; they would chase the Minister for Industry and Commerce at every stage; there would be no banquets given, no entertainments provided, and no passionate speeches about his excellent virtues, his zeal for industry, his courage and his resource. They would chase him out of the city, because they are equipped with resources with which the poor are not equipped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a woman living in Gloucester Street who goes to Talbot Street to buy a cotton singlet for her husband.  Up to a few years ago she got one for 1/-.  It is now not a question of paying a little more; her <Col N="388" /> husband has to do without an inside shirt.  Of course he has an outer shirt but he has to do without a singlet. These are homely and some people may say indelicate things to mention, but every labouring man knows what a difference it makes if his wardrobe comprises an undervest which can be washed frequently.  This is a joke for some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, but it is not a joke for anyone who has to deal with working people, and who knows what a difference it makes in the household.  I have seen men who had to go without these garments because they could not afford to buy them.  The Minister says that these things cannot be produced here. He asks: &ldquo;Do you want me to allow in Japanese and Czecho-Slovakian products to wipe out Irish Industry?&rdquo;  I admit that it is a difficult proposition, but I think the last people who should be hit in order to promote Irish industry are the very poor.  Supposing we are faced with the alternative of allowing in Japanese garments which will make available for the working man a wardrobe, which he will not have if they are not let in, then these are the last things that prohibitive tariffs should be put on.  It may be said that it is a terrible pity that we cannot produce singlets at a price that these people can afford to pay.  If we make up our minds that it cannot be done, then I think it is wrong to prohibit their entry altogether.</P>
    <P>Under existing circumstances what is happening is that a considerable percentage of lowly-paid working men have to do without these garments because they cannot afford them. They pay form 1/6 to 1/11 for garments that are not as good as those they were able to buy for 1/- three or four years ago.  The President of the Executive Council says that we cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  That is quite true.  But I object to breaking the eggs of the poorer section of the community first.  To my mind, their eggs are the last to be broken if eggs are to be broken at all.  I am sure Deputy Mrs. Concannon has some experience of the difficulty of hardworking women who are trying to provide clothes for a large family of <Col N="389" /> young children.  The Deputy will probably remember that up to about four years ago a mother could get a pair of cotton socks for about 4d., so that if she wanted to turn out six children nice and clean on a Sunday she could get socks for the family for 2/-.  These socks are not to be had now.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to know what we want him to do about it or if we want him to wipe out the hosiery factories. I do not want that.  I think a middle course could be pursued.  The hosiery industry could be promoted here without stopping what is required for the poor man's child.  It is reckless disregard for the particular case that has resulted in the steady increase in the cost of living of the poor.  I sometimes despair of getting those who are supposed to be solicitous for the welfare of the poorer sections of our community to understand what the situation is. In so far as drapery goods are concerned, the whole trouble is complicated by this fact, that not only do money prices rise but the quality of the articles supplied goes down. No one seems to see that.</P>
    <P>Take the case of flannelette.  Remember that the poor buy flannelette, and that a great part of their raiment is made from it.  A woman who is in the habit of buying eightpenny flannelette, when she goes in now gets in fact flannelette which used to be sold for 4½d.  The flannelette that now costs 8d. will not last much more than half the time.  That is happening all through commodities which working people buy in drapers' shops.  There are comparatively few commodities which cost a shilling three years ago that do not cost 1/3 to-day.  People are still buying articles for a shilling but they do not last half as long.  It is only when you get to the 1/- singlet and the 4d socks or something which the poorest of the poor must purchase that you find the actual increase in money prices.  Where there is any scope for reducing the quality or raising the prices you will very frequently find that the change in value that the poor are getting consists only of half of an increase in price and half a reduction in quality.</P>

      <P>No, but when we were importing people here were getting good value for their money, because merchants had to buy in the cheapest market, or otherwise competitors would take away their trade.  The result was that when buying flannelette they tried Manchester, America or Holland to get the best value to be got.  If you did not do that your neighbour would, and he would take your trade away from you.  Now, there is only one firm in Ireland producing flannelette, and you take that or you leave it, and you pay 33? per cent. tax.  I put it to Deputy Mrs. Concannon, just imagine a working woman coming in to buy 3½ yards of flannelette at 1/- a yard to make a garment for herself.  Out of that 3/6, that woman is paying about 8d. tax.  Mind you, I am understanding it; she is, probably paying 9d. or 10d., but let us say 8d.  On an ordinary nightdress she is paying 8d. tax.

      <P>There are matters about which I do not care to joke, and I do not suppose the Deputy wants to either. I find them very depressing, and I have not the slightest doubt that if Deputies here had those matters brought under their notice from day to day they would share that view with me.  I wish we could see our way to do something to relieve that kind of stress.  I believe <Col N="391" /> it is unnecessary and I believe it is very harmful.  I should like to direct the attention of Deputies to specific commodities which I am now going to mention. In 1933, when this Unemployment Assistance Act was first mooted in this House, a cwt. of flour in this country cost 13/-.  I am now taking the average price at which it would be bought in a country shop.  If it were nearer a port it might be cheaper; if it were nearer the centre of the country it might be dearer.  To-day the price is 20/6, that is an increase of 7/6 per cwt. in the price of flour over the last four years.  A cwt. of meal was costing 6/11. Now, mind you, a cwt. of meal in some parts of the country is animal food, but in many parts of the Gaeltacht, as Deputies from that part of the country know, it is used as human food.  A cwt. of meal used to cost 6/11; now it costs 9/5.  Part of that is due to the Government's folly.  Part of it is due to the rise in the world price of maize, but a great deal of that increase in price is due to the maize meal mixture scheme. Tea is up by 4d. a pound.  A stone of sugar cost 3/- in 1933; now it costs 3/11. A 10 stone bag of oatmeal cost 16/- in 1933; now it costs about 25/-.  The last price I saw paid for it was 23/6, but it has gone up a little since I took down those figures, and I think it is now 24/- or 25/-.  A stone of bacon was 9/- in 1932; it is now 15/-.  A cwt. of coal was 2/6 in 1932; it is now 3/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of those increases are due to the active intervention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  All those increases are being paid by the poor. All the commodities I have just mentioned are commodities which are the weekly purchases of the people who are receiving unemployment assistance&mdash; the purchases of those least able to afford the increase.  It is not relevant to discuss the conditions of persons other than those who come within the category of the unemployed.  Of course this burden is bearing just as heavily on many other sections of the community, and it is manifest to anybody who is meeting those people every day that the allowances made to them under the Unemployment Assistance <Col N="392" /> Act two or three years ago have been as effectively reduced by this rise in price to which I have referred as if the Minister had taken 2/- or 3/- off the assistance.  We all remember the storm of fury which Fianna Fáil succeeded in raising against the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they perpetrated that major political folly of taking 1/- off the old age pensions.  Of course it was the greatest political error a Party ever made.  The fullest capital was made out of it by the Fianna Fáil Party, and it stood them in good stead in the general election which then ensued.  They have taken far more off.</P>
    <P>I put this to the Labour Party, and I ask their particular attention for it, because it is an extraordinarily good example of how you can fool the poor, but you cannot fool a potential member of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. The taking of 1/- off the old age pension created a storm all through the country.  There was no old man or woman in the country who did not understand that as plainly as A B C. There was no explanation required; it stood out, and they were mad.  There is more being taken off by the rise in the cost of living to which we have referred in the course of this debate. Infinitely more than 10 per cent. of their income has been taken from them in the rise in the cost of living.  How many people can you get to see that at the present time?  If you went to the old age pensioners and said: &ldquo;Which would you sooner have&mdash;those prices reduced, or 1/- put on to your old age pension?&rdquo;  99 per cent. of them would say: &ldquo;I would sooner have 1/- on my old age pension,&rdquo; because they do not feel that; they do not understand it. That is why this Government does that kind of thing.  That is what I despise this Government for.  I think the late Government was wrong and stupid and mistaken in taking 1/- off the old age pensions, but I respect them for the moral courage they showed.  Having made up their minds that it was their duty to do it they faced the political tornado which they knew was going to blow against them, and which they knew was going to be fanned and <Col N="393" /> fomented by an unscrupulous Opposition. This Government has not the honesty to do that.</P>

We have him here admitting that President de Valera is now grinding the faces of the poor in the dirt.  He was declaring him to be a liberator of the people five years ago.  He has supported President de Valera through thick and thin in this House.  He has voted for all those parts of the President's policy which have placed those burdens on the backs of the poor.

      <P>The Deputy will be found leading his Party as he is told when the whip is cracked.  I hope the Deputy will develop independence and that he will see the position in the country as I see it.  Ample evidence is now forthcoming that the policy for which Fianna Fáil stands is a fatal policy to this country and that it is peculiarly fatal to the poor, inasmuch as it is piling up on their backs immense burdens of expense, that it is increasing unemployment, and that it is at the same time dissipating the country's resources out of which unemployment must ultimately be looked after.  I frankly do not see how the Government are going to meet Deputy Norton's request unless they are prepared to change their policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton wants more money for unemployment.  I want less money for unemployment.  I want reasonable maintenance for any man who is willing to work but who cannot find a job.  But to do those two things we must have in this country active, increasing and profitable business.  We must have abundant national income in order to carry the unfortunate sections of the community over any periods of distress that may afterwards come.  But the fact is that the business of the country is dwindling.  Our international trade is decreasing in value; we are artificially stimulating exports of certain commodities, largely through the help of Government subsidies. There is practically no branch of the agricultural industry at present which is yielding a profit.  There is every evidence that the national income as a whole is dwindling.  If that national income continues to dwindle there is going to be no found out of which we can give the unemployed any kind of reasonable maintenance until we can find work for them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned two heads under which the increase in the cost of living <Col N="395" /> has become very onerous.  In conclusion I want to mention two others. At the present moment the people of this country are being asked to pay 1/5 per lb. for butter.  That price puts butter out of the reach of the unemployed people and out of the reach of many labouring men.  We now discover, as a result of a Parliamentary question addressed to the Minister for Agriculture to-day, that we have been levying 5d. per lb. for butter on our own people in order to ship butter to Germany and Great Britain in excess of the quantities we should have shipped and we are faced with a situation in which we have got to use unsalted butter that was intended for the Belgian market or else import Danish butter in order to keep our own people going.  We have been actually charging 5d. per lb. on butter in order to finance that operation. Now, is such a thing believable outside Bedlam?  The same Minister who is responsible for that, is the Minister who got up in this House and said that the reason he was bringing in the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Bill was because there was too much milk coming into Dublin.  Too much milk coming into Dublin when half the children in this city are not getting a quarter of the milk that they should consume every day!  And our remedy for that situation was to raise the price of milk.  Outside Grange-gorman such activities have never been allowed to continue for long. Just imagine in a city like Dublin with the under nourishment that obtains, and with the development and spread of disease amongst the children, that it should become the declared conviction of a responsible Minister that there was too much milk coming into Dublin.  The remedy for that situation was to increase the cost of milk to every consumer of milk in the city.  In the presence of insane activities of that kind one almost gets tired of protesting; one is accused of crying &ldquo;wolf;&rdquo; one is accused of always complaining and the suggestion is that some of our complaints are illfounded.</P>
    <P>I think the conduct of the Government <Col N="396" /> in regard not only to the unemployed but in regard to all the people is absolutely indefensible, hopeless and cruel.  Indeed some of their supporters are beginning to realise that. What astonishes and amazes me is that the Labour Party have consciously supported the Government in this policy.  How the Labour Party have shown so little interest in the practical outcome of the course for which they are responsible is a matter that I cannot understand.  I hope as a result of the debate on this motion the Labour Party are coming to realise whither they are going.  If they are they may be sure of whatever co-operation they ask from the other parties in this House so as to make the Government realise that they have the duty of running this country not in the interest of one section only, not in the interests of the people who are out to make a bit, but to see that every element in the community gets a fair share and to realise also that the only sound economy which attracts support in this country is that economy which will secure prosperity to all sections in the community and not prosperity exclusively for one or two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon treated us to rather a lengthy dissertation on the vices of tariffs, on the vices of economic nationalism and, by inference, of course, invited the House to believe that his fundamental philosophy&mdash;free trade&mdash;is a policy which will cure all the evils that beset this country.  The Deputy asked why impose tariffs on the importation of certain articles of clothing.  He asked why we should impose tariffs on certain articles of children's clothing. If the Deputy had thought a little more deeply and a little longer he would probably have found by reference to the conditions in other countries in Europe, and by reference to conditions in other parts of the world, that almost everything we make here can be produced cheaper in some other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the Deputy ought to know, if he were thinking at all, that almost every article that is made in this country can be produced cheaper in some other country in the world.  In many cases this is due to the highly industrialised conditions obtaining in those countries.  In other cases it is due to the currency exchange rates, and in a number of other cases it is due to the fact that very low rates of wages are paid in some foreign countries.  It is also due to the fact that there is over-production in those countries.  Such conditions enable those countries to export their surplus here and to sell it at a price much below the price charged to their own people or the price at which we could produce it here.</P>

But when we asked him, at the end of 40 minutes, to give us one case in disproof of the contention that I make, namely that almost everything we produce here can be produced cheaper in other countries of the world, the only thing the Deputy can point to is Guinness's stout.</P>

      <P>That is the serious contribution that we get from the Deputy. <Col N="398" /> He tells us that ships can be produced cheaper here than in other parts of the world.  The Deputy ought to know perfectly well that his statement in respect of ships is the purest nonsense. If he will examine the conditions in the Russian market he will find that it is utterly untrue to suggest that linen can be produced cheaper here than in Russia.  The Deputy ought to know&mdash;he can get the information from the official statistics published by other countries&mdash;that practically every commodity that we make in this country can be produced cheaper elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;let these commodities in simply because somebody here wants to buy them.&rdquo; Of course, if one were to follow Deputy Dillon's argument to its logical conclusion the ultimate result would be that this country would be the open door for the exports of every other country.  Some exports could get in, as I have already indicated, by reason of special exchange positions; in other cases by low wage rates; in others, by highly concentrated mechanised methods of production, but, over and above all, they could get in by dumping here the surplus products of their own countries.  Take sugar, which the Deputy is disposed to talk about so frequently in this House and outside of it.  It affords a classic example of the truth of what I have been saying, because the surplus products of that industry in Czecho-Slovakia are exported to any other country that will take them, and at a lesser rate than the citizens of Czecho-Slovakia pay for them.  The Deputy, of course, does not want information of that kind because it disturbs his foolish preconceived notions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has forgotten all about it, and I am glad to have that admission from him.  I hope, however, that the next time the Deputy studies the matter he will try to retain some knowledge of the subject. <Col N="399" /> What he said here on this particular matter has a bearing on the utterances that he has been making outside the House:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Do not produce anything here in this country except bullocks and send them over to John Bull.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is Deputy Dillon's philosophy. Wheat growing, he says, is a fraud. Beet growing is a fraud, according to him.  All the new industrial development is a fraud, notwithstanding the fact that other and more sensible members of his Party who make speeches after Deputy Dillon have been very careful to assure the country that they do not propose to make any wild changes in the industrial or agricultural policy that is now being carried out if they are ever returned to office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon treated us to another discourse which was in accord with what he has been saying outside the House: &ldquo;Do not produce anything here but bullocks, and send the bulk of them to John Bull; depend on him to pay; if he does not pay, well and good, we will face up to the famine that follows.  If he wants to apply economic pressure against us, let him apply his economic pressure so long as it pays the farmer to get back to grass; let our work people play in the fields of grass that Deputy Dillon would create here, or pay occasional visits to the round towers to look at the wolf dogs or have a look at the rising sun.&rdquo;  That is Deputy Dillon's conception of the kind of Ireland that we ought to have here.  Of course, Deputy Dillon must know that you have got to pay a price for all that, and the price you pay is to have large numbers of your people idle, unable to obtain any wage at all and unable to pay anything for the articles he speaks of no matter what the price is. Of course, when the Deputy's Party was in office it did not even provide our people with unemployment assistance benefit to buy articles at the low prices he now talks about.</P>

If Deputy Brennan wants to get a picture of agriculture under Cumann na nGaedheal all he has to do is to go down to the library and look up the speeches made by ex-Deputy Baxter and ex-Deputy Heffernan who claimed to represent the agricultural industry in this House.  The picture they painted, so far as agriculture was concerned, was that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was fast turning that big industry into a pauperised industry.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because in some respects it seems to me not to be germane to the motion that we are discussing, though it may be in some respects closely related to it.  I prefer to deal with the motion rather than <Col N="401" /> the curious views to which Deputy Dillon gave utterance in the course of his speech.  This motion was proposed on a previous occasion.  It has been seconded and spoken to by a number of members of the House.  So far, no member of the Government Party has thought fit to support the motion orally in the House, though I am quite sure that many of them feel considerable sympathy with it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, apparently, does the thinking for the Government Party on industrial, economic and social matters, and, apparently, once the Minister has made up his mind that this motion must be opposed then the whole of the Government Party decide to accept his viewpoint not to support the motion and to vote against it.  There was no attempt whatever made by the Minister to contest the reasonableness of the motion, or to show that the claims made in it were in any way unjustified, having regard to existing circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was, in my view, a particularly disappointing one, and if he has since read it I imagine that he cannot be very pleased with it himself.  It was a remarkable speech in some respects, because we get some very important admissions from the Minister.  We have been used to listening to speeches by members of the Government Party that they accept the principle of providing work or maintenance for the unemployed. Now, that speech did service in the last election.  That contention and that philosophy has done service on a number of political platforms since the last election, but the Minister, apparently, has now recanted and has now declared that the Government, while it may try to provide work for the unemployed, does not consider that it is its function to provide a decent standard of maintenance for the unemployed, because we had a very definite declaration by the Minister that these rates of benefit are not intended to provide maintenance for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I think I have never described the rates of unemployment assistance payable as capable of maintaining any unemployed person for a protracted period.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the Minister might look at column 942 as well.  That was also part of the speech, and there he declared:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The unemployment assistance scheme was designed to give a contribution, within the limits that the resources of the State would permit, to each unemployed person, to enable him to maintain himself during temporary unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, temporary unemployment. So that if we take that statement by the Minister, and the following statement which he has quoted himself, we get the clearest possible indication from the Minister that these rates are not maintenance rates.</P>

      <P>Yes, for protracted periods, if the Minister likes.  I will take that phrase in order to get some agreement with the Minister, but who is to provide maintenance for unemployed people during periods of idleness, and does the Minister consider that the rate of 12/6 per week, to maintain a man, his wife, and five children, will provide any Christian standard of maintenance even for a week's unemployment or a fortnight's unemployment?  Surely that man is entitled to be maintained even for a fortnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Minister previously that, according to the findings of the British Medical Association, the minimum expenditure on food required to maintain the barest standard of health for a man, wife and three children, at the cost-of-living scales operative in Great Britain in 1933&mdash;and the index figure there was less than the index figure here&mdash;was £1 3s. 8d. per week; and yet the Minister here offers to a similar family a maximum benefit of 12/6 a week, and even if the family should be seven or eight or nine, instead of five, they will get no higher scale of benefit than 12/6 a week.  Who is to supply the difference between the 12/6 a week, which that family gets under the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the ascertained minimum standard of £1 3s. 8d. per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But who is to provide the difference between 12/6 a week <Col N="404" /> and £1 3s. 8d. a week, the ascertained minimum standard to provide the barest medium of health for a man, wife and three children?  The unemployed, obviously, have a right to expect the Government to provide that standard of maintenance in the absence of any ability on the part of the Government to provide work for the unemployed; but the Minister, apparently, is content with the position whereby these people are expected to try to exist on a scale of benefit measured by 12/6 per week for a man, wife, and five or six or seven or eight children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently, as I said in the beginning, the Minister is probably dissatisfied with the speech he made on the last day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fact remains that if he is not satisfied with the existing rates of benefit, this motion, asking him to increase the rates of benefit, ought to be supported by the Minister and his Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh I shall come to that later.  On the last occasion, the Minister, in some of those reckless moments when he feels that all the righteousness is on his side and all the error on the side of those who disagree with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we will test their sanity.  The Minister on the last occasion said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Norton made most unscrupulous use of the figures relating to the cost-of-living index supplied to him by my Department.  It is not fair to compare the figures for May of one year with those for November of another year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Now, if I compared May with November, it would undoubtedly be unscrupulous, but if the Minister had taken the trouble to read my speech, or even to listen to it, he would have found that I did not compare May with November. I compared only comparable months, and I am going to compare comparable months now again for the enlightenment and edification of the Minister. The Unemployment Assistance Bill was introduced in the Dáil in September, 1933, and at that time the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;the last ascertained cost-of-living index figure&mdash;for food in Saorstát Eireann was 129.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was 129.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  It was 131.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, this is the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> that I have here, and this is the publication that the Minister places all his faith in.  I am quoting from a printed copy of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for December, 1936, setting out in a tabular form the index figures for food, from 1926 to 1936, and the general cost-of-living index figure for the same years; and the figure in respect of Saorstát Eireann is 129 for mid-August, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The figure I quoted was the average for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, of course &ldquo;I am always right.&rdquo; I said mid-August, 1933, and the index figure when the Second Stage of this Bill was being taken in this House was 129.  The Bill was finally passed in the House in October, 1933, and 129 was still the figure operative in that period.  So that, when the Executive Council were considering the question of the rates of benefit to be paid under this Bill, obviously they had regard to the cost of living then ruling, and the cost of living then ruling in respect of food alone was 129&mdash;July, 1914, being the datum point of 100.  To-day, however, the cost of food has risen from 129 in August, 1933, to 145 in August, <Col N="406" /> 1936&mdash;a very substantial rise in the meantime&mdash;or, if we take the November, 1933, figure for food, we find it to be 140; whereas the last index figure for food ascertained by the Department of Industry and Commerce is 155, another very substantial rise in respect of foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If foodstuffs are not accepted by the Minister as playing an important part in the dietary of unemployed people, we can take the general index figure.  In August, 1933, a month before this Bill was read a second time, the general index figure was 149.  In August, 1936, the index figure was 159, a rise of ten points in these three years. If we take November, 1933, we find that the figure was 156 and in November, 1936, we find the figure to be 166. So that no matter whether the Minister chooses to have the matter dealt with from the standpoint of the rise in the cost of food, or the rise in the cost-of-living index figure, in both instances a very sharp upward tendency in the cost of living is manifest in these official figures.  The Minister said on the occasion of his speech on this motion that the cost-of-living index figure here had not risen as sharply as in Great Britain.  The Minister obviously had not his brief with him when he made that statement. In August, 1933, the British cost-of-living index figure was 139 and for the same month it was 149 in the Saorstát, the Saorstát figure, therefore, being ten points higher than the British figure.  For July, 1936, the British figure was 146 and the Free State figure, 159; so that while there was a difference of ten points between the two sets of figures in 1933, there was for July, 1936, a difference of 13 points between the two countries.  If we compare the figure here for November, 1936, with the figure for November, 1936, in Great Britain, we find that the figure for Great Britain is 151 and for the Saorstát, 166, showing a further upward tendency against the Saorstát.  A difference of ten points between the two countries in 1933 has now become a difference of 15 points.  That fact, if the Minister had adverted to it on the last occasion, should have shown him the unwisdom of making statements <Col N="407" /> of that kind which are not supported by the official figures supplied by his own Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not proved that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall prove anything in this connection to an impartial judge in the matter, but I do not hope to prove to the defendant in this case that he is guilty of the misstatements which I have definitely attributed to him.  However, the Minister now has time to examine these figures and the more he examines them the more accurate he will find them.  But, of course, while we are able to show the Minister very definitely from official figures that there has been a substantial increase in the cost of living between 1933 and 1936, and argue that as the reason why the rates of unemployment assistance benefit should be raised, if we were to concentrate specially on certain foodstuffs, the increase in the cost of living would be shown to be even greater than that indicated in the official statistics. When the Unemployment Assistance Act was going through the House in 1933 flour could be bought at 28/- or 29/- per sack.  Flour is now 46/- or 47/- per sack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Or 50/- in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases.  I am quoting a figure of 46/- or 47/- so as to induce the Minister to restrain himself from saying that that figure does not represent the facts of the situation. If we take bread, another staple article of diet among the working class, we find that in 1933 the price of a 2 lb. loaf was 2¼d.  The price of the same loaf to-day is 5¼d., another very substantial rise in the cost of living so far as the working class is concerned. If we examine the position in respect to milk, tea, meat, potatoes and a whole variety of other articles, even the Department's official statistics prove that there has been a substantial upward tendency in the price of all these commodities between 1933 and 1936.  I put it to the Minister that if the Unemployment Assistance Act when introduced took cognisance of the prevailing cost-of-living index <Col N="408" /> figure, and if that cost-of-living index figure has since risen substantially, the logic of the situation demands that the Executive Council should increase the rates of unemployment assistance benefit if for no other reason than that these rates have not the same purchasing power as they were intended to have in 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain class of farmers who have a certain class of produce to sell, but the Minister will <Col N="409" /> surely not contend that the small farmer trying to eke out a livelihood on land which is not suitable for cultivation, or having only a small proportion of suitable land, is compensated, by the higher price for the small quantity of produce he has to sell, for the substantial upward tendency in commodities which he has to buy.  The Minister knows his contention in that respect is utterly fallacious.  I again come back to the point that if the Executive Council acknowledged that the rates of benefit introduced in 1933 were intended to buy a certain quantity of food, then, if those rates of benefit will now buy only a lesser quantity of food, there is a moral obligation on the Executive Council at least to repair the shrunken value in the rates contemplated under the 1933 Act.  If 12/6&mdash;the maximum rate of benefit in rural areas, which include towns with a population of 7,000 and under&mdash;was assumed to buy a certain quantity of food in 1933, then 12/6 will not buy the same quantity of food to-day because of the increase in the cost of food.  In these circumstances, the least the Executive Council should do is repair the shrunken value of the unemployment assistance.  There is a moral case for their doing much more. because in 1933 the rates of benefit were utterly inadequate to provide a decent or Christian standard of maintenance for unemployed people. Endeavouring to resist this motion, the Minister talked about the large sums of money being provided for the relief of unemployment.  While he was making his speech on that point, I could not help wondering if the Minister had not made some very considerable sacrifices by coming into public life at all.  If he had chosen the stage for a career, he would probably be at the top of the bill as a first-class conjurer in the leading music-halls of Europe.</P>

When you get the £2,500,000 away from the language in <Col N="410" /> which the Minister sought to clothe it, and examine what that sum will do, you get a very different result from that represented by the Minister on the last occasion.  Of course, it is not the Government who are giving the £2,500,000 at all.  The local authorities are expected to make a contribution of at least £800,000 towards releasing this sum of £2,500,000.</P>

Portion of that £1,500,000 will have been spent in bringing down the figure from 140,000 to 94,000.  Assuming, however, that it is all there, by dividing 94,000 into £1,500,000 you find that the sum available to sustain an unemployed <Col N="412" /> man and his wife and children is between £15 and £16 a year.</P>

      <P>The Minister did a fair amount of double entry on the last occasion.  When we examine that £2,500,000, we find that it is largely an illusion so far as its capacity to sustain unemployed people over a prolonged period is concerned.  The fact remains that though a substantial portion of the £1,500,000 which was available for wages is already spent, there are still 94,000 unemployed people registered at the labour exchanges. Everybody knows that there has been a substantial tightening-up in the administration of unemployment assistance in such a way as to drag large numbers of these people to the courts of referees to prove that they are genuinely seeking work.  Anybody who knew anything about the circumstances would realise that, in many cases, no work whatever is available in the areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a curious notion of the amount of energy to be put into land.  It is utterly impossible for these people to sustain themselves on the land during the whole year.  In respect of many of them the amount of work the land calls for is pretty small and in any case the holdings are usually so small that it does not require all the available members of the family to look after them.  Proof of that can be found in the fact that, if you start a relief scheme in the area, no matter what the call of the land is on the bread-winner he will work on the relief scheme, through economic pressure, for 21/- or 24/- a week, because he knows he gets a better return than he would out of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the making available of a large sum of money for the relief of unemployment is desirable. In so far as the sum of £2,500,000 puts people into employment, helps to increase public amenities and enrich the national estate, it is all to the <Col N="415" /> good.  But my complaint is that it is not good enough.  It is only giving people an annual subsistence income of £11, £12 or £15 a year, and that is not dealing adequately with the unemployment problem.  For the useful things that have been done in the way of providing work, I have nothing but praise and enthusiasm.  That is very beneficial work, but it is not sufficient; you are not going far enough.  There are still vast numbers of unemployed in respect of whom the Government must recognise it is unable to provide work and if these people are not able to get work by their own efforts or the Government is not able to stimulate industrial or agricultural activity so as to absorb unemployment, then they are entitled to decent scales of maintenance during periods of involuntary idleness.  The Minister said he pulled the unemployment assistance and the unemployment insurance claims down from 144,000 to 94,000.  Everybody knows that is being done by resorting to the ruse of employing people for two, three and four days a week.</P>

      <P>If the Minister says he does not fall on means, that can be tested.  Take the three-day man whom the Minister admitted will definitely be caught.  In that case the man is getting 15/- a week in lieu of the 12/6 he would get by way of unemployment assistance.  The 12/6 would be utterly inadequate to sustain him during periods of unemployment and yet he is being given only 2/6 in addition to the 12/6 he would get as unemployment assistance, to compensate him for the three days' work he has done. Why not give the man six days' work? Why push him off after three days? On these schemes there is work available for men for a whole week.  Why not allow them to work for the whole week?  The reason is obvious.  You want to employ as many people as possible on these schemes so as to pay out to each person as little as possible and spread the distribution of the money over the greatest possible number in order, at the employment exchanges, to bring down the number from 144,000 to 94,000.  Of course that is the way the unemployment assistance figure has been pulled down.</P>

How that philosophy is to be adjusted to the last census figures is another matter.  The Minister declares that there may be more people in employment and more unemployed in a country with a rising population.  That is poor consolation <Col N="417" /> to the unemployed man; it is no comfort to know that the person who happens to be on either side of him is unemployed.  The Minister, in one of his humorous moments on the last occasion, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Deputy Norton wanted to provide a remedy for unemployed persons he should have supplemented his motion with a paragraph in which he would set out the direct taxation which would produce the amount involved.

I do not know what particular increase in taxes the Deputy is prepared to support in order to meet the sum that he is advocating for unemployment assistance.

      <P>I will say it.  On a motion to provide some decent scales of unemployment assistance benefit for these people who are still unemployed, his plan notwithstanding, the Minister <Col N="420" /> says that he must now have a paragraph set out in the motion indicating what taxation we are prepared to support in order to provide these additional rates.  That is the position of the Minister in 1937.  He was much cheerier and more buoyant in 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister wants to use here against us the fact that we opposed a motion by the Minister for Finance assuming an increase in the valuation of working-class houses for the purpose of raking in a bigger income-tax return.  We opposed that motion then because the Minister would not indicate that he would exempt working-class houses from the scope of that curiously conceived proposal.  If the Minister had been prepared to say: &ldquo;Well, in respect of houses normally occupied by the working classes, I will exempt these from the scope of the thing and I will increase it in respect of the houses occupied by the wealthy people,&rdquo; we told him we would vote for the motion if it appeared in that amended form, but the Minister was not prepared to do that.  Is it necessary for the Minister to have a paragraph of the kind indicated?  What about the £2,000,000 which were going to be saved in 1931?  Are they not available to increase the unemployment assistance benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not, because according to the Minister's own contention it is not now costing more than £1,000,000 to the State, as the local authorities are putting up about £300,000, and the total estimate for this year can only be in the vicinity of that.  What about Deputy Cooney's £2,000,000 that he was going to save on the Army, and the Minister's speech at Cahir, I think, in which he indicated that £2,000,000 could be saved without impairing the existing social services?  Surely the Minister ought to have these resources available in order to supplement these scandalously low rates of benefit.  It should not be <Col N="421" /> difficult to get money for this necessary purpose.  I have read frequent speeches by bankers and others in Dublin indicating, apparently, that there is agreement on the part of the Minister and of industrialists, that there is now a considerable wave of prosperity through the country.  If all that prosperity is available why should not portion of it be shared with the most needy section of the community, the unemployed people?  If that prosperity is there, why not rake some of it in and give it to the unemployed who are compelled to exist on such low rates of unemployment assistance benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the healthy condition of industry and to the prosperity that has been achieved in industrial development, while the Minister for Education, at Kilkenny recently, stated that the nation's finances were healthy and prosperous. Although we have all these testimonials to the existence of prosperity, and the declaration by the Minister for Education that the nation's finances are healthy and prosperous, we cannot do any more than provide 12/6 weekly as unemployment assistance benefit for large families.  Yet, with all the prosperity that we hear of, we cannot give the Athy family I mentioned anything more than two-thirds of a penny for a meal.  In my <Col N="422" /> opinion these unemployment assistance rates are now utterly inadequate, comparing the purchasing power of these benefits to-day with their purchasing power in 1933.  As the purchasing power has shrunk considerably in the meantime, the least the Government should do is to repair the shrunken purchasing power of the benefits provided under the Act.  There is a strong case for a substantial improvement, because if the rates were inadequate to maintain a civilised existence in 1933, when they represented the maximum benefit the State could make available, in 1937, when there is so much talk of prosperity, and when we have high tributes paid to the healthy and solvent condition of the national finances, the State should share with the victims of the social system which gives us regular unemployment, some of the prosperity talked about on these occasions.  These rates cannot be justified.  They do not provide a decent standard of subsistence for an unemployed man and his family.  They cannot be justified by reference to any code of State or private conduct.  The Minister ought to accept the motion and agree to the rates being increased, in order to provide some better standard of living for unemployed people than the pauperised standard that thousands are compelled to tolerate to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this motion:</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of the Dáil, the methods of the Government for preserving the Irish language need to be reconsidered and rationalised,</P>
      <P>I feel very much as Daniel must have felt when he entered the lions' den. I do not know any subject that seems to arouse so much concentrated ferocity as this subject of the Irish language among those who take the greatest interest in it, and I approach it as one who, so far, has left all these matters in dispute severely alone.  In addition to the difficulties that I should normally have in dealing with this subject, it has been brought on for discussion much sooner than I expected, and I find myself even more inadequately prepared to do it justice than I should otherwise be.  Owing to the eccentricities in the arrangement of public business, and the continued timidity of Deputy Belton on the subject of the League of Nations, I find myself forced to the front.  I feel that it is one's duty to the House to go on with a motion, if one at all can manage it, when it is on the Order Paper, even if one feels that one would be able to do it more justice with a little further preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent film dealing with the Irish Free State I had the pleasure of seeing the members of the Executive Council portrayed sitting around a table, each man trying to look just a little more statesmanlike than the one next to him, and of hearing an address by the President of the Executive Council upon what this Government was doing for this country.  Not from the address of the president, but from the accompanying comments of the gentleman in charge of the film, I gathered that the present Government had founded the National University and Trinity College and Guinness' Brewery, and perhaps even discovered the Blarney Stone, but I also gathered that they above all others were responsible for what was being done in the matter of the Irish language.  I noted with interest that the argument by which the President justified what was being done for the Irish language was that it was the depository of our ancient culture.  One of the questions that I want to ask the House to consider to-day is whether in fact the Irish language has been so dealt with, <Col N="425" /> either by this Government or the Government that went before it, as to make such Irish culture as is embedded in it accessible to the general public.  Let me say this to begin with, that it would be a fallacy&mdash;as I am sure every member will realise&mdash;to suggest that the Irish language was the sole depository of Irish culture.  A great part&mdash;and I would say the greater part&mdash;of Irish culture is now embedded in the English language, in which for centuries we have been producing from our midst very great writers.  There is in fact a treasury of wisdom, of philosophy, of thought, of imagination, which deserves to be called Irish, that is available in the English language, so that in talking about the Irish language as being the depository of our culture we must not allow ourselves to be led into the fallacy of supposing that it is the sole depository of that culture.</P>
    <P>Let me make a remark which I hope will not be thought offensive, certainly it is not intended to be so in any way. When the Irish language is discussed in this House, it is generally discussed in Irish, and, therefore, a person like myself who has no Gaelic may miss a number of precious sayings that are uttered by other speakers.  I think that is a great pity, but I recognise that that is possible.  It does seem to me, however, that in the speeches made in this House in English by those members of the House who are familiar with the Irish language there might be conveyed to the rest of us and to the general public much more of an idea of Irish culture than is, in fact, conveyed. I often hear in this House quotations in other languages.  Apart from quotations, I constantly hear in this House allusions drawn from the literature of Greece, Rome, England and France. Deputies of various Parties enrich their speeches with images and instances drawn from the literature of various languages.  But I have been five years a member of this House and I have not yet heard a single thing said by any Deputy that illustrated the richness of the Irish language.  I have not heard any happy quotations; I have not heard any happy illustrations or images employed, and I venture to <Col N="426" /> suggest that that is symptomatic of one fundamental defect in the measures that have been taken for the preservation of the Irish language. That defect is that there has been too little regard for scholarship and too little regard for Irish culture.</P>
    <P>Let me make another preliminary observation before I go further along that line.  I think that the lack of clear thinking on this subject of Irish has been largely due to people exciting themselves by catch-words that had better never have been used.  It will not in any way be to the detriment of the true interests of the Irish language if we can get rid of these catch-words once and for all.  One of them is that the language is necessary to the preservation of our national self-consciousness and our national independence.  I believe that to be simply untrue. Instances can be quoted from all over the world where a nation with what we may call for the want of a better expression an &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; language has developed a civilisation and culture of its own and a very full sense of national self-consciousness.  You have, for example, the United States of America where people from all over the world have been brought into a melting pot where they all talk English.  Yet, I venture to say, in many ways an Englishman landing in the United States of America feels that he is in an atmosphere more distinctive and more foreign to him than the atmosphere of many countries of Europe.  Again, in countries like Belgium, Switzerland, and the various Spanish Republics of South America, we have illustrations of a very full sense of national self-consciousness growing up, and a very full determination to preserve national independence growing up, without its being found necessary to have an exclusive and special home language.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there are many nations in the world with languages of their own that have very little to offer in the way of culture.  The possession of a language of their own has not always been a guarantee that the nations which possess it will have a strong feeling of independence. Some people talking about the Irish language would seem to imagine that <Col N="427" /> the surest way to find a cultured and virtuous people would be to go off into the recesses of the African bush and find some tribe which had never been found before, a tribe that had been cut off from any contact with any other country, and that there you would discover a nation that was really worth imitating, a nation that would have a fresh and vigorous culture uncontaminated from outside sources.</P>
    <P>There is another fallacy that I think ought to be disposed of as promptly and thoroughly as possible, and that is that the possession of a special language protects you in some way against the contamination of undesirable ideas and undesirable philosophies.  That again is utterly untrue.  As I pointed out once before in this House, Communism was born in Germany.  It was born in the German language in the works of Karl Marx.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Communism was not prevented by barriers of language from spreading elsewhere.  At the present moment it has less regard and less respect in the country of its origin, perhaps, than in almost any other country.  The very difficult Russian language did not prevent its spreading into Russia.  The difficulties of the Spanish language did not prevent its spreading into Mexico or Spain.  The most difficult language of all, the Chinese language, did not prevent its spreading into China.  A disease like Communism will spread to places where the conditions favour it, where the soil is suitable for it; where there is misery, poverty, want and lack of a Christian spirit among the more well to do and a lack of a determination to get the best possible standard of living for the greatest possible number of the inhabitants of a country.  No amount of cowering behind the language will save this country from Communism or any other &ldquo;ism.&rdquo; The measures necessary to do that are of quite a different order.  I am not saying this for the purpose of proving that nothing should be done for the Irish language.  I am saying all this in order <Col N="428" /> to put an end to the exaggerated claims that are made for it; to the fantastic ideas by which its cause is sometimes supported&mdash;ideas which have the effect of making people anxious to put up a great show in a hurry, and of confusing the Government mind as to the object to be attained, namely, the enrichment of our national life by the preservation and restoration of as much Irish culture as is bound up with the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The first concrete suggestion then that I have to make for reconsideration and rationalisation is that more regard should be had to scholarship, and, as a first step in that direction, I suggest that the Government ought to spend far more money and more effort upon the publication in a worthy form, though not in an expensive form, of Irish classical texts and of English translations of them, making them accessible to all the citizens of this country.  I am informed by people in a position to know that there is much still to be investigated in the Irish language of the past: ancient, middle and classical modern Irish, that there are many literary texts requiring to be edited and important questions of grammar and lexicography to be studied.  I have even been told that we possess no reliable grammar and no reliable dictionary of modern Irish as a whole.  I am informed that there is an immense amount of work to be done in all these fields of Irish scholarship, and I suggest that the Government instead of wasting their efforts on futile and trivial, if not actually harmful, things, like the translation into Irish of English detective stories, should devote their energies to such matters as I have mentioned.  I can hardly think that the work that I have suggested is one which will not appeal to everybody who has the interests of the Irish language at heart, and while I am certainly in no position to pose as an authority on the subject, I can say that five or six of the best Irish scholars in the country have assured me that work of that kind has been deplorably neglected both by the present Government and by its predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as to how much encouragement or opportunity has been given to the scholars for doing anything of the kind, that is a matter that is worthy of investigation. It is not to be supposed that work of that kind can pay for itself.  It is not to be supposed that publications of that kind will be possible unless they are generously financed by whatever Government is in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us go a step further into the teaching of Irish and carry on this idea that scholarship has been too much neglected.  I want to suggest that in secondary schools and universities classical Irish should definitely take precedence of colloquial Irish. There are two ways of learning a language. You can learn it, as a small child most easily learns it, by ear.  A grown up person can also learn it, but far less satisfactorily, by ear.  A man who wanted, shall we say, to be a waiter in a Paris restaurant and knew that he would need four or five languages in order to get the job, could acquire these languages after a fashion by going to a Berlitz school and taking colloquial lessons.  He would not really get a hold of any of the languages. From a literary or cultural point of view, none of the languages would mean anything at all to him.  He probably would not be able to speak any of them well, certainly not if he had learned to speak it from teachers who were not themselves native speakers, but who were people who only had a smattering themselves of the colloquial language.  That is not the road to culture in any language. The road to culture is through scholarship: is through reading the literature that exists in the language that you are studying, and if you are really going to get a hold of a language in a way that will do your mental equipment any good&mdash;and I would even say your moral equipment&mdash;sooner or later the time will come&mdash;you may begin like the small child studying it merely by ear&mdash;when you must go further and study the classics of the language that you are interested in.  Certainly, in the case of people who have not acquired Irish as a language practically native to them in their extreme youth and who do not quite normally, <Col N="430" /> without effort, think in Irish, certainly such boys and girls as those, when they go to a secondary school, would, I suggest, gain far more by studying Irish as they would study Greek, Latin, French or German at school as a special subject, as a cultural subject with an interest in its literature and in all the deposits that history, anthropology and human activity of every kind have left in that language.  I suggest that Irish in secondary schools and universities should be taught by scholars and in a scholarly spirit and that the object should not be to obtain a fluency in a sort of pidgin Irish.</P>

The Deputy has admitted that he has no Gaelic, but naturally the Deputy would not be quite so insolent as to introduce a motion of this kind without having, to the best of his ability, furnished himself with information from those who are real authorities on the Irish language. Let me say that, while I understand Deputy O Briain's impatience at a motion of this kind being introduced by a non-Gaelic speaker, I have waited a very long time for somebody who is a Gaelic speaker to introduce some such motion, and I would willingly have given place to anybody who was so disposed.  I have at least one qualification which is perhaps some compensation for the qualifications I lack, and that is that nothing I say will compromise or injure any political Party.

      <P>There is no reason why I should not make the statement I have made.  The Minister will have his opportunity to comment on it.  I am not attacking any person at all.  I am saying what I consider I have full reason for believing to be true: that in Irish the whole standard of scholarship among teachers at secondary schools and universities is on a lower plane than scholarship among teachers of other languages; that no such standard either of accuracy or of familiarity with the literature and the culture of the language is necessary as is the case with other languages.  There are, of course, brilliant exceptions.  There are some very brilliant men teaching Irish, who are absolutely first-class scholars, but I say that, taking those teaching Irish as a whole, they are not expected to exhibit the same standard of scholarship; and that is all part of what I consider to be the vicious plan <Col N="432" /> of putting the talking of some kind of Irish before everything else.  We all know that great difficulties arise from the number of different kinds of even genuine Irish that exist.  There is ancient Irish.  There is middle Irish. There is the modern classical Irish, and then there is the colloquial Irish of the present day in the differing dialects of Ulster, Munster and Connacht.  In addition to all those, which create great difficulties for what I believe, any way, to be the bad policy of putting colloquy before everything else, there is the new kind of Irish, the Dublin Irish, as they call it in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, if you get the authentic native Irish of the present day, even if you get it from somebody quite illiterate, at any rate you get with it a certain feeling for the Irish language, a certain contact with the past of the country, that you do not get if you pick up a sort of Irish from somebody who is not ether a native speaker or who has not made himself as good as if he were a native speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> Now, let us turn from secondary schools and universities to infant schools and primary schools.  But first, to prevent misunderstanding, let me say that in universities and secondary schools, while I urge that the language should be treated like any other language and approached from the angle of scholarship, I am not claiming that it should be taught by native speakers, necessarily.  A man like Kuno Meyer, for example, would not be a native speaker, but who would be so absurd as to say that it would not have been an enormous advantage and an enormous privilege to learn Irish under him, if one was approaching Irish as a scholarly subject?  Assuming, however, that to the infant and primary schools the approach to Irish is to be different, and colloquial Irish is to be what is to be aimed at, then I suggest that in such schools it should be only taught either by native speakers or by people who are so exceptionally good as to have made themselves as good as native speakers.  I do not know how many such men there are.  I believe there are some.  For example, Mr. Seán O Cuiv, of the Government Bureau of Information, is one such, and I suppose there are others; but I do suggest that in those infant and primary schools only such men should teach Irish.  What does that involve? It involves that the person who teaches Irish should be a specialist who is not required to teach other subjects.  He need not necessarily be a national teacher at all.  If he is teaching only Irish, he will be able to serve two or three schools instead of only one school, and the other subjects taught in these schools will be taught by the national teachers.</P>
    <P>In that way you will have Irish taught in the way that it deserves to be taught, by real experts, and you will not be forcing the unfortunate teachers of other subjects, the national teachers, to devote time they cannot spare, if they are to be good teachers of other subjects, to the acquisition of colloquial Irish.  Whether, however, there are enough native speakers and enough people as good as native speakers to go around for the purpose I have mentioned, I am not qualified to say, but, assuming that there are not, I <Col N="434" /> would urge that Irish should only be compulsory, in so far as they are available.</P>
    <P>The next point I have to suggest is that the policy of teaching other subjects through the medium of Irish should be definitely abandoned outside the Gaeltacht or places where Irish is the home-language of the children.  I know that that is a matter that has already aroused great feeling, but it has aroused feeling not only on one side.  There are two classes of people who have been actively complaining of the present system.  One is those who are concerned with education and who have had experience of the evil results of the teaching of subjects through bad Irish, by people who do not know it properly, to children who do not know it properly.  Besides the educationists there are the parents, and I have been in contact with parents just as I have been in contact with Irish scholars, and I think there are few Deputies who do not know how widespread is the discontent of parents with this system of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish in places where the conditions&mdash;the only conditions that, educationally, could make it sound&mdash;are not present.</P>
    <P>What is the result?  The result is simply to tie a millstone, educationally, around the necks of those unfortunate children; to befog them, to cloud their minds, to put a premium on what is vague and slipshod.  Heaven knows, if there is anything in education that we specially need in this country, it is to glorify clarity and accuracy.  If the Minister had at heart the true educational interests of the young people of this country, I am quite sure that there is nothing he should more speedily and more certainly do than abolish this system of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish where the proper conditions are not in existence.  The view I have is that, so far from the present Irish policy promoting the interests and the spread of Irish culture, as indicated by the President in that talking picture of which I spoke, its tendency is to cause people to be illiterate in two languages, instead of cultured and literate even in one.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry if anything I have <Col N="435" /> said has aroused feelings.  It was not intended to do so.  I am far from wishing to make a personal attack on anybody connected with the teaching of Irish.  For everything that I have said I have what I feel to be good warrant and everything I have said I do sincerely believe.</P>
    <P>Let me mention, in conclusion, just one more consideration that I would ask this Government, and any other Government too, to bear in mind in their Irish language policy&mdash;do not let us forget the North.  Do not overdo this business of Gaelicisation.  By all means, have the storehouse there for all who can take advantage of it, but do not forget to think of Ireland as a unit as surely we must all think of it.  Do not let us do something contrary to the real interests of Ireland by setting up an additional barrier between the million and the three million whom we wish to weld into one people.  If we do keep that consideration in mind, surely it would be wise, as I think it is wise even apart from that consideration, not to make Irish compulsory in the Civil Service and in the professions.  My suggestion would be to secure that a proportion of the people in the Civil Service and in the professions should be Irish speakers, to make sure that the parts of this country where Irish really is the natural language should be fully served by the existence of such Irish-speaking officials as are necessary.  It would be quite possible to have Irish as a compulsory subject in schools and universities and yet not bother officials with it later in life in the middle of their professions.  You should not, I suggest, do as is being done at present, start off new schemes in order to pester civil servants with additional tests and examinations in Irish at a later stage in their career.</P>

      <P>There has been a commission recently appointed for that purpose&mdash;to see how civil servants are to be further pressed into the use of the Irish language.  To my mind, and I am sure to the mind of anybody who <Col N="436" /> is free from prejudice, the Irish language is already too much used by the Civil Service, too much used because it is a sham, because it is used when it is inappropriate and in dealing with persons who do not understand it.  I detest shams and pretentiousness.  I would use the Irish language for official purposes just so far as it is really natural to use it, just so far as it is really valuable to the people affected by it, but this business of sending out acknowledgments and cards from Departments in Irish to people who do not understand the language, this business of beginning letters with a few words of Gaelic and ending them with a few words of Gaelic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion, and I shall give way to any member of the Government Party who wishes to speak now if the Minister has not made other arrangements.  In seconding the motion, I want to define exactly what I mean by the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; in the motion. &ldquo;Rational&rdquo; may be translated as &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or the exercise of common sense in a reasonable way.  It is my submission to the House that the teaching of Irish at the present day in the national schools and also in the secondary schools, is neither rational nor a common sense method of furthering the best interests of the language. I have on more than one occasion&mdash; perhaps on two occasions&mdash;when the Minister's Vote was under discussion in this House, called the attention of the Minister and the Government to the fact that it was my belief&mdash;and it is a belief generally shared by the members of the teaching profession&mdash;that the co-operation of parents and guardians was a wonderful asset to the teachers in nearly all subjects which they taught in the national schools and many secondary schools.  How can the Minister for Education expect co-operation <Col N="437" /> from the parents at the present moment when the parents themselves do not know the Irish language? It is a fact that even the first book that the young student handles is in Irish, and as he proceeds through the various stages the text-books are all in Irish.  Again, other subjects which he takes up at a later stage are taught through the medium of Irish. Instead of turning out an educated working class&mdash;I propose to deal with that section of the community first&mdash;we are turning out a number of half-illiterate boys from these schools.</P>
      <P>No blame can be laid at the door of the national teacher.  He is doing his best under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  The teachers to-day have not that co-operation that they had before the Irish language was made compulsory.  I challenge contradiction on this, that when the boy or girl of tender years brings home a text-book and begins to do some home exercise, the parent who has no knowledge of Irish cannot correct the child's exercise.  That is a matter which, I think, the Minister should take seriously into consideration in the future when he is helping to direct the policy of the Government in regard to the teaching of Irish.</P>
      <P>National teachers and other teachers are naturally timorous in reporting adversely on the effect the teaching of Irish has on their pupils, because the over-zeal perhaps of some inspector, over-zeal in the direction of teaching Irish, may result in that teacher getting very low marks.  A highly efficient teacher might easily be relegated to the non-efficient or merely efficient class, and for that reason alone, if not for others, the present methods adopted and sponsored, not alone by the present Government but by the previous Government, are not having a good effect on the education of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy MacDermot, I did not anticipate this motion would come on to-night, and, therefore, I suffer from a slight handicap.  I had cuttings from the reports of several of our public schools, made by headmasters, etc., and while most of the headmasters agree that they will do their <Col N="438" /> best to further the Irish language, many of them complain of the handicap which it places on many of their pupils.  It so happens that I came across, quite accidentally, an article by a well-known educationist in the City of Dublin, a man who has had considerable experience in teaching in the national schools all over the country and who, by the way, is a strong advocate of the Irish language.  Speaking of the teachers' responsibility, and also speaking of the help that might be expected from parents and guardians &mdash;if not the help, at least the great effect it would have on the policy of education generally&mdash;he pointed out in this article that visitors from overseas, who take an interest in education, are always surprised at the indifference shown by Irish parents to the work done in the primary schools. That is the opening sentence in this article, and can anybody wonder at the indifference which Irish parents show in the work of the primary schools when they cannot follow the studies of the children?</P>
    <P>Further on he says: &ldquo;The old proverb that those who pay the piper should call the tune has neither force nor application in Ireland so far as education is concerned.&rdquo; In relation to that paragraph, I understood when compulsory Irish was introduced under the régime of Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President of the Executive Council, that parents or guardians could, if they were organised, make representations to the Minister, and the programme of teaching Irish might be varied in accordance with the wishes of the parents or guardians. How far that is true I do not know, but I was informed to that effect some years ago by a teacher in one of the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This article goes on to say: &ldquo;Through the apathy of parents, a junta of Government officials has assumed a control of education that even Hitler might well envy.&rdquo;  He goes on to say: &ldquo;This official coterie has arrogated to itself the right to determine the whole school curriculum without any regard to the opinions of either parents or teachers.&rdquo;  I do not propose to quote much further, but I think it is quite proper that I should make at least one <Col N="439" /> quotation, as it deals particularly with the teaching of the Irish language.  He speaks of the labels attached to certain subjects&mdash;&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo;&ldquo;Very Good,&rdquo;&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;&ldquo;Fair,&rdquo;&ldquo;Bad&rdquo;&mdash; and those personal to the teacher such as &ldquo;Highly efficient,&rdquo;&ldquo;Efficient,&rdquo;&ldquo;Non-efficient,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Six months' notice,&rdquo; and he goes on to deal with the teaching of the Irish language.  He refers to some inspector who comes along to inspect the school, and he says: &ldquo;His accent and phraseology, especially in Irish, may be strange and unfamiliar, his manner and address will certainly be that of one &lsquo;drest in a brief authority.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting an article by Mr. Quinn, an ex-national teacher, a well-known educationist in the City of Dublin.  The statements Mr. Quinn sets forth in that article cannot be denied or challenged.  That is a feeling generally shared and, perhaps, more widely shared throughout the country than the Minister is aware of. Examine the position of the boy or girl who leaves a national school. After all, the national school is regarded as the poor man's university. What happens?  After all these years of effort, and indeed over-effort on the part of the Gaelic League, and the efforts of the Government, what have we done?  The mountain in labour hath brought forth a mouse!  We find that these boys and girls who are lucky enough to get into employment after leaving the national school and whose time, in my view, has been partly wasted&mdash;I do not say wholly wasted, because I am a believe in bi-lingual education&mdash;enter into some occupation outside and from the moment they leave the school they never use one word of Irish with, perhaps, the exception of something they will pick up in later years in the street and which may not be good for either their souls or their bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be as well aware of those facts as I am.  He must be aware that many thousands of boys and girls leave the schools and, surely, after all these years of effort and the <Col N="440" /> relatively huge sums of money spent on the teaching of Irish, better results than we have experienced so far should have been brought about.  I have said that it is not the language of the home, and under the present system of &mdash;I cannot say fostering the Irish language, because I believe it is doing injury to the language; but under the present system of teaching the Irish language I very much fear that most of the money spent on education, roughly, £4,000,000 per annum, will be wasted.  I am given to understand that almost one-fourth of the school week is devoted to the study of Irish. I calculate it is something more than one-fourth of the week, because, now that most of those subjects are taught through the medium of Irish, I would certainly say that more than half the week is used up by the teaching of Irish.</P>
    <P>So far, the results have not justified the huge expenditure of money.  If there is any doubt about that, why is it that we have the Gaelic League collecting on the streets and having flag-days? One would have thought that all the money expended by the Government would make it unnecessary for the Gaelic League to make these public collections on St. Patrick's Day and perhaps on other occasions, too.</P>
    <P>One more word before I sit down. Many parents have come to me and have informed me that their children were frightfully backward.  They wanted to put them out to business.  It was the parents' considered opinion that when they themselves were 13 or 14 years of age they were streets ahead of their own children in education at that age, the thing out of which they were to get their bread and butter in after life.  Many of the persons who share my views do not make themselves vocal because they fear if they did they would be labelled as anti-Irish, Imperialistic or something of that kind. We are a wonderful people for putting tags on our political opponents.  It is because many of these people have not the moral courage to stand up against a noisy few that they allowed the opportunity to pass when they should have exercised their authority as parents in refusing to allow any Government Department to dictate to them <Col N="441" /> as to the way their children should be taught.  In saying that I do not mean that they should dictate to the teachers whether they were to teach mathematics or English or the other subjects, but I do certainly say that this policy of ramming Irish down the throats of these children at the present time is neither good for the language nor for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the fact that the discussion has been so disappointing is accounted for by the fact that, as Deputy MacDermot pointed out, he was rather taken at a disadvantage.  I must say that I have not been taken at a disadvantage because the arguments that I have heard from Deputy MacDermot this evening are simply a rehash of arguments we have read in the newspapers for the past year or two.  If these arguments were the arguments of persons with qualifications to speak on the subject of modern language teaching, or with experience of the work that is being done in our secondary schools at present, or with anything to show that they themselves were qualified to deal with this question of teaching through the medium of Irish, one would concede that the matter merited consideration.</P>
      <P>But I submit to the House that no evidence whatever has been produced to show that there is any foundation for the statements that have been made&mdash;very foolish statements calculated to create a good deal of damage to the Irish language movement, which is in urgent need of all the aid it can get.  Why these particular gentlemen, who tell us they are interested in Irish, come out to attack one aspect of the Government's policy, not alone of this Government but of the last Government, which has been notably successful, that is teaching through Irish in the secondary schools, is quite beyond me to understand.  In this country we have the reputation of being rather violent critics and when we take a dislike to a policy, or when we feel it is not right, we sometimes go beyond what is fair and reasonable. But I do not think that any public matter of importance has been treated in the same haphazard fashion or subjected to the same ignorant or unfounded criticism; not even a proper understanding of the position in our schools at present has been evinced by some of these critics in the daily newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Deputy started off by telling us that he hates shams, that he hates pretentiousness, and that what we want is clear thinking.  There is <Col N="448" /> no want of clear thinking in regard to the Government's policy about Irish either now or at any time during the past ten years.  We are not out to teach Irish as a literary subject in the schools; we are out to make Irish the living, spoken language of this country; and the sooner these people who criticise methods, because they have a kind of romantic affection for old Irish, a romantic affection for Irish as a literary or academic subject, but no appreciation apparently of the tremendous difficulties that face us in bringing this language, which has not been in general use for a couple of hundred of years, up to the necessary standard to enable us to do all our work, all our business, and carry on our affairs through it, realise that the better.</P>
    <P>Why is it this question is tackled as if Irish were merely a literary and academic subject, as if it were merely a question of carrying on the study of old Irish or of the old Irish Sagas? The question is one of reviving the Irish language as a spoken language, and we are not alone in our belief that the proper place to begin with the revival of the Irish language as a spoken language is in our schools.  The Commission on Welsh education which sat in 1929 reported also that in their view the key to the whole position for the maintenance of the Welsh language was in the elementary schools, and whether we completely agree or not with those who put the present programme into operation, we have to admit that it is reasonable and it is common sense to suggest and to carry out a policy based upon the plan of teaching the children first to have a good fluent knowledge of Irish.  That is what we are trying to do in our infant schools.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that subjects are being taught through Irish to infants.  That is not so.  The sole object is to teach infants the Irish language, and anything in the way of a subject that is being taught is being taught purely as in the case of elementary ideas of number or location, because it is necessary in language training.  The earlier we get our children to study the language, the more effective, in my opinion, and the more <Col N="449" /> useful it will be to them, and the more fluent they will become.  Those who have been in a position to give special training to their own children in languages will agree that the earlier a child is taught, the better, the more quickly, and the more easily he or she will absorb the language.  The policy has been very successful in spite of the fact that we have a large number of teachers who not alone are not native speakers of Irish, but who are actually, under the arrangements that were brought into operation in 1922, where they are over a certain age, exempted from the necessity of getting qualifications in Irish, let alone teaching through Irish.  Yet, still we have a constant campaign in the newspapers, carried into this House to-day, on the entirely misleading and wrongful assumption that somebody is forcing teachers, who are quite incapable of teaching through Irish, or even of teaching Irish, because they have not sufficient knowledge of it, to do something impossible.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot almost repeated here the ridiculous misrepresentation that a professor of the National University used in public outside&mdash; encouraging teachers whose Irish is far from perfect to teach subjects in Irish to pupils whose Irish is worse. I have stated to-day again in reply to Deputy MacDermot, that where teachers have not the qualifications to teach through Irish they are not asked to teach through Irish; that even in the infant schools they are not asked to teach through Irish where it is clear that they have not the requisite qualifications.  If that were not sufficient, I have two circulars here which I need not worry the House to read except to clarify the position, one of them issued in 1931 and the other, at my request, quite recently in 1936, both calling attention to the fact that before a teacher undertakes to give instruction in Irish he should be satisfied, and the inspectors of the Department of Education should be satisfied, that he is capable of teaching through that medium.</P>
    <P>The first circular states: &ldquo;Where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish and where the children can <Col N="450" /> assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.  When these conditions do not exist, such teaching through Irish is not obligatory.&rdquo; In the recent circular we stated: &ldquo;With regard to the teaching of Irish, there is reason to think that more time is being given to reading and writing than the pupils' progress in speaking the language warrants.  The Department wishes to point out that the main purpose of the teaching, particularly in the lower standards, is to secure that the pupils speak the language freely and fluently.  In regard to the question of teaching through the medium of Irish, it is considered necessary to draw inspectors' attention to the circular of July, 1931, dealing with this question and particularly to the warning it contains against using Irish as a teaching medium in schools or classes where the conditions set out in the circular as necessary for the success of such teaching are not present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be absolutely impracticable for us to staff our schools completely with native-speaking teachers.  We are endeavouring to get a very large percentage of native-speaking teachers.  I wonder is it demanded, with regard to other subjects, either in the ordinary or in the secondary schools, that the teachers of languages should be specialists. Deputy MacDermot, in my opinion, insulted the Irish secondary teachers here this evening in a most unjustifiable way.  I say that if the Irish revival ever succeeds it is the secondary schools in the Irish Free State, who have been teaching through Irish, are primarily responsible and to them the credit is due.  I think it is a sorry state of affairs that in the chief Assembly of the country those teachers, who have been shouldering the burden of the Irish language, while others have been screaming in the newspapers and doing nothing whatever about Irish, should be attacked in this way, and told that their qualifications and their standard of culture are not as good as those of other teachers.  If their standard of culture is not as good as the standard of others, then I say it must be the standard of <Col N="451" /> the university from which the critics of the teaching of Irish have come is wrong, and that these gentlemen in the university should look to their own position.</P>
    <P>The teaching of Irish has been successful in our secondary schools, because a very large number of them&mdash;I think over 202 out of 300&mdash;have accepted the principle that teaching through Irish is right and has proved sound educationally.  Nobody has forced them to do it.  Nobody has dragooned them into doing it.  True enough, they have been encouraged by the Department who adopt that policy, but I challenge here now any case where any pressure was brought to bear on a secondary school manager to adopt this policy. The secondary schools are under private control.  They can have Irish or not, as they wish.  Certainly, as long as I am Minister for Education, I will see&mdash;and I have seen&mdash;that a school that refuses to put Irish on its programme as an ordinary subject will not get a Government grant.  We have not compelled secondary schools, nor would we be in a position to do so if we tried, to teach through Irish.  The imputation is that teachers teaching Irish, at least some of them, in these schools are not capable of doing so; first and foremost, that the secondary schools are playing fast and loose, are not acting up to the right standard of conduct and honour, but are drawing money from the Government for doing certain work which they are not doing, and that, in addition, they are doing damage to education in this country by permitting people to teach through the Irish they know&mdash;because if people in the university know it, then the headmasters in the schools ought to know it&mdash;who apparently are not capable because they have not the same cultural attainments as the teachers of other languages.</P>
    <P>I would like a single title of proof to show that the teachers of Irish are not as good as regards academic qualifications and general culture as teachers of Greek, Latin, German and French. Of all the teachers on the register 50 per cent.  possess university degrees of some kind, and 21 per cent.  possess honours degrees.  Of the teachers who <Col N="452" /> qualified last year for teaching through Irish 65 per cent.  possess university degrees of some kind and 37 per cent. possess honours degrees, all I suppose from the National University.  Yet we are told that these people have not proper cultural standards to do this work.  I say God help us if we were depending for the revival of the Irish language on scholars who seldom seem to produce a work, and who if spoken to in the language in which they profess to be specialists are unable to carry on a conversation in it.  You might as well try to build up a country's foreign trade on a mathematical inflection as to talk of the recovery of the national language through lexicography and grammar.  No doubt these things are very important, but it is an extraordinary thing that it is only now, when the secondary schools are sending to the universities every year large numbers of students who have done their entire secondary school course through Irish, and who naturally expect that the universities should be able to provide the same facilities, that we hear this talk of scholarship.  When I became Minister for Education I told a professor in the National University that if he put any proposals before me by which the graduates of the National University could undertake original research work I would recommend it to the Government.  Nothing came of it. Surely if there are questions of scholarship it is the university authorities in the first instance are concerned. It is the universities should keep up the standard of scholarship and pure research in this country.  It is not for the Government to approach the universities, although they are quite prepared to do so.  I have given an example.  If the universities at any time come to us about aid for research and pure scholarship I am sure the Government will consider the matter very carefully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the secondary schools, there is a conflict of opinion between those like myself, the two Governments we have had in the Free State, and the vast majority of Deputies who stand for the policy of restoring Irish and making it a living language in ordinary use, and another <Col N="453" /> body of opinion tha, regards Irish as an academic subject, one for which they have a romantic affection, and would like to keep in touch.  They have an altogether different conception of the problem from what we have, and when they tell us that we have not clear ideas we realise that it is they who are not clear.  We have the feeling when we educate through the medium of Irish, and on other aspects of the educational policy regarding Irish, that there is a lack of conviction behind them, which apparently arises from the fact that they cannot understand the policy&mdash;having no sympathy with it&mdash;of making Irish a living language in the ordinary sense. Had there been a charge made against the Government in this debate of failure to take adequate steps to ensure the success of the Irish revival in other directions, I would have listened to it almost with pleasure, but I wonder what is wrong with this country and what is wrong with our people, when the only interest that seems to be taken by the public&mdash;by those like Deputy MacDermot who profess to speak for culture and enlightenment and so on&mdash;when the only thing they can say about the Irish language revival is that it is altogether mistaken, that it is, as the Deputy said, &ldquo;a vicious plan.&rdquo;  They would have us go back to the position where Irish would be a subject in the school programme.  We are not going back to that position.  There may be things in the present position with which we are not satisfied.  We are in a transition stage.  We are making allowance for the fact that this language has not been used, for purposes for which it is now sought to utilise it, for a couple of hundred years.</P>
    <P>We have the position that we have only a very small territory of native Irish speakers in this country.  The position is not, as Deputy MacDermot would have us believe, that the professions and the civil servants are being compelled to learn Irish.  Irish is indeed compulsory for the civil servants who are now entering, but in regard to the professions nothing could be further from the truth than the suggestion <Col N="454" /> that they are being forced to learn Irish.  In some of their entrance examinations they may have to do a small amount of Irish.  But what is that?</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have no complaints from the poor people of this country, the people who send their children to those national schools where Dublin Irish is spoken.  Why, if Deputy MacDermot spoke English in some of those schools they would hardly understand him.  Apparently he is not acquainted with the English that is spoken in some parts of Dublin, or if he were down in Galway he would find there still an Elizabethan accent.  The Deputy would not be at all satisfied with the kind of English we have in this country, and why should he, when it is not English at all, but half Irish? I was going to say that it is extremely significant that we have no complaints from the poor people who are subscribing money to try to get their children down to the Gaeltacht; who have to buy a double supply of books, books in Irish as well as in English, at a high cost, and to whom is being preached every day by the critics of Irish this doctrine that Irish is a terrible mistake, a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Their children, according to Deputy Anthony, are going to grow up illiterate.  Those poor people have no fault to find.  They are prepared to fall in with the national policy.  Their instincts tell them that it is right that Ireland, an old Mother Country, should have a language and a culture of her own.  They see in that language not merely a vehicle of speech but the depository of our national aspirations and traditions.  Everything that was bound up with the lives of our people for thousands of years is in that language.  It is not merely the words of the language, the vocabulary, that we have in mind; it is everything that is connoted by the language that we have in mind when we say that we want to revive it.  But the intelligentsia in the National University would like, perhaps, to keep a certain distance between themselves and this Dublin Irish or even the Irish of Connemara.  Perhaps there is at the back of their minds the idea that this <Col N="455" /> language of peasants and fishermen is not good enough for them.  A language in which, according to Eugene O'Curry, up to the year 1600 every Irish priest and scholar was trained, in which every Irish priest and scholar got his full education, is not good enough for those gentlemen, and cannot be used for modern purposes.</P>
    <P>We are keen, also, a Chinn Comhairle, on Irish in the secondary schools, because it is from the secondary schools that our educated classes of the future will come&mdash;our professional classes.  Although nothing much is being done at present to make those classes Gaelic speaking after they leave the schools, nevertheless I think those who are really interested in the Irish revival must appreciate that it is true to say that the revival of Irish as a medium of intercourse between educated persons depends upon the continuation and extension of instruction through Irish in the secondary schools.  It is not because we learned English as a subject at school that we have become fluent speakers of English, able to talk on a great variety of matters; it is because our whole schooling was conducted through the medium of the English language.  We believe that the instruction through the medium of Irish is good educationally and is good nationally.  We believe also that it gives the Irish language a prestige and a position in the eyes of the pupils that it can never have while it is taught as an ordinary subject.  When the pupils see that Irish can be used for the ordinary business of life, the ordinary work of the school, when they see that history and geography and such subjects can be taught and discussed through its medium, they realise that Irish is a very different thing indeed from Irish as it was taught to us older people when we were at school.</P>
    <P>In any event, we have, by some means or other, to bring back the Irish language to ordinary use.  The pity of it is that while so little is being done in other directions, the schools and the teachers&mdash;who are bearing the whole burden of this tremendous work, the like of which, <Col N="456" /> I suppose, is not being done in any other country&mdash;are to be subjected apparently to this constant criticism. If we compare those secondary schools, their results and the work that is being done in them, with the work that was being done there before the task of restoring Irish was put upon them, I think I can venture to say that we will find there has been an enormous improvement, an enormous raising in the standard of education in those schools.  Similarly, if we compare the schools in which work is being done through Irish, either wholly or partially, with the schools in which it is not, I think we need have no fears but that the schools where Irish is being used as a medium of instruction will bear favourable comparison with the others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to the problem of the parents helping the child.  That problem affects other subjects as well as Irish.  A great many teachers would prefer that parents should avoid assisting the children, even when they think they are able to do so.  As you, a Chinn Comhairle, and I know, having had some experience of the matter, it is not by any means important to the pupils' work that the parents should have a hand in it.  Even in the case of mathematics&mdash;where the parent might think that he, as a child, was far in advance of what his son or daughter is learning at the present time at the same age&mdash;when the parent tries to help it is not always a success, because the methods may have changed, and the parent may not alone be wasting time but actually teaching the child wrong methods altogether, methods that have been dropped.  The same is obviously true in regard to Irish.  Are we to take up the position with regard to Irish that we are to wait until the parents know Irish?  How is that going to happen?  Apparently, the most we can hope for in the present generation is that the pupils now attending school, when they grow up, will at least have a knowledge of Irish sufficient to instruct their children, and perhaps to have Irish spoken at home.</P>
    <P>In the same way in regard to teaching <Col N="457" /> through Irish, are we simply to make no effort to teach through Irish? Are those critics so much against the principle of teaching through Irish that they would have no teaching through its medium?  If they concede that there must be some teaching through Irish, having regard to the fact that it is the intention to use Irish for the ordinary business of life when the pupils leave school, then it is only a question of degree.  We may be going too rapidly, or we may be going too slowly, but I have given the House a sufficient indication from the official circulars&mdash;and I could quote further from the report of the National Programme Conference of 1926&mdash;to show that, while the aim has been to make Irish the language of the schools, care has been taken to point out the dangers of going too fast; care has been taken to warn teachers against undertaking tasks which they are unable to carry out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that such an important subject as education in this country should get so many hard knocks.  We have heard the Minister to-day railing against members of the National University and objecting to criticism in newspapers and objecting to speakers of various kinds criticising in some way or another some aspect of the Irish language policy.  I think if we had a little more opportunity for generally reviewing the whole position of education in the country and the position of the Irish language in relation to it, that we would be able to rise above the various irritations that arise.  I remember when the Primary Programme Conference of 1925 was in session, even then across the general policy of education in this country all kinds of grievances were thrown. There were representatives of the teachers there who did not help the Conference in the way they should, because they were fighting against a particular type of inspectorate to which they objected.  In some respects that particular Conference was deprived of the best advice it could have got from the teachers because the teachers' representatives were fighting a policy of their own.  Now the position of <Col N="458" /> Irish in the primary schools is not going to be looked at calmly and efficiently and with the specialist outlook that one would expect from the inspectors, the Department of Education, and even the teachers because of certain alleged haphazard and ignorant criticism in the country.  Nor are the results of the policy of teaching through the medium of Irish in the secondary schools going to be looked at in a reasonable kind of way simply because somebody in the National University has some criticism to make of these results.  The Minister suggested that it would give him a certain amount of pleasure if the charge could be made against the Ministry of not having taken adequate steps in connection with the use of Irish in the schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has referred to the case of the Welsh language, and quoted some statement from a Welsh authority that the key to the whole situation is in the schools.  Well, the Welsh language in relation to Welsh life, from my experience of it, stands in a very different relation to the Irish language in any of the eastern counties or in the City of Dublin and even in Cork City.  If serious progress is going to be made in restoring Irish as the <Col N="459" /> spoken language amongst the people, then the Minister has not only to look at the work in the schools but he has also to look a little outside it.</P>
      <P>I speak from an amount of experience arising from my contact with people in the City of Dublin who are bringing up Irish-speaking families. The Minister, I think, would be well advised to get closer down to the situation which exists to a considerable volume, I should say, in Dublin. The work of teaching through the medium of Irish in the infant schools and the primary schools, and the work done entirely through the medium of Irish in certain national schools throughout the City of Dublin and the work being done in the secondary schools throughout the city has gone on for quite a number of years and it has arrived at a stage now at which I think it should be looked at carefully. I want to make a few suggestions to the Minister.  I would suggest that he would now take and examine them free from the fret and irritation that he seems to show to certain types of criticism.  A lot of that criticism is not worth bothering about.  The Minister has a certain amount of confidence in the work that is being done.  He has a certain amount of confidence in the general outlook of the Department on the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have told us that there is not any Party in this House that do not stand for the restoration, at the earliest possible moment, in a direct way and in the most complete way, of the Irish as the spoken language of this country, so that his <i>morale</i> can be absolutely perfect.  He has a very efficient machine.  Do not let him be afraid of the position.  My experience comes from being in touch with a number of families who are bringing up their children as Irish speakers. Some points of that experience are worth pointing out; first, they have been people who from the beginning in most cases were able to get Irish-speaking girls into their houses to look after their children as servants or nurses.  They were able to adopt as a condition in the house that one of the parents would systematically <Col N="460" /> use Irish when speaking to the children at all times and that the other parent would speak English.</P>
    <P>A group of them came together a long time ago and they asked that a special primary school should be set up that, without any faltering from the start, would give primary education to their children.  Scoil Muire was set up for the girls in Marlborough Street and a few years after Scoil Columbkille for boys.  Scoil Brighide had been in operation a few years before that with a definite kind of connection with University College. It was intended in the beginning and thought it was the most satisfactory and scientific thing to do to retain Scoil Muire as a girls' school in Marlborough Street for children coming to the primary school with what I would call pre-school Irish, at any rate with Irish spoken in the homes.  Principally through the operation of the officials of the Department of Education and the teachers that idea was broken from and children were admitted to Scoil Muire without Irish. In that school adequate primary education was given through the medium of Irish, and English was taught as a separate language.  In my opinion, the standard of work done as primary education through the medium of Irish was lowered by admitting to that school children who had no Irish in their homes.  However, that experiment was gone ahead with and was rather successfully carried out.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the argument on the part of the officials in the Department of Education that, at that moment, it was well to give the children of parents who were satisfied that their children should receive their primary education entirely through the medium of Irish, the advantage of associating in their classes with children who had Irish in their homes.  That school developed and very good work was done in it.  I do not think that any criticism can be levelled at the work that was done in Scoil Muire.  A development took place in which it was necessary to set up a separate infant school on the understanding that no infants would be taken in the preparatory classes at <Col N="461" /> Scoil Muire except they were up to the standard in Irish.  That school has been there for a number of years, and I think it has been most successful. The same cannot be said with regard to the boys' school, and I blame the Department of Education for want of supervision over the boys' school in Marlborough Street.</P>
    <P>Passing then to the secondary schools, there are secondary schools in the city where excellent work is being done through the medium of Irish. The Minister spoke of the work that is being done by the secondary school teachers.  I do not know that the people of this country ever will appreciate the type, standard and magnificence of the work that has been done by secondary school teachers throughout the country teaching through the medium of Irish.  Some of them have been writing their own text books in certain convents and colleges with the assistance of native Irish speakers who have been brought to these schools and at the same time are getting their education in them.  The Minister will admit that, while such excellent work is being done, secondary schools do labour under a certain disability in giving a substantial part of secondary education through the medium of Irish because of the lack of text books, and because of the fact that, in a large percentage of the secondary schools, the teachers are by dint of a fierce, hard struggle only giving themselves the necessary linguistic qualifications to deal with their work at the same time as their teaching.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke disparagingly of grammar.  I think that if he were to inquire into the position in the secondary schools he would find that one of the things militating against them in their work is the fact that children coming to them, even from primary schools where they have got a good knowledge of Irish and a considerable amount of linguistic qualification in the use of Irish, are at the same time utterly unequipped with any knowledge of grammar.  These pupils then find themselves in secondary schools facing the study of French and Latin and say, a literary knowledge of Irish <Col N="462" /> without the necessary qualification for an easy approach to that work that an elementary knowledge of grammar necessitates.</P>
    <P>There is a point there to be reviewed and considered by the Department of Education.  Again, when the Minister does find criticism on the part of university authorities as to the linguistic power, through the medium of Irish, in students coming to the universities from the secondary schools, surely that is a position that can be sympathetically looked at and examined. I asked the Minister before why it was that representatives of the universities, of the Department of Education and of the secondary schools could not come together as a private committee, work privately, exchange their ideas without any unnecessary publication, advise the Minister privately, and look at the difficulties that are complained of by the university authorities with regard to the secondary school pupils that are going to the university to-day.  I know children who have, in a way, broken down in their work in the secondary schools through the medium of Irish because of a want of a sound grammatical training, or a want of any grammatical training in some Irish-speaking school.  I know children who have broken down in secondary schools by reason of the fact that although the schools were &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools the language of recreation in them was not Irish.  I think that if the Minister is really appreciative of what the secondary schools stand for in relation to the Irish language, he will have a critical examination made of the atmosphere that surrounds secondary schools in which education is given through the medium of Irish, and will be very critical if he finds that English is the language in use during recreation in them.  If it is, it is going to militate tremendously against the work of the teachers in those schools, because it is going to deprive the students, to a very large extent, of the value of the qualification for speaking Irish, naturally and fluently, over the range of subjects that a secondary education usually covers.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly suggest to the <Col N="463" /> Minister that the time has now come when, on the primary side, in large centres of population like the cities of Dublin and Cork, there should be a primary school development that would be restricted to children who are speaking Irish in their homes, just as the Department of Education apparently had a theory ten years ago that it was good for children who had not Irish in their homes, and were going to get their education entirely through the medium of Irish, to be associated in school with other children who had Irish in their homes. Going a step further, I think it would be to the advantage of schools giving primary education entirely through the medium of Irish now, even though they were admitting children who do not speak Irish in their homes, that there should separately exist a school in which there was not that disability or that difficulty standing in the way of the standard to which primary education was going to go through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is bound to admit that the school in which primary school-children are attending and working entirely through the medium of Irish, and these children having Irish in their homes, is going to do better work and is going to develop to a higher standard of primary education than the school that is labouring under the disability I speak of.  I take it also that the Minister will admit that the fact that a higher standard is maintained in one school is going to help in the uplift of the other schools. At the same time there is another advantage in it, and that is that it will induce parents who want to get the education of their children, even the primary education, to the highest possible standard, to stretch out a hand to the population of the Irish-speaking districts and to get Irish girls from the Irish-speaking districts into their homes.  It is a very great economic advantage to the people in the Irish-speaking districts to be brought here to the city and to get employment here.  There is also this advantage, which I have seen developed in very many cases, that parents who bring children from Irish-speaking districts <Col N="464" /> to their homes here in the city for the purpose of making their homes Irish-speaking, take an interest in the education of these girls that come to them, send them to the technical schools, and help them in other ways. I have seen quite a number of cases of girls from the Irish-speaking districts who have been brought to the city in that particular way and who have been helped into positions as nurses, music teachers, Irish teachers, and so on, here in the city.</P>
    <P>All that kind of thing is helping the Irish language in the city.  It would be also helping the Irish-speaking districts and it would be a help in seeing that people, who were really anxious about the preservation of Irish in their homes, would be working to the best possible advantage.  The homes that are purely Irish-speaking to-day are fairly numerous now, and the Minister will raise the standard and create a position that will be a further defence to him against haphazard and ignorant criticism if he seeks development in that particular direction.</P>
    <P>I would also recall to the Minister the neglect in that direction with which we have already charged him.  He does know that quite a large number of parents in the Rathmines area made proposals to him a couple of years ago asking that Irish-speaking schools, of the same type as Scoil Colmcille or Scoil Muire, should be set up in the south side of the city, but nothing has been done about it.  The Minister's own experience, and the experience of his Department, about what has been done through the medium of Irish in the city, should dictate to him that the children of a school like that would certainly help to advance the standard to which primary education through the medium of Irish was being raised in the City of Dublin, and would also help to advance the improvement of the standard of Irish-speaking in homes in the City of Dublin.  The Minister must know that a couple of families who speak Irish in their homes, or whose children speak Irish in their homes, have been tremendous influences in seeing the language spread as a spoken language among children in other families.  I have seen <Col N="465" /> families in different parts of the city, where Irish was the spoken language of the children and where the children went to Irish-speaking schools&mdash;I have seen them, under the old system, bring the children of neighbours to Irish-speaking schools.  I have seen them help these children of English-speaking families to resist the tendency to fall back on English in their play hours. That is a thing the schools cannot do as they are at present, and a movement like that should be assisted in every possible way that the Minister can think of.</P>
    <P>The amount of money that is being spent in various directions is very large.  The saving of the language is important.  The saving of the work that is being done for the language, against the type of criticism the Minister complains about, and gets irritated about, and gets incoherent about, is worth doing, and it can be done by giving Irish-speaking schools in large centres of population to people who require them.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that Irish is the language of the infant schools and that he cannot provide specially for particular classes of people, but people who want primary education through the medium of Irish in the City of Dublin, where they are so many and where their influence can be so great, should be helped in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I said that I have seen children in secondary schools fail through want of attention to grammar as a subject in the Irish-speaking schools they came from.  I have said that I have seen them fail through English being allowed to be the language of recreation of some Irish-speaking schools in the city.  The Minister must know very little of the standard that is being reached in the secondary schools if he simply gets irritated against University College, Dublin, as a whole, by the criticism of one or two people or by the criticism in the Press.</P>

      <P>So-called.  Well, I am not out of touch with the people in the National University who care most and who work most for the language, and who have on their shoulders the heaviest part of the work for the language in University College, Dublin, and they would be able to give the Minister, if he were capable of talking to them in a reasonable and helpful kind of way, some views on the standard to which Irish is being brought even in the secondary schools.  Again, speaking from experience of Irish-speaking families in the City of Dublin, where the children talk Irish and where some of the parents talk Irish to them also, I have seen children, simply as a convention, talk Irish amongst themselves until they came to the age, say, of 13 or 14 years.  Then, first, the parents, who have been in the habit of speaking Irish to them, get into a slight difficulty with them.  The mind content that either the father or the mother would like to convey to the child at that particular ago becomes a little bit too big to be fully expressed by that parent to the child, who is sticking to the convention that, mind you, becomes more rooted when the parents begin to talk English to the children.  The children talk Irish back to the parent, and the parent then falls back on Irish and appears to try it for another period. They then find, however, that the linguistic capacity of the child is not able to help them out.  We all know what the experience is when we try to carry on a conversation in Irish with people who do not know very much Irish, or when some of us who have just a fair knowledge of Irish talk to people whose knowledge of it is only up to our own standard.  It becomes difficult and there are gaps and things left unsaid because you cannot very well express them.  When you come to carry on the same conversation with one or two Irish speakers who are native speakers with full power over the language, it becomes perfectly easy to carry on a conversation that would not be possible with a person who is not so well qualified in Irish.  That particular type of difficulty then arises as <Col N="467" /> between the parent and the child and, ultimately, Irish, as a medium in a conversation of any importance, is completely dropped in the household. If the children were up to the standard that university people are entitled to expect, perhaps not now, but entitled to expect at a time when the Minister for Education could say: &ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied that secondary education is given through the medium of Irish now, quite as well as it was given through the medium of English 15 or 20 years ago,&rdquo; then parents would be helped over the difficult point I speak of and Irish could be used in our Irish-speaking families in the City of Dublin as a suitable medium for any kind of important conversation with children about the years of 14, 15 or 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, therefore, want to put it to the Minister that this type of criticism is useful to him; that he should, in the first place, get an examination carried out in conjunction with those responsible for primary and secondary education in the city as to the difficulties that arise for secondary schools through inadequate training in grammar in the primary schools.  I should like him to inquire whether the work of primary schools in the city, in which education is being given entirely through the medium of Irish, and to which non-Irish-speaking children are admitted, would not be considerably helped if there was a system of sectionalisation, so that there would be some primary schools where only children from families in which Irish was the home language would be admitted.  I should like him to examine whether that type of school, with an inducement to parents who know Irish and who are in a position to do so, to get Irish-speaking maids in their homes, would not help to develop quickly and rapidly a larger number of Irish-speaking families in the city.  I think he would be satisfied that that would mean a very considerable help economically to the Irish-speaking districts and would bring with it a higher type of education, in many cases, to the girls brought from those <Col N="468" /> Irish-speaking districts than they could possibly get under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to examine the extent to which Irish is used as the language of recreation in secondary schools.  I should like him to get over his prejudices with regard to criticism emanating from anybody in the National University.  I should like him to initiate a sympathetic and helpful discussion between those in University College, Dublin, who are in a position to know what is going on at the secondary schools, and who are in a position to know the knowledge of Irish that would be required by students working their courses in the university through the medium of Irish.  He could arrange that representatives of the university, of the secondary schools and of his own Department should examine the position of Irish so far as ability to speak it fluently and well on a variety of subjects at that particular point is concerned. I think if the Minister would take these points in the education spectrum and examine them thoroughly, he would see that there are ways in which he could very much improve what is being done for Irish in the schools, and in which he could improve and strengthen the use of Irish in homes here in the City of Dublin.  He might also be induced to take such steps as would strengthen him, his Department and all those interested in the spread of Irish as the spoken language of the people, against the haphazard and ignorant criticism in which, he thinks, some people have indulged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My presentiment about the ferocity that might develop on this subject has unfortunately been rather more than fulfilled.  The Minister for Education displayed, to my mind, quite unnecessary passion in dealing with a matter which is very much more in need of light than it is of heat.  He excused that display of feeling by representing himself as the champion of a class of people who have been unjustly attacked.  I entirely repudiate that interpretation of any part of my speech.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;attack&rdquo; at all in connection <Col N="469" /> with a speech that was intended to be constructive rather than hostile.  So far as it was an attack, it was an attack upon the Government and not upon the teachers.</P>

If I said, as I did, that the standard of scholarship applied in the teaching of Irish was lower than that considered requisite for the teaching of other languages, I was not making an attack upon a body of men who, as Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, have done an immense amount of work under appalling difficulties, including such things as the absence of proper text books and the necessity for constructing them themselves.  I stated what I believe to be a fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister, having spoken already at some length and with so much heat, and having interrupted me repeatedly during my opening address, might now restrain himself for the few minutes I am going to take in supplementing what I have already said and in partially replying to him.  I made no statement that the teachers had a lower standard of general culture than the teachers of other subjects.  I said that as regards the teaching of Irish, owing to the Government's idea that the one thing that mattered was to get as many people speaking some sort of Irish, however debased, as quickly as possible, a lower standard of scholarship and accuracy in the teaching of Irish had crept in all over the country. I repeat that to the best of my information and belief that statement is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested I am just the mouthpiece of a couple of cranks, as he would describe them, in the National University. In point of fact I have consulted every first class scholar in Irish <Col N="470" /> that I happen to know, and they are not all in the National University, nor are they all even professors in any university.  I have informed myself quite painstakingly and sincerely, so far as I could.  Nobody, at the same time, has any responsibility for what I have said except myself; but I can only say I have formed the opinions that I have expressed after taking as much trouble as I could take about it. The suggestion I made that the Government were unduly contemptuous of scholarship as such seems to me to be borne out by the whole tone of the Minister's remarks.  If I may venture to give an instance, not taken directly from the Irish language movement, only a few days ago a book of great historical importance was issued under the aegis of the Department of Education on the &ldquo;Composition of Connacht.&rdquo; It was made as useless for the purposes of students and historians as it could be made by the omission to supply it with any index whatever.  I repeat that it has been the general policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is the duty of the Department of Education to select and instruct editors and provide &mdash;I do not know whether any question of funds arose in this case&mdash;such funds as may be necessary for the purpose. Why on earth cannot we discuss these matters with calmness and good temper, and if some of us fall into blunders, as we well may, why cannot we be corrected with calmness and good temper?  It is much more easy to convince people if you do not fly into a rage the very moment they say something you dislike.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks contemptuously of scholars who cannot talk Irish.  So far as I am aware, such a description does not apply to any one of those I happened to consult.  He bursts into claptrap and asks is the language of the peasants and the fishermen not good enough for the intelligentsia.  What does that sort of exclamation mean?  Could not that sort of claptrap be used to squash every kind of scholarship in every kind of language?  Any attention to the rules of grammar, any reference to literature, any exactitude, anything that is bound up with the word scholarship is swept aside by the Minister saying &ldquo;Is not the language of peasants and fishermen good enough?&rdquo;  I wonder how much the language of peasants and fishermen is, in fact, being disseminated by the Department of Education.  The Minister speaks as if the whole Irish policy of this Government and its predecessor had produced a fulminating success that only cranks could call in question. How far has he succeeded in getting the language of peasants and fishermen spoken by the people of this country? I suggest his success in that has been little if at all greater than his success on the side of scholarship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that I put forward was that in schools in this country Irish should be taught by specialists who would be relieved from teaching other subjects.  Deputy Mulcahy has referred to the fact that conversation on anything that is at all beyond the most elementary order of ideas becomes very difficult if conducted between two people who do not know a language adequately.  That is quite true, and developing that thought we all know how rare it is to find a man who has a first-class gift of teaching. It is a tremendous privilege&mdash; probably we all have had experience of it in our youth&mdash;it is a tremendous privilege to learn any subject from somebody who is an inspired teacher. One subject taught really well is worth <Col N="472" /> half a dozen subjects taught indifferently. I claim that where you have, as I suggest you do have in large numbers of primary schools, men teaching subjects through the medium of Irish with only a very moderate knowledge of Irish and with a still more moderate knowledge of Irish among the pupils, a barrier is placed between the teacher and the pupil that is contrary to all the principles of education.  You cannot talk inspiringly, even if you can talk well enough to qualify according to the standards of an Education Minister, even if you are nominally qualified to teach through the medium of Irish, unless Irish is your native tongue or unless you have had the opportunity to learn it as well as if it was your native tongue.</P>
    <P>As regards the Civil Service and the professions, what I said had reference not so much to things as they are as to things as it would seem to me they were in danger of becoming through this perpetual urge for more and more compulsion and for sacrificing efficiency as we have lately been told we must be prepared to do even more than at present for the sake of spreading the language.  This movement seems to me to make it probable that more and more pressure will be exerted in the Civil Service and the professions of a detrimental kind.</P>
    <P>From a great deal of the Minister's speech you would have thought that I had made a root and branch attack on the whole idea of doing anything for the Irish language.  That is far from being the case.  I, of course, admit I do not share his view that the right ideal is to get as many people as possible talking some kind of Irish as quickly as possible.  I do not take the view that the complete Gaelicisation of this country is either possible or desirable.  I hold still with Thomas Davis that when Ireland finds herself a country she must be neither Gaelic nor English but Irish.  I quite agree and I am surprised the Minister should have thought that the remark he made would be disagreeable to me&mdash;I quite agree that we have set our stamp upon the English language.  I quite agree that the Irish language and the modes <Col N="473" /> of thought that derive from the Irish language have penetrated into the English language and that we have had a very considerable effect upon it.  I regard the English language as an instrument of power, an instrument for propagating Irish genius and spreading the influence of Irish thought over the whole world and I feel that it would be madness to abandon it.  Whatever anyone's enthusiasm may be for having the Irish language as fully revived as possible I hope he will not along with that consider that it is desirable to aim at abandoning the English language so that it becomes a disgrace to write or to speak in English.</P>
    <P>Even at the present moment we have works of very high merit appearing by native Irish in English.  There are none of us, I imagine, who are not glad when a book such as Liam O'Flaherty's book about the famine appears written in English.  It will be read in many other countries besides this.  I only wish there was a tenth of the good work being produced in the Irish language at the present moment by mere Irish like us here than there is being produced by mere Irish in the English language.</P>
    <P>Let me recapitulate once again the concrete suggestions I made so that I may try to dissipate the fog made by the Minister's remarks, and the impression that I was proposing something contemptuous and destructive of Irish culture.  I suggest first that there should be more publication of Irish classical texts and English translations of them.  The Minister passed over that suggestion in silence except to say &ldquo;Why do not they do it?&rdquo;  Apparently he does not think his Department is called upon to do anything about it.  Secondly, that in universities and secondary schools classical Irish, that is, classical modern Irish, should take precedence of mere colloquial Irish.  I make that suggestion in spite of the taunt about the language of peasants and fishermen not being good enough for the intelligentsia. If we are ever going to express ourselves about deeper and more complicated things in Irish, we have <Col N="474" /> to have an instrument for doing it more literate than the living speech of Connemara or Kerry.  That is to cast no reflection on the living speech of Connemara or Kerry.  If you are to confine yourself to the speech of Somersetshire or Yorkshire for expressing ideas in English no book of depth or power would appear in the English language.  It is folly to talk with such contempt of approaching these matters from the scholars' point of view.</P>
    <P>Next I suggest that teachers of Irish in secondary schools and universities should possess an equal standard of scholarship with teachers of other languages.  It would appear, at any rate, that that principle is accepted by the Minister and for that much I am grateful, though he said the standard of scholarship is already there, and I say from the information at my disposal it is not.  Next, that in infant and primary schools Irish should only be taught by native speakers, one teacher taking several schools and the ordinary national teacher teaching the other subjects so that the children will be taught Irish by a real expert and education in other subjects will not suffer and that national teachers teaching other subjects will not have their capabilities diminished by being compelled to devote their time to the Irish language.  Along with that, Irish should only be compulsory where really fit teachers are available.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion is that there should be no teaching through the medium of Irish except in districts where Irish is the home language of the child.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the situation is quite satisfactory now, that such teaching does not take place except where the teacher is qualified.  But whether the Department's requirements about the qualifications of the teacher are adequate or not none of us here can say, at any rate can say with certainty of our views being accepted by others.  One thing is easy to establish and that is what is the home language of the child.</P>
    <P>I hope in spite of the heat that has been developed that something may come out of this debate and that some <Col N="475" /> of the suggestions that have been made including, of course, Deputy Mulcahy's, will obtain further consideration from the Government.  As a matter of fact, in spite of the front of brass, if I may say so, that the Minister adopts here, I do understand that there are some heart searchings among the most prominent members of his Party as to whether all is well with the language movement in this country.  I think that if that course of reflection and heart searching is persisted in, it will not be too terribly long before considerable changes are made for the better.</P>

      <P>I had a question on the Order Paper to-day in connection with a demand from the Cobh Urban Council for an inquiry into the damage done to Government property at Haulbowline. The reply I got from the Parliamentary Secretary was that it was not proposed to hold such an inquiry. I would be anxious and the people of Cobh would be anxious to know what are the reasons for not holding an inquiry in the first instance.  The position is that when Haulbowline was handed over by the British Government they handed over a dockyard and dry docks which were the second largest in the British Isles and the best equipped. There were at that time three dockyards in Cobh.  Some time later the late Government&mdash;I cannot blame the Parliamentary Secretary for everything &mdash;leased this dockyard to a kind of mongrel Danish firm, who from time to time, in the course of carrying out ship repair work there, wrecked the dry docks and the dockyard.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what firm the Deputy is referring, but he should be careful in his choice of language, as the firm in question cannot defend itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm was known as Haulbowline Industries, Ltd.  The position was that this firm cleared out of Haulbowline last year.  They left the dockyard completely wrecked; the <Col N="476" /> whole yard in a completely derelict condition.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated here that the commissioners came to an arrangement with the late tenants before they surrendered possession, as to the question of maintenance during the period it was leased to them.</P>
      <P>I do not know what was the position as regards maintenance, but I have seen an estimate for £12,000 from the same firm, of the cost of putting the dockyard partly into as good condition as it was in when they got it.  I do not know what arrangement on that basis the commissioners have made, but I know that over 1,000 workers were employed there previously.  The present estimate for labour is £1,950, more or less, for a maintenance party. If a maintenance party was kept there and if there was any supervision, as undoubtedly there should be over Government property, how was it that damage to the extent of £12,000 was done there?  It is very little use to the unemployed workers to know that the Government got some money out of the place.  The position now is that a ship that came into the harbour in distress recently had to unload the cargo, and a hole below the water line had to be filled in with cement before she was sent across to England for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That happened in the first harbour in the Free State.  Four oil tankers that were laid up there during the period of depression have left the dockyard within the last two months, and a sum of over £2,000 in insurance had to be paid on each of them before they were towed across to an English dockyard to be laid up awaiting their turn to be put in order.  Several vessels needing repairs came to the harbour during the last few years, and naturally they would dry dock and have repairs done there.  If the dockyard was in proper condition, and was able to deal with vessels, I know that there would be no difficulty whatever in leasing it to some firms.  That has been done in Belfast and in England.  It could even be leased to private individuals during the period needed for carrying out repairs to vessels, and the expenditure would mean anything from £10,000 to £40,000 yearly to Cobh.  The people of <Col N="477" /> Cobh are entitled to know why supervision was not maintained over the dockyard.  It seems rather strange that damage to the extent of £12,000 could be done there.  The people of Cobh are entitled to know the sum that was paid as compensation.  If I understood the latter portion of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement aright, the Commissioners came to an arrangement with the late tenants before they recovered possession of the property or dealt with the question of maintenance during the period it was leased to them.  The people of Cobh are entitled to know if the compensation will be used to put the dockyard into the condition it was in when it was handed over.  I am anxious to get that information from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather glad that Deputy Corry has raised this question.  I think it would have been better to have raised it on the Estimates, at any time, in the last few years.  It would be much better if it was raised on the Estimates, and when the Haulbowline Estimate comes up for discussion I hope, with a better knowledge of what actually has happened, that the Deputy will raise it again.  To me Haulbowline has been an ugly problem for a long time.  It has always been an ugly problem.  It was an ugly inheritance of this Government, and for the last three or four years in considerable difficulty we have been trying to liquidate that bad inheritance.  In 1929, as an emergency measure, the wrecking of the &ldquo;Celtic&rdquo; necessitated finding some place in which things taken from it could be placed.  Haulbowline was let by the last Government to the firm engaged in salvaging that wreck.  It was let hastily and under the conditions that were not very accurately ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years after it was leased for a period of 99 years, with power in the lessee to terminate the lease in a period of five years.  It was a badlydrawn arrangement with an unsatisfactory tenant.  That is the whole truth.  Terrible damage was done in the form of neglect up to the period in which the place came into the <Col N="478" /> possession of this Government.  It was not easy, even after we got it over, to prevent a continuance of these conditions.  Part of the property had been sold to them, part of it had been leased, part with maintenance and part of it without any maintenance. It was apparently understood that part of it could be abandoned to look after itself.  Part of it was to be maintained and part of it was theirs to sell.  The delineation of those particular categories was not exact. Two or three years after they had come into possession the exact terms upon which they had come into possession or were to remain in possession had not been agreed. That was our inheritance.  An empty house is better than a bad tenant, and I am glad that we have an empty house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the second question; we will take them one by one. There is nothing that an inquiry could tell you except that.  That is the reason why there is no particular object in having an inquiry.  The important thing, as Deputy Corry has put it, is what is going to happen in the future.  Is there a future in relation to Haulbowline which, as a commercial proposition, as a manemploying proposition, we can envisage and bring about?  We do know that since 1922 two Governments have been trying to make a proposition out of Haulbowline.  It has been offered to everybody who was willing to take it.  I suppose there is not a piece of commercial property in the country the advantages, disadvantages, assets and liabilities of which are more exactly known to those who might be concerned to use it, and the fact remains that, as far as the big dock, the pump house, and all the rest are concerned, there are no bidders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary; he says there are no bidders.  I cannot see why the matter could not be fixed up on something like the same lines as other dockyards.  Anyone who visualises this country at any time as <Col N="479" /> an independent State will realise very well that at some time or another we must cease having our goods conveyed on British boats.  At some time or another we will own a ship of our own, and surely to Heaven a dockyard that cost millions of money to construct ought to be near enough to this Government or any other Government in charge of this country to be kept in condition for that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the kind of thing that is very easy to say. At the present moment there is a responsible committee in Cork considering this matter, making representations to the Government as to what can or can not be done, and ascertaining facts, as far as facts can be ascertained, upon which a policy in relation to that dockyard can be framed.  I have had in my possession a list of all the ships that came into the harbour in the last considerable number of years, and a list of all the ships that passed. The general method of making a calculation of this kind is to take all the ships that come in and all the ships that pass; estimate for yourself what it would cost to do all the repairs that you think ought to be done in them, add them together, and call that the income of a dockyard in the port.  That is a very simple thing to do, but Deputy Corry knows as well as I do&mdash;it is an unpleasant knowledge common to both of us&mdash;that when we had two equipped dockyards operating in Cork&mdash;Passage and Rushbrooke; Rushbrooke in the possession of Messrs.  Furness Withy, a thoroughly up-to-date and thoroughly commercial firm&mdash;lame ducks were towed past Cobh, lame ducks were towed into Cobh and towed out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the faintest use regarding this as simply a matter for controversy or propaganda; this is a problem to be solved, not a speech to be made.  We know that those ships were towed past Cobh; we know that they were towed into Cobh while arrangements were made to find out how much it would cost to repair them in other places.  In practice they went on, although a completely equipped dockyard was in operation <Col N="480" /> in Cobh under Messrs.  Furness Withy. Taking a list of the ships that did come into Cobh, and the amount of money which would be required to be spent on any of them that required to be dry-docked, I certainly do not think it would pay the cost of pumping out the dock.  That is the problem I have to face.  For whatever reason, Haulbowline Dockyard at the present moment is inoperative. To put it in a minimum condition in which it could be used for the docking of lame ducks&mdash;and that is practically what you would have to live on, the casual possession of lame ducks&mdash;is going to cost a good deal of money.  Is the State entitled to spend the money for that purely contingent possibility of work? If I could see that it is, I would recommend that it should be done, but if I cannot see good sound ground for assuming some reasonable user of that dockyard when it is there I certainly will not recommend it on the ground of looking for lame ducks.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another way of looking at it&mdash;a point which Deputy Corry has apparently at the back of his mind&mdash;and it is the only case that I have yet heard put up for the reconditioning of Haulbowline, that after all, it is a big and valuable piece of property; that the cost of putting it in condition, compared with its original capital value and its possible intrinsic or commercial value at some later date, however big that amount for reconditioning may be, is relatively small, and it is for the State to consider whether or not it would be wise for them to expend that money.</P>
    <P>Now, one is tempted, and very much tempted, to come down on the side of doing that work.  But one has to face facts.  When Rushbrooke docks were put in the market when Furness Withy withdrew and left behind them a completely equipped modern dock, built pre-war, absolutely modern up to the last moment, that whole dock, as it stood, was offered for £5,000. Now, you may say to yourselves that Haulbowline cost £4,000,000.  That is what they asked for it, that is what they wanted for it when we took it over.  They got nothing for it.  They <Col N="481" /> did not get one cent for it.  It was regarded as a liability&mdash;that completely-equipped modern dockyard, right up-to-date and equipped within a few years of its abandonment was offered for £5,000, and it has lain idle ever since.  It would be far cheaper for us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>But the owner asked £20,000 for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree he did but not as a dock.  The owner did not ask a cent for it as a dock; he asked £20,000 for it as a site, not to be used as a dock.  Whatever else we may say as to why Haulbowline was neglected or how much damage was done or anything else like that&mdash;there is no evidence in the possession of any responsible person to go to the Board of Works that that Dockyard had been in a condition in the last five years that a single ship would be put in it except for just an accidental 2 or 3 days' work.  Now, take the ship that was in and had a plate put in the bottom.  I think it is quite possible that as much was got out of that ship in Haulbowline from the method in which it was repaired as would have been had it been dry docked.  You would have to pay the same thing and the actual repair was a negligible repair in itself. It was the preparation for the repair that represented the money.  The mere possibility to have it dry-docked would have reduced the actual expenditure in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I can see any way of using Haulbowline which would be profitable for the local community or for the State; if any proposition of that kind, which is a profitable proposition, is put up to us we will agree to take it.  Up to this no one has been put up to us. The idea that is being propagated at the moment about Haulbowline&mdash;with Rushbrooke standing idle beside it&mdash; that that represents a huge loss to the community, has no basis in any fact which a responsible body has been prepared to put before us.  That is what I say to Deputy Corry and to others, because remember I am in contact with that responsible body, a responsible body <Col N="482" /> of which Deputy Corry and I are members, a body which is negotiating with the Board of Works at the present moment and which has put up a helpful proposition in the sense that it was prepared to contribute or to organise the means of contribution towards anything which would be necessary in the future.  Any responsible representations of that kind that come to us or any constructive proposals that come to us, will receive the closest and most immediate attention, but certainly I am not going to be disturbed by the sort of agitation which is going on now amongst certain people.  Let us have the facts.  Let us have a proposition put up to us.</P>
    <P>Apparently the idea at the present moment is that we should recondition the yard and keep it there on the chance that some lame duck will be brought in.  That is the first chance. The second chance is that there will be a responsible organisation capable of taking charge of major repairs for that establishment, and thirdly&mdash;and this is the thing that matters&mdash;that the price that will be offered for doing those repairs will be a price so competitive that the people who have direct affiliation with other dockyards on the other side will turn down the dock with which they are affiliated and that they will have the work done here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation that we are faced with is this&mdash;that a certain amount of damage has been done to the dock; that certain compensation has been paid to this Government for that damage.  Is that money going to be used for putting that dockyard back into any kind of repair, or is that money going with the rest of it, with the other £25,000?  That is the question I want to have answered.  Who is responsible for the damage?  What were those people who were paid by this Government for supervision over that yard doing while that damage was done?  If this Government gets sufficient money from those people to make good the damage then what are they going to do?  The estimate of those figures is in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary.  That estimate shows that there has been damage to the extent of £12,000 done to the dockyard <Col N="483" /> alone.  That is the point that is troubling us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only prepared to answer the questions.  I am not prepared to indulge in another speech. Whatever amount of money would be required if a proposition is sent, the money for that would have to be found from central sources.  The amount of <Col N="484" /> money which has been paid in compensation, whether it was twice that amount or half as much, is entirely irrelevant.  If the repair is to be made it will have to be made out of central funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he can give particulars of the regulations governing the programme of instruction, the attendance of pupils, and the system of remuneration of fosterage schools, together with a statement as to whether the results of the fosterage school system justify a wide extension of that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The official regulations which have special application to fosterage schools are Rules 22 (6) (a) and (b), 50 (3), 54 (16), 58, 73 (11), 110 and 114.</P>
      <P>The programme of instruction is that for national schools.  Irish only is to be used in the domestic life of these schools and as a teaching medium for all subjects of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>Only one fosterage school has been so far recognised, i.e., Scoil na Leanbh at Ring, Co. Waterford.  It is a matter for public knowledge that highly successful results have been achieved at this school in making Irish speakers of the children in attendance.  I have no doubt that the successful establishment of other schools of this kind fulfilling the official requirements and achieving similar results would be of great assistance in the revival of the language as a living speech.</P>
      <P>The establishment of schools of this type rests with the community and not with my Department.</P>
      <P>I am sending the Deputy a copy of the Rules and Regulations for National Schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether any steps have been taken to remedy the defective pronunciation of Irish by the students in secondary schools to which attention was called in the latest annual report published by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The section of the Department's Annual Report in which reference is made to the pronunciation of Irish by the students in the <Col N="366" /> secondary schools contains suggestions for remedying the defects to which attention is drawn, the most important of these suggestions being that teachers should spend some time (&ldquo;treimhse reasunta fada&rdquo;) in the Gaeltacht.  The practice that is growing in some schools to send some of their students to the Gaeltacht every year is also commended.  In addition, special attention was given to phonetics in the summer course in Irish for teachers of secondary schools conducted by the Department last summer.</P>
      <P>I might point out to the Deputy that the wording of his question conveys a misleading impression regarding the standard of pronunciation of Irish by the students in secondary schools and the reference thereto in the Department's report.  That report recorded an improvement in pronunciation, and mentions certain defects requiring special attention; but to refer to &ldquo;the defective pronunciation of Irish by the students in secondary schools&rdquo; is to convey a misleading impression regarding both the position in the schools and the reference thereto in the Department's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether any principles are laid down for the guidance of officers of his Department in sanctioning books for the teaching of Irish in the national schools, and, if so, whether he can state what these principles are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principles applied in sanctioning books, whether in Irish or in English, for use in national schools are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Books, whether in Irish or in English, submitted for use as readers in the different standards in national schools should conform to the following standard:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  They should be printed in clear type on good paper, and firmly bound;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  They should be well illustrated by good artists, by photographs or by properly proportioned diagrams, <Col N="367" /> and should be turned out in an attractive and artistic form;</P>
    <P>(3)  They should be Christian in spirit, national in outlook, and truthful as regards facts;</P>
    <P>(4)  They should be interesting as well as instructive;</P>
    <P>(5)  They should be examples of good style;</P>
    <P>(6)  They should&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  include matter in prose and poetry drawn from the hero stories of Ireland and of the world,</P>
    <P>(b)  deal extensively with the important facts of life in Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(c)  have an Irish outlook and a definite rural bias.</P>
    <P>(7)  They should be free from matter objectionable to any religious denomination.</P>
    <P>(8)  They should be of suitable price.</P>
    <P>Readers in Irish should not contain any English translation of the matter. They may contain certain questions in Irish on the lessons.  Explanations in Irish or in English of words or phrases of uncommon use or peculiar to certain districts may be given at the end of the book.  In the case of the more advanced books, a vocabulary with the equivalent Irish or English words may be given at the end of the book.</P>
    <P>Text-books in mathematics, history, geography, etc., should be constructed on approved lines in accordance with the aim of the school programme.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the recommendations, on the selection of school texts for the junior, middle and senior divisions of national schools, on pages 49-50 of the Notes for Teachers on the teaching of Irish.  The principles underlying these recommendations are also kept in view in the sanctioning of books for use in national schools.  I am sending the Deputy a copy of the notes referred to.</P>
