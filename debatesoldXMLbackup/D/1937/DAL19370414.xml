      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether diplomatic representations have been made by the Government of Saorstát Eireann (1) to the Burgos Government, and (2) to the Valencia Government in Spain with a view to securing facilities for the repatriation of Saorstát nationals who volunteered for service with the fighting forces in Spain while they were minors and without the consent of their parents; and, if so, what reply was forthcoming from each of these Governments.</P>

    <P>(3)  59 per cent. (approximately) of aliens other than those shown as American citizens.</P>
    <P>A large number of persons registered as aliens were resident in Saorstát Eireann for many years before the 6th December, 1922, and are probably citizens by virtue of Article 3 of the Constitution.  Persons registered as American citizens are nearly all of Irish birth or parentage and it is likely that most of them are citizens by virtue of Article 3 of the Constitution or sub-section (4) (a) of Section 2 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935.  It is not possible, however, to determine the number who are citizens.</P>
    <P>Full records are not available of persons registered as American citizens who are in remunerative occupation.</P>
    <P>Many aliens who have been resident in Saorstát Eireann since 1920 have lost their original nationalities.  This observation applies particularly to those registered as Russians, many of whom lost their nationality as a result of the Russian revolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission, before approving the scheme of division in this case, had full information as to the circumstances of each proposed allottee and of each applicant for land.  One adjoining smallholder received an enlargement; two men losing their employment on the lands were provided for; one small accommodation plot was approved to give a local man a site for a hayshed; six holdings were laid out for suitable landless men from the immediate locality; and four holdings were reserved for migrants from some 15 miles away whose home farms were needed for the relief of congestion. It will be apparent that congestion did not exist in the immediate neighbourhood <Col N="729" /> of these lands.  The Land Commission have followed their established practice of using portions of them to relieve congestion elsewhere, and have been able as well to settle on the land some half-dozen suitable young landless men whose homes are on the spot or very close to the lands. Applications were received from landless men with approved I.R.A. service. These applicants resided not close to the lands but at distances varying up to as far as seven miles away.  It is the practice of the Land Commission in allotting holdings to landless men, to select suitable men whose homes closely adjoin the lands being divided.  Should lands become available nearer to the I.R.A. applicants referred to by the Deputies their claims will receive full consideration, and one of them is being considered for a holding on another estate.  As regards the allotment of a holding to a landless man whose father owns a farm of 80 acres, this would not appear to be correct, but the father of one allottee has a holding of 58 acres, poor law valuation £35 10s., and this may be the case to which the Deputies refer.</P>

      <P>The question appears to refer to the estate of Mrs. Stella Power Lawlor, lands of Longorchard, and Derryville, County Tipperary.  The Land Commission had an inspection made of the lands in this matter, and it was ascertained that portions of the lands of Longorchard had been sold privately in 12 lots.  A separate inspection has been made of each portion sold, and a further inspection has been made of the lands remaining in possession of Mrs. Power Lawlor, and the question of the acquisition of all the lands is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the date of last year's Budget I should have been well content with a total revenue from taxation and otherwise of £30,191,500, but as in fact £31,034,710 poured in to us, I cannot be blamed if I find the retrospect over the past 12 months a not unagreeable one from the Exchequer Standpoint. Moreover, this result having followed the substantial tax remissions granted last year, I must claim that it is explainable only on the basis of a general increase in prosperity.  This view is strengthened by the fact that in general the returns from the duties and taxes greatly surpassed our expectations. Thus, tobacco duties gave £4,422,000 against an estimate of £4,240,000; the beer duties produced £3,219,000, the highest for a number of years; motor cars and parts, £270,000; entertainments duty, £288,000, and betting duty, £194,000.  Estimates were likewise exceeded by yields in respect of the duties on mineral hydrocarbon oils, matches, wheat and table waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the aggregate, all the duties I have mentioned brought in £10,021,000 as against the Budget Estimate of £9,416,000.  In 1935-36 they were responsible for £9,358,000.  The sugar duties, from which we expected £696,000, actually gave £741,000; while the spirit duties at £2,359,000 exceeded the Estimate by £39,000.  The stamp duties, and taxes on profits, property, <Col N="736" /> and income, excluding excess profits duty, accounted for £7,905,000, that is £107,000 more than in the preceding year.  Finally, the motor vehicle duties brought in £1,079,000.</P>
    <P>With the possible exception of the wheat duty, all the duties and taxes with which up to this point I have been dealing are barometric in their character.  Their yield rises when times are good or on the up-grade and falls when the contrary conditions prevail. For the year 1936-37, their yield was £22,105,000 as compared with £21,422,000 for 1935-36, and £20,149,000 for 1934-35.  There is every reason to believe that they will be increasingly fruitful this year.</P>
    <P>That expectation, however, does not apply to those duties which are designed to be highly protective in their effect.  Yields from many of these did not differ substantially from the Estimate.  With others the Estimate has not even been reached.  This was the case with duties on boots and shoes, bottles, buttons, clocks and watches, sheet and plate glass, daily newspapers, knitted fabric, and tomatoes. Altogether these were estimated to bring in £225,000.  Actually they brought in only £188,000.  Excluding the duty on sheet and plate glass, those protective duties which I have mentioned brought in £259,000 for 1935-36, and in the year before that £305,000.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the account, our outgoings for the Central Fund and Supply Services totalled £31,227,688. The House understands that this amount included certain capital outlays, such as the final instalment of £196,758 for the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, £100,000 being that part of the cost of the industrial alcohol factories which I am charging to borrowing, and £48,609 for property losses compensation.  It also includes the sum of £312,453, which was the amount paid up on the further 499,925 £1 shares in the Industrial Credit Company taken up on behalf of the Government during the year.  Nor need we forget that in framing the Budget last year I undertook if necessary to borrow one-half of the total sum actually expended on export <Col N="737" /> bounties and subsidies.  Including the amount provisionally reserved under this head, the expenditures which, if necessary, may be charged to borrowing amount in all to £1,637,501.  If we adjust the gross figure for expenditure accordingly, the Budget for 1936-37 shows a surplus of £1,444,523.</P>
    <P>Some may demur at certain of the expenditures, which I have classified as capital, being included amongst the amounts to be deducted from outgoings before a balance is struck, but to my mind there is only one item to which conceivably exception may be taken.  I refer to the figure in respect of export bounties and subsidies.  The House, I hope, will bear with me while I venture to outline my views on this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Let me begin by saying that if in normal conditions of trade the Dáil, as settle policy, decided to subsidise our exports, it would have the unescapable obligation of providing out of current revenue the whole cost thereof.  But if there arose a situation which was clearly abnormal, which interfered so greatly with the normal course of trade that in order to safeguard the productive capacity of the community, both now and in the future, extraordinary steps had to be taken; then the Government, so as to avoid the imposition of unreasonable immediate burdens, might seek to leave some part of these special measures to be defrayed later.  Upon this principle I think there can be no doubt that we are justified in budgeting to defray, if necessary, some part of the cost of the export bounties and subsidies otherwise than out of revenue.</P>
    <P>At the same time I believe that the House in general feels that the share of the burden passed on to our successors should not be unduly heavy.  I think that was the point of view expressed last year by Deputy Bennett&mdash;the reference is vol. 62, col. 396, of the Official Report&mdash;when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I might say to the Minister that the farmer does not want any portion of his relief to be a burden on posterity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But if the propriety of the course <Col N="738" /> which I have always been prepared to adopt in regard to the bounties is questioned, it can only be by those who have forgotten that the farmers and taxpayers of to-day have equitable rights in this matter also.  It must be remembered that when we propose to borrow part of the Vote for these bounties and subsidies, we have standing against such borrowings certain Exchequer assets; to wit, the funded land annuity arrears.  The Exchequer became entitled to these arrears by reason of the payments, totalling £4,010,847, which it made to the Guarantee Fund during the years 1932 to 1935 in respect of the funded arrears. This valuable asset has been created by present-day taxpayers.  If to relieve them it is mortgaged, the future generation will, at least, not be any worse off than if it had never existed.</P>
    <P>Naturally our right in this matter ought to be exercised with prudence and economy; for it is not by what we ourselves enjoy but by the opportunities and resources which we leave to our successors that our hopes for the nation will be realised.  I have always acted upon that view.  Accordingly, it will be found that, taking one year with another, our right to borrow for export bounties and subsidies has not been availed of at all&mdash;even though to 31st March last the total amount thus paid was no less than £10,585,000.  Moreover, I may say that borrowing for them was wholly obviated last year. And that applies also to our total expenditure under the Vote for employment schemes.</P>
    <P>We may, however, appraise the Budget of 1936-37 by even more rigid standards.  Making provision out of revenue for the whole cost of the export bounties and subsidies, and for the whole cost of the employment schemes programme also; but borrowing £48,609 for property losses compensation £312,453 invested in the Industrial Credit Company, £100,000 out of £140,000 expended on the new industrial alcohol factories, and the final instalment of £196,758 paid in repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, the year closed with a clear surplus of £464,842, a figure which not <Col N="739" /> even the most rigidly orthodox or conservative can question or quibble at.</P>
    <P>Before I come to consider the prospect for the present year it may not be inopportune, bearing in mind that the present Administration has just completed half a decade in office, to review some of the changes and developments which have taken place during that period in our public finances.  While being as informative as I may, I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year I informed the House that at the 31st March of that year our direct Exchequer obligations amounted to £55,356,678.  At the corresponding date this year they were £59,520,612, according to the following details:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Our balances, advances and shareholdings amount, therefore, in the aggregate to £36,593,926, and were we to take only these into account our actual net dead-weight debt at 31st March last would appear to be £22,926,686.  The corresponding figure for 31st March, 1936, was £23,854,343, and at 31st March, 1932, was £22,373,502.</P>
    <P>To make the position plain, however, it is necessary to make certain adjustments in that figure.  But first, I should like to direct attention to the special significance of several of the items which appear on one or other side of the account, or which indeed no longer appear there.</P>
    <P>The Dáil Eireann External Loan is the first of these.  The Dáil will remember that in 1932 the then unredeemed balance of this loan was taken into account as a liability of £1,000,000 at the then prevailing rate on the dollar sterling exchange.  The repayment of the loan, so far as the Exchequer is concerned in it, was completed by the 31st March last and, subject to minor adjustments, all our commitments to <Col N="741" /> subscribers in regard to it have been liquidated for the aggregate sum of £537,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to our liabilities arising out of public issues, it will be noted that the First National Loan, of which £8,020,280 was still in issue in March, 1932, has been replaced by £6,939,000 of 4 per cent.  Conversion Loan, issued in December, 1935.  The price of this loan at the close of the last financial year was £110½ per £100 stock, at which it gave a return of £3 7s. 9d. per cent. per annum, assuming that the loan will be repaid in 1957.  On the other hand, towards the end of January, 1932, the quotation for the First National Loan was usually about £100½ with a yield to redemption of about £5 1s. 9d. per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>Then we have the Second National Loan which was issued in 1927 on terms which, to the earliest redemption date, gave a yield equivalent to £5 4s. 3d. per cent. per annum.  At 31st March last the price of this loan was £113¼ per £100 stock as compared with £101¼ in January, 1932, and £97 at the date of issue; while the net yield to earliest redemption date was then £3 14s. 6d. per cent. per annum against £4 19s. 9d. in January, 1932, and £5 4s. 3d. at date of issue.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Third National Loan, which was issued at the price of £93½ per £100 of 4½ per cent. stock, the price latterly has been about £110.  This gives a yield to 1953 of £3 14s. 0d. per cent. per annum, as against £5 3s. 6d. at the end of January, 1932, when the stock could be bought at a discount of £8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Fourth National Loan bears interest at 3½ per cent. and was issued in December, 1933, at the price of £98 per £100 stock.  Its price at the end of the financial year was £102 which, assuming redemption in 1961, gives £3 8s. 3d. per cent., while at that date the British 3½ per cent.  Conversion Loan, the nearest corresponding issue, on the same assumption would yield £3 8s. 6d.</P>
    <P>It is of particular interest to note that in January, 1932, the average yield to be got by holders of our loans was £5 1s. 6d. per cent. per annum. <Col N="742" /> By the end of May, 1932, this average had fallen to £4 13s. 6d.  The average yield, however, from the nearest corresponding British Government issues about that time was lower still at £4 4s. 0d.  At the 31st March last the loans which have been issued under the auspices of the present Government, the 4 per cent.  Conversion Loan and the 3½ per cent.  Fourth National Loan, gave on the average to their present probable redemption dates about £3 8s. 0d. per cent. per annum; while the two most nearly corresponding British issues gave an average of £3 8s. 3d.  These figures prove beyond denial that the State's credit has not declined during the lifetime of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The next important item in the Schedule of State Debt is Savings Certificates (principal and interest). Under this heading our liabilities have increased from £8,151,000 to £10,552,000 in the course of the five years subsequent to March, 1932.</P>
    <P>But it should be noted that the sums debited against us in this regard cover the principal of the certificates in issue and the interest accrued thereon to the 31st March last.  Off-setting the interest charge, however, we had at that date in Savings Certificates (Interest Charge Equalisation) Fund cash, gilt-edged securities and accrued interest to the amount of £2,706,000. At the corresponding date in 1932 the figure was £696,000.  As the history of the Savings Certificates (Interest Charge Equalisation) Fund is a matter of some public interest I should like to recount it briefly.</P>
    <P>The fund was first established by the Finance Act, 1929, in order to provide for the State's liability in respect of interest accruing on certificates; and certain payments were made to it between 1929 and 1932.  These, however, far from covered the accruing interest and, at the close of the financial year 1931-32, the uncovered liability therefore amounted to £425,000. In the 1932 Budget provision was made for this, together with such further interest as was estimated to accrue during 1932-33.  Furthermore, we have been careful since to provide fully for our liability under this head.  Thus, <Col N="743" /> in the five years since March, 1932, after providing £687,000 for interest accrued on certificates repaid during that period, we have put aside to the credit of the Interest Charge Equalisation Fund £1,653,000, which, with the interest earned thereon, brought the total assets of the fund at the 31st March last up, as I have said, to £2,706,000.</P>
    <P>We have sometimes been twitted with the fact that in latter years the value of the new Savings Certificates sold has not greatly exceeded repayments. I propose to put some facts before the House in relation to that matter, and shall begin by pointing out that almost two-thirds of the certificates encashed over the past five years belonged to the first issue, which was on sale from June, 1923, to February, 1931.  The maturity period for this particular issue was originally fixed at five years, during which compound interest was earned at £5 4s. 7d. per cent. per annum.  In June, 1928, this period was extended to ten years, and the rate of compound interest increased to £5 6s. 2d. per cent. per annum.  The maturity period was again extended, this time to 20 years, in 1933, but the average rate of interest allowed over the second ten-year period was only £3 6s. 1d. per cent. per annum.  Now, as there is no fund from which to pay off these certificates on maturity, we have had since 1932 to find, in addition to the interest charges, £1,684,000 for repayment of principal of certificates which were issued between 1923 and February, 1931.  In those circumstances it is little wonder that the amount of the new certificates issued did not greatly exceed the amount of the certificates repaid.</P>
    <P>Raising money by means of Savings Certificates is not favoured by the Exchequer, as the rate paid for money on the certificate terms is usually uneconomical, and the incidental expenses of securing subscriptions for the certificates and managing the issue are very high, while, as the holders are entitled to repayment virtually on demand, the money is held by the Exchequer practically at call.  For <Col N="744" /> the reasons, and because it is not in the public interest to allow an uncovered capital liability of this kind to attain such proportions as might in unforeseen circumstances create difficulties for the Exchequer, I have of deliberate policy endeavoured to keep our commitments in respect of Savings Certificates within reasonable limits. With this in view, I withdrew in May, 1933, the issue then current, which over the ten years to maturity yielded £4 2s. 9d. per cent. per annum, and replaced it by the present issue, which pays on the average only £3 1s. 5d. per cent. per annum over 12 years. Furthermore, I drastically restricted the maximum amount which might be invested in the certificates by any one holder.  This restriction and the reduction in the rate of interest have had the desired effect, and while there has been some increase in our capital liabilities under this head since the 31st March, 1932, the figure for them is still under 8,000,000 mark; which, in present circumstances, I regard as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Before passing finally from this item of the Savings Certificates perhaps I should inform the Dáil that, at the 31st March last, the amount due to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank was estimated at £7,810,000, as against £3,750,000 at the 31st March, 1932; while as between November, 1931, and November, 1936, the deposits of the Trustee Savings Banks here rose from £1,266,000 to £1,912,000.  Moreover, in 1931-32, the aggregate figure for Savings Certificates and deposits in the Savings Banks was £13,167,000, while for 1936-37 it was £20,274,000.  Thus over the past five years the savings of the petty capitalist, the small farmer, and thrifty worker, the small shopkeeper and the like, have increased by 54 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have now to consider the Exchequer's liability under the Land Acts, 1923-1933.  It will be noted that it has risen from £2,397,000 in 1932 to £14,883,000.  In the main the increase is due to the reduction in the land annuities granted under the Land Acts of 1933 and 1936; by which tenant purchasers were relieved of capital obligations amounting to £12,228,000, a <Col N="745" /> corresponding liability being imposed on the State instead.  But for that transaction our net deadweight debt, so far from showing an increase of £553,000 as compared with 1931-32, would show a reduction of £11,675,000, and stand at only £10,699,000 or less than £3 12s. per head of population.</P>
    <P>At this stage I must refer to other consequences of the 1933 Land Act, which as well as granting a reduction in the annuities payable under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, granted a like reduction in those payable under previous Acts.  By the grant of this concession the Exchequer has lost an annual income of £1,480,000; but purchasers under the old Land Acts have been relieved of capital burdens amounting to £38,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1933 also legalised the moratorium which had been granted in respect of certain land annuity gales accruing due in 1932 and 1933 and extended it to cover a period of three years in all.  Normally the land annuities thus permitted to remain unpaid, would have been debited against the agricultural and other local taxation grants; and these would have been sequestrated for the general purposes of the Exchequer accordingly. Wherefore, the local ratepayers would have received little or nothing in 1932 and 1933 to mitigate the cost of the local services.</P>
    <P>Now we must also note that the default in payments under the Land Acts had been increasing at an accelerating rate prior to 1932 and 1933. At the clearance of the Guarantee Fund in February, 1930, this default amounted to £498,000; but at the corresponding dates in 1931 and 1932 it had risen to £546,000 and £808,000, respectively.  Nor, in view of the continuance of the world-wide depression in agriculture, and failing the enactment of the 1933 Act, could it have been expected that the accumulated default would have been less than £1,100,000 in February, 1933, and £1,450,000 a year later.  Accordingly, therefore, even if the moratorium had not been granted, an amount equivalent to the accumulated arrears would have been <Col N="746" /> impounded in the Guarantee Fund during the two last-mentioned years, and correspondingly a reduction in the grants-in-relief issued to the local authorities would have been made.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the Government, these statutory reductions, whether on account of the moratorium or otherwise, did not take place.  Special Exchequer provisions amounting to £1,616,000 in 1932-33, and to £1,844,847 in 1933-34, were made, so as to enable the local taxation grants to be released in those years; while, in addition, special advances totalling £550,000 were made to the local authorities during 1934-35 on the security of the funded land annuity arrears which had accrued up to and including the May-June gale, 1933.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, therefore, that the local authorities in effect lost nothing by the provisions of the Land Act of 1933.  Instead, they benefited substantially; for the special payments and advances made by the Exchequer to relieve their position amounted to £4,011,000.  Moreover, since about 95 per cent. of the Exchequer grants in relief of local taxation which are hypothecated to the Guarantee Fund, is devoted to the direct relief of rates on agricultural land, the agricultural community naturally received practically the full benefit of these special payments.</P>
    <P>It is not with this special aspect of the matter that, at this moment, I am particularly concerned, but with the fact that by the payment of £4,011,000 into the Guarantee Fund the Exchequer has secured a good title to an equivalent amount of the funded annuity arrears.  So long as the campaign to prevent the payment of annuities constituted a serious menace, and so long as the Exchequer's rights in the Guarantee Fund were the subject of legal challenge, I hesitated to bring these funded arrears into account. Now, however, that there can be no longer any doubt as to the validity of the charge, or as to the ability and determination of the State, acting, of course, for the whole community, to collect the annuities, they cannot but be accounted a sound and well-secured <Col N="747" /> asset, with which to the value of £4,011,000 I have credited the assets accordingly.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to mention the position of the Local Loans Fund I should like to call the attention of the Dáil to the very substantial increase recorded in our advances to the Electricity Supply Board and the Shannon Electricity Fund since March, 1932.  In that year these amounted all told to £8,785,000; by 31st March last they had increased to £10,889,000.  In view of the present satisfactory financial position of the board there need be no hesitation in valuing these advances at par.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that the sums advanced to the national electricity undertaking last year amounted to £408,000, that is £88,000 more than the amount by which the Exchequer balance was reduced over the same period. Indeed the Exchequer issues to meet capital expenditure during last year, including the additional investment in the Industrial Credit Company, and for the redemption of debt, including the repayment of Savings Certificates and the Dáil Eireann External Loan, together with the payments for Property Losses Compensation and to the sinking funds for the Conversion and National Loans, exceeded the aggregate amount raised by the creation of debt, and derived from the repayment of advances, by £1,124,000.</P>
    <P>The House will note that the figure for advances to the Local Loans Fund, up to 31st March last, stands at £13,559,195, as against £2,536,237 for the corresponding date in 1932.  Last year I detailed the inter-relation between the old Local Loans, the present fund, and the Exchequer.  It is unnecessary for me to repeat what I said then; but in accordance therewith, I propose, as last year, to take the Local Loans figure for 31st March, 1932, as £9,071,902; the figure for 31st March, 1937, as £13,559,195, which it is, and to write up by £6,192,665 the Exchequer obligations at the end of 1931-32, making them £44,878,000.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the State's shareholding in the Industrial Credit Company, which was established under <Col N="748" /> the Industrial Credit Act, 1933.  This concern has a nominal capital of £5,000,000, in respect of which 1,000,000 ordinary shares of £1 each have been issued.  The State's holding consists of 492,064 fully paid up shares, and 499,925 more on which 12/6 per share has been paid, the total value being £804,517, which is the figure credited under this head in the list of Exchequer assets.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company has been very successful since it commenced business.  Up to the 15th December last it had carried through capital issues amounting to £3,968,000; while at the 31st October last, after less than three years' activity, its declared net profits amounted to £77,900.  No dividend has so far been paid, but out of profits the preliminary expenses of the company, amounting to £13,335, have been written off, £20,000 has been transferred to investment reserve and £25,000 to reserve for contingencies, while £11,330 has been carried forward to the current year's account.  All of which reflects the company's very satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>In connection with the more general question of industrial finance the Dáil may be interested to know that since the enactment of the Industrial Credit Act in July, 1933, the capital issues offered to the Dublin market, other than those sponsored by the Credit Company, amounted to a net cash total of £2,454,000, bringing the aggregate of capital issues for industrial and commercial purposes, made in Dublin since the passing of the Act, up to £6,422,000.  In the three years which preceded that the public issues offered to the Dublin market by companies amounted to only £15,750. These figures go far to substantiate our claim that we have succeeded in creating a capital market in Dublin for Irish industrial and commercial issues.</P>
    <P>Another asset to which I should like to refer is our holding in Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teoranta.  Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teoranta, as is well known, owns and operates four sugar factories.  One of these it purchased as a going concern from the old subsidised <Col N="749" /> undertaking known as the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited, the vast majority of the shares in which were held abroad; the three other factories, admittedly among the most efficient in Europe, it has erected since its inception.  The operations of the company have so affected the national economy that, whereas in the year 1932 the total imports of sugar into the Saorstát amounted to 86,000 tons, as against a native production of only 23,000, in the year 1936 the positions were reversed, for we made 85,000 tons and imported only 27,000.</P>
    <P>The unsatisfactory position of the sugar industry in other countries has created its own difficulties for our industry, since it has resulted in the offering of excess sugar production at cut prices wherever a market could be found for it.  In consequence, world sugar prices have been so depressed that, in order to protect our market against uneconomic competition, we have had to concede a larger margin of protection, that is to say, 16/4 per cwt., than was originally contemplated. With the rise in the world price of sugar, however, the need for so large a tariff will disappear, and the protective duty can be adjusted accordingly. I may, perhaps, point out here that if, in addition to the 27,000 tons of sugar which was imported last year, we had also imported, at the prevailing world prices and present rate of customs duty, the whole of the 85,000 tons made in our own factories, we should have secured about £1,400,000 more for the Exchequer, without causing any increase in price to the consumer.  The whole of this £1,400,000, with the exception of about £95,000 representing dividends and debenture charges, goes to the benefit of the beet growers and those engaged in the factories and ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>Our holding in the sugar company consists of 500,000 ordinary shares of £1 each, on which dividends at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum have been paid for the past two years, and it represents practically the whole of the equity of the concern.  In addition to the ordinary shares there are also 500,000 6 per cent. £1 preference shares, and £1,000,000 has been raised <Col N="750" /> by the issue of 4 per cent. debenture stock.  It will be clear that the financing of this £2,000,000 undertaking has been prudent and economical. The total of the debenture and preference charges ranking in priority to the ordinary capital only amounts to £70,000 per annum, so that the earning power of our investment being reasonably assured, it is valued at par.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will note that this year there appears among the Exchequer liabilities for the first time a figure of £3,600,000 in respect of national school teachers' pensions, being the additional liability assumed by the State in respect of such pensions, and uncovered by assets transferred, or by increased teachers' contributions, or otherwise.  The liability in question has arisen in this wise.  In July, 1928, an actuarial valuation of the National School Teachers' Pension Fund as at the 31st December, 1926, disclosed a net deficiency of over £4,000,000; from which, in conjunction with other facts, it is reasonable to infer that the fund was insolvent when taken over from the British in 1922.  As such a deficiency, if unregarded, must increase at compound interest, the capital assets of the fund would ultimately have been liquidated; in which event teachers would have had to content themselves with the bare and meagre pensions that the fund's contributory income would have sufficed to finance.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, of the teachers in this regard was very grave in 1926, and graver still in 1928, when the true position of the fund was made known.  It was a matter which brooked no deferment, for each day made the position worse both for the teachers and the Exchequer.  While it is not for me to blame the different interests for what took place, or did not take place, between 1928 and 1932, the fact is that a problem which could have been more easily dealt with in 1928 was left in aggravated from for us, in a much less favourable time, to face.</P>
    <P>When, in these circumstances, we came to examine the position, we saw that if the future pensions of the vast body of the national teachers were to be made secure, the old scheme which had so hopelessly broken down must <Col N="751" /> be superseded by a new one, and, naturally, the financial structure of this new scheme must have regard to the new benefits and advantages which it conferred upon the teachers.</P>
    <P>It has also to take into account the changed circumstances of the times, not merely from the viewpoint of the teachers, but also from that of the general body of taxpayers who could not upon any ground of equity or justifiable expediency be called upon to shoulder the whole burden of making good the deficiency.  Proceeding on this basis a new pensions scheme for national teachers was established with effect as from 1st April, 1934. It gave the national teachers absolute security for their pensions together with certain other benefits and easements.  Against these concessions the salary scales have been revised, and the assets of the insolvent fund taken over.  These latter consist of securities, yielding approximately £50,000 per annum, together with a statutory annual charge on the Church Temporalities Fund of £26,598.  As the assets of the fund have been conserved, the annual income arising therefrom is appropriated yearly in aid of the charge for teachers' pensions, which it is estimated will reach a total of £560,000 per annum in due course.</P>
    <P>To meet this charge there will be available ultimately:&mdash;(1) the annual income of £76,000 from assets of the old Pensions Fund; (2) the estimated ultimate annual saving of £226,000 due to the revision of the salary scales; and (3) the estimated ultimate annual saving of £108,000 of State grants which would have become payable had the fund been continued on the old basis.  All told, however, these will come to only £410,000, and the difference between that figure and £560,000 per annum, has been taken as one of the elements in computing our new capital liability for national teachers' pensions.</P>
    <P>I must now point out how the Exchequer has been affected by the operation of the wise and generous provisions of the Housing Act, 1932, <Col N="752" /> with which I dealt very fully last year.  Up to the 31st March last the Local Loans Fund had advanced to local authorities for the purposes of the 1932 Housing Act a sum of £5,560,000, of which £2,885,000 was for urban housing and £2,675,000 for rural housing.  But, of the amount thus advanced, the State has assumed direct and immediate responsibility for £3,200,000, i.e., 58 per cent. of the whole liability.  The amount credited to the Exchequer assets in respect of the Local Loans Fund is, accordingly, for this reason to be written down by that £3,200,000.</P>
    <P>Account must be taken also of the moneys raised for housing independently of the Local Loans Fund.  So far as can be ascertained, the amount thus borrowed and actually expended on housing to the 31st March last was £3,160,000.  The State is wholly responsible for loan charges on this sum to the extent of 52 per cent.; and the Exchequer obligations accordingly must be written up by £1,640,000.</P>
    <P>The final balance may now be struck. It places the Exchequer liabilities at £61,161,000, with off-setting assets at £33,394,000, and the net State debt at the 31st March last at £27,767,000.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1931-32, after adjustment in respect of the local loans, were: liabilities, £44,878,000; assets, £22,848,000; and net debt, £22,030,000. It will be seen, therefore, that the net State debt has increased by £5,737,000 since March, 1932.</P>
    <P>Attempts have been made to confuse the public mind as to the true cause of the increase in the State debt. The fact that in the greater part it has been occasioned by the State's acceptance of direct responsibility for half the burden of the annuities, has been ignored; as has also the fact that it is in another part due to the generous help which the State has given to the local authorities in connection with housing.  I have no doubt that in similar fashion those who criticise the Government will endeavour to suppress the further fact that the writing-up of the Exchequer liabilities by £3,600,000 this year has been due to the additional responsibility which <Col N="753" /> the State has accepted for national teachers' pensions.</P>
    <P>It is clear in regard to all these matters that they represent only a transfer of burdens within the community; and that there has been no worsening of the position of the community as a whole.  And this was particularly the position last year and in the years before when I detailed the position of the debt in relation to housing, and as it had been affected by the 1933 Land Act.  Notwithstanding, however, attempts were made last year, by misusing the figure which I gave for the net State debt, to prove that our finances had been maladministered and that the community as a whole was much worse off in consequence. Indeed, as is reported in vol. 62, col. 232, of the Official Debates, it was said of us, that we were</P>
    <P>&ldquo;emulating the example of any fool who wins a sweepstake and proceeds to go on a drunken spree&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and again, that we were</P>
    <P>&ldquo;deliberately living from day to day without any regard for the future solvency of this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to dispose of such suggestions, once and for all, and to show how unfounded and irresponsible they are, I have prepared the following account covering the financial transactions and cash operations of the Exchequer from the 1st April, 1932, to the 31st of last month:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Between 31st March, 1932, and 31st March, 1937, there was:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It will be seen that the debit side of this account includes every item of our borrowings.  On the other side, however, in order to put the statement beyond question, I have omitted certain items which might have been credited to the present Administration, as, for instance, the sum of £112,000, which was provided to enable the Dairy Disposals Board to reduce its overdraft in respect of losses incurred from 1928 to 1931.  But even leaving this and other items out of account, it is clear that over the whole five years of our administration, the Exchequer repayments and capital investments and advances exceed the Exchequer receipts from borrowing, repayment of capital, etc., by no less than £8,610,000. These figures give no support to the foolish contention that this Government has been prodigal or reckless in its administration of the nation's finances.  On the contrary, they prove that by prudent management our assets have been not only conserved, but even enlarged.</P>
    <P>Let me return again to a consideration <Col N="755" /> of the net State debt, and refer to the items which have occasioned the increase therein.</P>
    <P>First, we have the reduction granted in 1933 on the land annuities payable under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, which is responsible for an increase approximately of £12,228,000.  If this reduction had been granted ten years earlier, when the 1923 Land Act was passed by the Dáil, there would have accrued to the tenant-purchasers under that Act, by way of savings on their land annuity payments over that ten years, no less than £1,550,000.  Here we may note that in the period from February, 1923&mdash;under the agreement signed in that month&mdash;to March, 1932, no less than £26,803,000 was paid to the British Government in respect of the old land annuities&mdash;as much as would more than twice redeem the additional capital liability imposed on the Exchequer by the reduction in the 1923 land annuities.</P>
    <P>Then the housing campaign has been responsible for a net increase of £4,840,000 in the net debt since 1932. If this campaign had begun even in 1926, and had been prosecuted with vigour and zeal, the housing problem would have been practically solved by now.  True, the net State debt might have been increased in the process, even by so much as £10,000,000.  But if, in the period from 1923 to 1932, by retaining our slums we avoided increasing the State debt, we also contrived to hand over to Great Britain, in respect of Local Loans, from which housing is now so largely financed, no less than £5,871,000.  If we had this sum now to add to the £11,000,000 which had been raised for housing by taxation and loans over the past five years, the financial aspect of that problem would be a simple one to-day.</P>
    <P>The third item in the account is the Teachers' Pensions, in regard to which we have accepted commitments equivalent to a capital liability of £3,600,000.  If this liability had been assumed prior to 31st March, 1932, the obligations of the Exchequer at that date must have been written up by <Col N="756" /> about £3,600,000, in which case the net State debt would have stood then at £25,630,000 as compared with £27,767,000 at 31st March last.  Those who may be concerned at the growth in our net State debt under this and other heads, will, however, find no consolation in the fact that between 1922 and 1932 £12,204,000 left our Exchequer for the repayment of R.I.C. pensions.</P>

      <P>The position as I have put it before the House in regard to (1) the annuities payable under the Saorstát Land Acts, (2) the housing problem, and (3) the pensions of national teachers, will, I am sure, bring home to all how grievous a drain the Secret Agreement of 1923 was on our resources.  But the point will be emphasised when I say that between 1st April, 1923, and 31st March, 1932, there was paid away £47,839,000, which is almost twice the whole dead-weight debt contracted by the State in the 15 years of its existence.</P>
      <P>I note that it has been recently said that in enforcing the Secret Agreement the British Government claims to have collected £22,200,000 by means of penal duties.  Now, how can responsibility be imputed to this Government for that?  We did not sign the Secret Agreement of 1923; nor even the document known as the Ultimate Financial Settlement&mdash;that was done in 1926. Nor did we incite and encourage the British Government to impose the penal tariffs.  They had other mentors in that regard, and it is upon them that the responsibility for that £22,200,000 rests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But one fact of great economic significance has manifested itself in connection with this £22,200,000.  It is alleged that it has been collected from our people.  If that be true, then it has been collected during the very trough of the deepest economic depression the world has known for some generations; a depression during which indeed we have been told to look back <Col N="757" /> to the period anterior, as the Hebrews did, to the fleshpots of Egypt.  Yet the condition of the people has been improving steadily; so that to-day they are much better off than during the five years which preceded the advent of the present Government.</P>
    <P>To what is this happy condition of affairs due?  I venture to ascribe it to the changes which have been made in our economy, to the enlightened social policy which has been adopted by the present Government, and, economic theories and presumptions notwithstanding, to the gain which has accrued to the country as a whole by the retention and use here of the land annuities and other moneys which were formerly sent abroad.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary to detail the changes in our economic life which have taken place since 1932.  We have become in every way more self-supporting, self-sufficient, and self-reliant.  We have given practical and effective expression to the patriotic and economic principles of Sinn Féin.  We have made our people believe in themselves. <Col N="758" /> And we have shown them that under this new dispensation they can care for themselves.  For we have provided them with social services more nearly approaching their due need&mdash; and these on so sound a foundation that they need never be constricted or withdrawn.</P>
    <P>In order to make the facts in regard to this aspect of the Government's policy clear, I am setting out here a table&mdash;which the House can study at leisure &mdash; showing the actual amounts expended on the social services proper, and on certain other similar services during the years 1931-32 and 1935-36.  I have chosen the latter year for the comparison because it is the latest year for which the expenditure has been audited.  The figures for 1931-32 state the expenditure also as audited; so that there can be no question as to the accuracy of the figures or the fairness of the comparison. I also give in the table the official Estimates of the amounts which will be expended in the year 1937-'38 on the particular services under review.</P>

    <P>The table shows that the total expenditure on the social services proper was £7,565,000 in 1935-36; and in the current year is expected to be £8,623,000, as against £3,945,000 in 1931-32.  The difference as between the years 1931-32 and 1935-36 was £3,620,000; and as between the former year and the current year is expected to be £4,678,000.</P>
    <P>In the same way the expenditure on the other similar services was £5,398,000 in 1931-32, as against £6,149,000 in 1935-36, and an expected expenditure of £6,630,000 for the present year.  Excluding the Local Loans Fund from consideration, the increase as between 1931-32 and 1935-36 in expenditure on all the services included in the table was £4,022,000, and as between 1931-32 and the current year is estimated to be £5,480,000.</P>
    <P>I am told that, according to recent pronouncements, not merely are the present social services to be maintained, but in a certain&mdash;shall we say, unlikely&mdash;eventuality, they are actually to be enlarged and expanded, so that according to the Minister for Agriculture an additional £17,000,000 would be required to finance them.  Pensions at 65, complete derating, full-time employment <Col N="761" /> for all the unemployed, etc., etc., etc., to the end of the litany, in which everybody is promised something and nobody is disregarded.  And all, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, without increasing taxation!  In fact, as a happy ending to this Grimm story, taxation is actually to be reduced.</P>
    <P>But how like a confession of final despair is such a programme!  Those responsible for it may promise anything, but their promises cost them nothing, and are worth nothing.</P>

      <P>For, indeed, they cannot believe that they will ever be asked to implement them.  Frankly, I confess that I could not in honesty undertake to do so, neither could this Government, nor do I believe could any other Government in this or any other country.  Moreover, not having the apocalyptic spirit of the Townshends and the Aberharts, I cannot even conceive how it might be done.  I can only point to our social services as they have been enlarged and expanded over the past five years, and tell you what they once cost and what they are costing now.</P>
      <P>But after all, the burden and the duty of explaining does not fall on us. It rests on the authors of this extravagant and delusive programme. They can tell us all, and I think they ought to.  And tell us moreover why all these good things were not given to us when they were in power.  To my mind, the whole thing smacks too much of the &ldquo;damned good bargain.&rdquo; And that is what the intelligent people of the country are saying about it. They know that we cannot increase public expenditure enormously and at the same time reduce taxation drastically&mdash;at least, not without completely disorganising the public finances, and who then will lend the State money to be re-lent at 3 per cent.?</P>

      <P>Since I am dealing with social services, perhaps I ought to say a word about the debt of the local authorities.  The latest figures available in this connection are those for the 31st March, 1936, giving the balance of loans to local authorities then outstanding as £24,573,897.  The corresponding figure at 31st March, 1932, was £15,710,711.</P>
      <P>Most of the increase thus recorded fell under three heads, all relating to housing.  These were:&mdash;£2,071,371 for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, as against £206,896 to 31st March, 1932; loans under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, £9,510,860, as compared with £4,099,166, in 1932; and loans for the Labourers Acts, £6,960,700, as against £5,515,745 in 1932.  Thus over the four years, out of a total increase of £8,863,186 housing accounts for £8,721,124; while increase under the Public Health Acts amount to only £206,567; the increases under all the remaining heads being insignificant.</P>
      <P>Now most of those who have touched on this matter of the indebtedness of local authorities have ignored the fact that the State has completely indemnified the local authorities in respect of a large part of their expenditure on housing since 1932.  When this is taken into account, it becomes clear that the net increase of local debt is in fact much less than the gross figures which I have given. For instance, of an increase of £5,411,694 for the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, the State, under the 1932 Act is, or will be responsible in due course for £2,885,000.  The same applies to the borrowings for the Labourers Acts, where the State pays for £1,110,000 out of an increase of £1,444,955.  Therefore, under these two heads, the net increase in the liability of the local authorities for loans is only £2,861,649, as against the gross figure of £6,856,649 with which they have been debited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the increase in net liability is not an increase in dead-weight debt.  It is offset by the value of the rents which the local authorities <Col N="763" /> derive from their house property.  Even if these do not cover quite all the outgoings there is a balance left after defraying the cost of repairs, insurance and management, which is available to reduce the amount which has to be found out of rates to meet the net charges on the loans.  Capitalising the rents in question on a 35 year basis at 4 per cent., the net increase since 1932 in dead-weight liability due to the Housing Acts is approximately £1,400,000.</P>
    <P>A similar position obtains in regard to the charges held by local authorities under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  Experience has shown that in general these are very well-secured. During the year 1935-36, the amount in default or in arrear in respect of them did not exceed 4 per cent. of the collection. It is quite justifiable, therefore, to offset the increase of £1,864,475 in the liability for the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, by a credit of £1,790,000 on account of the increase in mortgages held against it; giving the net increase in uncovered liability under this head at £75,000.</P>
    <P>Altogether, the net increase in the dead weight of local debt incurred for housing in the four years ending 31st March, 1936, was only £1,475,000, as against the gross figure of £8,721,124, which is so commonly taken and mistakenly used in this connection.</P>
    <P>Similar adjustments might be made in certain of the other items which have swollen the gross figure for local debt during the years we have been considering, but I need not bother the Dáil in regard to them.  It is sufficient to show, as I have shown, that so far from the indebtedness of the local authorities in the period in question having increased by £8,863,186, the dead-weight increase could not in fact have been more than £1,617,000, which does not exceed what is normally to be expected in a progressive community.</P>
    <P>Before going on to consider the prospects for the year, there is a certain series of statistics upon which I should like to make some observations.  I refer to the figures, which are sometimes quoted, giving the net excess of external assets held by our banks over <Col N="764" /> external liabilities; regarding which it was said last year&mdash;I should say by a member of the Opposition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The foreign assets of our banks are, so far as I can judge, the only really reliable thermometer of national wealth, and, as revealed by the Currency Commission report, they are down by £11,000,000 in the last five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reference is vol. 62, col. 235.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this statement, we must start from the earliest reliable figures bearing on this matter, and these are published in Table V of the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin of the Currency Commission for January, 1934.  They relate to the March quarter, 1932.  No earlier figures based on the segregation of the assets and liabilities of the banks as between those held within the Free State and those held elsewhere, are available to the public; though it may be possible to make a reasonable assumption as to the figures for the end of the preceding year.  It is important to note, in this and other connections, that the figures I shall use are based on the average of sets of figures taken for a selected date in each of the three months of the quarter, and covering all of the eight shareholding banks under the Currency Act, 1927, together with the National City Bank, Limited. They are, therefore, beyond question truly representative.</P>
    <P>Now, according to the Currency Commission's figures, the average net excess of external assets of the Irish banks during the March, 1932, quarter amounted to £82.2 millions.  The figure then jumped by successive increases in the next three quarters to reach £91.9 millions for the March quarter of 1933. Shall I be accused of facetiousness if I remark that at this period &ldquo;the only really reliable thermometer of national wealth&rdquo; must have been in grave danger of bursting&mdash;or perhaps it was merely the fantastic thesis which was exploded.  However, after March, 1933, the figure gradually fell to £83.0 millions for the December quarter of 1933&mdash;when, presumably, according to the &ldquo;thermometer,&rdquo; the national wealth had about come back to normal.</P>
    <P>It is clear that quite unusual causes must have been operating to effect the <Col N="765" /> extremely rapid rise in the figures to March, 1933, and the equally rapid fall to December, 1933.  Some of the causes were readily apparent, and I have often adverted to them in this House.  But of course with no effect upon those economic hypochondriacs who go around taking their temperatures with home-made thermometers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is not up to the standard of those which have been established under this Government. I shall refer to these causes briefly again.  The first of these is a matter of common knowledge.  I refer to the accumulation of funds in the Suspense Account which was opened in 1932, and which amounted ultimately to £4,677,000.  We may assume that these moneys were largely invested in sterling securities, and therefore figured in the external assets of the banks, occasioning a net excess under that head.</P>
      <P>As to the second, none of us has yet forgotten the intense uneasiness in regard to money matters which permeated the world in the latter end of 1931, the whole of 1932 and part of 1933.  During this period, in fear of loss and in anticipation of the moratorium which did in fact occur, large sums were withdrawn from the American banks and lodged abroad. Some of these deposits came to our banks and were responsible for a large part of the increase in the figures for the net external assets of those undertakings. When in time stability was restored to the American banking structure these moneys were repatriated, causing a large part of the decrease which we have noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this period also there was another important influence operating likewise.  I refer to the exchange rate between sterling and the dollar.  How important it was may be gauged by the fact that whereas the average dollar-sterling exchange rate during December, 1932, i.e., three months before the banking moratorium, was 3.27, the average rate during July, <Col N="766" /> 1933, was 4.64, i.e., the rate had appreciated in favour of sterling by approximately 40 per cent. in the course of these seven months.  Holders of American funds in December, 1932, could, therefore, purchase sterling securities on a basis of 67 per cent. of the par rate of exchange; and, subsequently in July, 1933, could resell them and repatriate their funds on a basis of 95 per cent. of the par rate of exchange.</P>
    <P>The facts which I have recounted as to the flow of American funds to and from this country during 1932 and 1933 ought to enforce upon us the need for caution in making assumptions as to the origin of assets held by banks.  It is quite impossible, from the figures which are published from time to time by our banks, to say to what extent they do in fact represent funds held to the credit of our nationals, or how much of the accounted assets represents foreign funds entrusted to our institutions for safe-keeping.</P>
    <P>The conversion of the British War Loan announced in June, 1932, was a third factor which influenced bank figures for external assets.  The State, and other Saorstát holders, accepted redemption or realised their holdings and placed the money on deposit with the banks to swell their already large sterling assets.  The reinvestment of these moneys, which in the case of certain very large holders was not completed until 1934, later led to a substantial fall; and this position was reflected in the bank figures for the first two quarters of 1934, which declined from £83,000,000 in December, 1933, to £81,500,000 and £79,000,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>During 1934 a new influence also began to manifest itself with the rise in Stock Exchange values.  For investors who, having realised their holdings and cut their losses had placed their liquid capital on deposit during the slump, began once more to take an interest in the markets; so that deposits tended to be withdrawn again for the purchase of external securities, especially in London.  There also came into play at this time, a new factor of great weight, and from the point of view of our own general <Col N="767" /> economy of even greater significance than the others.  I refer to the great industrial developments which have been the fruit of the Government's policy.  The inevitable consequence has been a considerable increase in the imports of constructional goods, machinery, raw materials, etc., as well as an additional demand for consumption goods by workers engaged on capital construction work in the new industries.  During the three years ended December, 1936, the amount of capital raised by public subscription to finance the industrial revival was not less than £6,277,000, while the amount secured privately might be half as much.  Manifestly this internal investment operated to reduce still further the net excess of our banks' external assets from the abnormal figure which was reached in the beginning of 1933.  But can it be denied that the employment of these idle funds in industry here has been of great benefit and advantage, not merely to the banks, who have found more remunerative customers, and to the private investor, but to the community as a whole?</P>
    <P>All the causes I have referred to have operated to reduce the figure of external net assets of the Irish banks. In the light of them, how can it be said with certainty that the figure for net external assets of our banks having decreased, our foreign assets have decreased in like measure or that we are poorer in consequence, or, as was said last year, that we are &ldquo;living from day to day without any regard to the solvency of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But what gloss will the author of the statement that &ldquo;the foreign assets of our banks are the only really reliable thermometer of national wealth&rdquo; put on the further and later changes in this elusive and very complex concept which we commonly refer to as &ldquo;our net external assets&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The downward trend of the figures we have been considering continued until it reached its lowest with the average of £70,000,000 for the September quarter of 1935.  Thereafter, it began to increase, being £71,300,000 for <Col N="768" /> the December quarter of that year, and £72,100,000, £72,400,000, £72,000,000 for the first three quarters of 1936, culminating in a figure of £72,600,000 as the average for the last quarter of last year.  What those who look on these figures as &ldquo;the only really reliable thermometer of national wealth&rdquo; have to say about them, I shall await with great interest.  But perhaps we shall hear nothing; for I understand that it is difficult to speak when one is swallowing a &ldquo;thermometer,&rdquo; even &ldquo;the only really reliable thermometer of national wealth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But there are two other important facts bearing on this question of the net excess external assets of the banks which I must mention.  One is the position in regard to the sterling assets of the Currency Commission, mainly in the Legal Tender Note Fund, as set out in Table II of the Currency Commission Bulletin.  These assets increased by no less than £3,030,000 between 31st December, 1931, and 31st December, 1936.  I may say, in passing, that this increase is a manifestation of the expansion which has taken place in our internal trade and savings over the period in question.  But the point I wish to stress now is that, in general, legal tender notes are issued only to the banks, and only against drafts on London.  Naturally, any increase in this issue, other elements remaining constant, must occasion a draw on the external assets of the banks, and must be set against any apparent diminution thereof.</P>
    <P>The second fact is that between 31st December, 1931, and 31st December, 1936, the sterling assets to the credit of certain Departmental funds increased by £3,770,000.  This increase is likewise to be set off against any shrinkage indicated by figures for the banks' external assets.</P>
    <P>What, finally, is the position after five years in regard to such of our external assets as are easily traceable? We have four items to go upon.  There is, first of all, the figure taken from Table V of the Currency Commission's Bulletin, showing, as the average position during the March quarter of 1932, that the external assets of our banks exceeded their <Col N="769" /> external liabilities by £82,200,000.  We have from the same source the corresponding figure for the December quarter of 1936, that is, £72,600,000. And we have to add to that latter figure £3,030,000, being the increase in the sterling assets of the Currency Commission between December, 1931, and December, 1936; and we have to add to that again, £3,770,000, being the increase in the sterling assets held by Departmental Funds over the same period.</P>
    <P>On these figures, the foreign assets held under the three heads I have mentioned declined by £2,800,000 between the March quarter of 1932 and the December quarter of 1936. But it is to be remembered that the figures for 1932 show that year to have been a wholly abnormal one in regard to these external assets, and that all the factors which tended to increase these during that year were operative during the first quarter of it.  If we were able to get reliable returns for the banks' external assets and liabilities in the summer of 1931, I dare say that the net excess of the assets would be returned at a lower figure than for March, 1932.  It is not possible, however, to get these figures, and the best we can do now is to surmise what the position was at the end of December, 1931.  In my view, and speaking with every reservation, I do not think we should be justified in fixing the net excess of the banks' external assets at December, 1931, at higher than £81,000,000.</P>
    <P>If we care to take this figure, though it may be a liberally high one, and apply it with full advertence to all I have already said regarding it, we shall find that, notwithstanding the repatriation to their countries of origin of the fugitive moneys which were lodged for safety with our banks in 1932; notwithstanding the withdrawal by our citizens for investment at home and abroad of very large sums which they had on deposit with our banks during the &ldquo;slump&rdquo; years of 1932, 1933 and 1934; notwithstanding the £11,000,000 which since August, 1932, has been raised and expended by the State and local authorities for housing and the considerable sums spent on public health <Col N="770" /> schemes and employment schemes, and on sugar factories, electricity supply, telephones, and so on, there has been practically no change since December, 1931, in the aggregate value of such net external assets as are held by our banks, the Currency Commission, and Departmental Funds.</P>
    <P>We may now consider the position for the current year.  The White Paper which has been presented to the Dáil gives the Estimate for receipts as £31,706,000 and for expenditure as £33,624,000.</P>
    <P>These Estimates, however, assume that the taxes and duties at the moment in force will continue to be charged during the remainder of the year, and that the total required for the Supply Services is that set forth in the volume of Estimates, with the addition of the Supplementary Estimate for External Affairs passed last week.  I may say at once that these assumptions will not hold.</P>
    <P>When it became apparent that the revenue position was favourable, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health secured acceptance for the proposition that the first charge upon any surplus there might be should be for widows and orphans.  The new Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, giving effect to this decision, necessitates a further contribution of £200,000 per annum to the fund, raising the annual Exchequer subvention there is to £450,000.  Our original supply figure of £29,270,269 is to be written up accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has secured leave of the House to introduce a Bill which will amend and extend the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1932, so as to make better provision for the dependents of those who were killed, and for the personal needs of those who were wounded or incapacitated in the conflicts from Easter Week, 1916, to May, 1923.  This proposal will cost not less than £40,000 per annum, and, again, we must increase the total for Supply Services to correspond.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office in 1932, it was evident that the heavy slump in prices which had taken place on the British market in 1930 and 1931 was likely to continue for some years, <Col N="771" /> with serious consequences to the dairy industry.  A collapse would have meant ruin for the dairying districts and drastic measures were necessary to prevent it.  Accordingly, in April, 1932, the Minister for Agriculture introduced the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act under which, in the period which has since elapsed, £3,403,000, supplemented by a further £2,948,000 from the Export Bounties and Subsidies Vote, making £6,351,000 in all, has been provided for the assistance of the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>To show the nature of the problem with which the Government was faced in this regard on assuming office, and as an indication of the great decline in the world value of dairy produce subsequent to 1929, the position of New Zealand butter on the British market may be instanced.  The average price of that butter delivered in Great Britain fell from 173/- per cwt. in 1929, to 138/- in 1930, and 112/- in 1931.  The following year the average price was 101/-, which dropped to 81/- in 1933, and to 73/- in 1934. The value advanced to 88/- in 1935, and last year the average price reached 96/-.  If there had been no intervention of any kind on the part of the Government, the average butter prices received by Saorstát farmers would be, approximately, the same as those cited.  They were, however, appreciably higher in fact, through the operation of the levy, bounty and subsidy system since 1932.  The unavoidable measures which had to be taken to save this most important industry entailed, no doubt, some increase in the price of butter to the consumer, a fact which has been continuously before the Government.</P>
    <P>In the course of the preparation of his Estimates, the Minister for Agriculture intimated that he desired to wipe out completely the levy on farmers' butter and to reduce to a low rate the levy on creamery butter.  Provision has been made already in the Estimates to give effect to the first concession at a net cost to the Exchequer of £33,000. We have now to consider what may be done in relation to the levy on <Col N="772" /> creamery butter and, in that regard, for the butter consumers also.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter as it affects milk producers, the Government has first taken into consideration the fact that whereas no levy has been placed on non-creamery butter, a levy at the rate of 27/- per cwt. has been imposed on domestic sales of creamery butter from the 1st of the current month.  It has been decided to refund portion of this levy at the rate of 17/- per cwt., thereby reducing the net levy to 10/- per cwt., which was the rate in force from the 1st December to 31st March last.  It has also been estimated that if the provision for export bounties and subsidies were increased by an additional £350,000 this year, a reduction in the price of butter to the consumer can be secured.  We propose to provide this sum, which will cover the reduction in the creamery levy, and should enable butter to be reduced at the beginning of next month by 2d. per lb.  Incidentally, it may be noted that the additional subsidy will raise the gross total of the Supply Estimates to £29,860,269.</P>
    <P>I need not point out that this figure of £29,860,269 covers many items of a capital nature which elsewhere, in framing the Budget, would not be brought into account at all.  I may cite, for example, the amounts totalling £355,000 provided in the Estimates under various heads for the new airports.  I have decided, after making due allowance for all contingencies, that towards the acquisition of lands for the ports, and the construction of the necessary works, we shall find £220,000 out of borrowings. Then we have £198,000 for the Industrial Alcohol Factories, for which I propose, if necessary, to borrow £50,000, as well as £49,000 for Property Losses Compensations, and £25,000, being half the amount which it is expected to spend upon new Volunteer halls.</P>
    <P>Due to the difficulties inseparable from launching so large a programme of public works, we completed only half of our Employment Schemes schedule before the close of the last financial year.  We should have been <Col N="773" /> quite justified in borrowing the sum of £125,000 towards the cost of the works actually executed, but it was, in fact, not necessary to borrow. I see no good reason why the taxpayer should not secure some additional advantage this year under that head.  Accordingly, out of this year's figure of £1,500,000 for Employment Schemes, I shall provisionally reserve for borrowing, as against the contingency of an insufficient surplus, the sum of £330,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, bearing in mind what I have already said in regard to the cost of the export bounties and subsidies, I cannot see how any valid objection whatsoever can be raised if we earmark one-half of the total amount required under this head for borrowing, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The items I have mentioned amount, in all, to £1,970,000, and by deducting them from the earlier-given figure of £29,860,269, the latter is reduced to £27,890,269.</P>
    <P>We have now to consider the allowance to be made for over-estimation. And, in that connection, I may remind the Dáil that the art of estimation is nowhere an exact science &mdash;not even in regard to the comparatively simple matter of household expenditure; less so when we come to deal with the affairs of a business concern, and least of all in relation to the expenses of the State with its multitudinous and complicated services, administered by spending departments which are largely independent of each other in the detailed administration of the affairs for which they have particular responsibility.</P>
    <P>Now, each Government Service is estimated for separately item by item, and the Estimate must be so framed that the Minister responsible will always be in a position to show that he has made full and contingent provision for the service concerned.  Thus, every item includes some relatively substantial allowance for unforeseen contingencies.</P>
    <P>What, then, is the Minister for Finance to do when he comes to consider the financial provision to be made during the year for all the items of all the services in question?  He knows that against every single subhead <Col N="774" /> there is debited a sum designed to assure that the amount asked therefor will cover not merely the probable but even the possible cost during the year.  In the Volume of Estimates there are thousands of such items, each carrying its separate substantial quantum of assurance.  Is he to take the simple sum of all these subheads, including their separate assurances, and, slapping the whole burden down on the taxpayer, say, &ldquo;I must have the whole gross amount?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He might justifiably adopt such a course if he had not already made full provision, say, for Sinking Funds; for, in that case, he could profitably utilise for the reduction of debt any surplus which might accrue on the year's working.</P>
    <P>But where proper provision has already been made, as it has been made in our case, for the reduction of debt, the position is altogether different; for, then, a large surplus is not required to do what is already being done by the Sinking Funds. Though if, following a reduction in the rate of taxation, a large surplus does arise as a clear manifestation of improving economic conditions in the country, it is not to be scorned, any more than is a bountiful harvest.  In this connection, I may point out also that it is only on the basis of conditions as they are at the beginning of the year that a Budget may be soundly framed, and not upon our rosy expectations as to its end.  Therefore, if the public finances are soundly managed, large surpluses are the inevitable concomitants of a sound economy.  But they are not to be budgeted for.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the dilemma which confronts the Minister for Finance.  He may not take the simple sum of the Estimates and Budget for that amount, or he will have an unwieldy and, I should say, unjustifiably large surplus. Nor may he under-budget.  He knows, however, that the whole vast business of insurance has been based on the fact that it has been found in practice that the actual amount required to cover a large group of diversified risks is less than would be required to cover independently each separate risk in that group.  But each individual <Col N="775" /> element of risk has been separately and independently covered in the gross total of the Estimates with which he has to deal, and he proceeds to make allowance for that fact accordingly. The difference which past experience has shown to exist between the amount required to cover the group risk of under-estimation for the Public Services, taken as a whole, and the simple sum of each separate element of that risk, as it has already been assured against in the Estimates is the allowance which the Minister for Finance is justified in making for over-estimation when he is framing his Budget.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from what I have said that there is no question here &ldquo;of admitting a mistake of £1,000,000 in preparing the Estimates&rdquo; as was suggested last year.  On the contrary, each individual Estimate has been prepared, as I said, with the greatest care and is as accurate as human foresight, based on long experience, can make it.</P>
    <P>Nor is the figure for over-estimation arbitrarily determined for the purpose of striking a balance, or closing a gap between the two sides of the Budget account.  The allowance is made simply in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary taxation.  Obviously it is the duty of the Minister for Finance to make such an allowance as large as he feels it safe to do, but, of course, no larger.  How large it may be depends entirely on the circumstances of the time.  In periods of stress, when unforeseen circumstances may occasion unforeseen expenditure on a large scale, he will naturally be, as I was in 1932, conservative.  When times improve the allowance can be enlarged; indeed, the better the times the larger the allowance may safely be.  Last year I fixed it at £950,000, and the out-turn of that year has shown that the figure was far from excessive.  We had the same experience in regard to 1935-36.  Accordingly this year I feel justified in increasing the allowance to £1,200,000, thereby reducing the figure which this year's revenue must cover to £31,044,000.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to deal with the revenue position generally I should like <Col N="776" /> to deal with a matter to which I referred last year, and which still causes grave concern to the Revenue Commissioners and to me.  I need not emphasise how important to our Exchequer is the return which we get from income-tax and surtax.  Nor need I dwell upon the ingenious shifts and devices which have been adopted from time to time to escape the incidence of these taxes.  There is, however, one in particular which has been increasingly resorted to.  I refer to the practice of transferring income to children. Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1922, contained certain provisions which were designed to minimise the loss arising from such a practice, but, broadly speaking, these have not been operative in relation to permanent or quasi-permanent settlements.  The result has been that such settlements have been availed of to an increasing extent, whereby the loss of revenue now arising is not less than £16,000 a year.  It will become much more serious if amending legislation be not introduced to curb this practice, profitable to those who adopt it, only at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer who is unwilling&mdash;maybe I should say, who is unable&mdash;to resort to devices of the kind.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to ask the Dáil to legislate to provide broadly that in future the income of an infant and unmarried child which is derived from the parent under any settlement made by the parent or as a result of a transfer of investments made by the parent should (as long as the child is an infant and unmarried and the parent is living) be treated for the purpose of income-tax and surtax as the income of the parent.  The new provision may be expected to save the Exchequer about £5,000 in the present financial year, and not less than about £16,000 per annum in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>Among the resolutions which will be submitted to the House to-day are a number which are put forward, at the instance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture in pursuance of the policy of the Government, to protect and foster native industry.  These will impose a number of new protective duties of a minor character, will consolidate and <Col N="777" /> simplify the existing duties on clothing and wearing apparel, will amend certain of the existing duties, and abolish certain others.  The net effect of the changes on the revenue will be inconsiderable, but they may bring in about £30,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>We may now recall that the White Paper Estimates for Tax and Non-Tax Revenue in the current year amounted to £31,706,000, to which at this stage we may add the two amounts of £5,000 and £30,000, bringing the Estimate for the year's revenue up to £31,741,000.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this figure that for this year we may expect a comfortable surplus, a large part of which has, however, been appropriated already. For £200,000 goes, as I have said, to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions scheme; then £40,000 is earmarked for making further provision for the dependents of members of the Irish Republican Army who were killed in the struggle from 1916 to 1923, and for combatants who were wounded or incapacitated during that period; then there is the cost of abolishing the levy on farmers' butter, which has been taken into account in compiling the Supply Estimates; and, lastly, there is £350,000 required to reduce the levy on creamery butter, and to enable its cost to the consumer to be reduced by 2d. per lb.</P>
    <P>All told, the new concessions and mitigations which I have recounted will cost £623,000 in the present year, of which at least £431,500 must be found out of revenue.  The Dáil will remember, however, that before striking the final figure of £31,044,000 for the year's expenditure we had made due allowance for that fact, and accordingly it is clear that we have still £697,000 as the unappropriated surplus for the year, which we may now dispose of.</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that, judged by the standards which are in force elsewhere, our direct taxes are not so heavy as to be other than fair and equitable.  I am sure, therefore, that if we appropriate virtually the whole balance of the surplus to the reduction of indirect taxation, it will meet with general acceptance.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a couple of minor relaxations in the income-tax <Col N="778" /> code which I propose first to grant. The first relates to the position of registered trade unions which assure annuities.  Sub-section (2) of Section 39 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, provides that &ldquo;a registered trade union which is precluded, by Act of Parliament or by its rules, from assuring to any person a sum exceeding £300 by way of gross sum, or £52 a year by way of annuity, shall be entitled to exemption from tax under Schedules A, C and D in respect of its interest and dividends which are applicable and applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.&rdquo;  I propose to raise the limit in the case of the annuity mentioned in the sub-section in question to £80.</P>
    <P>The next relates to the setting-off of losses.  It sometimes happens that a trader who incurs a loss in his business is unable for income-tax purposes to get the benefit of such loss as a set-off against his profits during the ensuing six years to the full extent contemplated by Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1929, owing to the fact that in some of those years his profits are, for assessment purposes, partially wiped out by allowances for the wear and tear of his plant and machinery. It is considered that a concession should be given to meet this anomaly, and the necessary provision will be embodied in the Finance Bill with effect as from the 6th April, 1936.</P>
    <P>Last year I was able to agree, on the recommendation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to certain concessions to the public in relation to telephone charges.  This year the Minister has pressed for further concessions in regard to other Post Office services, and I am glad to say that I have been able to agree to certain reductions in charges and improvements in services which are estimated to cost in all £43,000.  As the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will shortly be before the Dáil I shall leave to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the pleasant task of detailing the concessions which he has secured.</P>
    <P>My views upon tea as a medium of taxation are well known though they are not shared by everybody.  Indeed, when I introduced my first Budget in <Col N="779" /> 1932, I think the sternest battles in the debate were waged around the proposal to put a modest duty on tea.  Now, however, it is proposed to reduce as from the 14th June next the rate of the full duty on tea from 6d. to 2d. and the rate of the preferential duty from 4d. to &ldquo;nil.&rdquo;  This proposal involves a loss of revenue in the current year of £325,000 and in a full year of £375,000.  It differs very little as regards the burden on the public from the total abolition of the duty, as the yield will be reduced from over £400,000 to about £40,000, and there is some reason to believe that this amount will in fact be borne by the growers.  It <i>does</i> differ, however, from total abolition of the duty in one very important respect, since it maintains an important protective effect which has been in operation for a number of years, and which has resulted in the almost complete transfer of the blending of tea for our market from London to different centres within the Saorstát.  To qualify for the preferential rate of duty not only must tea be the produce of a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations, but it is also essential that it shall not have been blended before importation in any country outside the country of origin.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals which I asked the Dáil to accept in the Budget for 1932-33 was one which I regarded as a very exceptional measure.  I refer to the increase in the stamp duty on the consolidated bank note issue. When I raised the original duty on these notes to 3 per cent., I did not intend that the issuing banks, taking everything into account, would be compelled to provide this form of public currency upon terms which would be definitely unremunerative to them.  Owing, however, to the changes which have taken place in money market conditions since, that position has not been maintained, and the issue is now being made and managed by the banks at a definite loss, of which some large part must of necessity be passed on to their customers.  I propose, therefore, by reducing the stamp duty by 10/- per <Col N="780" /> cent., that is, from £3 per cent. to £2 10s. per cent., to ease the situation to which the maintenance of the duty at the higher rate has given rise.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are interested in the history of our sugar industry will recall that at the end of 1931 the customs duty on imported sugar was at the rate of 16/4 per cwt., or 1¾d. per lb.  That was in 1931.  To-day it is 18/8 per cwt., that is 2d. per lb.; while the excise duty on the home-manufactured commodity is 2/4 per cwt., that is ¼d. per lb., as against 4/8 per cwt., or ½d. per lb., at the end of 1931.  Last year we reduced the customs and excise duties on sugar by 2/4 per cwt., the equivalent of ¼d. per lb.  We are now, I am glad to say, in the position that as from 1st June next we can reduce the customs duty on the imported article by a further 2/4 per cwt., or ¼d. per lb., and the excise duty on home-manufactured sugar by ½ per cwt., or ?d. per lb.  Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teoranta, taking advantage of these remissions in duty, and supplementing them by the reduction which on its own behalf it feels called upon to make, will simultaneously reduce the duty-paid price of sugar to its customers by 2/4 per cwt., enabling a corresponding reduction of ¼d. per lb. to be made to the consumer.  The Exchequer's part in this reduction will cost us £121,000 this year, and £145,000 in a full year.  If the resolutions which I will recommend to the Dáil are accepted, the new rate of the customs duty as from 1st June next, therefore, will be 16/4 per cwt., or 1¾d. per lb., and the new rate of the excise duty will be ½ per cwt., or ?d. per lb.</P>
    <P>One other remission I can grant, and that is as from to-morrow to remit completely the existing duty of 6d. per cwt. on imported wheat, which will cost the Exchequer £170,000.</P>
    <P>The final position, therefore, for this year is that we have, first of all, a surplus providing an additional £200,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, an extra £40,000 for wounds and disability pensions and dependents' allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, a sum of £33,000 against the remission of the levy on farmers' butter, <Col N="781" /> a further sum of £350,000 for export bounties and subsidies, so as to reduce the levy on creamery butter, and to enable the price thereof to consumers to be reduced by 2d. per lb.  Then, having provided for certain improvements in the Post Office services and certain reductions in charges connected therewith, granted certain relaxations of the income tax law and reduced the charges on the consolidated bank-note issue, we have also provided, as from 1st June next, for a reduction of 2/4 per cwt. in the customs duty on imported sugar and a reduction in excise duty of half that amount, so as to permit the price of sugar to the consumer to be reduced by ¼d. per lb. We are abolishing completely as from to-morrow the customs duty on wheat, and by reducing the customs duty on tea by 4d. per lb. intend that article to be by so much cheaper as from 14th June next.</P>
    <P>I have only to say now that the facts and the figures which I have placed, not merely before this House but before the country, speak for themselves. They show that, while the needs of our people have been in every way regarded, what we have done in their behalf has been based upon a solid foundation.  In the best, and in the original sense of that so often misused and misapplied word, we have been conservative.  We have conserved every good thing which was passed on to us, and by prudent management and careful foresight have increased the national estate; so that to-day our little community is stronger in will, stouter in heart, more confident of its future, than it was this time five years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget statement to which we have just listened might possibly be divided into five parts.  The first part dealt with the receipts and expenditure of last year &mdash;how the Budget of last year balanced; the next three parts were devoted almost exclusively to politics, Party politics, and the last part to the Budget of the present year.  The outstanding facts of the situation amount to this, that last year the Minister budgeted to receive £30,191,500 and this year he budgets to receive £31,051,000.  You may say it is an unfair comparison, so I will give him another figure.  Last year he received £31,034,000 and this year he is budgeting to receive £17,000 more.  When we review what are called his concessions, the remissions, the reductions in taxation, we have a right to revert to the sum total of the money which is being levied off the people.  No matter what concessions one grants, what remissions one makes, what reductions are embodied in the Budget, the sum total is the thing which affects the <Col N="783" /> people of the country.  Unfortunately, this Budget is conditioned by the politics of the Government.  One might say the politics of the Government run through their whole financial policy.</P>
      <P>It may, perhaps, amuse the Minister to review the financial agreements of the last 15 years, but at any rate that Government over there have no financial agreements to the credit.  They never made an agreement with anybody about finance.  They merely make scapegoats of civil servants.  In essence, when the agreements that we made in 1923 and which they, by a peculiar political dishonesty of their own call secret agreements, are taken into account, and when the results of them are weighed in comparison with their nonsense of the last five years, we find that their non-agreement is responsible for getting out of the people of this country, at greater cost, at a greater dislocation of trade, at a greater loss to the unfortunate farming community, a sum of money far in excess of that stipulated in the agreements that were made.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of those who are supporters of the Government let me say this, that any agreement that any Minister makes anywhere, or that the Executive Council make, even with their seal, is not worth the paper that it is written on unless Parliament by legislation votes the money.  Not a sixpence can the whole 12 Ministers of State give to any person without the authority of Parliament in this country.  Even that money which is voted under the heading of secret service must be voted before they can spend it.  Obviously they wish to mislead the people of this country into thinking that any Minister of State or any person can commit this State to any financial agreement without the authority of Parliament.  When they seek to do that they are misleading the people and are telling untruths.  Worse than that, when they try to get the people to think that a Minister of State either past or present ever did that, they are telling what they know to be untruths.  Unless they are dishonest, unless they are rogues, or unless they are knaves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will do that.  The Minister, in the course of his Budget statement, gave us a great number of figures.  He takes into account two assets&mdash;I presume he claims to have created them himself. One is a sum of money, some £6,000,000, which was in the Local Loans Fund, and he puts that on the asset side of his account.  The other is a sum of £4,000,000 of what is called the funded annuities.  Those two are regarded as assets.  One is at present in dispute with the British Government, the £6,000,000.  I will allow the Minister to intervene and say that is not so.  He said so last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £6,000,000 is in dispute.  It is still the subject of penal tariffs.  The £4,000,000 represents funded annuities and other things of that sort.  Now, as regards an asset, one assesses the value of an asset from the value of the solvency <Col N="785" /> of the person concerned.  If we are told that the unfortunate farmers have not been able to pay their land annuities, that they have to be put out on a long-dated loan&mdash;then, if that is to be regarded as an asset, he is welcome to it.  I do not think he will get anybody in a banking institution to give the same value to that particular asset.  It is guaranteed to this extent, that if it is not paid the ratepayers will be called upon to meet it.  It is deducted from the moneys voted here, but that is all there is to it.  I submit that these two sums of £10,000,000 have no right to be regarded as assets or as having been created by this Government, and to that extent his balance sheet falls.</P>
      <P>To come back to the Budget itself, we are told that last year's Budget balanced with a surplus of £464,000. I concede that there was a surplus of £464,000.  It is a surplus which can be defended.  There is no bad finance in connection with it, even though the Budget of last year was based on bad finance.  The Minister was proposing to borrow something like £900,000 in respect of bounties and subsidies, but it has not been necessary to do it and there is a surplus.  Let us look at another figure. Last year we were told that a definite and determined effort was to be made on the unemployment problem in this country.  We accepted that in good faith.  We taxed the people of this country to a higher degree than ever they have been taxed before to achieve that purpose.  We started off on the assumption that something like £2,500,000 was to be expended in order to relieve unemployment.  What happened? The unemployment assistance voted last year amounted to £433,325.  There was to be taken from that for unemployment schemes £550,000, leaving a net sum to be spent on unemployment assistance of £883,325.  The unemployment fund itself amounted to £1,675,000 and for public works and buildings we voted a sum of £883,396, making in all a sum of £3,391,721.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was spent?  On unemployment assistance, £1,119,331; on the unemployment schemes, £790,000; on relief schemes, £26,325; and on public <Col N="786" /> works and buildings, £601,707; making a total of £2,537,363&mdash;£854,000 short of what was voted.  Were those votes put up to this House, and was taxation imposed during the year, in good faith, to spend that money?  Had it been spent, the Minister would have been £400,000 on the wrong side; he would have had to borrow from some source or other.  What was the meaning of voting £4 to these unfortunate unemployed people and giving them only £3?  What was the meaning of giving them only 15/-, when we had arranged to give them £1?  Were they so well paid that they did not need it?  Were they not there?  Would it not have been possible to prevent so many of these unfortunate unemployed people going across the water to find employment, if that money had been spent, and was it good business to bring in that Budget here last year and say that we were justified in borrowing money for that purpose? They are the unfortunate unemployed; but we are told now that we have a surplus: that we have a buoyant revenue and that we are doing well. But balancing budgets at the cost of these unfortunate people is not good business or sound business, and the Minister deserves no credit in respect of it.</P>
    <P>This year we are having a higher revenue anticipated than ever we had before.  Circumstances, as the Minister said, all show buoyancy&mdash;people are more prosperous, they are doing better, there is greater scope for the collection of revenue, and yet, when all that is so, it is necessary to vote something like £3,500,000 to relieve and help people who otherwise would be left practically penniless and, possibly, destitute.  Now, this scheme of high taxation presses particularly heavily at the present moment on a country two-thirds of the people of which are engaged on agriculture. We are told by the Minister that the prices of agricultural produce are rising.  So they are, but no thanks to the Government or their policy.  It is the world price.  What are the facts? Why, even in this year's Estimates there is £80,000 for calf-skins&mdash;a potential asset those calves.  In a few years' time, possibly, they might <Col N="787" /> be worth £1,000,000&mdash;but the result of the policy of destruction carried out for the last two or three years in this country is that we are now left short of agricultural produce to sell; and that is now regarded as bringing us into an era of prosperity.  It is a great matter that agricultural prices have risen&mdash;a very great matter&mdash;but the great pity of it is that there was not a wiser policy on the part of the Government to ensure that, when those rising prices would come, we would have the stock to sell.  I notice also, in connection with the Budget of this year, and comparing it with the Budget of a few years ago, that taxation, we have found, and the Minister has found, is capable of being raised in bulk from only the wage-earning classes of this country.  We have a very small proportion of rich people in this country.  Our yield from income-tax and super-tax, etc., is something like £6,000,000.  Out of £30,000,000 it is about one-fifth. I do not know that it is even that much.  Across the water, income-tax and super-tax come to about one-third of the revenue.  Consequently, when high taxation is imposed, it falls upon the classes of persons who, normally, cannot bear any additional burden.</P>
    <P>We find, apart from this Budget altogether, that there are increased costs, arising out of Government policy, on flour, sugar, butter, bacon and several other items, but these are outstanding. These are phenomenal.  A member of this Party went into a shop in his constituency, which is close to the Border, a short time ago, and he purchased a number of items which would comply with the normal expenditure of a family of about six or eight persons&mdash;tea, sugar, flour, tobacco, butter, bread and oaten meal&mdash;and the sum total of the bill was 12/10½.  He crossed the Border and gave exactly the same order in a business house over there, and the bill was 9/10.  What is it that has increased prices here, when agricultural prices are below prewar prices?</P>
    <P>Now, let us look at the contribution that is being made by the Ministry to deal with that situation&mdash;and it is a serious situation: a very serious situation, <Col N="788" /> as they will find out in a very short time, whether they like it or not, and you have the evidence in the City of Dublin and in the City of Cork.  The contribution they propose to make is that they are taking off the duty on wheat, the value of which is £170,000. We consume somewhere around 3,000,000 sacks of flour here, and £170,000, distributed over that number of sacks of flour, amounts to about 1/1½ per sack.  A family will consume, normally, about six sacks of flour a year, and the remission on that, therefore, is 6/9.  The remission on 1 lb. of tea is 4d., and on 10 lbs. of sugar is 2½d.&mdash;that is 6½d. per week, or £1 8s. 2d. in the year.  If you add the 6/9 to that, it amounts to £1 15 s., all but one penny.  That represents 7d. per week.  In other words, 7d. per week is being allowed off now from the person who can buy goods on this side of the Border for 12/10 and, on the other side of the Border, for 9/10&mdash;and that is the contribution towards the solution of our political problem in this country.</P>
    <P>It has been complained of us on this side of the House that whatever contributions come from this side of the House are in the nature of wails and jeremiads and so on.  Within the last 18 months, Deputy Mulcahy referred here on several occasions to the cost of coal, and his calling attention to that matter had the effect of persuading the Minister to take it off.</P>

      <P>The document is on the premises.  Will the Minister produce it?  I have quoted it many times and it has never been held in dispute by anybody.  Assuming that it was not so, and that the Minister is right, why change the law and not let the matter be settled by the courts?  There was an action taken in order to have the matter tested in court and what was the answer of the Ministry?  To bring in a Bill stipulating that the annuities should go into the Exchequer.  However, the point is that Ministers have made no agreement, financial or otherwise, which has not been disadvantageous to this country.  Civil servants made them for them.  They made none themselves.  Let them improve on any settlements that have been made and they will find this difference between the reception that their efforts will get from me and the reception, whatever I did, got from them.  If they can improve on anything I have done, I shall be delighted.  Nothing will please me more.  Whether Ministers like it or not, we are rooted in the soil.  We are Irish, and we realise that any advantage accruing to this country is a national advantage.  It does not matter who is responsible for it, not the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking more as a business man than a politician and I say this is the worst Budget we have had yet. It seeks to collect more money from the people than has ever been collected before.  We do not know what other disadvantages may follow from it. One thing certain is that the signs are all against what the Minister has stated&mdash;the signs of people leaving the country, the signs of the increased cost of living and the unrest that arises out of it, the signs that the people have definitely made up their minds that <Col N="791" /> whether or not the Government reduces the cost of living, the people certainly will put in another Government that will.</P>

      <P>So far as particular sections of this Budget have the effect of reducing the price of certain commodities which are staple articles of food in many working-class families, I welcome them.  But, having regard to the tendency to increase prices, I am afraid that the Budget shows very little appreciation of the difficulties under which working-class people are being compelled to try to make ends meet to-day.  All the indications of the past two years convince one that there has been a substantial upward tendency in the price of certain articles of food and the reduction in prices, which will be effected by the Budget, does very little, except in one particular respect, to bring the price of these articles of foodstuffs down to the 1933 level. There have been complaints on all sides that the effect of the rising prices has been to reduce the purchasing power of very large sections of the people. While there are some sections of the community who, by their industrial or economic strength may be able in some measure to overcome the reduction in the purchasing power, there are large sections of the community who are utterly unable to find any such remedy for the difficulties in which they are placed by reason of rising prices.  The tens of thousands of unemployed people who are registered at the employment exchanges, who are endeavouring to exist on a static income from this source, never had their position readjusted in the light of rising prices.  Agricultural workers who have been employed at low wages in an industry, which has been suffering from unparalleled depression for many years, have not found it possible to secure an increase in their remuneration in order to compensate them for the reduction in the purchasing power of their incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we passed a couple of months ago a Bill to enable an arbitration board to be established, to regulate and fix minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers, we find that the Minister for Agriculture, in <Col N="792" /> the time at his disposal since, has not yet been able to constitute an agricultural wages board, consisting only of 12 persons, which might in some measure enable agricultural labourers to have their particular difficulties dealt with.  The effect of this whole tendency of rising prices has been to inflict, on lowly paid people and on unemployed workers, very grievous injury, indeed, and I am afraid this Budget does not adequately appreciate the difficulties in which these people are placed.</P>
    <P>On the 10th of last month, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to state in respect of the years 1933 and 1937, the average retail prices during the month of January of certain commodities at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Tullamore and Naas.  The figures at Naas and Tullamore were not available.  The Minister provided this very interesting statement which will give the House some picture of the increased cost of living, and enable it to appreciate the extent to which that increase bears with rigour on working class people. The Minister stated that in 1933 the price of coal was 30d. per cwt. in Dublin. In 1937 the price of the same coal was 34d. per cwt.  There is no proposal in this Budget to effect any reduction in the price of coal.  In 1933 the price of household flour was 22d. per stone.  In 1937 the price was 36d. per stone&mdash;an increase of 14d. per stone in the meantime&mdash;and the proposal in this Budget is to take less than 1d. per stone off the increased price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am quoting from the Minister's figures.  Flour, which cost 22d. per stone in 1933, costs 36d. to-day, and now under this Budget it is going to cost 35d. per stone, but the House will notice that there is still an increase of 13d. per stone, comparing the 1933 figures with the figures for 1937.  This Budget does nothing whatever to reduce the price of bread. Bread cost 4¼d. per 2 lb. loaf in 1933, and it cost 5½d. in January, 1937.  That price has been further increased since that date.  In respect of tea, there is <Col N="793" /> admittedly a reduction of 4d. per lb. In respect of sugar, the price in 1933 was 2½d. per lb.  It is now 3½d. per lb., but this Budget is going to take ¼d. off the penny increase which has taken place between 1933 and 1937.  In respect of potatoes, there has been a substantial rise in price.  The average price in January, 1933 and 1934, was 8d. per stone; it rose to 10d. in 1935, and has been 1/- for 1936 and 1937.</P>
      <P>In respect of bacon, which can now be purchased only by a person of very substantial means, there is no proposal whatever in this Budget which will deal with the situation.  According to the Departmental figures, the price of Irish streaky bacon in 1933 was 14d. per lb.  According to the Minister, in January, 1937, it was 19d. per lb., but I should like to invite the Minister to try to purchase Irish streaky bacon at 19d. per lb. to-day. According to the Minister's own figures, therefore, there was an increase of 5d. per lb. between 1933 and 1937, and there is no proposal in this Budget to bring any relief to those who have as much right as the wealthy classes in the community to consume bacon when they want to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beef and mutton prices increased from 1933 to 1937, but that may be due to the fact that the 1933 level was abnormally low.  When we come to put some valuation on the reduction in the price of butter effected by this Budget, we must go back and look at the tendency of butter prices in recent years.  According to the Departmental figures, the price in 1933 was 15d. per lb.; in 1934, 16d.; in 1935, 1936 and 1937 the price has been 17d. per lb.  The reduction in the price of butter which is now taking place under this Budget does nothing more than bring the price of butter back to the 1933 level.  In some counties, of course, the farmers' butter, which fetches a higher price than creamery butter, is much beyond the figure that it was in 1933.  When you come, therefore, to construe the Budget, which gives less than 1d. off a stone of flour, ¼d. off a lb. of sugar, 2d. off a lb. of butter, and 4d. off a lb. of tea, you put those on one side of the account, and remembering that the price of a wide variety of articles&mdash;including these articles, with the exception of tea&mdash;<Col N="794" /> increased enormously from 1933, have increased still further during the past year and are increasing even during the present year, it will be seen that this Budget is not making any satisfactory contribution to the serious economic position which confronts persons trying to follow rising prices with low wages, with no wages, or with a static rate of wages.</P>
    <P>We are told in the first page of the Budget statement&mdash;and the same mentality runs through the whole Budget&mdash; that there has been a general increase in prosperity.  The Minister says in the first page that last year he was content with a total revenue of £30,000,000 odd from taxation and otherwise, but in fact he got £31,000,000 odd, and that he cannot therefore refrain from indulging in retrospect at this not unagreeable development.  In the next sentence he tells us he must claim that this is explainable only on the basis of a general increase in prosperity.  We are told right through the other sections of the Budget statement that there has been that increase in prosperity&mdash;that that is the only explanation for the buoyancy which is displayed in quite a number of figures referred to in the Minister's statement.  I am quite familiar with this prosperity talk which is going on.  It is the stock in trade at every banquet in the city, but it is only at the banquets that the prosperity can be seen; it is only there that the prosperity is heard of.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really believes that there is prosperity in the country, then there are sections of the community who have a claim to share in that prosperity, much better, for instance, than the banks, who are getting a remission in stamp duty under this particular Budget, and much better, probably, than those who are going to get certain concessions under the reduction in Post Office charges. If there is prosperity in the country, then we ought to share that prosperity with the worst-off section of the community, and that is the tens of thousands of people who are satisfying the rigorous test of unemployment imposed under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    <P>With all this prosperity, with all <Col N="795" /> this talk of the relatively small sum of dead-weight national debt, with all this talk of the secure and reliable assets which exist on the part of the State against a large portion of this debt, we can see no evidence whatever of any desire on the part of the Executive Council&mdash;if this Budget is a declaration of their policy&mdash;to deal effectively, to deal sympathetically, with the very worst problem which confronts the country in the form of unemployment.  The minor relief schemes, with their odious condition of rotational employment, have now finished.  There is a large measure of unemployment, particularly in the rural areas throughout the country, and this Budget is not giving any great indication that that problem is going to be faced up to in a more satisfactory way during the present year than it was during the past year. Even worse than the reluctance to face up to the problem of unemployment is the fact that the State seems to be perfectly satisfied with continuing the present miserably low rates of unemployment assistance benefit.  In the face of the increased cost of living which the Minister's own figures indicate, in the face of the well-known and widespread fact that prices have increased and are continuing to increase further, the Executive Council appears to be satisfied with an Unemployment Assistance Act which provides that the maximum rate of unemployment assistance benefit payable in rural areas, and in every town with a population of less than 7,000, is to be 12/6 per week. It is extremely difficult for most applicants to get 2/6 per week. How is a man, in the face of these substantial increases in the price of foodstuffs, expected to be able to make ends meet on the miserable income which he receives in the form of unemployment assistance benefit?</P>
    <P>A question addressed to the Minister for Defence a few days ago elicited the information that, by buying foodstuffs wholesale, the cost of feeding a soldier in the Army for a week was 6/8 and, in some cases, 6/9, and yet an unemployed man is expected to be able to keep himself, <Col N="796" /> his wife and five or six children on twice that amount per week, as well as pay rent, buy clothes for himself, his wife and children and meet all the other expenses incidental to private life.  A question addressed to the Minister for Justice elicited the fact that, again, by buying foodstuffs wholesale, the actual cost of providing food only for a convict was 3/11 per week.  A man in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit cannot give himself, under the Unemployment Assistance Act, the same quantity of food, even if he could purchase it at wholesale rates, as the State gives to a man when it finds it necessary to detain him in a prison in this State.  In the face of these facts, based as they are on official statistics, to talk about prosperity in the Budget, while leaving a problem of that kind untouched, is an evasion of the real responsibility of the Executive Council in this matter.  If there is to be a Budget surplus, it ought to be used entirely to reduce the cost of living, and it ought to be used also to confer benefits on the worst off section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council's responsibility does not end there.  We had declarations from the President in other days that there was no reason why unemployment should exist in this country.  We had declarations by the Minister for Defence to the effect that it was probably a good job there were so many people idle in the country to do all the work that the Government was going to make available for them; and we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of course, with his plan which was going to absorb, not merely every idle worker in the country, but under the operation of which it would be necessary to bring back the emigrants. Now, the position is that, far from bringing back the emigrants, we are not even able to stop emigration from the country itself.  The rates of unemployment assistance benefit are becoming lower every day by reason of the increased cost of foodstuffs and are not able to keep the people in the country.  If there is prosperity, if there is the buoyancy in <Col N="797" /> financial matters indicated by this Budget statement, if there is evidence of widespread prosperity, it is the obvious responsibility of the Executive Council to share it with that section of the community most in need of it.  That is not done in this Budget, and until it is done in the Budget then, from the standpoint of that section of the community, the Budget, while it may make some small contribution to their difficulties, cannot be regarded by any means as a satisfactory Budget.</P>

      <Col N="819" /> This is the Resolution dealing with the imposition of a considerable number of miscellaneous duties upon different articles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he was introducing, at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a number of customs duties, particularly for the purpose of assisting Irish industry.  Will the Minister say what documents either he, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, proposes to circulate showing the effect of each of these items, indicating clearly what the changes are, and indicating specifically those which are intended to improve the position of Irish industry here, and those which have nothing at all to do with Irish Industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have circulated to the House, in connection with this and the other Resolutions, documents of the same purport and content as were circulated the last two years in reference to similar Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to point out to the Minister is that the absence of these documents will throw a considerable amount of work on Deputies and on the House itself when we come to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that I cannot commit the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I shall bring to his notice what the Deputy has said.  I assume for myself that there will be circulated to the House documents of the same purport and content as were circulated during the last two years when duties of this nature were being considered by the House.  I do not know whether Deputies consider that all the information given in those documents was sufficient, but they should remember that there was very full memoranda issued setting out exactly the purport of each item in the Resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The duties set out in Resolution No. 3, now before the House, are not being imposed for revenue purposes.  They are all being imposed for their protective effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, when I spoke originally, I spoke of the relationship of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to these Resolutions, but I now submit that the Minister for Finance has a relationship to them as well.  We had some talk to-day about the surplus that the Minister has in his Budget, but there is this to be remembered: the Minister had to collect £605,000 more from the people in customs duties during last year than he pretended to think at the beginning of the year he was going to get out of their pockets.  If the Minister is now going to tell the House that out of these 31 items upon which he is putting customs duties, ranging from 100 per cent. down to 50, 40 and 25 per cent. he is not going to expect any revenue from them, I want to tell him that he is asking the House to accept a thing which it cannot accept.  I personally should like to warn the Minister that I shall expect him to deal in Committee with what customs duties he expects to get on these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given to the House in the Budget statement our general estimate of the effect which will be produced by the imposition of these minor duties and the changes which are being made in the existing protective duties.  It is thought that we may get £30,000 out of the whole lot.  In the Budget statement I pointed out that so far as protective duties are concerned, they certainly have fallen below the estimate of yield in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that he expects to get £30,000 from the readjustment and extension of the protective duties.  Last year he told us he expected £23,000, but he actually got £603,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates the gigantic nature of the error we are in, and I ask him to be prepared to deal with it on the Committee Stage, because we are told now that he is going to get £30,000 more as a result of these duties.  Last year we were told he was going to get £23,000, and I reiterate that he got £603,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I make on Schedule 3 apply with very particular reference to this Schedule. The position is that for a number of years past, owing to the reduction in the purchasing power of the people, less and less money is available for spending on clothing.  The Minister for Finance would like to shake his head, but he has not screwed up his courage to that.  I would refer him to the particulars given in the introductory chapters to the Trade and Shipping Statistics for 1935, where he will find the answer given to some of the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here from time to time about our people being better shod and better clad than ever they were.  He will find the answer there that less money is being expended by the people every year on boots and shoes and clothing in general.  In that state of affairs the situation requires to be dealt with rather exhaustively both by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Finance, who I suspect is going to get more out of <Col N="841" /> this than he pretends, when we come with this on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes it all the more necessary then that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be prepared to deal thoroughly with it. In a situation where the consumption of clothing has definitely gone down in the last few years and where these new impositions are being put on we should know exactly what the effect is going to be on the price of clothing of these various kinds in this country.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £750,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for Schemes for the Provision of Employment and the Relief of Distress, including cost of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that grants for minor relief schemes are allocated to districts according to the figures revealed by the census of the unemployed, taken in the early part of the year.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be some relationship between the grants and the numbers actually unemployed in a district.  The census of the unemployed is taken in the early part of the year, and the grant is allocated at the end of the year.  In some districts the number unemployed alters considerably during the interval.  I have one area in mind, an isolated portion of Meath, sandwiched in between two neighbouring counties where there has been no land division, no peat development, and the unemployment position has not materially changed during the past few years. When the census of the unemployed was taken it was found that a number of men were working for a short period on a grant, but when grants came to be allocated these men were idle, and although registered in the labour exchange and representations made to the Department, the rules and regulations could not be got over and consequently that area did not get the amount of grant to which it should be entitled.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could do something in future to ensure that an amount of money would be kept over until the winter season and that it should not be earmarked for expenditure until he found out where unemployment at that particular time was most acute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> While offering that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary I say that the minor relief schemes have conferred immense benefit on a section of the community that had hitherto been neglected, and I suggest that a continuance of these schemes would be appreciated.  Two Labour Deputies who spoke on this Vote suggested that the Government had failed to find a solution of the unemployment problem, because the Parliamentary Secretary stated that it would take £15,000,000 to put all who are unemployed into employment for 52 weeks in the year. The Labour Deputies should know that nothing could be further from the truth.  I wonder if they allow themselves to become the echo in the wood for Deputy McGilligan.  Of course, we have a solution of the problem, but it has not been put fully into effect yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £15,000,000 will be less as the position improves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure was more than £15,000,000 last year, and I imagine that it was still greater when this Government took office.  The Labour Party should be the first to admit that. The figure will continue to decrease as the position improves.  I say that the figure is decreasing and that the position is improved.  We have evidence of it if Deputies would only admit it. There is evidence of increased tillage, evidence of land distribution, evidence of the development of the bogs.  All these schemes are as yet unfinished. Then we have the industrial revival in which operations have only commenced. If we take the figures in connection with unemployment stamps sold the year before this Party came into office and compare it with last year there is proof that the position is improving steadily.  In 1931 unemployment stamps to the value of £532,000 were sold while in 1935 similar stamps to the value of £856,000 were sold.</P>

      <P>The rotational system has come in for some criticism.  At the outset, I say that the rotational scheme is fundamentally sound.  If the Government is not in a position to give six days' work to the workers, the next best thing is four days or three days, as the case may be.  There is nothing wrong with that system, and I find that it has worked successfully in respect of works under local bodies or under Government Departments where a full daily wage was paid.  The question of its adaptability to minor relief works however might possibly be reconsidered in the light of the experience gained by the Department during the past year. There have been some complaints, and I myself have received complaints. The big grievance, as I see it, is that the remuneration is only maintenance and is nothing approximating to a family wage for a working day.  When a married man finds that he has worked a certain period and has not got remuneration approaching a family wage, he feels that he has a grievance. We know that the Government accepted responsibility for providing work or maintenance for all working men.  Until our policy is put into full operation, it is not possible to provide work for all our workers for the 52 weeks of the year.</P>

      <P>The dole, as we know it&mdash;unemployment assistance &mdash; was given as a pledge of the Government's sincerity when they stated that they would give maintenance to the people, but when that dole was put into operation, we had all classes in the community raising their voices in condemnation of its demoralising influences. Therefore, it was necessary to consider some other scheme to take its place, and the rotational system was substituted.  If hardship was inflicted on the workers by the introduction of the rotational system in respect of minor relief schemes, I think the Parliamentary Secretary will be the first to admit that any defects in that connection should be remedied.  I submit that it is worthy of his consideration.  Of course, the prospects for the coming year are much brighter, and I believe the Parliamentary Secretary will not be faced with the responsibility of providing for so many unemployed next season. He can go forward in the knowledge that the principle of the rotational system is sound, and that if changes are to be effected, they should be effected before the system is put into operation next season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary could afford to experiment and to attempt to bring the scheme into consonance with the requirements of heads of families who may be working for short periods on minor relief schemes.  I know there are difficulties, but these difficulties are not insurmountable. I know also that no relief scheme can be perfect.  The very fact that it is a relief scheme proves that it is not an employment scheme, but a substitute for an employment scheme, and, as such, will never be perfect.  It may not be possible financially to drop the scheme at the moment, and, if it were dropped and some other scheme substituted, that substituted scheme would have its defects also.  No relief scheme can be <Col N="864" /> perfect, but I must say that I have sufficient faith in the creative genius of the Parliamentary Secretary to believe that he can evolve a scheme which will eliminate all the existing grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing nobody on this side can object to, and that is the faith which Fianna Fáil Deputies have in their leaders. Deputy Kelly is satisfied that the lot of the unemployed is going to be all right.  His faith in the creative genius of the Parliamentary Secretary tells him that the unemployed are in perfectly safe hands and the outlook for them in the future is particularly bright.  What justification has the Deputy for saying that?  The Deputy and his colleagues should be apologising to the unemployed of this country. They are the Deputies who went before the unemployed five years ago, and told them that they had considered the whole question of unemployment here, that they had planned how they would put those men at work, that that plan had been tested by men who knew how to test it and found completely watertight, and that, in the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with a few of the important industries, they would put so many men into employment that there would not be enough idle hands in the country.  The President told us that if there was a Christian Government in power in this country, we would have no unemployment. The President told us that we had a solution for the unemployment problem such as no other country in the world had.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in his own constituency in York Street in 1932, said that within twelve months of the Fianna Fáil Government coming into office, there would be no unemployed in this country.  Those are the Deputies who come here after five years in office and tell us that the plan is in operation, but that the full effects of it will not be seen for a couple of years. That is not what you told the people in 1932 or 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan is in operation.  What has made the biggest impression on the <Col N="865" /> numbers of unemployed in this country since Fianna Fáil came into office? The numbers of workers, young men and women, who have fled from the country to Great Britain&mdash;at least 80,000 in four and a half years.  The Deputy talks about the industrial revival and the Minister claimed three years ago that there were over 300 factories started in the country.  At that rate of progress, I suppose there must be 900 new factories started now; but, notwithstanding that, notwithstanding the fall in population and notwithstanding the operation of the period orders which deem thousands of people to be at work, whether they are at work or not, they have never yet been able to bring the figure below 90,000, although, in the last 12 months, over 28,000 boys and girls left this country through Saorstát ports, not to talk of those who went from Derry and Belfast.</P>
    <P>Deputies talk about unemployment. We are told that the unemployed are safe in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The creative genius who is in charge of the unemployed is the man who said in this House that anybody on this side who would stand between the unemployed man and a wage of 21/- per week would be torn limb from limb.  To such straits has the Fianna Fáil policy brought the workmen of this country that, in the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary, if anybody dared to stand between them and the wage of 21/- per week, they would be torn limb from limb.  In these circumstances, we are told by the Minister for Finance that the country is prosperous, that the signs of prosperity are everywhere around us.  The fact that thousands of our best citizens are fleeing from a country supposed to be prosperous is the most devastating commentary that could be made upon that statement in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly talks about maintenance. He says that if the Government did not provide work, they provided maintenance.  They provide 6/- per week for single men&mdash;less than 1/- per day.  Does the Deputy contend that that is sufficient to maintain <Col N="866" /> any human being in this country? They provide 12/6 for a man with a wife and from four to ten children in a rural area or in a town with a population of less than 7,000.  Does the Deputy contend that, with the cost of living soaring, as it has been soaring for the last three years, it is possible for a man to maintain himself, his wife and children on 12/6 per week?  Is the Deputy aware that the stone of flour, which could be bought by that workman or by his wife three years ago for 1/6, is to-day costing from 3/- to 3/2&mdash;an increase of more than 100 per cent.? Would the Parliamentary Secretary or the Deputy tell the House how many stones of flour would be consumed by the ordinary family living in the country in a week if they could afford the purchase?  Will the Deputy or the Parliamentary Secretary agree with me that a married man with a family of five would use four stones of flour per week, if they could afford it, in those households in which the bread is baked at home?  Whereas that flour could be purchased for 6/- three or three and a half years ago, to-day it is costing from 12/- to 12/6. I should like some of the Deputies to try maintenance for a week on the rates which they, apparently, consider enough for these men.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any conception of the increase which has taken place in the prices even of the necessaries of life for the last two or three years?  Those prices are still soaring. The relief given in the Budget to-day will mean very little to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says that the rotation scheme has proved to be fundamentally sound.  It is the most fundamentally unsound scheme, from every point of view, that was ever started in this country.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary considered what the married man getting four days' work receives at the end of the week to maintain himself and his family?  He receives 16/-, less insurance.  That is under a scheme that is fundamentally sound! A single man receives 12/-, less insurance.  Even under the schemes that are run by, or with the co-operation of, the local authorities, there is not a great deal of <Col N="867" /> difference.  For three days' work a man in my own county receives 13/7 net, and for four days' work 18/7.  The first charge on this sum of 13/7 or 18/7 in the case of men living in urban areas is from 3/6 to 5/- for rent. Having paid that rent under a scheme which the Parliamentary Secretary has described as &ldquo;fundamentally sound,&rdquo; what is left to buy flour at 3/2 per stone and butter at 1/5 per lb.?  We need not talk about meat now because, so far as the unemployed are concerned and so far as a good many of the employed workers are concerned, meat is beyond them.  They cannot afford to buy it.  Deputies ought to face up to the realities of the situation.  I am satisfied that Deputy Kelly knows what the position is quite well.  Notwithstanding all the industries established, notwithstanding all the extra tillage which is claimed, notwithstanding all the moneys borrowed by local authorities, notwithstanding all the experiments made by the Parliamentary Secretary, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Committee over which he presided for nearly three years, we are faced with the position that, in a country with a falling population, with from 70,000 to 90,000 of our boys and girls gone to Britain in five years, with thousands laid off and deemed to be at work under period orders, with hundreds of claims suspended from day to day for investigation, and with all the other subterfuges, you still have 93,000 persons signing the register.  In face of that and in spite of the fact that the young people are going to Britain in thousands, the Parliamentary Secretary, after sitting on novel schemes for three years, confesses that he was unable to spend the money voted by this House last year, of which local authorities had to find practically one-third.  That is dealing with unemployment in a serious way! I attended a meeting in my own town on Monday night, and one of the matters under discussion was this flight to England.  One unemployed man asked who could blame the people for going to England, and indicated that, if they had their fare, thousands more would go.  Deputies know that that is quite true.  Neither Deputy Kelly nor <Col N="868" /> any other Deputy can get up and truthfully say that there is any plan in the possession of this Government which is going to solve unemployment.  Their major policy is cutting across the solution of the unemployment problem. Whatever efforts are made by one Minister to provide employment are being offset by the general policy of the Government.  Those are the facts. Deputies cannot deny them.</P>
    <P>Deputies, I am sure, will admit that when the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed through this House the rates of benefit provided under it were, God knows, small enough.  Will any Deputy on any side of the House contend that the rates which are the same to-day will purchase anything like the same amount of food as that rate would purchase when the Act was passed in 1933?  Not a single Deputy would contend that.  I ask Deputies to face up to those facts and not to try to talk along the lines travelled by Deputy J.P. Kelly.  Deputy Kelly has not succeeded in deceiving anybody who is dealing with this unemployment question, except perhaps himself.  With all respect to the Deputy, I do not really believe that he himself believed what he was saying when he said he had absolute faith in the genius of the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with unemployment. I do not believe it for a moment, because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has not given any cause to prove to any Deputy in this House or to show the country why anyone could have any faith in his ever doing anything towards solving the unemployment question in this country.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy J.P. Kelly and the Parliamentary Secretary to say here and now whether the plans which we were told about in 1932 ever did exist? If they did exist let them be produced to this House and to the country.  If that plan does not exist, Deputies on the Government side ought to admit that they succeeded in deceiving many sections of the community in 1932 and 1933.  Many sections of the community have suffered as a result of that deception. But there is no section of the community that has suffered more &mdash;and, as far as I can see, are likely <Col N="869" /> to continue to suffer&mdash;than those who are looking for employment and cannot get it.  We heard £15,000,000 mentioned.  Deputy J.P. Kelly thinks that conditions have improved as far as employment in this country is concerned. I wonder does he really think so?  I wonder does any member on the opposite side of the House believe that?  I wonder is there any member of the Labour Party who believe it? I do not believe there is, because the members of the Labour Party are fairly close down to what the position is.  Many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches are as close down to what the position is as we on these benches are.  A great many of them are in as close touch with the workers and with the poor as we are.  When they meet the people day after day in their constituencies they must know the extraordinary position to which the unemployed have been reduced. I want to say this frankly&mdash;and it is not anything to be proud of&mdash;that to my own knowledge in my own town, which is a typical provincial town in this country, I have seen greater poverty and more widespread poverty during the last winter than I ever saw in my own time.  I have confirmation of this statement from the officers of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. These are the facts.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Deputies on the opposite benches, I never did say that it was an easy matter to find work for every unemployed person in this country. I never said so.  If it were so easy a matter, then every country in the world would have work for the people looking for it.  The difference between myself and my colleagues on this side and Deputies on the opposite benches is this&mdash;that we never attempted to deceive the unemployed into believing that we could provide work for every man and woman in the country by simply waving the magic wand of Fianna Fáil over them.  Deputies on the opposite side told us that they were going to start factories in every village and cross-roads within 12 months after the general election in 1932 and 1933.  I do not expect any Government to do impossibilities.  But that is exactly what Deputies on the Government side of the House told <Col N="870" /> the people in 1932 and 1933 they were going to do.  That is what the President himself said.  That is what the Minister for Industry and Commerce and every member of the Party and follower of the Party through the country told the people they were going to do.  Now, having failed to do these things, they still want to bluster and pretend that they have succeeded.  The fact is they have not succeeded and they know they have not.  The result of the activities of the Party opposite over the last five years has not been to reduce unemployment in this country but to increase it.  Every person in the country knows that.  There is no Deputy living down the country who does not know it.  I would go so far as to say there is no Deputy here in Dublin who does not know it.  There are very few Deputies, and I am glad to say very few of the unemployed, who now believe that there is any hope of the Party opposite providing employment for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I confess I have not the same faith in the creative genius of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance as Deputy J.P. Kelly has, nor do I believe in that sympathetic regard for the unemployed which Deputy Kelly attributes to him.  I am only judging the Parliamentary Secretary by his record in dealing with unemployment. I am judging him by the standards he would set for the unemployed and by his statements in this House and his actions outside the House.  We have had his standard of 21/- a week.  Just imagine the Parliamentary Secretary believing that unemployment was so bad in this country that if any man dared to stand between an unemployed man and this wage of 21/- a week, he would be torn limb from limb.  If that is the position the unemployed must be reduced to a terrible state indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember the wages that were originally fixed for the Shannon scheme in Limerick.  Some Deputies here gave us outside support for the stand we took up at that time. There was a time when these Deputies would not stand for a minimum wage of 32/- a week.  Now they are standing for and supporting a wage of 21/- a week. <Col N="871" /> I invite anyone to say whether there is any comparison as to the amount of food which could be purchased at that time £ for £, and the amount that can be purchased to-day.  Deputies themselves know quite well that what could be purchased for 14/- four or five years ago would to-day cost £1.  The Parliamentary Secretary may smile, but that is the reason why to-day in his own constituency in Cork there are 1,300 men on strike.  That is the reason why there are to-day in Dublin 12,000 men on strike.  It is because the cost of living is soaring, and the wages are chasing after the cost of living.  That is a fact and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it is a fact.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy here who knows anything about actual conditions and who has any knowledge whatever of the workers and of trade union conditions knows that the soaring cost of living is the main justification for the demands which are being made by trade unions in this country for increased wages to-day.  If the cost of living is driven up wages must follow. Men must live.  That is all right for those who are in employment and who have sufficient sense to be members of trade unions.  They can band themselves together as one man, and when they have a just cause they can throw not only the full strength of their unions, but the full weight of public opinion behind them.  But it is different in the case of those who are unemployed.  Some of those have got no work during the last four or five years except very casual work.  These men are not banded together in any organisation, and they cannot make their case and their fight as one man. I invite Deputies on the opposite side to go down and tell the people who are trying to maintain themselves either on rotation work or on unemployment assistance that they are well able to do it and that the rotation scheme is fundamentally sound.  I say that it is the most fundamentally unsound scheme that was ever started in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not for a moment stand over low wages, but it would be very interesting if a census were taken <Col N="872" /> of the actual rate of wages paid in agriculture for the last ten years.  I believe it would show a very low rate of wages all over the country, and it would be a revelation. In the course of his remarks Deputy Morrissey referred to unemployment assistance and the rate of wages for a single man and a married man.  Whilst I leave the theme of Deputy Morrissey's speech to be dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary, I want to say in passing that 6/- or 12/6 a week is better than nothing a week&mdash;the state of things that obtained five years ago &mdash;and that the winters for the unemployed are not so hopeless now as they were during the reign of Cumann na nGaedheal, because there are certain periods of work to look forward to, and conditions have improved yearly since Fianna Fáil took office.</P>
      <P>Coming to one of the aspects of this Vote, namely, that dealing with minor relief schemes, the Parliamentary Secretary expressed the desire for as many minor relief schemes as possible to be forwarded for consideration. Whether I interpreted his speech rightly or not, I took him to indicate that there was likely to be a shortage of these schemes.  Speaking for the part of the country which I represent, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that we have enough schemes relating to cul-de-sac roads, bog roads, secondary roads and minor drainage schemes to keep his Department going for the next ten years.  I think in the system he is working out that there should be a period definitely fixed in which schemes should be submitted so that they can be examined and possibly done in the current financial year or the following financial year. I think there should be a definite date indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I would like to emphasise is that the Board of Works should pay more attention to drainage schemes, particularly in the summer. Drainage schemes have been submitted periodically from various parts of the country.  We are always told that during the peak period of unemployment in the winter it is impossible, because of the conditions obtaining, to do these drainage schemes.  Then summer comes on and they cannot be <Col N="873" /> done because of the increased employment in particular areas.  They are not done and the schemes remain hanging over, and in this way they are sent from year to year to the Board of Works.  I contend that there is an absolute necessity to do some of these schemes because they are of great utility.  I might illustrate my point by referring to one scheme on which there was £50 expended by way of drainage.  It happened to be a dry winter and it was possible to do it. The spending of that £50 was very beneficial because it exposed turf in a bog area, and turf has been available ever since in a place where up to that they never suspected there was turf available.</P>
    <P>The contention is put up to the Department that when these schemes are done there is no provision made for maintenance.  They say that the Board of Works have to take into account the question of maintenance when the work is done.  I put forward the suggestion now that if these schemes were done periodically, say every five or six years, their utility would be maintained.  The same system might well be applied to everything that comes under the term of minor relief work.</P>
    <P>As regards the rotational system, it has got a lot of criticism here.  I am not going to say anything for or against the rotational system.  It is on trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in my own county&mdash;I want to draw special attention to this&mdash;I saw too literal an interpretation of the rotational system.  I saw a main road in the making.  Men were sent into the quarry to do two days' and three days' work and the plant on the roadway had to discontinue.  The period was increased and still they could not feed the plant and eventually the men had to be put on whole-time employment. There should be an examination of the actual requirements before there is an application of the rotational system.  I am aware of the benefits of the rotational system and there are places where it is the best <Col N="874" /> that can be done, but I contend there are circumstances here, there and everywhere when there is no need for its application.  That applies more particularly where there is a work of urgent necessity.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot from Deputy Morrissey about the emigrants to England. He told us nothing about those who were disillusioned and have come back. He did not make any reference to the numbers of emigrants who were on relief in England.  So far as I can gather from talking to some of those who have returned, the employment question is not as rosy as we are led to believe.</P>

      <P>I have a few words to say upon the way this Vote is being administered.  I have listened carefully to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He made his usual speech and asked for suggestions from Deputies.  He said that any proposed schemes would get the greatest consideration and they would be judged on their merits.  I would like to think the Parliamentary Secretary was sincere, but I am sorry to say that from my own experience of how this money is being administered I think it has been used for the benefit of one political Party rather than for the public service for which it was originally intended.  In the first place, what type of men are appointed as gangers?  Is it a coincidence that they happen to be either the chairmen of the Fianna Fáil clubs or the most active members of the clubs?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary stand for that sort of appointment of gangers?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the appointment of gangers, and is he responsible for the fact that the most fitting and deserving men are passed over in many cases?  Would the <Col N="875" /> Parliamentary Secretary agree that, where it would be possible to name 100 &mdash;well, perhaps not 100, but at least 20 or 30&mdash;registered unemployed, it is right that a man in comfortable circumstances and with about £200 a year coming into his house is a suitable man for such a position?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary stand over that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, when I send in recommendations, I must say that I always get a courteous letter in reply, but that is all that comes of it.  I sent in details of suitable schemes that ought to be carried out, and time and again I recommended schemes that should be undertaken, but they were passed over because, presumably, the recommendations did not come from the right political quarter.  They were passed over in favour of other schemes that, presumably, did come from the right political quarter.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will look up his files, he will see how many proposals for such works I sent in, and that were, for one reason or another, allowed to lapse.  Of course, I got a lot of promises to the effect that, when the money would become available, these schemes would get consideration, but it seems that, when the money did become available, the schemes never got consideration, except in a few instances which were not very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that a fair way to administer the public money, and does it make it any better for the Parliamentary Secretary to profess, in this House, to be a very impartial gentleman and even to tell the House that there were two Deputies Hugo Flinn&mdash;one a politician and the other a benefactor of the poor?  Now, which of the Deputies Flinn is responsible for these things to which I have referred?  I should <Col N="876" /> like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary explain these things here, but I should much prefer that a public inquiry should be held in County Cavan into these matters, and if the Parliamentary Secretary grants that public inquiry, he will find out how the money is being spent and what the public thinks about it.  That money should not be spent to cut up the people, but to relieve the unemployment problem, and it should be dealt out fairly.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  The Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to get suggestions, and on many occasions suggestions have been made to the effect that drainage is a more useful work than making roads where there are already too many roads, as there are in some cases.  Of course, I know that drainage cannot be done very well in winter, but some drainage could be done in the winter, and certainly a good deal of drainage could be done in the summer.  Well, I think that all the minor schemes in the summer season should be filled so as in some way to balance the expenditure of money as between these two types of work.  I do ask the Parliamentary Secretary to pay a little more attention in the future to recommendations that are sent to him, no matter from what side of the House they come.  Otherwise, he is leaving himself open to the charge of corrupting the people.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to intervene for one moment, Sir. Deputy McGovern, in the most genial manner possible, has made the same speech that he made on a previous occasion, in which there were accusations of favouritism of one kind or another.  Following that previous speech of his, I wrote to him and quoted to him the words he had used, and I asked him to substantiate his charges.  I spent quite a long time trying to get out of him any shadow or scintilla of evidence that he had in his possession in support of his accusations, but he failed to produce any.</P>

      <P>On this Vote for employment schemes, Sir, I want to join with other members of the House who have protested against this abominable and reactionary policy of part-time work.  Many of us, of course, are inclined, from time to time, to lay all the blame on the Parliamentary Secretary.  Personally, I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am sure that, on more careful consideration, nobody else would blame him.  He is, I feel sure, merely giving effect to the policy of the Government.  It is the policy of that Government which promised the unemployed they had a plan by which they would be able to put all the unemployed to work immediately they got into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with that plan, the President himself said that they had got to find a plan.  I think it was in Cork that on one occasion the President said that unemployment was becoming such a menace in this State that it would destroy the State. He also said it was the duty of the Government of the day to destroy a menace of that kind.  He said, further, that they had got a plan by which they <Col N="878" /> proposed to end that menace.  The Minister for Defence also, speaking on a debate on unemployment in this House in, I think, the November or December before Fianna Fáil came into office, said that they were very glad to know that there were so many people unemployed because, he said, &ldquo;When we get over there&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the Government Benches&mdash;&ldquo;we want everyone of them to do reconstruction work and all the work which we have in mind for the building up of our country.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said, in or about the same time, that not only would they be able to put all the unemployed people at home to work, but he was afraid that in order to fill up the vacancies they would have to send cablegrams to America to get home our kith and kin who had gone out there to seek a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I think it is about time that we had some admission from the Government as to whether there is really a plan or not.  Deputy Kennedy made a very weak apology on the subject this evening.</P>
    <P>County councils and local authorities generally throughout the country have been passing resolutions protesting against the system of rotational employment for more reasons than one. First of all, they regard it as of very little benefit to unemployed ratepayers in their area.  Secondly, they cannot get the standard of work expected, particularly where subsidies have to be found from local rates for the provision of the work.  Even in the President's own constituency, the Clare County Council, composed of a large majority of supporters of the present Government, unanimously passed a resolution protesting against this reactionary system.  I notice myself, in recent times particularly, a complete lack of that enthusiasm that prevailed in the Government Party in regard to the abolition of unemployment. I should like to see a continuance of that enthusiasm with some effect given to it.  I listened the other evening to an explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to an incident that occurred in the distribution of certain documents.  I have not seen them and I do not know <Col N="879" /> what they were but, in any case, I, like other Deputies, expected that there would be one addressed to myself, but I was informed that they were only for members of the Government Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the House, because, personally, I have sent in schemes and many of them are yet awaiting attention. I am sure that many other Deputies also have not been behind time in sending in schemes for the provision of work in various districts and they are yet unattended to.  In one particular case, I might remind the Parliamentary Secretary that quite a number of farmers who have always tilled their lands and paid their rates and annuities have written several times very strongly on the matter, but yet the road to their holdings is left in the same impassable condition.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this Vote which I should like to mention has reference to aged unemployed workers.  In bold, bad England and in the black North workers who reach the age of 65 can enjoy State pensions.  On the other hand, in this State of ours we find that under our Christian Government they are arraigned before courts of referees and told that if they do not walk four miles to relief schemes, and four miles back in the evening, they can do without any unemployment assistance. I think that is a matter the Government should rectify, and the Parliamentary Secretary should take steps to ensure that people who have served their country to the best of their ability up to the age of 65, or even 55 years, if the State is not prepared to provide pensions for them as neighbouring States have done, should at least be accorded some humane treatment and should be allowed to continue to receive unemployment assistance until they are given suitable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the general low standard of wages.  There is no need for me to stress that point. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="880" /> heard all about it before, but I should like to remind him that many of the workers employed on relief schemes do not get 21/- or 24/- a week. In many cases they get only 12/- or 15/- per week, out of which they have to pay national health insurance.  In many cases they are upset to such an extent with their claims at the labour exchanges that they may be a fortnight or three weeks without getting any money.  Representations are made to the county councils to pay them weekly, but I think that the Department responsible should have taken some action to see that the county councils arranged to pay wages weekly to men employed on these schemes. That is all I desire to say on this Vote. I hope the Government will make some earnest effort to give effect to the promises that were so lavishly given before they took up office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only reasonable, I suppose, to expect that members of the Labour Party would be fairly critical of the rotational employment scheme.  It is only reasonable, I suppose, to think that they should get up in this House and denounce such employment, but I think that it is only right, too, that one should expect from members of the Labour Party recognition of the fact that members of this House&mdash;I am sure, on all sides&mdash;are just as anxious as they to see that every unemployed man gets, not rotational work, but work for the 52 weeks of the year, at full time, if that is possible.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing his Estimate, referred to the cost of a scheme of public work for the provision of whole-time employment for all the unemployed. We have not heard members of the Labour Party say whether the provision of such a sum of money to give such employment is possible.</P>

      <P>We should like to hear the members of that Party directing their attention to that aspect of the problem.  While, as I say again, all of us would desire to see a scheme of full-time employment introduced to provide for all men who are genuinely <Col N="881" /> seeking work, if, and when, that is difficult or impossible, and when members of the Labour Party challenge us to say whether or not we stand for this rotational scheme, I, for one, without hesitation, either here or outside, say that I whole-heartedly and absolutely support such a scheme.  I am prepared to defend it with whatever limited ability I possess.  I am prepared to defend the principle, and I see nothing wrong with it, of asking men who, perhaps through no fault of their own, become unemployed and who, as a result of their unemployment, become a charge on the State, to give to those on whom they are a charge some return in the way of doing work that would not otherwise be done by the State or by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, you made your case, and it was not a great one.  That is my answer to members of the Labour Party on that criticism.  It naturally is a political Party that must come in here and denounce the Government for the reason that the Government has failed, as they say, to provide a scheme of full-time employment for all those who are on the register and in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit.  Deputy Pattison referred to the fact that he was not in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary gave his explanation as to how certain forms&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  When the Parliamentary Secretary proceeded to explain how those forms came into our possession, Deputy Pattison pointed out that he and some other Deputies had made quite a number of recommendations to the Board of Works for certain schemes in their counties in which they were interested, and that so far those schemes had not materialised.  I can assure Deputy Pattison that, as far as the Parliamentary Secretary's invitation to members of his Party for assistance in this particular way in the provision of suitable schemes in <Col N="882" /> certain areas from which he had no applications is concerned, it is no blessing at all to any Deputy.  It certainly means a good deal of extra work, and work which most Deputies&mdash; I think I can include myself amongst them&mdash;are not seeking.  All of us have the same experience as Deputy Pattison in regard to applications which we have made over a number of years, and in spite of further requests for more schemes we find that in some cases hundreds of schemes which we have recommended over that period have not yet, for one reason or another unknown to me in so far as they refer to my county, been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that I did not allege that there was preferential treatment in the allocation of schemes. I would not for a moment allege that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, A Chinn Comhairle, that a Deputy from my own county&mdash;I was in the House only during portion of his speech&mdash;made a charge in which he accused the Board of Works of using public money for the purpose of corruption.  He, too, made the charge that schemes recommended by him had not got the attention and recognition which he expected them to get.  Deputy McGovern, as they say in his part, is no youngster, and I am sure that he can take his mind back to a period when a previous Government was in office here.  I am sure he can take his mind back to the system that was then in vogue in regard to allocating and supervising works of this character, and I am sure that, even if he will not concede it, the general public in our constituency certainly will concede that there is no comparison whatever between the organisation which exists in the Board of Works to-day and the scheme as it was then carried out under that previous administration. During that period men were selected at random and given sums of money with which to carry out any kind of scheme they liked, <Col N="883" /> in any part, in any parish, or in any area&mdash;men who had absolutely no knowledge whatever in the selection of works, and cared little except to use that money for purposes which must have been obvious to everybody. Deputy McGovern now comes along with this allegation, when you really have an efficient organisation&mdash;I would say, a very efficient organisation&mdash;under which the individual concerned makes application to the Board of Works, the Board of Works inspect the scheme, make their report upon it, give their estimate for carrying it out, and when the scheme of works for the county is complete it is then forwarded to the county surveyor and his staff.  How you can knit into that scheme and that allocation an allegation of political corruption beats me. But, of course, when a man of the type of Deputy McGovern&mdash;who is, perhaps, incapable of taking his mind back even ten years, who is perhaps incapable of selecting a scheme which would stand a chance of being sanctioned by any responsible person&mdash;stands up to make a speech, one never knows what he is liable to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point in connection with the selection of works to which I should like to refer.  In making applications for minor drainage schemes it is pointed out that no minor drainage scheme can be approved in any area where a drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act has been carried out, or in any area from which an application for such a scheme has been lodged with the local authority. I could understand an objection to the selection of a minor drainage scheme in an area from which an application for an arterial drainage scheme has come, but where an arterial drainage scheme has been carried out, and where a rate has been paid by the occupiers of land who had benefited as a result of such a scheme, I cannot for the life of me see&mdash;if there are any small tributaries inside that drainage area which have not been included in the major scheme&mdash; why a scheme should not be approved in such an area.  I am prepared to concede that, if there was any question <Col N="884" /> of doing through State funds a service to one section inside the drainage area as against another, there might be some point in that, but you might have a certain area in which you had an arterial drainage scheme and where some of those little tributaries had not been opened up&mdash; there might be 10, 12, 15 or 20 holdings affected&mdash;and I cannot see how injustice to anybody would arise if the Board of Works approved a scheme in such an area.</P>
    <P>As far as an area from which an application had come to a local authority is concerned, judging by the time that you have to wait for an arterial drainage scheme sometimes even in that you have a very severe hardship because of the failure of the Board of Works to carry out the scheme under those circumstances.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine that matter, because I have on many occasions been disappointed through the failure of the Board of Works, in accordance with those regulations, to have a minor scheme in such areas.</P>
    <P>There is also a further point to which I should like to refer.  It is one of the really solid objections to the rotational scheme, but it does not come from the point of view that has been taken by the Labour Party.  In many counties, I am sure in all counties, you sometimes have in certain arterial units a very small number of unemployment assistance recipients.  At the same time you have a great deal of very useful and desirable work requiring to be done.</P>
    <P>Because of the concentration of the unemployed around the little villages and the smaller towns, you will reach a period, I believe, in the near future when all types of useful work for rotational purposes will have been done. Yet, in areas where you have not work enough to justify the introduction of a rotational scheme, you will still find work of a useful nature not likely to be done, and for which no provision can be made under the rotational system.  I can see the difficulty of providing money for an area of that kind, apart from putting into effect a rotational scheme.  It is very hard, however, to justify that attitude to <Col N="885" /> those who are interested in having that kind of work done.  The people who urge schemes of that kind want them carried out for two reasons.  In the first place, they feel that it is better that men should be employed for a few days doing something rather than being idle.  No harm is going to come to a man from doing a little work.  In the second place schemes of the kind are going to be of permanent benefit in those areas.  Where you have the requisite number of unemployment assistance recipients they can always say: &ldquo;Well, we are never going to get any useful public work done if you are going to continue on that basis, and the position will be the same next year and is likely to be the same the year after.&rdquo;  They will say that their bog is going to be left undrained and their bohreen unrepaired.  I can see the difficulty, on the rotational basis, of getting over that difficulty because of the uneven distribution of unemployment assistance recipients.  I hope that somebody with better judgment, and with more intelligence than Deputy Dillon accuses me of having, will think out a suitable solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I have anything more to say, except to repeat that I got up to speak in case any member of the Labour Party would think that our silence on these benches was any indication of any fears or doubts we had in the matter of standing over and behind the Parliamentary Secretary on these rotational schemes.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can give two, three or four days' work&mdash;the more days he can give the better we shall like it.  We are living amongst the people and we know their views just as well as Deputy Pattison.  We know the views of those who are engaged on these schemes as well as of those who have to make provision for the people in receipt of unemployment assistance.  We are not in the least doubtful or the least afraid to face the public, or to stand over these schemes. They have been very well organised.</P>
    <P>While Deputies are perfectly entitled to criticise this system of rotational work, I am surprised that any Deputy should stand up and allege that there is any political tendency in their administration.  To anyone who opens <Col N="886" /> his eyes and uses his intelligence the evidence is all against that.  In my own county the evidence is all against such an allegation.  I am entirely and enthusiastically behind the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government in their attempt to get from men who cannot find employment and who are a charge on the State some return for what they are entitled to get from the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which I should like to deal with on this Vote.  The last speaker said that, on behalf of the people who have to find the money for the unemployed, it is the duty of the Government and of the Parliamentary Secretary to get some work out of the unemployed in return for the payments made to them: to get from them two days' work, or three or four days' work in the week, for the amount they receive.  I had a number of workers in my constituency with me a few evenings ago.  They were from the Fermoy district.  They went to work on Monday morning last and were informed that the amount they would receive for the week's work. would be £1 less the amount of the stamp.  That means that they are to receive about 19/6 for the week's work. Does the Parliamentary Secretary deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>And so was I.  I heard here this evening that some of the men employed on those schemes had received only 12/-, 14/- and 16/- a week. Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that £1 a week is sufficient for a man, his wife and eight children? Does he think that he can support himself and his family on that?  I wonder where has the great plan gone to?  At the last general election the Fianna Fáil candidates, from their platforms, told the workers in my constituency that if their Party was returned to power they would provide them with 52 weeks' work in the year. Instead of giving them 52 weeks' work we now find that men who have been unemployed for five months are asked to work for 19/6 a week.  The men have <Col N="887" /> informed me that they will not work for that wage.  I advised them to continue at their work until I had an opportunity of raising the matter in the Dáil, of finding out if it was true that the present Government required men to work five days a week, from Monday to Friday, inclusive, for 19/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They told me it was 19/6. That is the amount that a man, with a wife and eight children in the village where I come from, has to live on.  Out of that he has to pay 3/- a week rent. He is left with 16/6 to maintain himself, his wife and family.  How is he going to do it?  We heard a lot to-day from the Minister for Finance about the prosperity of the country.  I notice that this Vote shows a decrease, as compared with last year, of £65,000.  I suppose that is on account of the increased prosperity in the country.  I agree that a lot of very useful work has been done with this money, but I must protest in the strongest way I possibly can against the rate of wages paid on these schemes.  At the last election the Fianna Fáil Party told the workers that they had a plan for dealing with unemployment.  Now, after five years, they are asking workers to work for 19/6 per week.  If that is not a broken promise I do not know what is.  It is not for political motives that I am dealing with this unemployment question. It should be a matter of grave concern to every Party in this House.  But the Fianna Fáil Party, who have been in power for the last five years, told the people that they had a plan for dealing with unemployment.  The President, when broadcasting to the Irish people in America on St. Patrick's Day, told them of the great plan he had for the housewives in this country and the comfort in which he was going to put them.  To-day he sat alongside the Minister for Finance when he was making his Budget statement.  What relief did the housewives and the other people in this country get to-day from the Minister for Finance?</P>

Then we have the Unemployment Assistance Act under which some of these men who have been working on these schemes have been signing up.  I know of unfortunate men in the town of Fermoy who are married and have large families and who receive only 12/- a week unemployment assistance, out of which they have to pay rent and keep their families.  The regulations governing this Act are disgraceful.

He said quite frankly that the money could not be found to carry out the plan which the Government had repeatedly stated they had in readiness to put in operation when they came into office.  I congratulate Deputy Smith upon the confession he has made, but I am certain that, when the President and the members of the Executive Council read the opening portion of that speech, Deputy Smith will very likely be spoken to very severely at the private Party meeting. Deputy Smith is, in my opinion, a very honest and sincere Deputy and is quite prepared, as a loyal supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, to defend anything which that Party decide to do or not to do, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>I always understood that it was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to provide continuous work or maintenance at a decent standard for all those for whom they were unable to provide work.  I have heard the President state here in this House on more than one occasion that he was prepared to pledge all the resources of the State for that purpose and that, if he found that he was not in a position to carry out his plan under the existing system, he was prepared to go outside the existing system for the purpose of providing work or maintenance for all our able-bodied population.  To-day we have heard from Deputy Smith that the Government do not intend to go ahead on these lines because, in his opinion, the money is not available, and that is the reason why he is prepared to defend the rotational system of providing employment on minor relief and other public works.  I say that <Col N="890" /> the rotational system of providing part-time employment for some of our able-bodied citizens is completely demoralising and is not giving a good return for the money expended on these schemes.  I seriously suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has been inspecting some of these works down the country, that he would get a far better return for the money expended if he provided continuous employment for those who are willing and in a position to undertake that work, and that the system, so far as my limited experience of its working goes, is a complete failure and should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>I should like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is an opinion in the ranks of trade unionists that this scheme is being brought into operation for the purpose of smashing trade union conditions.  Trade unionists in some parts of the country are brought in to work under non-trade union conditions.  They are compelled to work or lose unemployment assistance benefit under conditions which they would not normally be prepared to accept.  These conditions are being imposed at a time when there is a considerable increase in the cost of living, over and above what it was when a previous Government compelled men to undertake continuous work for 24/- a week.  Deputy Daly does not seem to be well acquainted with the manner in which these schemes operate even in his area.  He does not appear to have any more information than was given him in his native town.  I suggest that if he went to the rural parts of his constituency he would find worse cases in the operation of these schemes than he was given recently in Fermoy.  The Deputy is so unacquainted with the position, even in Fermoy, that he does not know the actual amount of money that was paid to the people who are supposed to have made the complaint.  If the pay sheets were produced it would be found that the figures the Deputy quoted are not actually correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the operation of this Vote, members of this Party have not at any time suggested that political preference is given in the selection of works to be carried out.  I have made <Col N="891" /> no such complaint, and I do not think any Deputy in this Party has any reason to make such a complaint.  I do not think any such complaint could be made.  But we do not want to be misunderstood.  I complain quite definitely that money is not provided to carry out works that are urgently required.  I know of cases in my constituency that were submitted to the Board of Works three or four years ago, for carrying out repairs to bog roads; in some cases where people cannot get into the bogs to cut turf, or, when it is cut, cannot get it out.  The Parliamentary Secretary's advisers come along and say that there is not enough registered unemployed in the area to justify the carrying out of such work, no matter how urgently required.</P>
    <P>I say that that policy is wrong and should be changed.  It should be the duty of the Parliamentary Secretary, as he is responsible for administering a Vote of this kind, to see that works urgently required, such as repairs to bog roads, should be carried out, provided that within a reasonable radius unemployed men can be found, registered or otherwise, to do so.  I know of cases where men will not register because the distance from where they reside is too far from the labour exchange.  Accidentally I heard on Sunday last of a case of that kind in an area where work is urgently required.  It was put before the Board of Works for consideration, but was not carried out, although the necessary number of able-bodied unemployed men was available if sanction was given to a grant.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary attempted to explain why he did not send out the secret circular to all Deputies in connection with his desire to receive proposals for works that could be approved.  Candidly, I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation.  I suggest that that explanation was given in order to dig himself out of a hole which he consciously or unconsciously got into.  Like other Deputies in this Party, in fact like every Deputy who is an active Deputy, I put forward every scheme that comes to me <Col N="892" /> through a local agency, or through a local authority.  Unlike Fianna Fáil Deputies, I have never gone to any part of my constituency asking to have schemes put forward, and promising when that was done that the necessary grant would be made available.  That is being done.  Some time ago I asked the Parliamentary Secretary for the number of schemes that had been put forward over a certain period in Leix-Offaly; the number of schemes which had been examined; and the number of schemes which had been approved, and in which grants had been given.  I got the usual Parliamentary reply, that it would take too much time on the part of important officials to prepare and give the necessary information I am afraid if the Parliamentary Secretary submitted particulars on these lines, he would find that schemes submitted by other Deputies would more than compare favourably with schemes submitted by members of his own Party.  I would not mind if the Parliamentary Secretary dug out of the files of the Board of Works the schemes submitted by me for Leix-Offaly and made a comparison, for instance, with schemes suggested by Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Finlay. I am prepared to stand the test.  I am prepared to have my record on that question compared with Deputy Donnelly or with any other Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Labour Deputies are prepared to have their work in that respect thoroughly examined and given the light of day, and a comparison made with the work done by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Is it possible that Fianna Fáil Deputies were not putting up enough schemes, or any schemes, and that as the Parliamentary Secretary was sympathetic, he was anxious to get as many schemes as possible from lazy Fianna Fáil Deputies?  I do not suggest that all Fianna Fáil Deputies are lazy, but I suggest that some of them are mentally lazy, and would not acknowledge important letters received from their principal supporters, who have to fall back upon Labour Deputies&mdash; for instance, on Deputy Corish and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I had occasion previously to complain&mdash;and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there is some justification for the complaint&mdash;that it is a ridiculous thing to allocate money over a period of four years for carrying out of minor relief schemes where the cost does not exceed £400.  I have written to the Board of Works within the past few days stating while three allocations were made for repairing a bog road in Offaly it has not yet been completed, although the total cost of the scheme would not be more than £350.  The Parliamentary Secretary is supposed to be an expert business man and to be the business representative of the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Why in the name of common sense does he not allocate an amount that would complete such work and give good results for the money provided?  A bad case of that kind was brought to my notice, and I suggest it was only one of many, as I have been assured that it is not an exceptional one, where nine men got work for eight days on a minor relief scheme near Portarlington and had to wait three weeks for their miserable pittance before they could <Col N="894" /> pay the local grocer for necessaries they got on credit.  I understand that as a result of local protests the foreman who was employed on the work eventually had to cycle to Tullamore to get the miserable sum of money that these men were entitled to, three weeks after they had been deprived of unemployment benefit.  I do not know if there are other cases of the kind, but I suggest it is a disgraceful state of affairs to have men who got eight or nine days' work waiting for three weeks before they got the miserable amount provided for them.  Something should be done to tighten up the machinery from that point of view. Whether the laxity is on the part of the Department or on the part of the local authority, the Board of Works is responsible when acting as agent in the matter.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the fact that, in my opinion, the rotational method of employing men is demoralising and is a method which is not calculated to bring about the best results for the money expended.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Smith so sincerely said, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that scheme is a failure and that the Government was prepared, long before they took office, to provide continuous work or maintenance at a decent standard.</P>
      <P>We were told to-day for the first time&mdash;Deputy Minch is a financial expert, and he was not in the House when Deputy Smith confessed this&mdash; that it is impossible for the Government to carry out their plan for the relief of unemployment because they cannot find money.  I hope that Deputy Minch, who speaks for the financial houses of this country, will get up and say whether this is or is not a fact, and, if it is a fact, that he will be generous enough to suggest to the Government some monetary system or scheme whereby they will be able to get the money to carry out their plan, and to provide continuous work at decent rates of wages for all those willing to undertake this kind of relief work, or any other kind of public work.</P>

      <P>I want to deal first with the remarks of Deputy Daly.  He <Col N="895" /> spoke about how disgraceful it was to ask men to work for 19/6, and he asked us all about the plan.  I regret that he has left the House.  If Deputy Daly would cast his mind back a little and remember the position of one of those villages near Fermoy, he will remember that, when we came into office, there were 57 families there who had no shillings a week, who had no employment, and who had to pay rent and support themselves God knows how, until this Government restarted the flour mills in the district which had been closed under the régime of the Party he now supports, and gave employment.  The Deputy might also cast his mind back to the town of Mallow in his own constituency. I am sure he saw the condition of that town when he was around the district on election work.  He knew the unemployment there was in that town, and he knows its position to-day. I am not going to say that unemployment assistance is sufficient, because I do not think it is half enough.  I believe that if we can, by any means, find work for these people, they should get it, but I do not believe that it is demoralising, as Deputy Davin says.  I believe that those people do not want to draw money for nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You are planting it very well. To get back to the particular business before us, the rotational system, I admit that the work being done in this connection is good work, but the position we find ourselves in is that, in the first instance, we had to pay a sum of £80 to men who went on strike against the conditions, in order to keep their wives and families from dying from starvation, and, in the <Col N="897" /> second place, while the men were actually working under a rotational scheme, we had to pay the sum of £26 7s. 0d. to 44 men, and, in that connection, if you will allow me, Sir, I will read the report of the superintendent home assistance officer.  The superintendent home assistance officer, Mr. Forrest, reporting on the Spangle Hill relief scheme, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the week ended 3rd instant provisional assistance to the amount of £26 7s. 0d. was granted to 44 men engaged on relief scheme work. The assistance was given under the following conditions: The men only worked one day and received one day's wages, approximately 8/-.  The assistance was given solely on the responsibility of the officials and will not be given again under similar circumstances.  I accept responsibility for the amount involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy give me the date on which that payment was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The week ending 3rd April.  All parties are represented on our board of assistance, and every member admits that the superintendent home assistance officer is a most efficient and careful officer who will not pay money out unless he is very definitely satisfied that the conditions warrant it.</P>
      <P>That is the position of affairs there. In rotational schemes, unfortunately, no account is taken of days on which men could not work on these schemes. Under the rotational scheme, every day is supposed to be sunny and fine, and, if a day is not sunny and fine, the men have either to go out and get pneumonia, and become another burden on the rates, or lie up altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair that we in rural Cork who have to bear two-thirds of the burden of home assistance for the people of Cork City should be asked, in addition, to meet the burden of relief due to a broken-down rotational scheme.  This is the second payment. There was a third payment in question that day amounting to £65 which the board, in its wisdom or foolishness, defeated by one vote.  That is the condition of affairs, and there is no use in burking it.  It is not a <Col N="898" /> condition of affairs prevailing in Cavan, Donegal or anywhere else; it is the condition of affairs prevailing in the Parliamentary Secretary's own constituency. I ask that this extraordinary position under which men who, while in receipt of unemployment assistance, were no burden on the rates, now, suddenly, became a burden on the rates under the rotational scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it happened elsewhere or not, but when it happens in an area in which the people I represent have to pay for it, I think it my duty to call attention to it here.  I am prepared to say openly that, in my opinion, a full week's work ought to be provided.  I do not know how the Parliamentary Secretary will fit that in with his scheme, but I think a full week's work should be provided. When a local authority boasts the glorious position of being managed and of possessing a manager who, as we were told on one occasion, was second to none in the Free State, and when that manager is paid a big lot of money for a little city like Cork, there should be sufficient intelligence between the Corporation and the manager to arrange a scheme by which these men would be paid at the end of each week. Cork County is a very large county, and our county surveyor and officials were able to plan a scheme by which men in Bantry&mdash;practically a day's journey from Cork City&mdash;were paid every Saturday night.  I do not see why men living within a hundred yards of the City Hall in Cork, or working within a mile of the City Hall, should not be paid at the end of the week. The position of affairs which has been brought to my notice, as a member of the South Cork Board of Assistance, is one that should not be allowed to continue. I object to the ratepayers in my area being saddled with this burden owing to any scheme&mdash;I do not care what sort of scheme it is.  I ask that the Parliamentary Secretary devise some means by which this kind of thing will not continue.  I assure him that if he does not do so, I shall advise people, instead of bombarding the Board of Assistance, to take a run <Col N="899" /> down to Rushbrooke and bombard the Parliamentary Secretary there.  I think it is unfair that men should be in a position in which they have only a day's work in a week on which to support their families, including, perhaps, five children.  While that man is supposed to be engaged in rotational employment, the ratepayers have to support his wife and children.  It would be bad enough if the onus for support were cast on the ratepayers of the district only, but what I principally object to is that responsibility should be placed on ratepayers outside the district.  I think that these difficulties could be very well and very easily remedied.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy told us about the rate of wages for agricultural workers. I do not know how many agricultural workers there are in the County Westmeath. During my travels in that county I did not see many of them, nor did I see any great evidence of their employment there.  They may have changed since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates mentioned here from time to time are not the rates of wages paid to workers in any district of which I know.  I invite other Deputies who are farmers to speak out their minds on this matter. I have heard sums of 12/- and 14/- per week mentioned.  What usually happens is: a Civic Guard comes along and says, &ldquo;Well, Mick, what are you getting?&rdquo;  He says, &ldquo;Twelve shillings per week, sir.&rdquo;  That is entered down as the rate of agricultural wages in that particular district. The fact that Mick is getting board and lodging, in addition to the 12/-, is not taken into account.  I respectfully submit that the value of that board and lodging would be £1 per week extra.  That would make his wages 32/-.  In my own district the wage is 14/- per week and board. Still we are told that these men are paid the rate of agricultural wages obtaining in the district.  From the work I have seen these unfortunate devils doing, I am surprised that they are running out of it to the farmers <Col N="900" /> instead of running from the farmers to the work.  That state of affairs can be straightened out if attention is directed to it.  In my view, it is only necessary to have attention directed to it in order to have it straightened out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly referred to the state of affairs in his constituency.  Unfortunately, Deputy Daly and the others now representing that constituency have gained a lot of my sweat and labour; whilst I have to take over the derelict town of Passage from the Parliamentary Secretary, add it to Cobh, and try to do for both what I did for Clondullane and Mallow.  I heard him referring to parties who were receiving 19/6 per week in certain villages.  My mind went back, while he was referring to this matter, to the year 1930, when a mill which was giving a large amount of employment in that particular village was closed down.  In 1932, at the time of the general election, there were 57 families idle in that particular village. They had no shilling to get and no unemployment assistance to get.  To use a famous phrase, they might &ldquo;die of starvation.&rdquo;  The position is that to-day there are 57 men working in that particular mill.  I would ask Deputy Daly to travel around through that constituency, and if he will do so he will see more evidence of my hard labour there in connection with finding permanent employment and other things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not in charge of this Vote, but we were challenged here by Deputy Daly to tell him how the plan was working.  That is why I call the attention of Deputy Daly and other Deputies who wish to look at the evidence as to the working of the plan in their own home town, and in particular in Deputy Daly's constituency, where the plan has been worked out fairly well, as it has been in the village of Clondullane, where there are 57 men now working in a mill in which nobody was employed in 1932.  I submit that <Col N="901" /> is an answer to those Deputies who are talking about the plan.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Daly will go down to Mallow he will see that there are over 300 men working in the sugar factory where no man was working in 1932. The Deputy might ask himself where were these men working before they got work in the Mallow sugar factory. Where were these men getting the unemployment assistance at that time? Where, at that time, was the rotational scheme of employment?  If the Deputy will cast his mind around to these matters he will have to admit before he again talks here on this question that I at least have left the sign of my hand in the shape of permanent employment in that area.  I ask Deputy Daly to think of that.  I hope too that the Parliamentary Secretary will think over the matters that I brought forward here to-night, and I hope we will have good results from that.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to a matter that was brought before my own eyes this morning.  I understand that the Board of Works are responsible for a minor relief scheme which affects the lands of a man named Shee, near Carrick-on-Suir. I visited the place this morning, and I am unable to picture to the House the condition in which the man has been placed as a result of what has been brought about there.  It is only his poor little homestead and the small farm buildings that are not under water.  The whole farm was one sea of water.  Even the fruit trees that grew in the garden alongside the house were submerged.  The man has not as much tillage land or pasture land uncovered by water as is represented by the square in front of you, Sir, in this Chamber.  I am intervening in order to bring that case to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope <Col N="902" /> that something might be done to give this man some relief.  The fact is that a minor relief scheme on an embankment was carried out there not long ago.  It seems that since then another break occurred in the embankment and this man's whole place is flooded. Between 200 and 300 acres of adjacent land is also flooded, but as that is across the river it is not in my constituency. What I saw this morning was the worst case I have seen for a very long time.  Notwithstanding that, this farmer is asked to pay his rates and his annuities, though in actual fact he has no land at the moment.</P>
      <P>Personally I must admit that I have not sent in a great number of relief schemes to the Parliamentary Secretary. I do not think it is a Deputy's job to look after these schemes.  The people who busy themselves with doing this sort of thing do it for their own personal advantage and nothing else. They do these things in order to get the votes from a particular district. That is why, in a good many cases, they do them.  I am now bringing this matter before the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that something will be done to remedy the position in which this man has been placed.  As I inspected the work done in that particular place I had no hesitation in saying that it was an absolute disgrace.</P>
      <P>Very many of these schemes, whether relief schemes or otherwise, are not satisfactory, and real value for the money spent has not been got. This scheme on the road or boreen I saw this morning has turned out to be a very bad job.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take the matter up at once and see what can be done to bring relief to the people in that flooded area.  Most people whose lands have been flooded have had some dry land left to them, but this man has none.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this case at once and do the right thing.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was making a statement in connection with these rotational schemes in operation over the country one would imagine that the schemes <Col N="903" /> were ideal ones and that the work done was thoroughly satisfactory, whereas we all know that the contrary is the fact and that a great deal of dissatisfaction prevails all over the country in consequence of the way the rotational schemes have been put into operation.  I want to be quite candid and truthful in connection with this matter, and, speaking according to the experience I have of the working of the schemes, I want to say that I never thought the work would be so satisfactory as it has been.  I am talking now of the efficiency with which the work has been carried out in spite of the handicap with which the schemes were confronted when the local authorities and the Board of Works tried at first to put them into operation. I think most of the dissatisfaction in connection with these schemes prevails in the rural areas, because in the urban areas, where trade unions are in a strong, healthy condition, good wages obtain.  In Wexford, where relief schemes are in operation, the wages are £2 7s. 0d. a week.  The men under these schemes get £1 3s. 6d. That for three days' work is pretty decent.  I want to suggest that even though a good degree of efficiency is revealed in the working of the schemes, there is still a good deal to be desired in order to have the work carried out satisfactorily.  I suggest that the men will be more content if they were permitted to work a week about.  I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary on three or four occasions since the work started that the employment should be given on alternative weeks.  He stated that for some reason or another that was not possible.  I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that in consequence of the men not being able to work more than three days in a week owing to wet weather, that sometimes they were only able to put in one or two days.  He pointed out to me that arrangements were made by the county and borough surveyors by which the men were permitted to work another day in the week in consequence of one of the three days in the week in which they were employed being a day on <Col N="904" /> which the men were not able to work because of the bad weather.  I do know that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and it is being carried out.  I suggest, however, that in a great many cases that particular man is an extra man out of his turn on the particular gang on that day and he interferes with the machinery and ultimately with the estimate which the engineer gives for the work he is engaged upon.  I again suggest that if the work were carried out in a different way, if a week about were given instead of three days, and if a man then happened to lose a day he would not mind it so much.  I should like to say that the amount of efficiency that we have seen in connection with these schemes is extraordinary.  I think it is only right to say that on behalf of the men concerned, because a great many of them have not hitherto been engaged on jobs of this kind and it is to their credit that they have entered into the spirit of the thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the period were for a week about we would get better results altogether.  I also know that local engineers are rather afraid about the prices which they have given for the jobs; they fear that the works cannot be completed for the estimate given.  Of course, they are in a better position now to give a price that is better related to the job, because they have had experience of what men taken on in a haphazard fashion are in a position to do.  I think in regard to some of the jobs taken up at the beginning of this scheme, and which have not yet been finished, it will be found that there is likely to be a loss.  In these circumstances, I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if the Board of Works will be willing to help the local authorities in defraying any loss that may occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular aspect with which I have come into contact on various occasions.  The men who are in receipt of the lower amount of unemployment assistance are very anxious <Col N="905" /> to be employed for the three days' period, and one hears complaints day after day that the same men are being put on whatever schemes are operated. That is to say, that if a scheme were in operation for a month or two, and if a job were finished, when a new work opens up instead of going to the list where the last man came off, the labour exchanges have received instructions to start at the top man again.  I suggest that is very unfair and that the list should be exhausted over a certain period at any rate&mdash;that there should be a given period of three or four months, and then if the list were not exhausted perhaps they could go back to the beginning again.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one set of individuals who should really get some consideration. I refer to the British ex-service men.  I know some arrangement has been made by which an ex-serviceman or a pensioner from the National Army is given employment and his pension up to a certain figure is not taken into consideration.  There are a good number of British ex-servicemen in this country drawing 10/- and 12/- a week.  I suggest that they have the same degree of need as the man who is drawing an equivalent sum by way of unemployment assistance; that is, 10/- or 12/6 a week.  They have the same responsibilities and yet they are disqualified by reason of the fact that they have 10/- or 12/-.  There is a good deal of dissatisfaction in these circumstances because these men have not been permitted to work on rotational schemes.  I feel certain the Parliamentary Secretary will give that matter his attention.  The same degree of need is there.</P>
    <P>There are also many complaints being made by the single recipient of unemployment assistance.  The single man is entitled to 6/- or 7/- a week. The Parliamentary Secretary also knows that the amount of money given to a single man is not based on the number of dependents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are talking about two different things.  I am talking of what he is in receipt of from unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many single men who have their fathers or mothers dependent on them, and in urban areas, where the number of unemployed is very large, up to now they have got no consideration so far as these schemes are concerned.  I do not suggest that that is deliberately so, but it is due to the way the scheme has been worked that they have not been reached.  In one area, in my county, when certain works were being done by a local authority in the past, representations were made through certain organisations that single men should get some work on jobs of this kind, and an arrangement was operated whereby 25 per cent. of the people employed were single men with dependents.  I do not think we would be going too far if we were to suggest that at least 25 per cent. of single men with dependents should be given employment under these schemes.  A great deal of dissatisfaction prevails in consequence of those persons not receiving what they consider to be their quota.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith was rather annoyed because of the criticism of the Labour Party so far as these schemes are concerned. I do not want anybody to think for a moment that the Labour Party object to people working as against drawing unemployment assistance. We have always made it quite clear that we prefer to see people working pretty constantly at a decent rate of wages.  When Deputy Davin described the scheme as demoralising, I do not think he meant what was inferred by subsequent speakers.  We have always made it clear that we prefer men should be working rather than drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the last two years a great many discussions have taken place here in connection with <Col N="907" /> minor relief schemes.  Time and time again we have condemned those schemes because of the low rate of wages paid.  I was rather surprised to hear that those schemes are now being worked on the rotational system. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the wages for minor relief schemes are too low already, and certainly it is going too far to have these schemes carried out on the rotational basis.  Men working on the rotational system on minor relief schemes for, say, three days a week, are given the magnificent sum of 11/5, while for four days they would get 14/5.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage ought to issue instructions that so far as these minor relief schemes are concerned, they should no longer be carried out on a rotational basis.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, as has been pointed out by various Deputies, people have to walk long distances to their work. I suggest that the amount of money given for three or four days would not cover the wear and tear of their boots and clothes.  When we criticised the minor relief schemes and the wages to be paid it was suggested to us that the work these men were called upon to do was equivalent to what a farm labourer was asked to do and they were given wages something in line with what farm workers were receiving. So far as that particular period is concerned, that may have been correct, but I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary could stand over that statement at the present time, because work done under minor relief schemes is, I contend, equivalent to what county council workers are being called upon to do and for which they are receiving in any county no less than 30/- a week.</P>
    <P>However, what I am chiefly concerned about on this Vote is to try to secure that the rotational scheme of employment would not apply to minor relief schemes.  I think it is too much to expect that a man should be asked to work for three days for 11/5.  I do not think I have anything else to say in connection with the matter, Sir, except to refer the Parliamentary <Col N="908" /> Secretary again to the two or three points I wanted to make, and these are that at least a week's work should be given to men, that single men should get consideration, and that British ex-servicemen, who are in the same position as others in the labour exchange, should also receive consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I remember, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his statement, asked for schemes for new works, or likely new works, to be submitted.  I should like to bring before his attention the question of a river in Westmeath, which goes into Killucan.  This is a matter which I brought to the attention of the Board of Works about a year ago.  If the Parliamentary Secretary, in his travels through that part of the country, should stop off at Mullingar, he would see the whole countryside flooded on account of this river.  The history of that, roughly, is that years ago the landlord used to clean that river every year, but when it was sold to the Land Commission about 15 or 16 years ago nothing was done about it, nor has anything been done about it since, with the result that the whole countryside is flooded.  As well as that, the railway company have a right to allow the overflow of their canal into this river, and they have given an undertaking that if that river is cleaned and drained, they would give something towards the cleaning.  As I say, I brought this matter up a year ago but it was maintained that it was too big a job.  It was brought up two years before that to the county council as a scheme of relief, and it was pointed out that it would mean a cost of £2,000 or £3,000, the result of which would be that the tenants would have to pay £2 or £3 each.  I maintain that, if a couple of hundred pounds were spent on that river, it would mean a great relief to the people living in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of four or five bogs in that part of the country, and the cleaning of that river would be of assistance to the big scheme carried out by the Turf Development <Col N="909" /> Board on the Downs Bog.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a note of that, because the people are suffering great hardship along that river, and it is noted all over the countryside there.  As long as I have been in the Westmeath County Council the people have been talking about it, and if a couple of hundred pounds were spent on it, I am sure it would be a great relief, because it is a main river into which a lot of tributary rivers flow.  I think that, if the Minister looks up his files, he will find that this suggestion was sent in about a year ago, and if he will concentrate on draining a number of the small bogs, it would be a great help.  It must be remembered that, apart from, let us say, one large bog, there are other small bogs near at hand very often, and when a scheme is dropped in connection with one bog, the work on the other bogs is stopped.  If the Parliamentary Secretary likes, I can send him in particulars of dozens of those bogs.  I sent him in particulars of the different districts, but he was afraid that, in some cases, they were too near one another.  However, I think that if about £40 or £50 were spent on each of these bogs it would be very useful.</P>
    <P>There is a case in Streete where certain work was to go on and where a certain amount was done, but not finished&mdash;about 20 loads of stuff were brought in, but not spread&mdash;and the result is that the people are worse off than they were before.  It seems to be a question of working a bit, skipping a bit, and then working a bit, but in the case I refer to another £4 or £5 would finish the job.  If the Parliamentary Secretary takes a run through certain counties, I should like to stress the point that he ought to stop off when he is going through Mullingar the next time, and if he does so he will see that a little money spent there would relieve the thousands and thousands of acres in the countryside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House, Sir, but I am really disappointed in this Vote, and I do not see the necessity for it at all. It is rather unfortunate that now after five years of a Fianna Fáil administration, <Col N="910" /> we are in the position that we have to be doling out money for relief schemes.  As to the attitude the Labour Party has taken up, I can only say that one could be amused at their attitude, were it not for the seriousness of the position of the people of the country.  As you all know, the leader of the Labour Party, in 1932 or 1933, told the people of this country that, if Fianna Fáil did not solve the unemployment problem, they themselves would be the Party in office soon, and that if Fianna Fáil did not solve the problem, they would go out of office in four or five hours.  The Labour Party themselves, however, are only tinkering with the question now.  They are criticising the Parliamentary Secretary for not paying a certain amount when everybody knows that the schemes concerned are not capable of supporting these people.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to take this question seriously.  This problem, to a great extent at least, has been created by the policy of the Government.  The unfortunate farmers' sons who, in the past, were able to live within their own holdings, are now unable to compete with the worker who, in the past, was employed on schemes throughout the country.  I had experience recently of meeting a farmer's son.  He wanted a cheque for £4 10s. cashed.  I asked him what it was for, and he said that it was a free grant for draining an acre of ground.  I asked him how many cows he had, and he said that they had 20 cows, that they had two farms, but that this thing was forced on them and they took advantage of it.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take this question seriously.  Undoubtedly, there is demoralisation of our people, and the farmer, even at the present time, finds it very difficult to get people to work on his farm because, owing to the demoralisation caused by the Government, some of these people pass his farm and smile at the farmer and his sons working there while they go out to draw their dole of a few shillings a week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan, speaking in the House last week, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" />&ldquo;The principal point in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary was the abandonment of the idea of solving the unemployment problem. He has clearly abandoned that idea. He told us it would take some £15,000,000 to put all the unemployed working every day of the week, I do not know at what wages.  However, I will take the Parliamentary Secretary's word that it would take £15,000,000.  He said that, of course, was a thing the State could not attempt to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After all, did the Government not tell us before they got into office that they had a plan to solve the unemployment problem?  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to state if this is the only plan he has for solving the unemployment problem.  I would ask the Labour Party also to state what their attitude with regard to this question of unemployment is. Their leader said five years ago that they would ginger up the Fianna Fáil Party for the next five years.  Will they now see, because the Fianna Fáil Party have not carried out their promises in regard to unemployment, that, as their leader promised, that Party will be turned out of office inside 24 hours?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate several Deputies have criticised these schemes on the basis that since last October an unemployed man could secure employment only for four days a week on Government relief schemes. I venture to suggest that since October these relief schemes have meant a great saving for the unemployment Fund because instead of the four days per week, which the Parliamentary Secretary intended to provide for unemployed men, owing to the inclement weather, men have been able to obtain an average of only two and a half days per week since last October, and they have only been paid on that basis. Many of the schemes, sanctioned by the Department and for which grants were made out of the rates by public bodies, were not carried out owing to the inclement weather.  Public bodies were obliged to provide home assistance for these men owing to the fact <Col N="912" /> that the men, although they worked for only two days per week, were not paid for a fortnight afterwards.  We had the admission here, from the Government Benches, for the first time after five years, that this is the Government's solution, the very best they can do, and that there is no possible chance, as far as the Government is concerned, of solving the unemployment problem; that the 50,000 men who were unable to find work, need have no hope of being provided with even one day's work on a Government scheme.  We have also the admission here to-day that, notwithstanding the fact that we have 90,000 men unemployed, various Government Departments have transferred back to the Department of Finance a sum of £350,000 instead of making that money available for public bodies to finance the provision of work for men who are willing and able to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no complaint to make against the Department in connection with the submission of any scheme by myself personally because, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, since these schemes were initiated I have protested against the Government's reducing the wages of working men to 24/- per week and I have, therefore, submitted no schemes since that wage was adopted.  Although I have not done so, my county has received every consideration and the men unemployed have not suffered by the non-submission of schemes by their representatives, as schemes have been submitted by the county surveyor under which suitable employment was provided for certain of these men. There is, however, a grievance in connection with these schemes which I suggest should be remedied, namely, the question of the delay in the payment of men who are employed, even though only for two and a half days. They are paid fortnightly.  It is often from 14 to 16 days after a man starts to work before he receives any pay.  In such cases, pending the receipt of payment, the men have to be assisted by the home assistance officers.  I have known several cases in which, owing to the delay in payment by the county councils, the <Col N="913" /> local authority&mdash;the board of health&mdash; through their home assistance officer, had to come to the assistance of these men.  Take the case of a man who has been in receipt of a miserable pittance from the labour exchange. In the middle of the week he is offered work on a relief scheme and his unemployment assistance is stopped.  After doing two and a half days' work he is not entitled to receive any further assistance from the labour exchange, and he has to wait a fortnight for his wages from the county council.  How is such a man expected to exist in the meantime?  The fact that a man is employed only four days on a rotational scheme is bad enough, but the men to whom I refer are employed on the average only two and a half days a week.  They are receiving much less per man for working than they would receive if they were drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly talked of the wonderful prosperity in the country as proved by the fact that the revenue from the sale of insurance stamps has increased considerably.  He omitted to tell the House that the men who work only for two and a half days per week have to buy the same amount of stamps as if they were working for a full week.  Men employed on these relief schemes for only two and a half days have had to purchase these stamps&mdash;and that shows great prosperity, in Deputy Kelly's opinion! He tries to blow hot and cold.  He says that the Parliamentary Secretary is waiting for them to provide schemes.  I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Party are taking responsibility for this wage of 24/- per week, because my experience has been that their attitude on this question previously was: &ldquo;Oh, it is not our fault; it is the Parliamentary Secretary's fault.&rdquo; They let the Parliamentary Secretary carry the baby.  As I have pointed out, each and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party is responsible for that wage much more than the Parliamentary Secretary, because he came into this House and voted for that wage on these works.  The Government will go down in history, in my <Col N="914" /> opinion, as the 24-bob-a-week Government and nothing more.</P>
    <P>Then we are told, &ldquo;Oh, they are paying the same wages as the farmers.&rdquo;  I have had experience of negotiating settlements and agreements with farmers and I say that in my area farmers, notwithstanding the depression in agriculture, are paying a much higher rate of wages than the Fianna Fáil Government has decided to pay in the county.  I know that no farmer employs a man on casual work.  No farmer employs a man and, if it is wet, sends him home. No farm labourer is employed for only two and a half days a week. He is employed on a permanent basis and he is not dependent on his wages alone.  He receives perquisites such as milk and fuel.  The large majority of farmers in County Wicklow, notwithstanding the secret advisory committee which the Government has to advise them as to the rate of wages for agricultural workers in each county, pay much more than the Government rates on these schemes. Whoever the members of this committee are, we have never seen them nor do we know their names individually. Notwithstanding all the information which they are supposed to have got, they have never come to the trade unions or to the Labour clubs to get any information as to the wages paid.  I suggest that the figure they decided upon as the wages which farmers are paying exists only in their own imaginations.  Agreements which we can produce with farmers provide for a much higher wage than the Government are offering at the present time.</P>
    <P>Some people are criticising the work, and saying it is not good value.  How can you expect to get 100 per cent. value from hungry men taken from the labour exchange, who have to wait a fortnight or 15 days for their first payment?  Notwithstanding all the drawbacks, notwithstanding all the difficulties, notwithstanding the fact that the men have got no alternative but to accept, I say there is good value given in the circumstances.  I say that in urban areas you are getting 100 per <Col N="915" /> cent. return at the present time.  In the rural areas you may not be getting it on the minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>We cannot solve the problem.  I hope that Deputy Smith and the Fianna Fáil Party will draw no other smoke screen, but will make this an issue at the election&mdash;that we are unable to solve the problem and are not in a position to give more than 24/- a week. Make that the issue and have no other smoke screen.  I have no doubt whatever as to what the decision of the unemployed and the working people of this country will be.  Some of the Fianna Fáil members had the courage to get up here and approve of the scheme, pointing out that they are prepared to defend it before the electorate. They will have an opportunity of defending their actions; they will have an opportunity of defending the policy that they are not in favour of any more than 24/- a week being paid, notwithstanding the fact that the prices of the necessaries of life are increasing wholesale.  There is no necessity to go into that; it is too well known.  I say that if the unemployed and the workers of the country are going to have this as an issue put before them by the Fianna Fáil candidates, then we can assure them at least that there will be a different Government returned&mdash;a Government which will carry out the promises they make, and will not get up and state after they are elected that the banking institution of this country is a wonderful institution.</P>
    <P>This is not all the taxpayers' money. One of the conditions of the grant is that public bodies must put up a certain amount&mdash;50 per cent in many cases.  We had areas where there was a large number of unemployed, and the public bodies were unable to put up any money towards the relief grants. What happened?  The unemployed were allowed to remain hungry.  In some cases they were offered work nine or ten miles from their area.  We have had an unemployed demonstration in Bray.  We had what are called hunger marches.  I should like to know what was the reason why the Bray Urban Council's appeals for grants were refused by the Government.  Was there <Col N="916" /> any reason for it?  Were they not in a position to repay the loans from the Department of Finance?  If that was the reason, how are the unemployed going to live?  Because the urban council failed to fulfil their obligation to pay back their loans were the unemployed to suffer?  Were 400 men to remain unemployed with no hope of even four days' work or two days' work simply and solely because their public body could not meet its liabilities?  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether that is going to be a condition for future grants, because I can visualise a day when the public bodies throughout the country will say: &ldquo;Well, we are not going to continue any longer paying extra money to a Government which will give only two or two and a-half days' work to the unemployed men, the public body having no say in the selection of those men.&rdquo;  In the majority of cases the public bodies endeavour to co-operate with the Government. I do say that, without the co-operation of the public bodies, all the Parliamentary Secretary's genius and all his powers of persuasion would not get the men even two and a-half days' work.  You have the co-operation of the public bodies, but how long will it last?</P>
    <P>I do say that some extra amount should be given to public bodies to employ a couple of girl clerks so that the men who will get this work will not have to wait a fortnight or three weeks for the first week's pay.  I can give instances to the Parliamentary Secretary where the men received double pay for the one week; they got the payment from the county council and board of health in one particular week.  Then when the work closes down they might have to wait a fortnight or three weeks for the first pay.  During that time they have to be maintained by the public body.  The public bodies might say: &ldquo;What is the use in providing any grants, because it is costing us more? After giving the money to the Government and maintaining the men while they are working for the first fortnight, and for the first fortnight after ceasing work, it is costing us more <Col N="917" /> than if they were not working at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not agree with some Deputies who say that we object to the men working.  I have always maintained that I prefer to see them working. While I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary when he initiated it that I did not agree with the rotational scheme, I said that if you had a continuation of the work it was certainly better than having them on home help.  But the men are working only for four days in one week, and then have to wait a fortnight for another couple of days' work.  If you had a continuation over a period it would probably save the public body a lot of trouble, and you would get better returns in connection with the whole administration.  We are unable to provide any more money.  We have not got the money.  If we had the money, what would we put the men to work at?  Deputy Smith is now here.  He was looking for suggestions. According to him, the secret document which went out invited suggestions.  Whether that may be so or not I do not know.  If you give the farmers in the rural areas a guaranteed price for all their produce they in turn will be able to absorb a large number of unemployed in the rural areas at guaranteed wages.  You would then be absorbing a large number of the unemployed, and giving greater benefit to the farming community.  I have always maintained that.  The farmer wants a guaranteed price for all his produce. In return for that, when you have an Agricultural Wages Board, get him to pay guaranteed wages to his agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Agricultural Wages Board will not take it as an instruction that the farmers are not to pay high wages; that they are to reduce the wages of their employees to the level of the standard set up by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;24/- a week if they are lucky enough to work a full week.  If not, two days' work and two days' payment is held to be suffcient for a man and his family.  That is the spirit of the Fianna Fáil Party. The policy adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party is that two or two and a half days' work per week for a few weeks in the year is all that the <Col N="918" /> unemployed are worth and all that they are entitled to.  It is all that this Government is going to give, and all that the unemployed can hope for. If that is to be the only hope for the unemployed, well, then, I say that the unemployed may have to adopt different measures to those which they have adopted.</P>
    <P>If the unemployed are going to receive a less sum than it costs to maintain a prisoner, as was pointed out in reply to a question in the Dáil, then it would be better for those men to be in jail than to be unemployed outside.  It will cost the Government more to maintain them in prison than it does outside.  I am glad that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have come out openly to-night on this question.  That is the hope that they have to give to the unemployed men of the Free State.  They have said &ldquo;that is the best that we are going to do for them.&rdquo;  They have said that they are unable to do more; that, on account of the position of the country, they are more concerned with the capitalist class than they are with the unemployed.  After being five years in office, all that they can promise to give to an unemployed man is two days' work.  That is the only hope that the unemployed are able to get from the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Seán Brodrick Mr. Seán Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather remarkable that after being five years in office, the Fianna Fáil Government and Party have had to confess to-night that they have no plan to solve the unemployment question. It is probable that we will get the plan in four or five weeks' time. What has surprised me in this debate is that the members of the Labour Party should have fallen in with the ideas of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I heard some members of the Labour Party speak on this Vote, but I did not hear one suggestion from them as to how the unemployment problem in the country should be solved.  They referred, of course, to the unemployed who are only able to get two and a half days' work in the week, and to the amount of unemployment assistance benefit that these people lose.  We had that from the Labour <Col N="919" /> benches, but no suggestion as to how the problem should be solved.  Years ago we were told that if the Fianna Fáil Government did not solve the problem, the Labour Party would be there to ginger them up, to secure better conditions for the unemployed, to see that more men and women were put into employment, and that the workers would receive higher wages.  The position to-day, after five years' experience of a Fianna Fáil Government, is that the wage earner is receiving far less than he was getting in 1932.  As a result of the Fianna Fáil plus Labour policy in this country the results are these: the workers are earning less, we have more unemployed, the cost of living has gone up, and we have more people going to another country in search of employment.</P>
      <P>With regard to relief schemes, I thought that, after five years' experience of a Fianna Fáil Government, we would have put before the House some form of scheme that in time would solve the unemployment question. Nothing of the kind, however, has resulted.  We are in the same position now as we were four years ago.  There is £100 put into a bit of a road here, £150 into something else in another part of the country, and £100 or £200 is being spent in some area cleaning a drain&mdash;to drain water into a main river still choked up.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has done a good deal.  I want to give him every credit.  I know that he has been most attentive in seeing that councils and surveyors carry out their duties. He has put great energy into his work, but with all that I would expect something more from the Government, especially in view of the fact that it has had the support of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to complain about is that we are getting no results from the sums voted each year for the relief of unemployment.  We find that a bit of work is done in some district to-day, and that in two or three years' time the same work has to be done again. That should not be the case.  I have raised here, by means of Parliamentary question, the position of men in Letter <Col N="920" /> more, one of the poorest districts in the West of Ireland.  There you had men who had to travel from ten to 12 miles to their work.  The great majority of them had to walk during the winter months, and they could only get work for three days a week. When turning out to work on a Monday the morning might be fine, but if it were raining when they reached the place where the work was to be done they were not allowed to make a start and consequently lost their day's pay. They had to walk home again in the rain.  The same thing might happen to them on Tuesday or Wednesday. Someone on the Labour Benches referred to men walking 20 miles for 4/5. Here you had men walking 20 miles and getting nothing.  While that was so, you had a staff of gangers in every one of those districts in well-paid fulltime employment.  Most of them are brought in from other districts and put in the position of gangers over those poor people.  I believe that the men I speak for are as honest and as good workers as the people brought in over them.  I think it is a terrible injustice, when men walk such a long distance to work, that they should lose their day's pay because, in the opinion of the ganger, it is too wet to go on with the work or too wet for him to stand out in the weather in his oil-coat.</P>
    <P>There is a very big acreage of bogs in the country.  With regard to the development and drainage of them, I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any understanding between his Department and the Land Commission.  If, say, the Land Commission have three or four hundred acres of turbary in their possession for division, can the Board of Works go in and do the necessary drainage and make the necessary roads?  I think the position some years ago was this, that where the Land Commission made the roads they charged the people so much per perch.  I am anxious to know if the Board of Works can go into those bogs, drain them and also make the necessary roads.  I must say that any work that I have seen done by the Board of Works was a credit to it.  It has sometimes happened, of course, as <Col N="921" /> has been pointed out by a Labour Deputy, that a job has had to be left in a partly unfinished state because there was not sufficient money in hands, but, apart from that, the work that I have seen done by the Board of Works is a credit to it.  I think that in cases where the Board of Works do a good job in making a road into a bog some guarantee should be given by the people who buy the turbary, by those interested, that they would keep the road in repair for a number of years afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it very satisfactory. The tenants themselves are quite satisfied with it because they have an interest in the work.  At the time when the bog was being cut away the Board of Works or the Land Commission came to their help again and gave them another grant to continue the road.  Deputy Corry mentioned about the great work being done in Cork.  He criticised Deputy Daly's speech on the matter of relief work. He also told us about the beet factory in Mallow.  We happen to have a beet factory in Tuam, and I should like to know what provision is going to be made for the workers after the campaign in the factory is finished.  During the campaign, which lasts for three or four months, you have up to 800 men working in the factory.  During the summer months, I suppose there would be up to 150.  Out of the 800 men a certain number have come to reside in the town of Tuam.  For eight months of the year there is no work whatever for these people.  Roughly, the unemployment benefit to which these workers are entitled would only be about 30/-, or 2/6 per stamp for the three or four months they have been working.  Between rent and rates, the labourers in that town were paying up to 8/5 per week for their cottages. What are they to do for the remaining eight months of the year?  That would apply in every place where there is a <Col N="922" /> beet factory, I should say.  The population is growing, and at the same time unemployment is increasing.  What provision will the Government make to deal with that question?  It is a matter which should be considered very seriously because in my constituency the ratepayers are grousing about it. When their unemployment benefit is run out, a good many of these men have to go on the dole or have to be supported by the local authorities. Some provision should be made to meet such cases.</P>
      <P>The last point I wish to raise has reference to the minor drainage schemes, as in some cases a great mistake, I believe, is being made.  There are main rivers which have not been cleaned for a number of years.  Some Deputy mentioned that in days gone by they were cleaned by the landlord. The Land Commission then were to do it but did not.  The local authorities did not take advantage of the several Drainage Acts.  I know that the Board of Works had difficulty in carrying out drainage in some districts where the main rivers have not been done before.  It may not come under relief schemes, but some consideration should be given to the matter to see that where minor drainage schemes are being carried out the main drainage is carried out before the minor schemes are gone on with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are just a few points which I wish to raise on the Estimate.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give attention to the matter of the two and three days' work and the question of wet days.  That will not apply so much in the future, but in the winter great hardship was caused.  I have had several communications from men who, after walking ten miles to their work, were told by the ganger that the day was too bad and they could go home again, so that they had to walk back the ten miles without getting anything. At the same time, I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary and the surveyors down the country are giving serious attention to it.  There is one thing I cannot agree with, and that is the policy of the Government and the Labour Party.  After five years, <Col N="923" /> the position is as it was ten years ago, when the Government then in power were criticised because it was said they were wasting money on relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as the Parliamentary Secretary has antagonised me, and much as I have antagonised him, at least I have in me an element of fair play.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary has stood a fairly long barrage from various sections of the House and, let me say, he deserved every bit of it.  At the same time, I want to make a few remarks on this Vote and to register the opinion here which I have registered before and, not later than last evening at a meeting of the Cork Corporation, had to register again.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a man who has had considerable experience of the engineering profession and must know, possibly better than anybody else in this House, that the rotational system of employment which has been in existence on many of the relief schemes is a most objectionable system from many view-points.  It is the considered opinion of very many eminent engineers that it is wasteful, extravagant and uneconomical.  I know that this phase of these relief schemes has been laboured time and again in this House for the last week or two, but I want to get the Parliamentary Secretary to appreciate the point I am making and which was made again last evening by the Cork Corporation.  We know that because of this rotational system of labour much dissatisfaction has arisen, and rightly arisen, in the ranks of the unemployed in Cork City, and what is true of Cork City is also true wherever the system operates.  Some very exceptional cases have been brought under the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary in which men received for two weeks in which they had to rotate something like 15/- or 16/-.  I think it was Deputy Keyes who drew attention to that fact. These may have been exceptional cases.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to direct his best energies to seeing that at least a week's employment <Col N="924" /> will be given.  That will obviate a lot of trouble for his Department and I am suggesting it in the best interests of the Government that he represents.  This system of rotational employment has proved to be a most objectionable system and is causing an amount of trouble to various public bodies in the country.</P>
      <P>There is another point for which, possibly, the Parliamentary Secretary is not fully responsible, but for which to some extent he does share responsibility. The responsibility, I suggest, is jointly shared by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government.  The Government are at present putting local authorities in a most embarrassing position.  First of all, they are presenting a local authority with a cheque for something like £20,000 on the condition that the local authority shall raise a sum of, say, £8,000 or £9,000.  In some cases it used to be a fifty-fifty proposition.  The last grant offered by the Department concerned was £20,000 to Cork City.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that; I am not going to quarrel about it.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to be quite honest with the House in this matter.  He must have known, and, if he did not, I will excuse him, that when that offer came to the Cork Corporation, the corporation had already met and, at their rates meeting, had decided on a rate of 21/3 in the £ or whatever it was. Senior counsel advised that, once having struck a rate, the corporation were not entitled to include this sum of £4,000 in their estimate, the estimate for the financial year ending 31st March, 1938.  The members of the corporation are put in this most embarrassing position, that, if they refuse the grant, they will be told they are no friends of the unemployed and the Parliamentary Secretary can <Col N="925" /> get up on any platform in this country and say: &ldquo;We flung £20,000 at the Cork Corporation to do necessary work and the members of the corporation refused to put it into operation.&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary will get up at some cross-roads and say: &ldquo;Get rid of those persons who represent you in the Cork Corporation because we gave them a free gift and they refused it.&rdquo;  This is one of those wonderful gifts the Government is passing on to us, but, in my interpretation of the word &ldquo;free,&rdquo; and in its ordinary sense in the King's English, &ldquo;free&rdquo; means gratis or for nothing. This free grant is not a free grant, in the proper sense of the dictionary term.</P>
      <P>We are told that £20,000 goes to Cork to-morrow, but mark what happens. The persons who will be put to work on a rotational scheme are persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, to which fund, by the way, the citizens and ratepayers of Cork are contributing 1/6 in the £ on their valuations.  The Parliamentary Secretary understands that.</P>

      <P>Let us see this wonderful Greek gift.  This gift comes to us for the poor unfortunate unemployed who, by the way, are exploited in a most marvellous fashion always about election times.  Solicitude has been expressed in this House for the poor and unemployed which I have not heard expressed for many years, except on the eve of an election.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me when I say that I have said unpopular things in this House, and by &ldquo;unpopular&rdquo; I mean that I have not played to the gallery.  I said a thing on the Education Vote in respect of which I took certain risks and I was prepared to take further risks because I believe in telling the truth.  If I felt that the £20,000 offered to our people was a free gift, I would naturally jump at it, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that we pay 1/6 in the £ in our rates.</P>

      <P>We pay £18,000 towards the unemployment assistance fund.  We were told with a wonderful flourish of trumpets in this House that, when this Unemployment Assistance Act became law, the poor and helpless people would not be humiliated by being compelled to look for home assistance, or, as it used to be called in the old days, poor law relief.  What do we find?  We find that every other day the home assistance authorities, in other words, the poor law authorities, are being bombarded with applications for home help.  It all goes to show that this Unemployment Assistance Act has not fulfilled the functions we thought it would fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of comment was made in this country some years ago when the Shannon scheme was initiated and carried to a very successful conclusion by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan.  On that scheme a wage of 32/- per week was paid, and the condemnation of that wage was not so emphatic or so voluminous as it is now when the Parliamentary Secretary initiated schemes on which 24/- a week was paid. Although certain members of the Labour Party did object at the time, they are just as much responsible for that 24/- a week as are the Fianna Fáil Party, because they supported the Fianna Fáil Government in almost every act of theirs until they were compelled by the force of public opinion to object to the 24/- paid on certain schemes.  Why is it&mdash;and this is a matter on which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary for some information&mdash;that the Cork County Council can give to persons who are available for work under relief grants, a week's work instead of four, two or three days that may happen in the case of rotational employment?  The Cork Corporation have been charged with negligence, and almost told that because of their want of initiative, their want of pluck, etc., they have been compelled to subscribe to this rotational employment.  We&mdash;and I am speaking both as a Teachta Dála for the City of Cork and as one of the aldermen of the city&mdash;have been asked, and I subscribe to the proposal, to contribute to these schemes&mdash;and I <Col N="927" /> would contribute again even though my rates go up by 5/- in the £, because I feel that way in relation to the unemployed. The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware, from the figures given by the Minister for Finance, with which I was quite familiar, that the debts due by local authorities up to the 31st March amount roughly to £24,500,000. That is borrowed money and amounts almost to the National Debt.</P>
    <P>While prepared to do anything and everything to provide work for the unemployed, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the rotational system has become so abhorrent, even to the unemployed people, that it would be in the interests of the Government, and in the interests of the Department to grant the very polite request of the Cork Corporation, asking that that horrible system be ended.  I do not suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for it, because, after all, like any other Minister he is the servant of the Executive Council. With all his faults I do not put that responsibility on him.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that he has antagonised me, and I know that I have antagonised him, not that I compare myself with him, as that would be a far-fetched comparison, but the fact remains, and I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary on the point, that for every £4 voted by this House, local authorities are spending on this particular purpose something like £3, while all the kudos and credit go to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give you all the credit to which you are entitled. It is not a whole lot, as you know. For every £1 that the local authorities contribute, the State spends something like 13/-.  The greatest fraud of all is when the unemployed are told that £20,000 is given to Cork Corporation, or that £70,000 is given to Dublin Corporation.  That would be all right but for the snag.  The men put into employment are those who are in receipt of the highest rate of <Col N="928" /> unemployment assistance.  These men are then taken off that register and put to work, and the Central Fund is saved precisely the amount of money that would be paid to the persons who are taken off the unemployment assistance fund.  In other words, if employment is given to 1,000 persons in Cork, these are the persons who are drawing £1 and over in unemployment assistance, the Central Fund is saved over £1,000, and the Government gets the kudos, after putting these men on the rotational system.  I know what the Parliamentary Secretary will say in reply.  No later than last night we had to turn down an offer in Cork&mdash;although the Corporation was willing to accept it&mdash;because it was received too late for inclusion in the estimates.  A motion was carried by a big majority, in view of a condition attached to the acceptance of the £20,000, pointing out that the rotational system as now known should not obtain in connection with employment, and that if there was to be rotation it should be week about instead of three or four days.  I want to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that the present system is most objectionable, and is causing a lot of trouble to the workers, to the employment exchanges, and to clerks in engineers' offices when administering the schemes.</P>

Apparently the Labour Party will never be forgiven for one grave crime it committed in respect of Deputy Anthony.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We got rid of something much more humorous.  The main discussion on the Vote this evening, and on a previous occasion, has ranged round the rotational scheme of employment, and in my opinion nothing whatever can be said in justification of that type of employment on relief schemes.  We are told with a flare of trumpets sometimes that there are 25,000 persons working on relief schemes, and at other times we were told that the number had increased to 45,000, but when you come to examine the type of work available under these schemes you find that it is for three or four days per week at such a low rate of wages that workers are compelled to exist for a week on the wages they get for a few days.  The whole policy of the Executive Council in respect to rotational schemes is entrenched in the giving of periodic part-time employment to those not able to secure regular employment in industry or agriculture.  Part-time employment, particularly of the type provided in the relief schemes, is, in my view, a most reactionary policy. It compels workers to toil at hunger rates for a few weeks and to try to exist for the rest of the year on the miserable pittance they receive under the Unemployment Assistance Act. We have rotational schemes in operation in Kildare and other counties. Where a grant is made and is administered by a county council, the workers employed for three days a week receive 15/- less the cost of national health and unemployment insurance contributions, so that their remuneration is <Col N="930" /> something like 13/6 a week, or, if they, are fortunate enough to get four days' work, they get 20/-, less the cost of two stamps, leaving their entire remuneration 18/6 a week.  Where they are employed on minor relief schemes under the Board of Works, and only partially employed on rotational schemes, those who work three days a week receive the magnificent sum of 11/5, and if they are employed for four days under the notorious 24/- a week policy of the Board of Works they get 15/5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like some of the Government apologists for these relief schemes to tell us what standard of living it is possible for a man, his wife and four or five children to maintain on a wage of 11/5 for three days, or on 15/5 for four days' work.  I hope some of those who claim to be so interested in the progressive schemes undertaken by the Government will tell the House what standard of living is possible for a married man with a family who is compelled to work for such intolerably low rates of wages.  Bad as the rates of wages are, the conditions attached to the paying of them are even worse in many cases.  When a man starts to work under these relief schemes, and works say for three days a week, because of that he will get no unemployment assistance benefit and, although he has worked that week, he will not be paid for a fortnight or three weeks.  So that a man working on a relief scheme this week gets no wages and no unemployment assistance; the following week he gets no wages and no unemployment assistance but, in the third week, he gets the wages which he has, perhaps, earned a fortnight previously.  This is the scheme of employment about which there is so much talk.  This is the scheme of employment heralded as a boon and a blessing to the unemployed. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and those who stand for this particularly reactionary policy of part-time employment what is the objection to giving the workers a full week's employment? If there were a scarcity of men, one could understand the difficulty, but we have an abundance of men available <Col N="931" /> for a full week's work or even for 52 weeks' work in the year.  Why are they not being employed for a complete week, or why are they not being employed for a complete year?  Whatever the difficulty may be as regards their employment for a complete year, there ought to be no difficulty whatever in employing them for a complete week, and thus enabling them to earn something like a normal sum in wages. The scheme for employing them for short periods of three or four days per week is simply a device to prevent these people from drawing unemployment assistance benefit.  A man in receipt of 8/- or 10/- unemployment assistance may get a little more by working three days per week on these relief schemes, but the fact is he gets an amount entirely inadequate to his needs.  Every man working on these minor relief schemes or regular relief schemes under the rotational system is being compelled to exist on a rate of wages insufficient to provide him with the minimum standard of subsistence. Then, quite a considerable number of persons who have a small pension from the British Army or a small pension by reason of being a member of the Volunteer reserve&mdash;men with responsibilities and commitments&mdash;can never get a chance of employment on these schemes, because the people who get the preference are those drawing the maximum amount of assistance benefit. They get the preference not because of any sympathy or generosity, but because the more of those taken off the register at the employment exchanges, the greater the saving to the Exchequer at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Will those who defend this scheme say what is the difficulty in giving workers a complete week's work or what is the difficulty in giving them a complete year's work?  There ought to be no difficulty on the part of any Government in giving them a complete week's work, and it is rather notable that it was this Government which introduced the rotational schemes of employment as a means of spreading out relief schemes moneys&mdash;spreading them out by reducing the standard of living of <Col N="932" /> the workers.  Neither ought there to be any great difficulty on the part of this Government in employing these men for 52 weeks in the year instead of employing them for a few days each week for a few weeks.  We were told in 1932 about the famous plan which was to bring back the emigrants and, at the same time, provide employment for all the unemployed people in the country.  Now, we have reached a stage at which we are not only unable to take back the emigrants but we are actually unable to stop a dwindling population from emigrating. The whole scheme which is being enforced through the Board of Works amounts to a confession that there was nothing whatever in the story that Fianna Fáil had a plan to absorb the unemployed into industry.  The fact that the Government find it necessary to resort to this part-time type of work at low rates of wages is a clear indication that the Government cannot solve the unemployment problem and does not know in what way to attack it effectively.  In 1932 there was a plan to absorb the unemployed. Now, when you ask what has happened the plan or what the Government are doing to provide work for the unemployed, you are asked what you yourself would do&mdash;as if Fianna Fáil had not patent rights to this famous 1931 plan.  We are asked, &ldquo;Do you know how much it would cost to absorb all the unemployed?&rdquo; That by a Party who, in 1932, were not only going to absorb all the unemployed in the country but were going to bring back the United States emigrants as well! There is no use in the Government asking other people for remedies for unemployment if that plan is still green, still capable of being implemented, and still capable of achieving its authors' high objective in 1932. The fact is that this whole rotational scheme of employment is a confession of bankruptcy on the part of the Government as regards the solution of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We are now told that there has been an improvement in employment in the Free State.  There probably has been.  There has been an improvement <Col N="933" /> in employment in every other country of the world.  Such improvement as has taken place here is no greater than the measure of improvement which has taken place elsewhere. The Government has no right to plume itself on the ground that there may be an improvement in the unemployment situation here, in view of the general, world-wide tendency towards improvement.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that over 90,000 people are registering for employment at the employment exchanges and satisfying the rigorous tests imposed under the Unemployment Assistance Act to prove they are entitled to benefit under that Act.  A substantial number of other people are unemployed and, because of the methods of administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act, have long since lost hope of getting any benefit through the employment exchanges. That is due to the methods adopted to keep down expenditure under the Act.  Bad as the rotational scheme of employment is, the rate of wages paid by the Board of Works is particularly obnoxious in existing circumstances. The sum of 24/- a week, which can only be obtained by men working for six days of the week, is the maximum wage available for work on the minor relief schemes.  That rate of wages&mdash; intolerably low&mdash;is still adhered to by the Board of Works notwithstanding that there has been a very substantial rise in the cost of living during the past few years and that the tendency is towards further increases in that respect.  In face of a rising cost of living, the Board of Works adheres to a rate of wages which would be utterly indefensible even if the cost of living were much lower than it is to-day. That rate of wages could not be justified if the cost of living were substantially lower than it is at present. That brings me to the point of inquiring whether the rotational schemes of employment and low wages on minor relief schemes is not part of a deliberate policy to try to intimidate this proposed new Agricultural Wages Board from doing anything decent in the matter of fixing the rates of wages for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The Dáil has passed an Act designed to establish an Agricultural Wages Board.  The object of that Agricultural Wages Board is to fix a minimum rate of wages for agricultural workers.  That Act has now been passed for some time, and it has taken the Minister for Agriculture a period of several months to select 12 people to act on that board.  A considerable number of people have grounds for believing that the delay in setting up the board is not unassociated with the Government's general dislike of that particular legislation. The agricultural workers throughout the country are calling out for the establishment of machinery which will enable them to get something better than the rates of wages at which they are working to-day.  But in case they are likely to get too much from this Agricultural Wages Board, we have the Board of Works now setting a standard wage for the agricultural workers and a headline for the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Board of Works are doing that by paying a low maximum wage of 24/- a week in relief schemes.  In fact, they are paying as low as 11/5 and 14/5 a week on relief schemes.  In other cases the wage of 15/- and 20/- a week is being paid in ordinary schemes under the rotational system.  I think the Board of Works ought to be ashamed of the kind of mentality that allows this wage.  It is an effort to cut down to an intolerably low level the standard of existence.  In this matter those who may contest before the Agricultural Wages Board the agricultural workers' right to a decent rate of wages will be able to point to the fact that a great State Department, the Board of Works, is only able to pay a maximum rate of 24/- a week, and, in fact, a lower rate in some of the western and southern counties.</P>
    <P>That will be used as an argument or reason why the Agricultural Wages Board are not to fix more than 24/- a week in respect of agricultural wages. It can also be urged before the Agricultural Wages Board that the Board of Works regards an income of 12/-, 15/- or 20/- a week as sufficient for workers under the rotational scheme of employment.  That will be urged as <Col N="935" /> a reason why agricultural wages should not be raised to a decent level by the Agricultural Wages Board.  I think the whole policy of the Board of Works in respect of minor relief schemes is an outrageously bad policy from the point of view of those who are the victims of it.  The Parliamentary Secretary tries to justify paying this low rate of wages by arguing that if you give more wages then there will be a lesser number of people employed.  We were told recently that the workers employed in Rynanna were happy and contented. On another occasion we were told that anybody who interfered with the workers receiving 24/- a week would be torn limb from limb&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am right oftener than the Parliamentary Secretary.  We have his statement that 4/6 a day was enough to make the workers at Rynanna happy and contented while they were building an aerodrome for other countries.  We were told on a previous occassion that if anybody interfered with the workers getting 24/- a week on minor relief schemes he would be torn limb from limb.  That makes it clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is firmly convinced in his own mind that 24/- a week is a good enough wage for Irish workers.  The enthusiasm which the Parliamentary Secretary imports into defending that rate of wages&mdash;and he does it even with glee&mdash; shows his mentality on the matter.  He said that if the men were given a higher rate of wages there would be less employment for them.  Why, that kind of policy and that kind of reasoning would justify the payment of 10/- a week to workers.  The State has placed upon it the moral responsibility for paying a just wage.  It cannot escape that responsibility.  It has placed upon it a responsibility for setting a fair standard of wages.  But the only standard that they fix is one of 4/- a day, less broken time, and then we are told that if anybody tries to get any more for the workers he is <Col N="936" /> going to be torn limb from limb.  That is because, of course, he would be disturbing the happiness and contentment of these workers who are toiling for this starvation rate of wages.  And we have that condition of things in the face of a very substantial rise in the general cost of living.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether we are to have a continuance of this policy of rotational employment during the current year?  I would like to know from him whether the Government are relying on this method as the best remedy for dealing with a very serious unemployment situation? Are we to have a continuance of a wage policy that is represented by paying the workers a rate of 15/- or 20/- a week?  If that is their policy, the Government ought to be ashamed of standing over it.  Are we to take it from this that the Government has no solution of the unemployment problem?  Are we to take it that the Fianna Fáil plan has now been definitely abandoned and derided?  We have a right to an answer to these questions.  I do not think it is any answer to have the Parliamentary Secretary asking: &ldquo;Do you know the cost of providing employment for all the workers?&rdquo;  I cannot see any of the enthusiasm and the buoyancy about the plan to-day that we saw in 1932.  In many respects, I can see a definite feeling of failure and a feeling of helplessness on the part of the Government in respect of this policy&mdash; a failure to deal effectively with the whole problem of unemployment.  I want to know now whether this policy of misplaced rotational employment is to continue?  If it is, there ought to be some method by which that policy could be challenged in this House.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to allow this question to a free vote of the House.  If he does that, I am certain that he will not be able to get his own Party to go into the Division Lobbies in its support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A question appeared on the Order Paper to-day over the names of Deputy Jordan and myself in regard to the division of an estate in County Galway, the Daly estate. I can tell you that it was with great reluctance we put down that question, but owing to the fact that a holding of land on this estate was allotted to one particular individual, a landless man, whose father owns a holding of 80 acres, the greatest indignation has been caused amongst all parties in that district and we felt that we had to put down that question. We got the type of reply that we more or less expected.  Of course, the reply which the Minister gave was largely based on the brief of the Land Commission officials who dealt with the scheme.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister, because we know that under Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933 he cannot interfere with matters of this kind and he is placed in a rather awkward position having to come here from time to time to ask for money to carry on the work of this Department.  He has no other function save that, and yet he has to bare his shoulders to the lashes which will be handed out to him for the sins of omission and commission of certain officials in his Department.</P>
      <P>We were told, of course, that this particular allottee had all the necessary qualifications and that he was suitable in every way.  We were also told that the I.R.A. applicants were disqualified because of the distance they resided from this particular estate.  I do not think the question of distance should enter into this.  I agree that it may be desirable to confine it to a certain distance, but, after all, we must recollect that distance was no great object in the old days when these men were called upon to render service to their country.  I thought that the question of distance was only considered in the case of uneconomic holders who would be given increases from a particular estate and that they could not get land if they were over a mile distant from an estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> We were also told in regard to this particular allottee that his father's holding was 58 acres in extent and that the valuation is £35 10s. 0d.  I think that in itself is an admission, because a £35 10s. 0d. valuation in County Galway is a pretty high valuation. We contend that his father has over 80 acres and that that holding would bear sub-division, if necessary. If, for instance, this particular allottee were given half of that holding and his other brother, who is not in this country, were given the other half, they would still have better holdings than any of the landless men who have got holdings in County Galway.  It is very significant that this particular allottee was amongst the first to be interviewed when the inspector who was in charge of the preparation of the scheme came on the estate.</P>
    <P>I do not know what outstanding qualification this man has.  He is the only son at home on this 58-acre farm with the £35 10s. 0d. valuation that the Minister speaks of.  His only brother crossed to England six or eight months ago and joined the Irish Guards regiment.  I wonder were these particulars put before the Land Commission? I wonder were they given to the inspector in charge?  If they were, then I think what has happened is directly contrary to the principles of the Land Commission and of the land settlement policy generally.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted that a certain number of the old I.R.A. made application for holdings there.  Amongst those old I.R.A. applicants were men who are not supporters of Fianna Fáil, and they, too, were passed over. I have always tried to defend the actions of the Land Commission in the matter of the division of land, and when, under the 1933 Act, certain powers were taken away from the Minister, we welcomed that, because we believed it could not be thrown up to us that there would be discrimination or that land would be given for political reasons.  I am not alleging altogether that this particular holding was given for political reasons&mdash;that is, in relation to the different parties in this country&mdash;but I do believe that the very fact of this allottee having a relative in the British Army was the <Col N="939" /> very strongest qualification he could have, and it was certainly the only qualification he had.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to say anything as regards the part of the question which sets out that the district is not a very congested one, I will admit that, strictly speaking, in accordance with the law, it is not a very congested district; there are not so many people under £10 valuation, but at the same time that does not say that it may not be congested.  In that particular district, which is an agricultural district, a very intensive agricultural district, we have a number of people on holdings whose valuations are not greater than £15 and, in the families there, there are from four to seven or eight grown-up people.  I think that there would be nothing wrong in providing for these, even if they were anxious to cut out the I.R.A.  We have heard a good deal about giving preference to the I.R.A., but it did not operate in this case.  I do not claim that all the old I.R.A. in that area are supporters of the present Government.  There are a few at least who are not.  But even if the land were given to I.R.A. men, no matter what their Party affiliations at the present time, there would be no indignation of the kind that we are now faced with in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister cannot interfere in this case and see that something is done, then it is pretty near time to put an end to land purchase altogether rather than have this kind of thing going on.  I believe in this case full particulars were not given.  When the Minister was on the Opposition Benches I remember reading in the Press that he said there were men in the Land Commission worth their weight in gold.  I quite agree with him, and there are men to-day well worth their weight in gold.  But there must be more men there who have no regard at all for the responsibility with which they are entrusted.  I cannot understand how this particular allottee was given a holding on that estate.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say much more because Deputy Jordan will have a few words to say.  I ask the Minister, if it <Col N="940" /> is at all possible, in the interests of justice and fair play, to institute an independent inquiry into the division of that estate.  I think he will find, not only from his own supporters and ours, but amongst the strongest supporters of Fine Gael, the same feeling of indignation.  I am sure that they too will be prepared to place the facts before him and confirm what we have stated here, that this particular man was given a holding to which he was not entitled.  I have no more to say on that, but I do hope that there are some holdings reserved there yet and that something will be done to alleviate the existing grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>As my name was attached to the question on the Order Paper along with Deputy Beegan's, I would like to point out to the Minister some facts in connection with the division of this estate.  Although it may not be exactly relevant, I would like to remind the Minister that some time ago when a question was raised here about meetings that were held in Galway in connection with land distribution, or rather negligence in the matter of land distribution, my friend Deputy Brodrick, on the opposite side, stated that when we were addressing the meeting we expressed a fear that the people would not vote for us if the land was not divided.  The Minister, in his innocence, thinking that the Deputy had stated the exact facts, said that there were unreasonable Deputies on both sides of the House.  I wish to point out to the House on this case that no such statement was made and that the Minister is wrong in his estimation of our being unreasonable.  In dealing with this case, I am not being unreasonable at all, and am only dealing with the facts, as agreed to by the people concerned, in connection with the distribution of the land in this case. I endorse everything Deputy Beegan has said as regards the allottee.  The very fact of the Land Commission admitting that this man's father has 58 acres of land, with a valuation of £35 10s., in my opinion, justifies our putting the question down and also justifies the indignation expressed by the people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sent recommendations with regard <Col N="941" /> to every person on that estate, and adjoining it, who asked for them.  I did not discriminate between people, no matter what their political views were.  I think it is an extraordinary thing that this land is divided in the manner described by the Minister in his reply and, as he described, after full investigation into the circumstances of each proposed allottee.  I am very glad to see that anyhow, because the Minister evidently accepts full responsibility for the division of the land and for the giving of a farm to a man, an only son, whose father is the possessor of 58 acres, as is stated here&mdash;although we believe he has more than that&mdash;and with a valuation of £35 10s.  The other allottees on the land are quite young.  The older people, with the greater claim to old I.R.A. service, were left severely alone. It is stated in this reply here that the old I.R.A. applicants lived up to a distance of seven miles away.  Possibly that is true&mdash;that people who applied for land did live that distance away&mdash; but I have here the names of a few old I.R.A. men, who made application for land on that estate and who actually lived on the estate.</P>
    <P>There is the case of Michael Walsh, of Knockatoher.  On what grounds was he turned down?  He is an old I.R.A. man, aged about 45 or 46 years. He gave good service to his country and, without a doubt, was in a position to stock land and manage it properly, if he got it, and he proved to the satisfaction of the people that interviewed him that he would be able to manage it properly, and certainly would not default.  Then there is the case of Joe Keating, also an old I.R.A. man, who is married and has children, and he was left out of the scheme.  There is also Patrick Ford, of Kiltulla, an old I.R.A. man actually living on the estate, and there is a man named Sheridan.  The latter is one of seven sons.  Whether he is the first or the last of the seven sons I do not know, but I think he cannot be the last, because if he were he would probably have some charm as a seventh son and might have been able to get some of the land.  There are two daughters also.  He is living on the estate and <Col N="942" /> his grandfather was evicted out of the estate and he got no compensation.</P>
    <P>There are up to 20,000 acres of land in East Galway, where Deputy Beegan comes from, all around him, and although there were only 433 acres being divided in Dunsandle, three or four migrants were brought in, and they were coming in to the detriment of good I.R.A. men who were living in Dunsandle.  The final part of the Minister's answer is to the effect that one of these is receiving full consideration for a holding on another estate, and he could not get it on the estate in which he was living.  If that is a sample of the way the Land Commission deals with the division of lands in County Galway, and if the same tactics are to be resorted to in the future, the indignation of the people in Galway is likely to increase.  Those of us from Galway, from all sides of the House, I believe, are anxious for the preservation of peace in Galway, but I doubt very much&mdash;and I accept full responsibility for what I say&mdash; whether the people there, seeing their just claims for land on the estates on which they are living being ignored and the land divided in that fashion&mdash; and I am not speaking for Fianna Fáil people any more than for Fine Gael people&mdash;I doubt very much whether these people will be likely to put up with it quietly.  I believe that it will be very difficult to make these people live in ordered conditions or within the law.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission are indiscreet, to say the least of it, in the way they have dealt with these cases.  Personally, I am not satisfied that full consideration was given.  If full consideration had been given, there could be no justification whatsoever in giving that farm of land to a man, an only son, whose father has 58 acres of land with a valuation of £35 10s. while men who were prepared to work the land and who proved by deposit receipts that they were in a position to manage a farm of land, if they got it, were left out.  In the case of this young man, I believe the father is almost 70 years of age to-day.  Certainly, he is well over 60.  I know him, strange to say, <Col N="943" /> for about 35 years, and when I first met him he was a good, hardy man without a doubt.  Without hesitation, I should say that he is well over 60 or 65 years of age, and in the case of a man of that age his only son, certainly, ought not to be allotted the farm.  I agree with Deputy Beegan in his protest and, like him, I hope that the Land Commission will institute a fresh inquiry into the whole case, particularly the case of that particular allottee.  They should inquire into the whole case in general, and I trust there will be some compensation or some settlement of the state of affairs that exists in Galway at the present moment in that particular area, and that some of the disgruntled and dissatisfied men will get what they are legally entitled to, and that is a share of the estate on which they live.</P>

      <P>With regard to this question, Sir, I should like the Fianna Fáil Deputies to be honest.  I know, just as well as Deputy Beegan and Deputy Jordan, the cause of the trouble there.  The cause of the trouble is that four migrants were brought down from Gort, when people there had not got land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the cause of the trouble.  Probably, the Land Commission may be of opinion that there was not sufficient congestion&mdash;I am taking it from an inspector's point of view&mdash;in the district, and probably that the landless men had not sufficient finance to take over these holdings. Probably the men who came from Gort were on very bad holdings, but I believe there were sufficient young men in the district who were in a position to stock those four holdings.  In fact, I go so far as to say that the four holdings would probably suit six landless men in the district.  Now, the Deputies who have spoken have been making capital out of the young man, an only son, who got a farm. Strange to say, there is a second son, and also, strange to say, the father of this chap has married secondly.  The son has no hold whatsoever on the old <Col N="944" /> holding, which is £30 valuation.  The father has another brother living with him along with the two sons, and he has also two daughters.</P>
      <P>The inspector of the Land Commission went to this man and said: &ldquo;You have looked for a holding.  Show me what you are able to do, show me the money you are able to put up.&rdquo;  The applicant replied: &ldquo;I have so much stock at the present time and my father will help me.&rdquo;  He was then asked: &ldquo;Do you want a grant for a house?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and his father said the same thing: &ldquo;No, we can build a house.&rdquo;  The one reason that Fianna Fáil Deputies are making capital out of this matter is because the applicant who got this particular holding is a prominent Blueshirt.</P>

      <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party were straight in this matter they would kick against the Gort migrants, one of them a friend of a Fianna Fáil Deputy in this House. I should like to see those four holdings distributed amongst the people in the district.  I would say that the four holdings could be made into six holdings.  There is another matter that I wish to bring before the House in connection with this question. There is a ploughman who has a free house, free fuel and the grass of a cow on the estate.  He holds his job and he has got a holding of land also.  He is a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter.  He is not losing his job as ploughman on the estate, and he has a free house, free fuel and the grass of a cow.  There are other workers on the estate also.  There is one worker with a family of five, three of whom are working on the estate, and for the grass of one cow they have to travel three miles.  I am only interested in this question to see that these four holdings would <Col N="945" /> be given to local people who are able to work and stock them.  I am also interested to see that the workers on the estate will get some consideration. There are only 200 acres left with the mansion.  If the work is given up there in the near future&mdash;and it is possible that the sawmill will be closed down in a short time&mdash;the men working in the sawmill&mdash;there are only five or six workers&mdash;should each get the grass of a cow, a small garden and some provision should be made so that they would be able to grow some hay for their cows.  That is my attitude to this question.  I would not have risen in this debate were it not that Deputies wanted to make capital out of the case of one tenant who was prepared to stock the land and build a house.  The only reason in my opinion that objection has been taken to him is that he was a prominent Blueshirt, seeing that no objection has been taken to the four men who were brought from the Gort district.</P>

The Land Commission deal with the allocation of land as well as the acquisition of land, so that although I am responsible for the Department, really the allocation of land is not a matter in which I can interfere.  It has been generally admitted that there was no congestion in this area.  Deputy Brodrick complains that four migrants were brought in from another district to relieve congestion in the district from which they were migrated.  If there had been local congestion in this area, the local congests would have got first consideration. Two of the men who are losing their employment on the estate are, I understand, being provided with holdings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that two of the men who are losing employment on the estate are being provided with holdings.  Only one person in the district, as far as I can gather, has got an addition to his holding.  I take <Col N="946" /> it from that, that in the immediate neighbourhood of the estate there was only one uneconomic holder.  Therefore there was no congestion in that area.  There is congestion in other parts of County Galway.  People from other parts of Galway have been brought into County Meath and into my own constituency.  Surely Deputy Brodrick does not object to people being brought from another part of his own county to this district in order to relieve congestion in the county?  It seemed to me that that was his real objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That was really at the bottom of the trouble, but the other Deputies did not mention it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite consistent with Land Commission policy.  In regard to the young man to whom a holding has been given, there have been conflicting statements made here to-night.  My information coincides with Deputy Brodrick's statement, that there are two sons in the family and also two daughters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at the time the report was made out.  The Land Commission reported that there were two sons in the house and also two daughters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>And a brother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the brother.  It is also reported that this man was able to provide a house and to stock the farm provided for him on the estate.  As far as I can see from the report, the Land Commission acted in accordance with the policy laid down for them in connection with the allocation of land.  That is, they took this man as living in the immediate neighbourhood and being landless.  The other son was the man who was likely to get the home holding.  The fact of his living in the immediate neighbourhood and of being landless fulfilled two of the main conditions.  Deputy Jordan says that there were some old I.R.A. men suitable to work the land, actually living on the estate. That does not tally with my information. <Col N="947" /> I am told the nearest point to the estate at which any of the old I.R.A. men live is two and three-quarter miles away.  Some of them are as far away as seven miles.  Deputy Beegan did not say that they lived near the estate.  I do not think that Deputy Brodrick is justified in alleging that there was any question of political considerations in this matter at all.  He did say, if I do not misunderstand him, that somebody was brought to this area from Gort because he was a relation of a Deputy of this House.  That is a wrong insinuation to make.  I can assure him that this scheme was drawn up, as far as I can see from the report, strictly in accordance with Land Commission policy.  Old I.R.A. men have got preference in other places as long as they were not too distant from the holdings and as long as there were no suitable landless men in the district. If there were no suitable landless men in the district, then the old I.R.A. men would get first preference amongst the landless men brought in from outside.  In this case there were six suitable landless men, one of whom was this man in question.  According to the information supplied to me, the Land Commission has acted in accordance with the policy laid down for them.  I, myself, would not like the job of dividing land.  I would not take it.  There will be always dissatisfaction no matter where <Col N="948" /> an estate is divided.  I might think that if I were a Land Commission inspector things would be all right, but, I am sure, if I were, my scheme of division would cause dissatisfaction, too, and I am sure if any of the Deputies concerned in this question took on the job, the result would be the same.  I do not see that I can say anything more on this matter, but I shall investigate the statements made by Deputy Jordan and Deputy Beegan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please give consideration to the case of the man called Sheridan?  The Minister stated that the special allottee about whom this question was raised got consideration because he was one of two sons and had other qualifications&mdash;plenty of money, etc. He said that he got consideration because he was one of two sons.  Would he now consider the case of Sheridan, who is one of seven sons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got some information about him here, but I do not know whether I should make it public. He might not like my doing so. I shall take a note of the matter and see what can be done.  If Deputy Jordan wants to see the information I have got, I shall be glad to show it to him.  I would not care to publish it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the Irish Land Commission acquired the holdings of land held by Michael Gavin, Cross, Kilmeena, and Patrick Berry, Driminabo, Kilmeena, and gave them exchanges for said holdings over seven years ago; that the vacated holdings are still grazed by the migrated tenants; that acute congestion exists in the vicinity, and if he will state when the Land Commission will divide these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The completion of the two migrations in question has been delayed owing to the refusal of both the migrants to execute the necessary deeds of surrender in respect of their old holdings.  In the case of Michael Gavin, it is proposed to complete the migration under the provisions of Sections 28 and 29 of the Land Act, 1931, and a vesting order to give effect to the exchange has been published. Efforts are being continued to induce Patrick Berry to effect the exchange of his holding.  Schemes for the division of the old and new holdings will be put into operation as soon as practicable.</P>
