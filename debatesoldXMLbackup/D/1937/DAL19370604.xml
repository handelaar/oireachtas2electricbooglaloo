      <P>The amendments which have been set down for Report Stage in my name on this Bill are set down at the instance of the promoters.  They are the outcome of suggestions made by the Department of Local Government and Public Health on the Bill as it emerged from the Select Committee and agreed to by the promoters.  It is my view that it is not necessary that any of these amendments should be referred, under Standing Order 105, to the former Committee on the Bill.  They deal with matters which are purely of a formal character.  I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 9, to add at the end of the section the following words: &ldquo;for the purpose only of the receipt and payment of money, and of keeping the accounts of the same and the town clerk shall exercise and perform in relation to the borough all the powers and duties conferred or imposed for any other purpose on the treasurer of a borough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The addition is desired so as to show who will carry out the duties of <Col N="1806" /> treasurer as specified under Section 93 of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1840, other than the receipt and payment of money, the latter being within the province of the bank to be appointed treasurer pursuant to Section 9.  The bank would not discharge the other duties specified in the Municipal Act, 1840.  Hence the amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 10 (1), lines 4 and 5, to delete the words &ldquo;a fund to be established by the Corporation and called &lsquo;the borough fund&rsquo;&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the borough fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As there is already in law a fund known as &ldquo;the borough fund,&rdquo; and as the wording of Section 10 would appear to establish a new fund to be called &ldquo;the borough fund,&rdquo; it is desired that this amendment be made so as to avoid confusion as between the two funds&mdash;the idea being that there is to be only one fund, &ldquo;the borough fund,&rdquo; as already defined by law.</P>

      <P>As the sub-section stands without amendment, a question might arise that the only payment that could be made out of the borough fund would be the costs of the present Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this motion because this is a motion which deals with the making of special provision in relation to the last holder of the office of Governor-General. We object to giving a large sum of money and to endowing the last holder of the office of Governor-General with a pension of £500 a year.  I venture to think that this is one of the most extraordinary and one of the most audacious attempts &mdash;and I hope it will proceed no further <Col N="1809" /> than an attempt&mdash;ever made to endow an ex-follower of a political Party now in power with a pension for life, a pension which he has not earned by any service whatever.  It is going back to a very old and very bad system.  I suppose that there are few members in this House who are not familiar with the history of the Irish Parliament prior to the Union.  I suppose that there are very few members in this House who are not aware that the Government of that day exercised its power largely through the distribution of patronage, which consisted in giving sinecure offices and pensions out of the Civil List.  It was largely because of the exercise of that power of giving sinecures and of endowing political followers with pensions that that Parliament was brought into the disrepute into which it subsequently fell.  It was through methods such as that that the Union was passed.  We are getting back to that old system.  I want to say that when a member of the Executive Council loses his post in the Executive Council and, because the Seanad is dissolved, gets a high post in the Civil Service, if that is not exactly a sinecure, it is getting perilously near to being one, and certainly it is unjust to the other civil servants.  But here you have got a pension naked and unashamed.  You are giving a pension for no other reason than the fact that while he was a member of this House he was a faithful follower of the Fianna Fáil Party.  No other reason can be alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Buckley was appointed to the post of Governor-General by His Majesty the King on the recommendation of the Executive Council.  We were told in this House&mdash;and, I presume, correctly and truly told&mdash;that by a fixed agreement he was to receive a salary of £2,000 a year.  He was also to be given the right to inhabit a suburban residence somewhere, I think, in the vicinity of Blackrock.  I am not quite sure where the residence was.  Those were the terms of his appoinment.  Mr. Buckley had lost his seat in Kildare.  His merits for this post of Governor-General seem to have been that he had voted faithfully with his Party <Col N="1810" /> while he was a member of this House. The people of his constituency having grown weary of him and having selected another person to represent them in the Dáil, this provision was made for him by the Executive Council.  That seems to have been the sole reason why Mr. Buckley was selected for the post of Governor-General of this State.  His salary was fixed, and on those terms Mr. Buckley entered into office.  There were other terms, of course, We know that Mr. Buckley was appointed on condition that he never showed himself in public. Mr. Buckley was appointed on condition that he took no part in any State functions or in any State affairs. Mr. Buckley was appointed on condition that he lived the life of a hermit, the life of a recluse, and that nobody would be aware of his existence.</P>
    <P>The sole function that he performed during his term of office was the signing of certain Bills sent up by the Oireachtas for his signature.  I should say that, roughly, he signed about 50 Bills per annum during his four years of office.  That would be something like 200 times he wrote his signature and, as a reward for writing his signature some 200 times, he received £8,000 in cash.  He had nothing else to do. There was no entertaining; there was no acting as social head of the State, as he was supposed to act.  He was living the life of a recluse.  I do not know whether, when the Clerk of the Dáil brought Mr. Buckley up those various Bills for signature, he was allowed to see Mr. Buckley, or whether Mr. Buckley resided in his suburban residence as much under President de Valera's <i>lettre de cachet</i> or as much concealed from the public eye as the famous Man in the Iron Mask was concealed from the public eye under the <i>lettre de cachet</i> of Louis XIV.  But there he was, receiving his £2,000 a year, and not showing himself or not being allowed to show himself or enter into the social life at all.  Why, that man's £2,000 a year must have been £2,000 clear to pocket; £2,000 a year to be banked up; £2,000 a year to fall back on as a nice little nest-egg when his term of office was over.  Surely one might say that Mr. Buckley in Blackrock had just as much chance or just <Col N="1811" /> as much opportunity of expending money as had St. Anthony in the desert.  He was living the life of a hermit, and possibly, carrying it out to the full, living the life of an anchorite also.  Anyhow, he was there in his complete seclusion, having nothing to do with his money except to bank it up for the happy period when his office would come to an end, and he could live for the rest of his life in comfort on his savings.</P>
    <P>But what do we discover here?  He is going to get something more.  He is going to receive some £2,000 in hard cash.  That is what we are being asked to vote for here.  Why is he to receive £2,000 in hard cash?  There can be no reason.  His office is terminated.  He had undertaken, I will not say to perform the duties of his office, but he had undertaken to be a titular Governor-General for the sum of £2,000 a year. The office was abolished.  Nobody had guaranteed or nobody could guarantee or nobody had the power to guarantee that the office would last for five years, or that he would remain the occupant of the office for five years.  Any other Executive Council coming into office during that period of five years could have advised His Majesty to remove Mr. Buckley, just as President de Valera advised His Majesty to remove Mr. McNeill.  There was no contract of any kind.  We were told here in this House that £2,000 was what he was to receive; that £2,000 was what he had agreed to take.  Why is he getting a gratuity of £2,000?  So far we have no explanation from the Government Benches.  We had eulogies of Mr. Buckley.  I am not concerned with Mr. Buckley personally.  Assuming the eulogies are deserved what has that to do with this matter?  The question for the House is: did Mr. Buckley, because he filled the office of Governor-General, receive to the last farthing every sum of money he agreed to take?  Did he receive to the full the salary for which he agreed to fill the office?  Why is he to receive £2,000 as a free gift from the pockets of the Irish ratepayers?  But this goes further.  It does not stop there.  Mr. Buckley is to receive a pension of, roughly, £10 a week for the <Col N="1812" /> rest of his life.  Why is that?  What reason can there be for that?  There was never any talk of the office of Governor-General being a pensionable office when Mr. Buckley was appointed; nor could it have been made a pensionable office by the Executive Council when Mr. Buckley was appointed. Only the Dáil could have made it a pensionable office.</P>
    <P>Now we are asked, retrospectively, to make the office which Mr. Buckley received upon one set of terms, a pensionable office, and that Mr. Buckley should receive £500 a year&mdash;approximately £10 a week for the rest of his life&mdash;as a reward.  For what?  As a reward for doing nothing.  As a reward for occupying a post and, by agreement, doing no work when he occupied it.  We have pensionable offices in this State, but we are going back to a very old principle and to a very bad principle, when we start giving pensions when no work was done. There are pensions for civil servants, for national teachers, for civic guards and for the Army.  That is right.  Civil servants work in their offices, the teachers have taught during their term, Guards have been policing the country while active members of the Guards, and soldiers have offered and have been willing to fight for their country.  In these cases pensions are given to men who worked until the period for work had passed.  But Mr. Buckley is not a person who should ever receive a pension for doing nothing, at least in this country, where pensions have been payable for 150 years.  We are asked here solemnly to vote the sum of £10 a week to Mr. Buckley for life as a reward for doing nothing.  For what reason?  I see none except that Mr. Buckley always was a very faithful supporter of the Government Party.</P>
    <P>Of course, this opens up a delightful prospect.  I am sure every member of the Fianna Fáil Party will vote for this motion with a heart and a half. There are elections coming on.  The same fate that befell Mr. Buckley in Kildare might befall other Fianna Fáil members in other constituencies.  Then they will be eligible for free gifts of £2,000, and eligible for pensions of £500 a year, because they will have done precisely <Col N="1813" /> the same thing as Mr. Buckley did to deserve £2,000 and £500 a year; they went up for constituencies in the Fianna Fáil interests and were beaten. I am sure some of the Fianna Fáil people hope that they may be some of the happy persons to be selected for treatment in the same generous and kindly fashion, and that they will vote willingly for this motion.  But how about the persons who think they are custodians and trustees for the people, who think it is their duty to look after the people's money, and not to vote it away to any man, not as a reward for services, not as payment for work done, and not as a pension for work done after work has been completed, but as a free, voluntary, gratuitous gift?  If this House does not think that a proper principle, and that free gifts should be made to individuals, the House should not vote for the motion.  This Bill and the Bill which follows it is, to my mind, one of the very first examples of the evils which we prophesied would inevitably come to this State if we were to have Single Chamber Government.</P>
    <P>This is not a Money Bill, and could not be so certified, I submit, as there are other provisions in it besides the gratuity to Mr. Buckley.  Does anybody think that if a Bill like this came before the Seanad it would be passed? Because we have Single Chamber Government, and because there is no check upon the majority in this House, we are faced with this position, that a majority can come in and vote away public money as a reward to an ex-supporter of their Party, and, I daresay, a personal friend of a great many of them.  That is not the way in which public finance should be looked after. It is my submission to the House&mdash; and I have weighed my words very carefully&mdash;that the only way in which this motion can be described, and the only way a Bill founded upon it can be described is as a shocking financial scandal.  It is that the House is asked to vote for.  I daresay the motion will be carried.  I am sure it will be carried.  Then we will have this terrible precedent set up for future Parliaments anxious to vote away to their political supporters Government funds, or anxious to endow their political <Col N="1814" /> supporters or personal friends out of public funds.  We will have this Act, when it becomes law, cited as a precedent and, if at any time people in this House denounce any Bill voting gratuities out of the public purse to individuals who have done no work to deserve them, it will be pointed out that under the venal administration of President de Valera such venal acts could be done.  It will, therefore, be an excuse for similar venality in the hands of a Government actuated by the same want of public principle as the present Government.</P>

      <P>Coming from a constituency that contains more of the poorer element than perhaps any other constituency on the western seaboard, I think I should raise my voice in protest against this scandalous Bill.  We had very high-sounding phrases spoken in this House yesterday about public morality.  Here we have the very antithesis of public morality. I never thought I would see the day when public morality in this country would have fallen to such a low standard that a Bill of this kind would be introduced into an Irish Parliament We are going to pass a sum of £500 per annum and to give a lump sum as a year's salary in lieu of notice to Mr. Donal Ua Buachalla for his services.  To what?  Not to the State and not to the country, but simply because, in the lowest possible degree, he allowed himself to be made a door-mat for President de Valera on which he might wipe his feet; in order that he might be used to degrade a position which up to the time he occupied it was, at all events, a position of dignity and carried some degree of respect.  He was brought in to degrade that position, and to demean and degrade himself.</P>

I think this thing is going to live in history as one of the most disgraceful episodes in any Parliamentary life.  It is a thing that, in its reactions, will be pursued with vengeance against the Party and the Government that introduced it and are going to pass it and shove it down our throats and the throats of the people of the country in spite of our protest.</P>

      <P>Deputies who have spoken tried to blind themselves to what are the real facts of this matter. If the Government wished the day before the Governor-General ceased to hold office, they could allow him to draw the full salary and the full emoluments of this office without coming to this Dáil at all.  We have people talking about the scandalous position. On the last day it was mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald that £6,000 of the sum paid to the previous Governor-General was free of income-tax.</P>
      <P>The President pointed out that there was an allowance of £7,500 free of income-tax given to the previous Governor-General.  I suppose we will be told that it was for entertainment, and I suppose the entertainment was free of tax.  I do not know what the entertainment was and it does not matter to the country what it was.  I do not know what service the entertainment for which £7,500 was allowed was to the country.  But that was the position.  It did not even come before the Public Accounts Committee that there was an allowance of £7,500 free of income-tax from 9th April, 1930. These are the people who talk about the scandalous and disgraceful thing which is being done now.  These are the people who have the cheek to get up and brazen this out about the scandalous thing that is being done and the nice reading it is for the country. There was no protest and no inquiry about the entertainment that was given formerly and the value of that entertainment.  I do not know what it was, and nobody, I think, took much interest in it.  Anyway, this allowance of £7,500 was given for entertainment. What benefit did it bring to the country?  Or what did it consist of? We do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told about the recent occupant of that office&mdash;that he kept himself <Col N="1817" /> away.  Perhaps even from the national point of view that he was trying to have carried out he did better service that way and gave better value to the country than the £7,500 people who were supposed to give this entertainment. People talk about the scandal of this and so on.  From the Fine Gael Benches they talk as if there were never any gratuities or pensions given.  Deputy Fitzgerald hinted about somebody in the Seanad who was entitled to be reinstated in the service, as if that was a job.  The people of the country have not such short memories and they know perfectly well that men who were in the Army and otherwise&mdash;some of them occupying seats on the opposite benches&mdash;men who had full salary when serving in the Army, got gratuities, and some of them allowances and some of them pensions. Some of them also got positions afterwards.  We are told that they served the country.  Mr. Buckley served his country, according to his lights, and according to our lights, as well as anybody who got any of these gratuities or anything else.  Mr. Buckley may be criticised for getting this.  We may be asked to give an explanation as to why £2,000 should now be made available for him.  If Mr. Buckley thought more of himself and less of the country, and was in the position in which some of the people on the opposite benches were, in times of strain and stress and trouble in this country, of looking after themselves and not bothering about the country, then perhaps it would not be necessary for us to come to this House with a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>I explained on the Second Reading of the Bill that this £2,000 seemed to be only a reasonable amount for a man who had saved this country all the money he had during the four years he occupied the office.  £2,000 to set him up in a house and £500 for the remaining years of his life, knowing the stage of life he is at, seems a very small allowance for a man who has given the service to the country that he has.  The people who got the gratuities I have referred to were young men when they got them and they were able to go out and make a living for themselves. Nobody can suggest that Mr. Buckley, <Col N="1818" /> at this stage of life is able to go out and make a living for himself.  If he kept himself in the background, he did it because of the deliberate policy of the Government that he should occupy that position and remain in that position.  It was not with any very good will that Mr. Buckley took that position.  He took it because he was asked by the President to take the position.  It was not through any looking for it on his part&mdash;far from it! it was the direct opposite.</P>
    <P>I think that if Deputies opposite and Deputies on the other benches who may be opposing this would ask themselves that question they could only give one answer to satisfy themselves that Mr. Buckley never looked for this position, that he was not anxious for it and was, in fact, anxious to avoid taking it.  He was put in that position because it suited our policy, and he served in that position because it was the policy of the Executive Council.  It is the duty of the Executive Council and of the country in whose services he has acted, according to that policy which he has carried out, to make this small necessary provision for him.  Do Deputies want to have this Bill withdrawn? Do Deputies want the position that he would be entitled to claim this money? I do not say that he would go.  I am, however, quite certain that he would be entitled to it in any court.</P>

Mr. Buckley took upon himself a very difficult position. In the interests of the country, and in the national interests of the people, this provision should be made for him.  It is the duty of the Dáil, and it is the duty of the country, to make such provision as is absolutely necessary for Mr. Buckley to have made for him, so that he may have some provision for the rest of his life.  He was not in a position while he served his country to make any provision for himself. The Executive Council are now making that provision, and it is their duty to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not understand all this pother about the gratuity and pension being awarded to Domhnall Ua Buachalla, because I believe we are hastening very fast indeed to the end of our financial resources.  I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan were alive to-day they would have provided for them here a most wonderful theme for <Col N="1820" /> the display of their genius, and in collaboration on that theme they would have been able to hand their names down to posterity as the greatest collaborateurs ever known.  I have, on former occasions, given expression to my views on this matter of pensions.  I feel that where services have been rendered, whether by men in the Army, or men on board our own Navy, the Muirchú, they should be entitled to adequate compensation for any disabilities arising or accruing from services rendered.  I have always felt in relation to Army service that where a woman has lost her husband or son or one on whom she was dependent for a livelihood, she should be compensated for that loss, no matter on which side men fought.  But we should cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; some time or other, and there should be some finality to these pensions.</P>
      <P>As far as I can gather there must have been between 2,000 and 3,000 men fighting during the rebellion in the Post Office.  I do not know the floor space of the old Post Office, but judging from the applications sent in by men who claimed they fought there, it is difficult to understand how the place was able to contain them all.  But all these people were volunteers simply and solely.  They were men who, at that time, claimed they did not look for any reward for themselves for military service.  One feels that in comparison with the numbers who fought in that Post Office army, Napoleon's grand army fades into insignificance.  It does, indeed, compared with the number of persons we have in this country tumbling over each other looking for pensions.  I suggest that all this pother about a pension for Domhnall Ua Buachalla should once and for all come to an end. One sometimes feels that some day we will have military pensions for the whole population and the financial resources of the country will then go wallop.  We have heard a good deal about &ldquo;Erin go bragh.&rdquo;  I can envisage a time coming when we will see big public processions and demonstrations where, instead of &ldquo;Erin go bragh&rdquo; on the banners, we will have inscribed &ldquo;Eire for Pensions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 33, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to delete the provision in this Bill whereby a sum of £2,000 is to be paid to the ex-Governor-General. When discussing the provisions of this Bill on the Second Reading, I indicated that I had no personal objection whatever to the last holder of the office of Governor-General and that no remarks of mine were to be construed in any way as reflecting upon the standing of that gentleman in the community or his services to the nation in other years.  My remarks on this and on the next amendment are not to be taken as in any way reflecting upon the last holder of the office of Governor-General. I want to discuss this, the next amendment, and, indeed, the whole Bill, in an impersonal way, and to deal with this matter as I would deal with it if provision were being made for some person other than Mr. Donal Buckley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the Second Reading that the provisions of the Bill were, in short, a complete recantation of everything that Fianna Fáil previously professed to stand for.  The more one examines the Bill and the more one studies the gyrations of the Party in recent years, the more true that statement of mine becomes.  At one time we used to have declarations by the Fianna Fáil Party that it was an unpatriotic thing for any Deputy to accept a salary of £360 per annum; that it was a sacrilege against the nation that any Deputy should dream of expecting a salary of £360 per annum.  I think the proposal was then made that Fianna Fáil Deputies would not accept any salary but that, instead, they would put their entire salaries into a national fund for the development of Irish industries.  I never saw a balance sheet relating to that fund.  I do not know what dimensions the fund has reached.  One gentleman who claimed to know something of its origin and its development told me that there were only two subscriptions and that a third person inquired <Col N="1824" /> was there any money in it for lending to people in distress.</P>
    <P>After that declaration by Fianna Fáil, that it was quite improper for any person to accept a salary of £360 per annum, we had a further campaign by the Fianna Fáil Party through the country, a poster campaign, setting out at considerable length, and no doubt at considerable expense to themselves, a list of pensions which were being paid by the State to people who fought in the Black and Tan war and to people who served in the National Army.  Fianna Fáil paraded the whole country and said: &ldquo;These pensions are a disgrace; we do not stand for these pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some of the pensions were less than £100 per year, and were given to people in very poor circumstances, so that, from taking no salary as Deputies, they progressed to not standing for pensions to persons who served in the Black-and-Tan war and in the National Army.  Then, of course, we had another grandiloquent declaration by Fianna Fáil that Ministerial salaries were too high and that it was an outrage on the nation that a Minister should receive £1,700 per annum and Parliamentary Secretaries £1,000 per annum.  At the cross-roads throughout the country the Fianna Fáil Party denounced the payment of those salaries to Ministers, and when they came into office, they decided that the salaries of Ministers should be reduced to £1,000 per annum, and we had a certificate from the President of the Executive Council that £1,000 per annum was sufficient salary for a Minister.  We have now reached the stage at which the Executive Council has gone on record as declaring that a salary of £1,000 is sufficient for a Minister for Justice, or any other member of the Executive Council, and when we consider this whole question of providing a pension and a lump sum to the ex-Governor-General, we must bear that declaration by the President and previous declarations by the Fianna Fáil Party carefully in mind. When the Second Stage of this Bill was being discussed, the Minister for Justice said that the Governor-General was receiving less than his predecessors. We all know that, but who, <Col N="1825" /> least of all Fianna Fáil, could possibly try to justify the payment of a salary of £10,000 to any Governor-General? Everybody knows that the previous Governor-General's salary was outrageous, that there was no justification whatever for paying it, and it carries very little weight for the Minister for Justice to tell us that the last Governor-General endeavoured to struggle on on a salary of £2,000, which is twice as much as the Minister for Justice is expected to live upon, although he performs a thousand times more work than the ex-Governor-General did.</P>
    <P>Let us see on what ground this lavish expenditure and this bounteous generosity to the ex-Governor-General can be justified.  On the last occasion we discussed this Bill, the Minister for Education made a long speech in which he endeavoured to show some justification for the munificence of the Government towards the ex-Governor-General. What are the facts of the situation?  We are not considering now Mr. Buckley's record during his lifetime.  We are considering the situation whereby a man, in 1932, was asked by the Government to accept a post at a salary of £2,000 per annum, plus expenses.  The man agreed to accept the position at that salary, and it was in many respects a very generous salary.  It was particularly generous when you remember that the man, apparently, consented to be virtually a prisoner in the mansion provided for him by the Government, and that he apparently carried out all instructions given to him faithfully, so far as the Government was concerned.  So far as social amenities are concerned, the man may admittedly have imposed terrific sacrifices upon himself, but let us remember that the man was paid a salary of £2,000 per annum for whatever duties he was supposed to have discharged in that office.</P>
    <P>What are the duties of a Governor-General? In the main, they consist of signing a Bill and living as comfortably as possible.  A salary was provided in order that he could enjoy the comfort of a country mansion, and his monastic life there was occasionally interfered with by the Clerk <Col N="1826" /> of the Dáil calling and saying: &ldquo;A Bill to be signed, sir.&rdquo;  When you count the number of Bills to be signed, however, and even give rein to your imagination in seeing what the Governor-General might have done during those four years, the most you can get on the credit side, so far as he was concerned, is that he signed a number of Bills.  When you calculate the number of Bills he signed, you find that almost every time he signed his name he cost the State, at his rate of remuneration, about £80.  I know of nobody else in the country who contrives to get £80 from another person simply because he signs his name to a Bill.  I would have thought that treating the Governor-General in that lavish way was dealing pretty decently with the man from the material point of view, if you look at it only from that standpoint; and living in these circumstances, performing that very menial task and not being greatly encumbered with laborious toil, the Governor-General who had been paid £2,000 per year for four years, should not have very much complaint if at the end of that period the link that kept him in that office was suddenly snapped.</P>
    <P>After all, this ex-Governor-General surely knew the President's mind. He scarcely expected that Fianna Fáil, a Republican Party, would continue a Governor-General in office for ever, and he surely knew that all the time he was sitting on a kind of republican powder barrel, that any day it might go up and he might be shot back to the civilian life from which he emerged.  The Governor-General, under Fianna Fáil administration, had no right to expect that he had the title deeds of that office for ever, and it must, therefore, not have come as any great surprise to the occupant of that office when he discovered that the Government which appointed him had decided to abolish his position.  We reach a stage, at all events, at which, having surveyed the office, the duties attached to the office and the functions performed in the office by the Governor-General, we find that during a period of four years, merely for signing his name to Bills to the tune of <Col N="1827" /> about £80 a time, the Governor-General amassed the sum of £8,000. I do not know of anybody else in the State service who manages to get that sum of money from the State for such menial duties in such a short period.  I know that thousands of people in the State cannot get a fraction of that from the Government for duties much more onerous, and with much greater domestic and citizen responsibilities than the occupant of this office.</P>
    <P>What, therefore, justifies this generosity on the part of the Government? It cannot be said that the Governor-General was overworked, that he was appointed to this office with the title deeds to it for life or that he was led to believe that the office would last for a longer period than it, in fact, did last.  The Governor-General, a shrewd old man, must have been well aware of his position in relation to that particular office and it must in no sense have come as a surprise to him that the Government had decided to abolish the post.  He was put into the office to do what the Government desired and I rather imagine that one of the first admonitions addressed to him by the President, on taking up that office, was that the Government had no great desire to continue it in existence and that one of these fine days he must be prepared to wake up and find himself an humble citizen once more.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister for Education, in an endeavour to justify this proposal, talked about the services for the ex-Governor-General during 1916.  We are not, in this Bill, remunerating the ex-Governor-General for his services in 1916.  This Bill has nothing whatever to do with the ex-Governor-General's services in 1916 any more than it has anything to do with the services of anybody else in 1916.  This Bill is designed to reward the Governor-General not for what he did in 1916 but for the leisurely duties he performed between 1932 and 1936.  It is simply trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people to pretend that the ex-Governor-General's services in <Col N="1828" /> 1916 have anything whatever to do with the provisions of a Bill of this kind.  When we try to find out the real justification for the generosity of the Executive Council, the only explanation we can discover is that given by the Minister for Education on the Second Reading debate, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the particular circumstances of the time it was an extremely difficult position for Mr. Buckley to accept.  It is because we realise that he made a big sacrifice that we are making this provision now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The office of Governor-General was suddenly abolished and the Government are not going to take up the position that the gentleman who, against his will and entirely out of a feeling to do whatever his duty to his country called upon him to do and to do it at a rather critical stage, is to be left unprovided for when he relinquishes that office in circumstances into which I need not enter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking the Minister for Education as speaking the mind of the Government, we find that the reason for this generosity towards the ex-Governor-General is that he made a big sacrifice and that provision must now be made for him.  Will somebody tell us what sacrifices he made between 1932 and 1936? We have loose talk about the sacrifice made by the ex-Governor-General but nobody has attempted to give us an example of these sacrifices.  If it is now contended that it is a sacrifice to take a job&mdash;a comfortable, leisurely job&mdash;of that kind at £2,000, then I do not know anybody in this country who would not gladly make that sacrifice with 1,000 times more avidity than was displayed by the ex-Governor-General. What were the sacrifices made by the ex-Governor-General?  If they are so obvious to Ministers, surely they ought not to be so secretive about them. They ought to let the whole community, in justice to the name of the man who made the sacrifice, know what the sacrifices were.  While we have had a lot of loose talk about sacrifices, we have not had the slightest indication from the Government as to what type of sacrifice was made.  It seems <Col N="1829" /> now to have been a sacrifice for the Governor-General to go to the trouble of counting the £2,000.</P>
    <P>I protested against the Second Reading of this Bill because I considered it was an outrageous Bill.  To-day, the Minister for Justice tried to muster up a little indignation at the sentiments expressed on the Financial Resolution.  I should like to hear the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Finance on this Bill if he were on the Opposition Benches.  All the indignation the latter Minister displayed yesterday would be multiplied a thousandfold if he were on the Opposition Benches, and this were a Fine Gael instead of a Fianna Fáil Bill. The Government knows perfectly well that, so far as the community is concerned, nobody can discover a reason for the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  I do not think that the Party can be terribly happy over its provisions.</P>

      <P>Apparently.  I do not want you to make confessions about it. I protest against the provisions of this Bill because I cannot see any justification for this generosity.  I could not see any justification for it if the proposal were to pay the previous Governor-General a pension of this kind.  I could not see any justification for it if it were proposed to pay the first Governor-General a pension of this kind.  I am opposed to paying this Governor-General a pension because I do not believe he has earned it and because I do not see that he has done anything during the last four years to justify this munificence and extravagance towards him.  Other people whose economic position is much worse than that of the person dealt with in this Bill cannot induce the Government to take the same sympathetic and generous attitude towards them.  We are told by the Government that not another halfpenny can be spent on the provision of additional benefits to unemployed people.  We are told that not another halfpenny can be given to supplement the low rates of <Col N="1830" /> widows' and orphans' pensions paid to persons who come under the non-contributory portion of the Act.  We are told that teachers must continue to suffer cuts in their pensions and salaries, that there is no money available to increase them.  We are told that thousands of lowly-paid State servants cannot get any more, that there is nothing in the larder to give them.  At the same time we are told that we have a proposal to pass a Bill to give £2,000 to an ex-Governor-General, to give him a pension of £500 and to give him a blank cheque for the odds and ends of liabilities which may have to be discharged in connection with his vacation of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was sought to be alleged on the Second Reading of this Bill that the Governor-General made a big sacrifice. I do not know whether or not that was a sacrifice of prestige.  If it was only a sacrifice of prestige, I do not know that we can ever recompense a person for the loss of that prestige in this mercenary way.  I think that some effort was made to show that the ex-Governor-General suffered certain financial loss by being called to the service of the State in this leisurely office. If it be true that the ex-Governor-General suffered some financial loss by reason of being asked by the State to accept this position, surely we ought to have the question of loss examined. The Government has just decided to set up a committee to deal with the question as to whether the present salaries and allowances of Ministers and certain other persons are adequate or inadequate.  Surely that committee could also examine the question as to whether the Governor-General was in a position to substantiate the claim that he had suffered material loss as a result of having been called to serve the State in this capacity.  If we did not desire to have the matter examined by a committee constituted as this Salaries Committee will be constituted, surely we could have asked a couple of judges to examine the loss the ex-Governor-General had suffered, and provide us with a report as to what should be paid to him.  I might take a different view of a proposal based on a <Col N="1831" /> recommendation of that kind.  But we have got no recommendation of that kind.  We have got no evidence that the ex-Governor-General suffered any loss.  We have got no evidence that he did anything else than make a substantial profit.  On top of that, it is proposed to hand over to him in this Bill very generous financial compensation, because his office was suddenly abolished, and because, in the words of the Minister for Education, he made a big sacrifice, which, so far, nobody has been able to set out in any detail.</P>
    <P>I am completely opposed to this Bill in so far as it provides this pension for four years' leisurely service for the State.  There is no justification for this Bill, and there is no justification for treating this ex-Governor-General in this generous way while thousands of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit are expected to exist on a maximum benefit of 12/6 a week for seven persons, while old I.R.A. men cannot get decisions on claims for service pensions and disability pensions, while thousands of widows are expected to exist on miserably low rates of benefit, and while other classes in the community cannot get their economic and financial difficulties solved.  While all that is true, we have this display of generosity towards this ex-Governor-General.  No reason whatever has been given for the Bill, and there is no justification for it.  It appears to everybody to be needless generosity on the part of the Government in making provision for a person who has been associated with their own Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard from the Minister for Justice one of the lamest and weakest defences which could possibly be put forward for this proposal.  The Minister, as a rule, is a rather quiet speaker in this House, but he tried this morning to lash himself into some excitement. He utterly failed.  He certainly did not seem to me though, to use a metaphor with which I imagine he is familiar, he was under whip and spur, to manage to bring <Col N="1832" /> any sense of conviction into his own mind.  What was the Minister's argument?  It was simply this, that Mr. Buckley, if he did not agree to take £2,000 a year, might have got £10,000, but he did agree.  All the stumping up and down the country, all the boasting in the Dáil of the value which Fianna Fáil were to get out of getting a Governor-General to do for £2,000, as they said, what cost £10,000 before, was utilised because Mr. Buckley was willing to do his work for £2,000 a year.  That was his bargain.  That was his agreement. That is not denied.  Was £2,000 a year an adequate sum?  The Executive Council thought it was, and Mr. Buckley thought it was.  Why is there any alteration now?  What has happened between the date of Mr. Buckley's appointment and the present time that makes Mr. Buckley worth a pension of £500 a year and £2,000 hard cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us no reason for this.  He said that Mr. Buckley if he went to law, dishonourably went to law, might succeed in getting arrears.  I am not at all clear about that.  I am perfectly aware that it is a very sound legal principle that if a man is owed £10,000, and he agrees to take £2,000 of the sum that he is owed, his contract is void for lack of consideration, and he can sue for the other £8,000 if he is a dishonest and a dishonourable man. But I do not at all agree that that principle is applicable here, because this is not a case of Mr. Buckley coming in at £10,000 a year, and then agreeing, subsequently, to receive £2,000 a year.  This is a specific contract with Mr. Buckley that he will only be paid at the rate of £2,000 a year, and the consideration in this case is the getting of the appointment. Therefore, the argument that there is want of consideration in the first instance that I put is not applicable here at all, because there is full consideration.  Therefore, it is by no means clear that if Mr. Buckley were to sue he would succeed, but even assuming that that were so, how does that justify the Government?  To my mind it does <Col N="1833" /> not even lay the basis of justification. You have got here the broad simple fact that Mr. Buckley, in consideration of his not carrying out the unwritten duties of his post, was to receive £2,000 a year.  That has been altered now gratuitously by the Government out of their kindness of heart, but of course not at their own but at the taxpayers' expense it has been altered into a completely free gift.  When we ask the reason why Mr. Buckley is getting this free gift, the Minister gives us none, and I do not suppose that he will attempt to give us any.</P>
    <P>The Minister attacked the provision that was made for the previous Governors-General.  He attacked the fact that a sum was allowed to them for entertaining.  That sum, I would point out, was fixed and settled by the Dáil.  Whether it was a wise thing or an unwise thing that the social head of the State should be voted a sum of money to entertain distinguished visitors coming to this country, and that he should expend that sum of money in entertaining distinguished visitors, is a question upon which views may differ.  Personally, I think the social head of the State should be in a position to entertain on behalf of the State: not on behalf of any political Party in the State, but on behalf of the State as a whole.  He should be in a position to entertain adequately and properly, as becomes the head of the State, distinguished persons or distinguished groups of persons or large associations that come here in an official or representative capacity. Personally, I think that is how that money went.  Anyhow, the Government at the time considered that that was correct and did supply the money.  The money, in fact, was voted by the Dáil, but this is quite different.  Here was no question of entertainment.  Here, as I have already pointed out, was a gentleman isolated and living in a hermitage, a compulsory hermitage by the terms of his office, because if he had gone to a single State ceremony, to a commemoration Mass or anything of that sort, in which he would have taken precedence of the President of <Col N="1834" /> the Executive Council, of course he would have been sacked immediately. That was known, so that he had to live in his hermitage, and as I have already pointed out, a hermitage is not a place in which you can spend very much money.  In consequence, this gentleman must have been making very considerable savings, certainly enough to live upon.</P>
    <P>Then we had the extraordinary argument that he took the position against his will, and that, in fact, he hated the job.  He is allowed out of the job a year earlier than it was thought he might have gone, and surely the natural conclusion from that would be that he should pay you for letting him out rather than that you should pay him, if he hated the job and was so anxious to get out of it. This argument that he took this job, that he took this £2,000 a year against his will, has certainly absolutely nothing in it.  It cuts, as I say, much more the other way.  Why should a gentleman be paid a pension for giving up a job before his time&mdash; and I understand that is the argument &mdash;a job which he was always anxious to give up and which he hated holding &mdash;always assuming that he took it against his will?  As to whether or not he did take it against his will, I do not know, but it seems to me that he was rather a foolish person because, to any person who wants to retire and to live a secluded life in solitude, this seems to have been a most eminently attractive post that he got&mdash;eminently attractive.  I daresay that people who like social gaiety, or attendance at race meetings, or anything of that kind, would have found his job extremely unpleasant, but to a gentleman of retiring habits, as no doubt Mr. Buckley is, it was a most delightful thing to be able to live the life of a recluse, to have your little desk and your nice little hermitage, and all the time to have your £2,000 a year mounting up and mounting up, and I am sure being very wisely and suitably invested, so that when you come out of your hermitage and the delights of the world catch you again you will have a very nice little sum of money to spend for the future.  I <Col N="1835" /> hold, therefore, that there is no necessity or justification for this payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join my word of protest to what has already been said against what is proposed in this measure.  The sum involved may not seem to be a very considerable one having regard to the resources of the State as a whole, but I know of no proposal in recent years that has created more disaffection throughout the country than the proposal enshrined in this measure.  The principle behind it&mdash;or rather it would be better to say the lack of principle behind it&mdash;is causing endless talk amongst the people in this country who have been led to believe that it was owing to the hardships and straitened resources of the country that so many of our people had to continue to endure the present conditions under which they live.  This Bill seems to be completely at variance with the attitude of the Government, in its dealings with the citizens as a whole, and towards the people to whom Deputy Norton has referred already, the unemployed, the widows and orphans and so on; and it has been asked whether there is any sincerity in the protestations that these people must continue to exist on a mere pittance when another gentleman can be treated in such an extravagantly generous fashion.  No justification can be made for this payment. No justification of any sort or kind has yet been made for it, and I do not think that any is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that no answer can be made to.  It cannot be said that Mr. Buckley, when asked to take up this office, was assured of any kind of fixity of tenure.  It must be assumed that he took up the office knowing that it would be abolished as speedily as the Executive Council could determine on the time for its abolition, and it is unreasonable to assume that he got a shock because he was being summarily dismissed from his job, or because he was being asked to abandon a job that he thought would exist for a long time. I do not think it would be reasonable to assume that the President put Mr. <Col N="1836" /> Buckley into that job under false pretences, so to speak.  Hence, there is no question of Mr. Buckley's having got a rude shock when he heard that his office was being abolished, and I am sure that if he were examined medically, it would be borne out that he suffers no shock by reason of this sudden dissolution of the office.</P>
    <P>From any angle or from any standpoint, I do not think any attempt can be made to justify this.  It cannot be said that Mr. Buckley was not amply recouped for whatever duties he performed while he held that office, and there were allowances for whatever incidental expenses he may have incurred.  To say that it is a liability on the nation to pay him a gratuity of £2,000 now, and a pension of £500 a year, I think, is the most unwarrantable suggestion that ever came from any Government in this country, particularly when this is being given, as I say, at a time when so many of our people are living in poverty and, practically, destitution&mdash;hundreds of thousands of our people, if you reckon the unemployed, those working on short relief schemes, and widows and orphans, who get 5/- a week in the country districts to enable them to live for the round of the week, that being set down by the Government as being sufficient now to keep the widow and to relieve her from the local funds by putting her on the central funds&mdash;a citizen of this country just as much as Mr. Buckley is.</P>
    <P>So long as he was being paid for honourable services rendered to the State I would not object at all to any reasonable compensation or remuneration being paid to him, but I flatly object and protest against the proposal contained in this measure as being nothing short of graft. No other word that I know of would describe it.  I have nothing personally against the gentleman in question, and I am sorry that it should be necessary that his name should be brought in and dragged through the House in this fashion, but I want to protest against the indecent action of the Government in offering this <Col N="1837" /> affront to the people of this nation, which is what they are doing in giving this extra generous treatment to the ex-Governor-General at a time when so many of our people are suffering under such hardships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is really much sincerity, particularly from the Opposition Benches, in their opposition to this measure, because I was reading a speech by Deputy Cosgrave in Cork, I think, the weekend before last, and he wished this gentleman, Mr. Buckley, long life and hoped that he would live many years and enjoy his pension and that he would make the best possible use of his gratuity.  That was a generous speech, and I am surprised that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney did not follow the same lines as Deputy Cosgrave this morning.  Deputy Keyes has talked about the widows and orphans and about the unemployed. Of course, that is a slogan of the Labour Party that will never die. However, it must be remembered that we had former Governors-General here at one time drawing £26,000 a year, and we had widows and orphans and unemployed people at that time, too.</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;well, spending it, I suppose.  It was £10,000, plus the allowance.  If the Labour Party were sincere in their opposition to this measure, they should not have waited till now to express it.  They should have expressed their opposition when £26,000 a year was being expended by Mr. Buckley's predecessors in office. We had widows and orphans and unemployed people then, and the Labour Party should have tabled a motion to reduce the salary and allowance of the Governor-General at that time.  It would have been more in keeping then than all this that we are now having.  After all, I do not think it is an extravagant sum at all. Deputy Keyes said that if Mr. Buckley had rendered any service to his country, he would not have objected at all to this.  There was nobody in this country who rendered <Col N="1838" /> more or better service than Mr. Buckley did.</P>

He served his country according to his own lights, and he served his country in a way in which, possibly, very few at that time thought of serving it, and I want to say that, if Deputy Cosgrave were speaking again to-morrow, I believe he would be one of the first to pay a tribute to this man.</P>

      <P>These comparisons between what was drawn by previous Governors-General and Mr. Buckley have nothing at all to do with the case.  The essential difference is this: It was the policy of the Government that preceded the present Government to have a Governor-General and to let him perform certain duties, whereas it is the policy of the present Government, <Col N="1839" /> and has been their policy all along, not to have a Governor-General except as a cipher.  If a man is to behave as a cipher, to be forced to act as a cipher, and to be nothing but a cipher, his removal from office cannot be regarded in the same light as that of a man who had been performing duties, and it is not suitable or right that the conditions under which former Governors-General were appointed or removed should be looked upon as any guide.</P>

His office was a nullity and he was remunerated on a higher basis than any of the Ministers, and at the end of all that they provide a pension for him.  I listened most carefully to the President's defence of what is being done here and I remain as convinced as I was at first that this is a transaction that cannot be defended with any plausibility or reality.</P>

      <P>I would not intervene in this debate again were it not for Deputy Donnelly's remark that there was no sincerity amongst the members of the Opposition.  Perhaps amongst the members of the Opposition, there is just as high a regard for Mr. Donal Buckley, in his private capacity, as there is amongst Deputies of the Government Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>But forgetting my personal regard for the ex-Governor-General in his private capacity, I must repeat my protest against this unwarranted motion to grant him a pension. If this were purely a compassionate allowance for somebody who had filled some position, whom the Government felt they should compensate, there might be something to be said for it.  If it were even a question of allowance or pension for a person <Col N="1840" /> who held a big position in this country, a position which was hitherto regarded as non-pensionable, and that this particular person had performed the duties of that office in an exceptional way, there might be no objection to granting that person a gratuity or pension. Here, however, we have no evidence whatsoever that the gentleman in question ever performed any services.  If he did, they were services which, as Deputy MacDermot said, were almost negligible.  As far as we can see, this is a proposal to compensate Mr. Buckley for a voluntary three years' seclusion. There are many Deputies even amongst the members of the Government Party who would hide themselves securely for three years for one-quarter of that sum.  I believe there are Deputies even in our own Party who would accept one-quarter of that sum and hide themselves securely, so securely that nobody could find them for three years.  They would not feel that they were in any way aggrieved afterwards by not getting a pension. Here we have a gentleman who filled a position entailing no important or elaborate duties at a salary of £2,000 a year with perquisites, a house, etc., thrown in, and it is proposed that he should receive from the people who appointed him a lump sum of £2,000 and a pension of £500 a year.  I do not think that any honest Deputy could allow such a measure to go through this House without protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton made a comparison between the treatment given to this gentleman and the treatment given to many other citizens who held less exalted positions in this country. There is a village in my own neighbourhood where there is an unfortunate postman who served his country as well as Mr. Buckley did&mdash;not for three years, but for 19 years and at the end of these 19 years he finds himself, as the Government say, incapacitated from all work.  At least, he was temporarily incapacitated.  He is now able to perform the work, as far as I know, but he cannot get back his job because he was pronounced incapable of performing his duties.  This unfortunate man is now trying to exist upon 3/- a week.  There may be reasons why it is impossible for the <Col N="1841" /> Department to give this unfortunate man any allowance or pension, but if there was the same anxiety for the under-dog who served the State as there is in this particular case for another gentleman, means would be found by which this unfortunate man would get some compensation after his 19 years' service, so that he need not almost be a beggar on the streets. It is idle to repeat the arguments against this particular measure.  I felt that I, for one, could not allow it to pass this House without offering the strongest protest I could put in words. I can only say what I said when I spoke on the original motion, that it is a scandalous measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to refer to two or three matters raised by Deputy Norton which were not dealt with on the financial resolution.  Deputy Norton pointed out that Mr. Buckley had a mansion free.  That is not correct. The Deputy was probably confusing him with the previous occupant of the office.  The relevant position and the relevant comparisons are that Mr. Buckley had a salary of £2,000 free of income tax, whereas he was entitled to £10,000.  He had an allowance of £1,200 for expenses, and out of that he paid the rent of his residence.  Both he and his predecessor had provision made for an official staff and for a motor car.  His predecessor, in addition to £10,000 salary, of which £7,500 was free of income tax, had an allowance of £3,000 for expenses, free of income tax, and he had a free residence. These are figures which, if one takes them roughly, show a saving over four years of something like £32,000.  I referred to the fact already that Deputy Fitzgerald stated here on the last day that the President stated that there was £7,500 free of income tax out of the £10,000, while it was stated before the Public Accounts Committee that only £6,000 was free of income tax.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said in reply that it came before the Dáil.  I am not making any <Col N="1842" /> point about it, but on the 9th April, 1930, the allowance, free of income tax, was increased by the Minister for Finance from £6,000 to £7,500.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here that it is on account of his 1916 services that Mr. Buckley is being remunerated, and we are told that 1916 has nothing to do with it.  I suggest that it is not for 1916 that he is being remunerated or that this provision is being made for him, but 1916 has a lot to do with it in this way.  As many Deputies on the opposite benches understand, the people who had 1916 service continued on in the movement and, as I said earlier here, thought more of their country and less of themselves.  They were not able to make the same provision for themselves as other people who thought more of themselves and less of their country.</P>

      <P>In that way I suggest 1916 has a lot to do with it.  I do not think here that anybody will suggest that when Mr. Buckley took on this office he was a man in affluent circumstances. I suggest that was because of his services to his country.  The grounds for making this gratuity and the grounds for giving this pension are simply to make provision for Mr. Buckley for his remaining years.  It has been suggested that out of £2,000 a year for four years he was able to make ample provision for the rest of his life.  I do not think any reasonable member of the Opposition could seriously suggest that out of £2,000 a year for four years&mdash;as I say, not having been in affluent circumstances when he <Col N="1843" /> went into office&mdash;he could have put away what some Deputy referred to as a nest-egg, and would be able to live on that for the remaining years of his life.  I do not know what the gentleman's age is, but this is to make provision for his remaining years, and I think it is a very small provision.  We have already had the legal position referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. There was a constitutional and statutory right under Article 60 of the Constitution entitling the Governor-General to £10,000 per year. The constitutional right, undoubtedly, was abolished on 11th December last. The statutory right remains.  Under Section 4 of this Bill, we are abolishing that statutory right, but I do say that there would have been an enforceable claim by either the late occupant of the office or his personal representative to sue for the full salary.</P>

      <P>I am only stating the simple fact that he had an enforceable claim for this £10,000, and if he went into court and got a decree I am quite certain this Dáil would uphold that decree.  I am also stating that it was not under any considerations of that sort that we came to this House to make this provision. I stated that this man had served his country in the past, and was not looking for anything in the way of enforcement of a legal claim.  This is simply and solely to make what we consider a very small provision, but a very necessary provision, so that he can get a house.  That is the meaning of the gratuity&mdash;to set up a house&mdash;and this allowance of £500 a year will enable him to live in some little degree of comfort for the remaining years of his life.  I think it is not a big provision; I think it is a reasonable provision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keyes talked about a lot of criticism down the country.  I am quite sure that nobody on those benches will for a moment think that Deputy Keyes was very concerned about what criticism there was down the country, except from the same point of view as Deputy Norton was talking about criticism down the country.  Should they not be extremely grateful to us for providing criticism? Is not that what they want?  It is really futile getting up here and making a case like that.  If they try to keep us right in that way there will not be anybody in the country in a position to criticise us, and that will mean the elimination of labour throughout the country.  That is only in keeping with other arguments which we had here.  Some of the speeches made here to-day might be better made either in Kildare or in Limerick, instead of wasting the time of this Dáil by making them here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious to anybody who takes the trouble of reading the section what its intention is.  This is dealing with the family and states: &ldquo;In particular, the State recognises that, by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved&rdquo;.  I should like to know if anybody will controvert that.  Then it goes on: &ldquo;The <Col N="1848" /> State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;  Surely that is a praiseworthy object for the State to set before itself&mdash;that mothers, whose work is essential for the common good, should not be compelled by economic necessity to abandon that fundamentally important work and be forced to undertake duties which would compel them to neglect their duties in the home.</P>
      <P>I have not been able, from the start, to understand why there should be any antagonism of any kind to that section. I do not understand the attitude of any woman who objects to it.  There is no suggestion in that that a woman should not be free to take up any avocation she chooses; no suggestion that a woman should not exercise her liberty of marrying or not marrying.  What is stated here is, if women choose to marry and found a home, that they should not be compelled by modern conditions, which very often force mothers to engage in outside labour, to do that, and that it should be the duty of the State to endeavour to see that that shall not happen.  How the State may endeavour to see that is quite another question.  We leave the methods completely and absolutely open, as it is right that we should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, to indicate my own mind in regard to the attitude the community should have towards men and women in that particular matter in regard to the home, I would say this, that if work and the means of livelihood are not available for the father of a family, the State should itself, if it cannot be found in ordinary industry, in ordinary commerce and in the economic life, endeavour to provide that work somehow.  If the State is unable to do that, it is only then that the obligation of maintenance would fall upon the community as a whole. But, if I were able so to organise it, I certainly would try to get for the community as a whole some immediate return from a man who is getting assistance in that particular way.  In other words, I should try so to organise it that work of public utility, something of value to the community as a <Col N="1849" /> whole, should result from the assistance which the community had to give in that particular matter.  I think the man ought to render back to the community in the way of some work something for the assistance he is given.</P>
    <P>But, if it were a woman, I take quite the other attitude.  I say a woman, by her duties in the home, is, in fact, performing for the community as a whole a fundamental service.  I would say that she, by doing that work, was rendering invaluable service to the State and I would not require of a mother, under these circumstances, any other form of return, such as I would be inclined to demand in the case of a man.  That makes quite clear what our attitude is in regard to woman's position in the home.  She is rendering in the home a fundamental and indispensable service to the State.  The greatest service she can render is to perform her duties in the due manner and anything that would compel her to neglect these duties would be, in my opinion, a loss to the State as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we should have a quorum to listen to this sermon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this seems to me to be a clause to which no reasonable person can object.  There is nothing in the clause, so far as I can see, and nothing that can be deduced by way of supposed implication in the clause, which should cause any resentment on the part of any citizen in the State.  Particularly, I cannot understand why there should appear to be resentment on the part of some women. Surely it cannot be that there is objection to this, because I mentioned the home, or because I mentioned one section of womankind.  We are not supposed in this document to take every section and to deal with life as a whole.  We are dealing with a very important matter in this section, namely that modern conditions are forcing women, through economic necessity, to neglect their duties in the home, not that they want to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> There is no suggestion in this Article of interfering with the free-will of any woman.  The problem is to endeavour to provide some remedy for a great modern evil.  I am at a loss to understand the Deputy's point of view. I should like to hear what anybody has to say on it, and to understand what is the basis of the criticism of this Article?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President said that the purpose of this Article was to provide a remedy for a great modern evil.  This section of Article 41 is his conception of providing a remedy for a great modern evil.  It provides nothing.  There was one part of a sentence in which I agreed with the President.  He started a sentence in which he said &ldquo;there is nothing in this Article...&rdquo;  If the President had stopped there the Opposition would agree with him.  There is nothing in the Article.  There is a great deal of pretence about the President and about everything he does, but this Article means nothing legislatively.  The President himself says there is nothing in the Article, and with that part of his sentence I agree.  That is what the Article means&mdash;nothing.  It may, as a piece of guidance, have some effect. What the President aims at may be an excellent aim.  There is nothing in this Article nor in this phrase &ldquo;by her life within the home,&rdquo; which makes any more difference than if it were not there.  The Article accomplishes nothing in the direction of achieving what the President tells us was the purpose of this Article.  It compels the State to do nothing.  It is exactly like Article 45.  All one can gather from the President's speech is that it can do nothing and that it compels the State to do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How it is to be implemented is a matter for the future.  That is one of those vague things about which we hear so much.  One time we hear that the Article cannot bind us.  The President says we cannot tie the House as to future legislation.  But it is the business of a Constitution to bind the hands of future Legislatures. That is one of the purposes of a written Constitution.  I was weary listening to the President last night <Col N="1851" /> saying &ldquo;we cannot bind the hands of the future.&rdquo;  Whether you can now bind them depends not on what is written down here, but on some vague things that are at the back of the President's mind.  What he says about the great modern evil is excellent. Nobody denies that.  But it does not help the House.  It is a well-known principle of legislation that when you mention any particular thing you exclude other things.  There is in this section the implication that &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; the State is not to recognise other implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President does not and cannot understand the mentality of anybody else.  That is why he is by nature so dictatorial. This Constitution is dictatorial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes; this is like what we hear in Germany, &ldquo;whatever the Leader says is right.&rdquo; I quite understand that that is Deputy Donnelly's point of view.  We had a speech yesterday from another Minister as to what he wants in this Draft Constitution.  Now undoubtedly woman's most important service is within the home.  But to what does this commit you?  How does it bind any future Legislature from refraining from doing or from doing certain things?  This is the Draft Constitution. It is fundamental law, not the expression of the extremely vague desires of the President.  The President tells us what he would like to do.  I will give him an instance&mdash;does he intend to provide sufficient pensions for the subsistence of a widow with, say, seven or eight children so as to make it unnecessary for her to work at all except to look after the home; and will the pension be big enough to see that she will be able to bring up her children in comfort and with proper educational facilities?  Suppose you take the case of a woman who has to work because her husband will not work?  Is the President to compel such a man to work?  What will be the position of the wife, or will the President deal with it?  He does not like to deal with these things.  He <Col N="1852" /> tells us that he is allowing the future Legislature to do it.  That method is a method of washing his hands of the matter.  That will not do.  There is too much of this business of throwing the responsibility on someone else.</P>
      <P>This section compels the State to do nothing and it prevents future Legislatures from doing nothing.  But these Articles and the President's speeches do imply certain things&mdash;perhaps the word &ldquo;imply&rdquo; is too definite a word to use in the case of the President. At all events they seem, to a large number of women in this country, to imply certain things.  The President has referred to these as women of advanced views.  That is the phrase he used and that phrase shows the mentality of the President&mdash;these women are women of advanced views.  That is what he says about the people who have given attention to this subject. We witnessed the President yesterday rejecting an amendment from Deputy Mrs. Redmond because, as he said, the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; was so hard to define. That was the objection to the amendment&mdash;the word was too difficult to define.  Before we came to Article 41 at all I noticed that the second last word in the previous Article is &ldquo;class,&rdquo; a word that is so hard to define.  It is a word that is very difficult to define when Deputy Mrs. Redmond uses it, but not difficult to define when the President uses it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the President would have defined it.  The word is incapable of definition where Deputy Mrs. Redmond is concerned and because it was moved from these benches.  There we have the gospel; the Leader is always right.  His word is always law.  He does not understand what the Opposition want or what women want.  He does not understand what anybody who suggests a modification of this Constitution puts forward. The continual burden of his speeches is: &ldquo;I cannot understand.&rdquo;  The word is impossible of being defined when it comes from these benches.  It is impossible to define the word &ldquo;class.&rdquo;  But the word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is the second last <Col N="1853" /> word in Article 40 of the sacred text itself.  There is no doubt that the President's whole attitude is a bias against women seeking work.</P>

I am taking the Articles as they stand; I do not care what the President means by them or what is in his mind. We are not yet legislating about what is in the President's mind.  We are legislating about what is in these Articles.  That is our difficulty.  We have to know what the words will mean legally, not what the President thinks they will mean or what he thinks is their purport.  That is why women object to these words.  Is the President aware that these women, many of his own followers amongst them, are perturbed because of these words &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; in Article 41?</P>
      <P>Is it not because they recognised the implication?  Who is responsible for that?  If there is such lack of clarity that it obscures their vision, the vision of even some of his supporters, it is not due to Party bias. Why is that so?  Why cannot they understand what the President is driving at?  It is obvious the Articles themselves do not convey what the President intends, if he intends anything definite.</P>
      <P>So far as every word that the President said is concerned, he indicated excellent things for the State to aim at, but we must remember that this is legislation.  How is it to be administered?  If the State fails to do these things, if a future Legislature fails to do these things, is there any remedy?  This is a fundamental Constitution that must be honoured by a legislative body.  If that body fails, is there any remedy?  Surely nobody could appeal to that Article&mdash; I am referring to Article 2&mdash;to compel the Legislature to do anything? Taking them all together, there is one purpose in them, one drift in them.</P>

      <P>I would regard these clauses as entirely harmless if there had never been any movement in this and other countries to shut out women from competition with men.  But there have been such movements.  Even during the last few years I have seen fairly numerous letters to newspapers advocating that certain restrictions should be imposed to prevent women competing, shall we say, with fathers of families, for jobs.  And it is because there has been a certain amount of that sort of agitation that women have been rendered nervous by these Articles in the Constitution.  I think it is reasonable to expect that they would be rendered nervous about them.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am convinced of the President's good faith in this matter. I do not think he or his Party have any policy in their minds of shutting out women from gainful occupations. But I do know that what Deputy O'Sullivan said is quite true&mdash;that great uneasiness has been excited in the minds of women, not merely women who have some political interest in opposing the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;because I have met women myself with no political bias whatever who have been exceedingly alarmed by the insertion of these Articles&mdash;for the reason that there has been a certain agitation which crops up from time to time and which these Articles tend to foster.</P>

      <P>I do not say that it logically follows from these Articles that that agitation is right, not for a moment.  If you take these Articles, analyse them, parse them and treat them in a perfectly abstract spirit, there is nothing in them to object to; there is not a single word in them that I consider wrong; I think every word is right as they stand.  But you have to think of possible effects as well, and if there has been an undesirable kind of agitation against women you have to consider whether some colour may not be given to that agitation and whether the Articles cannot be thus interpreted by nervous women.</P>

      <P>I merely say there has been an impression created that these Articles favour the view that a woman's proper place is in the home and that where she is not in the home there is an anomaly that legislation ought to strive to correct.  That is the notion that has spread abroad, that these Articles can be so read as to favour that view.  I am not imagining these movements and agitations.  I remember a speech made two years ago by one of the leaders of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, in County Louth or County Meath, where he advocated that pensions should be given to all women&mdash;10/- a week, I think it was&mdash;and that, simultaneously, gainful occupations should be closed to them.  I am sure he would not advocate that now, but he did throw that out in a moment of expansiveness, and in doing so he was not doing something that was entirely disconnected with certain feelings and agitations that did exist in the country.  I have had, and I dare say other Deputies have had, letters from constituents urging that something should be done to prevent women from competing with heads of families.</P>

But there is nothing singular in that.  Lots of people from time to time have suggested that women should not be allowed to compete freely with fathers of families.  The danger of these Articles in the minds of women is that they seem to give support to a theory of that kind.</P>

      <P>The President keeps saying to me, &ldquo;How?&rdquo; but I am merely telling him the fact that that has been the impression created in the women's minds This Constitution <Col N="1856" /> has in many parts of it been so drawn as to expose the largest possible surface to attack.  You cannot behave as if every human being were strictly logical.  Human beings are not strictly logical, and when they read something that seems to them to give a sort of indirect support to an attack on their bread and butter they get exceedingly alarmed, and I would suggest that it ought not to be beyond the powers of the President to add something making it quite explicit that the State will not discriminate against women in the matter of opportunities for earning their livelihood.  If he would put in something of that type he would allay the fears which I know to exist very widely among people who honestly have no political bias against the Party in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the President and the House to the fact that we are dealing with a particular amendment the effect of which is to delete the words &ldquo;by her life within the home.&rdquo;  The President's entire observations were addressed to sub-clause (2) of Section 2 of the Article, whereas these words occur in the preceding sub-clause. Speaking relevantly to the amendment before the House, and leaving aside other matters until we come to the next amendment, I would like to point out that the objection to the words we propose to delete, &ldquo;by her life within the home,&rdquo; is that the insertion of those words has led, and reasonably led, to the belief that into that particular clause may be read some sort of slight, if I may put it that way, on either married women who do work not merely inside their homes but outside their homes, or unmarried women, whether they work inside or outside their homes.  The amendment seeks to delete these words because they are capable of that meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the objection to the deletion of those words?  Many women, both married and unmarried, give very valuable work to the community in the way of social services and otherwise, outside the home.  Many women who work for their daily bread give valuable service to the State although they <Col N="1857" /> do not work within the home, and perhaps, in addition to doing that, they do carry out their ordinary work within the home.  It is because of the fact that for some reason that is not quite apparent, the kind of service given by women in the home is picked out here to the exclusion of everything else that objection has been taken and fears aroused.  That is the amendment we are dealing with at the moment.  I want to know what is the objection to leaving out the words &ldquo;by her life within the home.&rdquo; Deputy O'Sullivan has referred to the maxim to which I drew the President's attention last evening.  I gave the Latin version&mdash;<i>expressio unius</i>&mdash;and I do not want to go over it again, but if you set down certain matters, impliedly you leave out other matters.</P>

      <P>The mere fact that the President says &ldquo;of course, it is&rdquo; does not make it nonsense.  That has been the attitude of the President throughout this entire debate on every suggestion we put up.  Because he thinks the suggestions we make are either without ground or nonsense, they are, therefore, in fact, groundless or nonsense. We have directed attention in the course of the debate on this and on other sections to certain very fundamental objections to this Constitution. We have not been met in one single instance.  We have ensured this at all events, that nobody can say that we did not carry out our duty in directing attention to it.  We are doing it now on this clause and we are speaking solely on this clause now. That expression &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; has given cause for uneasiness, if not cause for offence, to a number of women, both married and single, who do good work in the State.  Married women are giving very great social service in child welfare work and unmarried women are doing the same.  Married and unmarried <Col N="1858" /> women help in the ladies' association of charity attached to the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  They are left out here and one thing is picked out for special reference.  The fact that that is picked out is capable of being interpreted as being inserted for some particular reason and, consequently, has reasonably, as I say, given cause for uneasiness. If that particular expression is left out, I cannot see what objection there can be to the clause as it will then stand.</P>
      <P>I propose to repeat very shortly what I said yesterday afternoon about the assertion of general principles and the following of that assertion by some particular instance, the effect of which is to cut away from the statement of general principles.  When we find in Article 41 of clauses 1 and 2 the State guaranteeing to protect a family, does that not cover everything?  If the State undertakes to do its duty in protecting the family and in seeing that it is the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, does that not cover the next sub-clause of clause 2, that the State shall endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home?  In order to cut down the discussion to the smallest amount of time, compatible with the asserting of principle, may I say again that the President, by putting in that sub-clause (2) of clause 2, again offends against the rule of construction to which I have referred.  The State is to endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to work.</P>

If the State is to endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to work, is it not an indication from that that the State is to take no notice of anything else that may cause mothers to have to work?  Economic necessity is the only thing they are to deal with. If the father is drunken, if he is lazy and will not go to the trouble of getting work, that is not economic necessity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The State is not to take any notice of that.  It is not economic necessity of the class which the State is to look after, and if a man is lazy, drunken, will not work or will not keep his work when he gets it, the State is to take no notice of it.  You cannot, by merely inserting a principle which everybody agrees with and putting it down on paper, pretend that you have carried out in practice some laudable purpose which we all would wish to see achieved.  Merely writing down high principles in this Constitution is not going to see that these things are, in fact, achieved in practice.  There is a lot of theory in this Constitution.  I deal in practice and I want to see how in practice this is going to be achieved and I direct attention, merely on technical grounds to the fact, as illustrating the point I am making, that by referring merely to economic necessity, a whole field of other matters is, by implication, left out.  There is nothing here about the duty of a father to protect the family; there is nothing here about the duty of the State to see that he carries out his duty.  We hear a lot about the rights of this, that and the other, but there should be more insistence on the duty of the people rather than on their rights.  Here we have the family looked after, but there is nothing in this Article, if I may again give an example, to impose duties on people who are responsible for keeping the family, for maintaining the family institution, to do their duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well if some clear exposition were given by the President as to what line he has pursued in drafting this document.  He said parenthetically yesterday that this document was not intended to be entombed in dusty law reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me correct that.  He created the impression on reasonable men listening to him that he intended to convey that he did not want this Constitution entombed in dusty law reports. Doubtless he did not say that, <Col N="1860" /> but that was the impression he conveyed to some people who heard him&mdash; that it was intended to inform the plain people of the country of what the meaning of the Constitution was.  That, I believe, is the dilemma into which the President has fallen.  As I understand it, this Constitution should really be addressed to those who will be called on to interpret it on behalf of the people whose rights it is designed to defend, and when I desire to defend my constitutional rights as guaranteed by this document, it is not to the people on the hustings I will go, but to the courts of law.  The courts of law will interpret that document, and unless the President is prepared to take cognisance of the well-established principles of judicial interpretation of such documents, the result of what he writes or of what this House puts into the Constitution, in the country may be entirely different from what he intends.</P>
      <P>I twice yesterday directed the President's attention in respect of another Article to the danger of qualifications, because sometimes a qualification, when it comes to be judicially interpreted, assumes much more importance than the positive assertion of the fundamental right.  Sometimes, as Deputy Costello has pointed out, if you put in one particular qualification, the assumption is that you mean no other; alternatively, if you put in a qualification desiring to convey nothing more than that particular qualification, it may, in the process of interpretation, carry a far more pregnant meaning when read in conjunction with the assertion of the fundamental principle. I urge on the President, without losing patience, calmly to tell us whether he has borne in mind, or intends to bear in mind, the well-established rules of judicial interpretation when dealing with this document, or whether he is resolved to address this document to the lay people who know nothing of judicial interpretation and care very little about it until such time as the vindication of their constitutional rights may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has referred to the fact that I was heard to advocate on one occasion the giving of 10/- a week to all women to abstain from <Col N="1861" /> gainful employment.  I cannot remember whether I ever advocated that in public or not.  I feel sure that I have often discussed it with the Deputy and I may very possibly have mentioned it in public in his hearing, but let me make my position clear in regard to it. I have always regarded it as the fundamental groundwork of our social outlook that our ideal should be to ensure that every human creature had enough before anybody was allowed to enjoy a surplus.</P>
    <P>That has always been my idea of it, and my only difficulty has been to find anywhere any scheme which would achieve that ideal and which would work.  There are thousands of schemes &mdash;economic nostrums&mdash;which, we are told, would achieve that but, when they are put into operation, they calamitously fail and bring in their train far greater evils than existed before they were attempted at all.  I have discussed a hundred proposals for redistribution of wealth and I have always had in my mind the difficulty that, if you try to give everybody enough before anybody enjoys a surplus, one of the results may be to destroy the initiative and energy which make the capitalist system, founded on individual liberty, function.  If you make life too easy for every able-bodied person, you may damp down the initiative which makes the system work and which draws from the natural resources with which God Almighty provided us the maximum return.</P>
    <P>I have often seen an agricultural labourer contemplating marriage, and the difficulty was that he had 30/- a week and that he hesitated to accept family responsibility on that slender income.  If he knew that, far from putting additional burdens on himself by the marrying of a wife, he would bring a small additional income into his home and that, even though earning 30/- a week himself, he would, as a married man, have £2 a week, it might give him courage to face family responsibility and facilitate marriage for poorer people.  Furthermore, many women who at present go out and take work to help out <Col N="1862" /> the family budget would, if they had 10/- per week, be able to give that help within the family without going out to work at all.  That particular matter has been partially recognised in this House.  We have given&mdash;and rightly given&mdash;pensions to widows, but an elderly spinster can very often be a much more pitiable figure than a widow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay, but I want to make, clear that proposals of that kind, which have been in my mind, are similar to many others the ultimate end of which has always been to attain the ideal that every human creature would have enough before any human creature would be allowed to enjoy a surplus.  Subject to this overriding principle, which is strictly relevant to the matter we are considering, in this day and age, the liberty of a woman to earn her living, if she desires to do so, should not be restricted.  You have got to protect her against exploitation, and I freely confess that it would be easy for us, if we wanted to do so, to trip the President up by suggesting that any kind of restriction on the exploitation of women was an interference with the fundamental liberties of women.  I do not think that there is any desire on our side to attempt that subterfuge. Liberty for women to earn their living does not mean that the State should stand idly by while poor women were induced to go down half-naked in a coal mine and drag up coal tubs, as they did at one time in the North of England.  But, subject to the social <Col N="1863" /> restrictions that are necessary to prevent the exploitation of men, women and children, we feel that, in this day and age, the right of a woman to earn her living, if she wants to earn it, should be held sacrosanct.  I, personally, hold that anything we here could do to spare a mother the necessity of having to work to live ought to be done.  I, perhaps, would go further and say that, if we wanted effectively to redistribute wealth, having provided for the aged and infirm, I should like to consider with experts the question of whether the redistribution of wealth might not, in part in any case, be achieved by easing the lives of women.  If it were proposed that a lump sum to ease the lives of all should be provided&mdash;if that were practicable, I should like first to make adequate provision to spare women the necessity for servile work of any kind before I would relieve any able-bodied man of the necessity of servile work in order to live.  I do not want to elaborate that fully, but one is so liable to misrepresentation that one is tempted to guard against every possible attempt to misrepresent one's views hereafter.</P>
      <P>I think I have made my position pretty clear, and I now turn with a specific question to the President: Does he intend to recognise the well-known principles of judicial interpretation to which Deputy Costello has referred, or is he addressing this document to lay people who have no knowledge whatever of judicial interpretation, and leaving to chance the results that may accrue from its judicial interpretation.</P>

      <P>One can sympathise with Deputy O'Sullivan and the other members of that Party on the difficulty in which they have found themselves when face to face with words, and when they had to defend a certain attitude. Of course, one would expect, in these circumstances, that all we could have would be trifling with the matter. Anybody who fairly reads the remarks of Deputy O'Sullivan in the papers to-morrow or who will read them in the Official Report, will agree that he was merely trifling, and nothing else.  He did not address himself at all to the words here, or attempt to show us in what way the words of this Article could give rise to the apprehensions which he said were rife, that an attack was being made somehow on women's liberties and rights.</P>
      <P>He says with one breath that this means nothing: that it cannot bind.  It does mean something.  It means that, when the people have adopted this Constitution, they will have agreed with a common mind and purpose to try to see that the State, which will represent them, should ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.  This is a directive, a strong directive, to the Legislature with the backing of the people as a whole that this is a purpose which ought to be given effect to and ought to be pursued.  It does mean something, and well the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Costello falling back again on his old friend the canon of interpretation which has, of course, a limited application always, and is not a thing to be applied everywhere.  If we are dealing with any particular subject, the fact that we are not dealing <Col N="1865" /> with other subjects is not to suggest that these things are not matters of importance, so that when a person takes special canons of interpretation for legal documents in a certain way, and tries to apply them in a way in which no lawyer would attempt to apply them in court, I can only call that trifling also.  The Deputy must too clearly understand what is the meaning and purpose of this section. The attempt to suggest that, because other women are not mentioned in this section, there is a definite intention to put them in a lower status or anything of that kind, has no foundation whatever. This is a section dealing with the family.  The words immediately preceding it are to the effect that the family is the basis of social order and is indispensable to the welfare of the nation.  If the family's welfare is to be preserved, who is going to deny that it is necessary for the woman to be free to perform her motherly duties in the home?  It is a bad system of society in which the mother is forced to go out and labour to the neglect of her duties in the home.  I can conceive of no higher purpose that we could have here in this community of ours than to see to it that economic necessity will not force mothers to abandon their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>What, then, is the justification for the attack that is made here?  We are dealing with the home, with mothers in the home, and with the duties of mothers in the home, and if we are not dealing with women who are in other occupations outside the home, who is going to suggest that that is a reflection upon them?  This is a just recognition of the important part that mothers play in society as a whole in their homes.  That does not mean to say that women are not playing important parts elsewhere.  Does it mean that men, the fathers of families, are not playing important parts both in the home and out of it? It does not, because that particular aspect did not demand attention from us.  Here we are dealing with mothers. We are trying to deal with a great modern evil, as I have already said. All that is done here is to try to get people to agree, as part of their fundamental <Col N="1866" /> law, that it should be the purpose of the State to try to secure that mothers will not be forced to neglect their duties in the home by economic necessity compelling them to labour outside.  Personally, I can have no patience with the attacks which have been made on this Article.  I think they are altogether unjustified.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot tells me that I would have been wiser if I had proceeded in another way.  Of course I could.  I need not have put in the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; there, but because the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; is mentioned, it brings back to the minds of certain people the fact that there was a very cheap gibe at women who were not able to be in the home either through inclination or the economic necessity which compelled them to work elsewhere&mdash;the cheap gibe that their place was in the home.  I am not responsible for that gibe, and I am not going to leave the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; out of its proper context because there is a gibe associated in some people's minds with it.  It is a strange position that the sacred word &ldquo;home&rdquo; should be omitted.  Well, I am not going to omit it anyhow.  As far as I can get any support, it is going to remain, but there is no implication and no suggestion of inferiority as regards other women.  There is a just recognition here of the special part that is played by mothers in the home, and there is, further, the indicated intention of the community, through its Legislature, to endeavour to secure that that work, which is so vital to the State, shall not be hindered by economic conditions which force women to work outside.</P>
    <P>I have only to say, then, to Deputy MacDermot that this was not drawn from a propagandist point of view. It is true that every Constitution gives a very broad surface for attack. It must, because it covers the whole of our political life.  It covers our political life in the broad sense, and covers all our social and economic life, and everybody would like to see future Legislatures tied down here so that any particular privileges which they may have will be preserved. We had from Deputy Norton last <Col N="1867" /> night an extraordinary exhibition.  He wanted us tied in one direction and loose in another.  The position of a Legislature, as I said last night, for the future as in the present must be that it will be free to co-ordinate the public good, the individual good and the individual right.  That is its prime, main duty.  I repeat that here there is no suggestion of any kind that women who are not in the home are not playing an important part. There is no suggestion of any kind in this that there should be any discrimination against women in regard to earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which I resent very strongly is that I have some reactionary views about women.  It is not true.  I have never shown it either in public or in private.  I believe that the culture and the progress of a community can very well be estimated by the status and the position which women occupy in it.  I have always held that.  I do not compare men and women at all in the sense in which some people want to compare them.  I do not think that the words &ldquo;equality and inequality&rdquo; can properly be applied to them.  Each has its own particular and important part to play, just like a back or a forward in a football team.  Men and women are complementary of each other in society, working out in their own particular spheres the parts for which they are best fitted.  Individuals with special aptitudes may go outside that sphere to the good of society as a whole.  I am not accepting the amendment to delete, and I am not going to accept the suggestion &ldquo;for,&rdquo; because I am dealing with mothers and the work which they do within the home in regard to the upbringing of children.</P>

The President, however, looked down at the document and discovered that neither is there, and that the word there is &ldquo;woman&rdquo; It is because of that, that we have demurred, lest there be any misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>I ask the President to keep his seat.  The amendment here is perfectly clear.  If there is any very heated feeling about it, I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee what is in the Bunreacht&mdash;I do not think it matters two straws what is in it&mdash;but the President asked us to come in here and give him our assistance and discuss the matter with him.  We had the President getting up here and talking for a quarter of an hour and, by implication, he admitted our objection, then he looked down at the document and discovered that there is no reference to mothers and wives in the paragraph we are referring to.  We object to the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in that part because, to put in the word &ldquo;mothers&rdquo; there would make the Article more clear to the President, to the House and to the country.  As I say, I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee if you do not want it, but there is no need for impatience on the President's part.  If he does not agree to it, well, that is well and good.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not read it, and the President did not read it&mdash; well, pardon me, probably the President did read it, but he spoke under a complete misapprehension of it, because I think our argument had carried some force to his mind, and he saw that the Article would read more cogently, and that the meaning of it would be much more obvious if he spoke of mothers and wives, and that to use the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; in that case left it open to misapprehension.  That is our case.  If you do not agree with it, then let us agree to differ, but let there be no suggestion from the President <Col N="1870" /> that representations from these benches were made from a purely obstructive and hypercritical attitude.  At any rate, they were sufficient to make him speak for a quarter of an hour.  We spoke because we believed there was an amendment of substance to be made.</P>

To get back, however, to this particular amendment in the name of Deputy Mrs. Redmond, I must say that it seems to me to make no sense, because, if we are to make a statement here at all about woman, it must be in connection with the family, and it would be entirely out of place to have that sub-section stand with the words, &ldquo;by her life within the home,&rdquo; left out.</P>

It did occur to me, during the last few minutes, that perhaps it might be an improvement in that sub-section to put the word &ldquo;married&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; but on second thoughts I did not even feel that that would do, because a woman who is sometimes performing the duties of a mother and a wife may be a sister, or something of that sort.  Accordingly, I confess that this first sub-section seems to me to be wholly unobjectionable.  I think that any alarm created would arise more naturally from the second sub-section, about which I shall speak in a moment.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words, Sir, on this.  I will not reach the heights of oratory which the President has reached, and I will just speak from the point of view of the plain man in the street&mdash;the point of view of a person who always thought well of the home and who thought that the responsibility always rested on the members of the family to support the parents.  It seems to me that the President has never read that old proverb, &ldquo;Man shall earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.&rdquo;  It also seems to me that the President is setting out, in this Constitution, to make a paradise of this world.  He seems to forget that, after all, this is only a vale of tears. He seems also to give the impression that he, above all men, is the only man that ever thought about the home and had any respect for the heads of the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me state here and now that there is hardly any man in this House <Col N="1872" /> or in the members of his Party who has done more to disrupt the homes of this country than he and the members of his Party have done in the last few years.  Of course, the members of the Party opposite do not like plain facts.

His policy, in effect, means a policy symbolic of that which at the moment obtains in Soviet Russia.  Take charge of the families, take charge of the mothers, and with that done, of course, to use the words of the President, this little country of ours is going to be a paradise.

      <P>What is the whole trend of the President's remarks?  After all, the best tribute to me is to hear Deputy Donnelly laugh.  Of course, he laughed the other day, too, on his own amendment to the Constitution in regard to the North of Ireland, and afterwards he voted for this Constitution.  That is the consistency that is so characteristic of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In the same way, in regard to this section, the President will go down to private meetings of his supporters, where men only are present, and will say to them: &ldquo;In this section we are protecting you against women.  We are seeing that no woman will go out and take a man's job.&rdquo;  Later he will go to a meeting at which women only are present, a meeting at which the attendance will probably include Deputy Mrs. Concannon and Deputy Miss Pearse, and say: &ldquo;Oh, we do not mean that at all. Women can still earn their living.&rdquo;  At the back of all that, he has these qualifications to every section in the Constitution. He legislates first and qualifies afterwards.  There is no use in the President trying to get away with this whole business of pretending that he, of all men, is the only one who is anxious for the welfare of the home. Let me tell him again, and let me emphasise the fact&mdash;I want no help from his Party nor do thousands of the women of Ireland either.  They are able to earn an honest living in this country.  There are fathers and mothers in this country who have reared families of 14 and more, and they were never known to go out and look for any help from anybody.  The Fianna Fáil Party and the President are out to degrade the men and the women of this country who suffered hardships and who reared their families&mdash;and they were not small families either.  That <Col N="1874" /> is my chief objection to the policy enunciated by the President.</P>
      <P>Let Deputy Donnelly or any member of his Party come down to Louth at the next election and I shall say there what I am saying here, because I know the men and women of that county. You want to degrade and pauperise the fathers and mothers of this country while you pretend that, were it not for Fianna Fáil, the mothers of this country would have to go out and make their living and that you are out to make a paradise of this country.  I ask the President again what steps is he going to take to put this section in operation or to make it effective? Let him leave out the platitudes.  I could argue that the steps taken by the President might be the means of putting far more mothers out of work as they might mean jeopardising the position of these women's husbands in industry&mdash;probably as a result of higher taxation&mdash;if I wanted to go deeply into the whole subject.  You know as well as I do that steps may be taken to cure evils in certain directions and that these steps may create evils in other directions.  This, of course, is a source of laughter to Deputy Donnelly and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We, on this side of the House, have no sympathy whatever for the mothers of this country! Let me tell the President and the members of his Party that we had sympathy with mothers and advised children to obey their parents when the Party opposite were telling them to disregard parental control.  Now we have the sneers of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to this section.  I am speaking the honest sentiments of my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that I have no objection to the express statement laid down in this sub-section, but I think that, standing by itself, it is too limited and that it is likely to lead to misunderstanding and probably to misapplication in future.  It is true, and I think we all agree, that by her life within the home woman gives to the State a support without which the common good could not be achieved. We all realise the immense importance of &ldquo;the woman of the house&rdquo; to the home and the nation.  We have no difference, I think, on what the President has said on that topic, but I suggest to him that woman&mdash;even the mother of the family, &ldquo;the woman of the house&rdquo; to use the common expression here&mdash;has duties to the home, for the home, which are not exclusively exercised within the home, and it is with the hope of obtaining the assent of the President and his Party to that view that I put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the sub-section stands, it suggests that the entire life of the woman is within the home, that her whole activity, her whole influence on society, is exercised and should be exercised <Col N="1876" /> within the home.  I am not questioning that the influence of the mother in the home, as mistress of the house, as instructress of her children, is the most important influence she can exercise on society.  But I do suggest that she has wider influence, and that the phrasing of this sub-section seems to suggest that her entire influence is within the home, instead of, as I should like to put it &ldquo;for the home&rdquo;.  It is not good for the mother of the house to be exclusively occupied with the domestic concerns of her own house, within the home.  A certain degree of such occupation is necessary, but her work within the home will be all the better for her having interests outside the home, and I would suggest that this sub-section tends to limit the tendency towards her having such outside interests.</P>
    <P>Again, the President declared&mdash;and I entirely accept his declaration&mdash;that this clause was not drawn from a propagandist point of view.  I do not at all question the sincerity of that statement, but what seems to create a certain danger in regard to this section, as in regard to other parts of the Constitution, is that the President is optimistic enough to assume that future generations will interpret the Constitution in exactly the same spirit as he has framed it.  Being confident of his own good intentions he assumes that the intentions will be the same in the minds of his successors.  But that is an assumption which is not justified by our knowledge of the world.  I think that, in consequence of that optimistic point of view, he has taken risks in this sub-section, and in other subsections of the Constitution, in regard to the direction in which he intends to travel.  He used the word &ldquo;directive&rdquo; himself to-day in regard to this clause. He said it was intended to be directive. If so, the direction is hardly precise enough.  It may very easily lead in the wrong direction; it may lead to a limitation of the influence of the mistress of the house, instead of increased emphasis being laid on that influence.</P>
    <P>During the President's speech I ventured to interject the remark that &ldquo;woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; were different terms.  Up to that point his speech had been entirely about the <Col N="1877" /> mother.  I do not bring this point up again simply to emphasise what appeared to me a lack of clarity for the moment in the President's mind as to what we were concerned with, but in order to point out that where this word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; is used here in sub-section 1º it has a much wider meaning than the word &ldquo;mother&rdquo; as used in the next sub-section, and I do not think the President will suggest that the main sub-section 1º is to be controlled or interpreted by the word in sub-section 2º.  One takes it in the ordinary way that the first general statement laid down is the ruling statement, and that the other is an application of it, if not a clarification of it &mdash;in this case an application of it to a particular instance.  Again, I think we are all with the President in regard to the actual terms of sub-section 2º, although not perhaps agreeing that it will always be interpreted wisely in future.  Woman in the house is something more than mother in the house in numbers, and she is something more than wife in the house.  There are many women in many houses in addition to the wife and mother, and this clause seems to me to stand in the way or may be applied in the future to stand in the way of these women exercising their activity outside the four walls of the home.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, common knowledge that not all the daughters, in the modern society of this country as in every other country, will be content to remain in the home where there is not ample work for them, where there is nothing to do but assist the mother in the management of a small house. Not only in this country but in other countries these girls have independence, and look for work useful to themselves, useful to society, and useful to the home.  They are bringing their earnings in to maintain the home.  They are getting a wider outlook on the world.  They are getting greater opportunities for a suitable choice in marriage, and in every way their services for the home are useful not only to the home but to society.  I suggest that if the President were to reconsider his rather anticipatory condemnation of this amendment he might see that <Col N="1878" /> he is not weakening the doctrine he is laying down by accepting the term &ldquo;for the home&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;within the home&rdquo;, but that in using the words &ldquo;within the home&rdquo; he is indirectly casting a certain slur on the many women, the majority of women, who have to undertake some occupation other than that which they may actually practise inside the four walls of the home, although that occupation is for the home.  Girls who go out as governesses, nurses, shop assistants, and so on, are working for the home, and their work is just as important or more important than if they remained at home tied to the mother's apron strings, where they would be unnecessary and would be almost completely idle.</P>
    <P>The principle of this amendment is, of course, quite different from that of the amendment which was disposed of a few moments ago.  It illuminates what seems to me the underlying groundwork of the President's theory, which I accept, as to the importance of woman in the home, but I think it applies to the principle in a broader way, in a way that is more useful and more applicable both to the state of society as it is at the moment and to the state of society which we are bound to have in the future.  We here cannot hope to follow Herr Hitler's example in sending girls back to the home, confining their activities there, and doing nothing else but knit and sew in the home.  That will not be adopted in this country nor, I am sure, will it be adopted for long in Herr Hitler's country either.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not suggest that there is anything in this section which says that women should be sent back, as he said Herr Hitler had sent them&mdash;I do not know to what extent he has&mdash;to remain in the home.  This is closely-knit reasoning. We are putting upon the State an obligation in future to endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in work outside to the neglect of their duties at home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is closely-knit reasoning.  Because of the fact that there is an obligation, we want to give a reason for it, and the reason we have given in this connection is that the work that is done by woman in the home&mdash;as the home-maker, in the care of her children, in the rearing of her children, in the care of the home&mdash;is indispensable to the welfare of the nation as a whole, and because it is indispensable we say, further indicating the extent, that we recognise that she gives to the State a support without which the common good could not be achieved.  That is repeating in another form the words of a previous phrase.</P>
      <P>The object in putting in the first clause is not merely to recognise what part woman plays but as a groundwork for the conclusion.  Fathers of families who earn the wherewithal to maintain the family are doing work for the home.  This is not intended to be a catalogue of all the people who serve the home or who serve the State.  It is intended as a preliminary, to point to a conclusion, and the conclusion is that work in the home is such that mothers ought not to be forced by economic necessity to leave these duties.  The first part is closely knit up with the second part.</P>
      <P>That is why I dealt with the second part.  I cannot see in any suggestion that they do otherwise than serve the home.  This is a particular kind of service, and of such importance, that the State should make it its special purpose to see that it should not be interfered with.  I am dealing with that particular part of woman's life within the home.  If you take this away completely from the context here and try to make it mean something other than what was intended, or if you put in &ldquo;for the home,&rdquo; it would not lead up to the second part.  The difficulty is that mothers are forced to leave their proper duties, and I want to see it accepted as the purpose of the nation as a whole that we should endeavour to see that that necessity would no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> Take the case of a daughter who is forced to emigrate and who sends the wherewithal to maintain the home. She is working for the home.  I am not thinking of that case, or of women who go out to work at all.  I am thinking of the particular aspect of woman's life connected with her duties in the home, as woman of the house, to use the Deputy's phrase, which covers exactly what I am dealing with.  I tried to deal with that as best I could.  I must say that the criticism made it hard to keep an open mind.  I am trying to interpret this as an ordinary person would interpret it.  I know that there are certain people anxious to drag it away from the clear and obvious meaning.  I am very anxious that no person could misinterpret the context, or read into it the idea that there is some reflection on woman whose work is not of this character or even that part of woman's work which is not of this character.  As the Deputy stated, very often you have women, who not only perform their duties in the home but are able to do a great deal of good work outside as well.  I am not against that.  I think the very definite answer of the State is that every citizen should contribute to the common good in whatever way that citizen is best fitted.</P>
    <P>Where I feel the Deputy's amendment fails is that it would change the whole context and take away the closeness of the reasoning in the clause.  It would also raise many other matters.  My mind was running rather upon whether there was some possible suggestion that &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; it should necessarily be spent within the home.  There is no suggestion of that in the clause as it stands.  If I were disposed to amend it at all, it would be to try to make it certain that nobody was going reasonably to read into it by the words &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; that there was some suggestion that woman's life was to be confined absolutely within the home. I am only dealing with one aspect of woman's life.  I am forced to reject the amendment, because I think it would change the whole meaning of the clause.  I am prepared to consider <Col N="1881" /> whether in the words &ldquo;by her life within the home&rdquo; there is not a suggestion that people would condemn her, so to speak, to live entirely in the home.  I think that would be absurd in our state of society.</P>

      <P>The President said he would consider the matter again, though not in the direction I suggested. As things stand the argument is weak owing to the fact that there is no common term between the two phrases. The President would really strengthen his argument in support of the next sub-section if he adopted a suggestion which was made earlier, that he should put the term &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in sub-section 1º as well as in sub-section 2º.  Then his argument would be perfectly clear, and, as Deputy Dillon stated, no one would object to a recognition of the mother in the home, whereas &ldquo;woman&rdquo; includes too much.  I hope the President will think the matter over before dealing with the section again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being told that it is foolish and trifling, I wish to draw attention to a difficulty arising out of the clauses dealing with the <Col N="1882" /> dissolution of marriage.  Clause 2 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
      <P>I think that clause is too wide. Clause 3 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State shall be capable of contracting in Eire a valid marriage during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.</P>
      <P>In my view, that is also entirely too wide.  It is well known that the Catholic Church does not recognise marriage in a registry office or other than through the method and form laid down by the Catholic Church.  A case came under my personal experience where an Irish girl, a Catholic, married a Scotchman of a different religion in a registry office.  Of course, that marriage was not in accordance with the views of the Catholic Church, was invalid and no marriage at all.  It was a marriage merely under the civil law of Great Britain.  In fact, the marriage was never consummated, because the parties separated at the door of the registry office and never saw each other again.  The girl came back to Ireland and desired to marry. According to the view of the Catholic Church she was entitled to marry.  The case was submitted to me when I was Attorney-General with a view to prosecution for bigamy.  I need hardly say that I did not prosecute.</P>
      <P>Sub-clause 3º of clause 3 provides that no person whose marriage has been dissolved in another State shall be capable of contracting marriage here.  If a Catholic is married in a registry office in England to a Protestant, or even to a Catholic, that is an invalid marriage according to the law of the Catholic Church, and according to the civil law here and the civil law in England it is valid.  That marriage is dissolved.  Then it is no marriage in Great Britain and it is not a marriage according to the Catholic Church.  But, according to this clause, either of these persons cannot be married here afterwards.  Will the President say if that is a foolish interjection or is it of some assistance to him?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can always be sure that when he addresses himself to matters in the way he has now, nobody is going to accuse him of anything foolish.  It is quite a different matter, and I think it is obvious to everybody, when there is a case being argued that is really only being argued because the person happens to feel that he has to say something on the Opposition Benches.  I think this is something quite different. Anyone can see that there are genuine difficulties to be dealt with there.  I am not a lawyer, but I think there is a difference between dissolution and a declaration of nullity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between nullity of a marriage, which is no marriage, which never was a marriage, and a marriage which was a marriage in law and which is dissolved. The case I am putting is the concrete instance where a marriage is perfectly valid in accordance with the English law, and possibly consummated, a marriage celebrated, if you can use that expression, in a registry office.  Subsequently, by the law of divorce in England, it is dissolved, and one of the parties comes over here and wants to get married.  It is no marriage, according to the Catholic Church.  It is not a marriage, according to the law, because it has been dissolved in England, and this Article prevents either of the parties getting married here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy said it would be declared invalid and that it had been no marriage at all.  If it is dissolved, of course it is clearly coming under this, and there is a difficulty which will <Col N="1884" /> have to be met.  I can only promise to look into that matter.  The matter has been raised already, and I do not see that there is any definite solution for it.  The main thing we want to see is that there shall not be granted a dissolution of a valid marriage in our own State.  We have the old difficulty, that if you try to make room for all the possible exceptions that may occur, then you may get away altogether from the fundamental purpose.</P>

We do not want to permit a person who has been validly married in another country and whose marriage has been dissolved by the civil law of another country to come here and get married here.  I promise to have the matter examined to see if we can possibly deal with it. But, as I said, the matter has come up and I have come to the conclusion that it would be almost impossible to deal with it without opening the door in such a way as to cause undesirable results in another direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I think, a harder case than that mentioned by Deputy Costello.  There may be a case where a seeming marriage has been annulled by the authorities of the Catholic Church, but the parties might not be able to get an annulment in civil law in another country, and in order to make the separation effective they might have to proceed through the ordinary law of divorce.  It might happen that the marriage was annulled at Rome on grounds which would not carry under the law in England and, in order to make the separation effective, these parties might have to proceed by the ordinary law of divorce in England. Having had the marriage dissolved, let us say, in England, if they came over here they could not contract a valid marriage, although in the opinion of the majority of the people in this country there never had been a marriage. I think that is a case which is worthy of consideration, and that it can occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> I should like to make one or two observations on this Article in general. I have been told&mdash;I am not sure whether it is so or not&mdash;that when the President was speaking on the Second Reading he stated that this section was not put in as based on any theological convictions held by the majority of the people of this country, but that it was put in purely from social considerations. That would leave the matter, of course, much easier to discuss.  It would be impertinent in both senses of the word for me to discuss the discipline of the Church to which the majority of the people of this country willingly submit themselves, or to suggest that they shall not consider themselves bound by the discipline of that Church.  But it is another matter if they think it their duty to enforce the discipline of one Church on the consciences of people who do not submit themselves to such discipline.  Therefore, I think that, if the section were based on such a ground, there would be reasonable ground for complaint on the part of, admittedly, a small number of people in this country.</P>
    <P>However, I am assuming that the President did make the statement which I am told he made&mdash;that he was not affected by the theological opinions of himself or others in bringing in the section, or some phrase to that effect.  The question then comes back to the pure question of social considerations, as to the advantage or disadvantage of permitting divorce in any circumstances in the country, and providing against it in the Constitution. It seems to me that it might be discussed here at a considerable length without readily arriving at a conclusion. I am not going to discuss it at any length.  But I should like to say this, that while I do not think anybody in the country wishes to have divorce made easy, or that marriage and the dissolution of marriage should be made such light things that they could be undertaken without responsibility, undoubtedly anyone of experience in the world knows that there are many cases in which marriages have been quite definitely a failure, in which through faults of one sort or another, there is no hope that the continuance of such a marriage will be of use to <Col N="1886" /> society, and that giving freedom to these people, restoring them to the status they had before marriage, would conceivably give an opportunity for establishing a happy home which would be useful to society.</P>
    <P>I am not going to proceed further along that line.  I think it is a matter which could be discussed at great length, and discussed either usefully or uselessly, according to the manner of it. But one meets these cases.  Anyone with experience of the world, any clergyman, any doctor, will meet many such cases in which he cannot but believe that a divorce would have led to a happier life and a more moral life on the part of those concerned.  I will make no further observations on the Article, but I wish to draw the President's attention to the particular case I mentioned when I got up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to look into it.  My feeling is that if you try to meet certain very specialised cases you will have to go into quite another field altogether.  However, as the Deputy thinks it is an important matter, I will have it further examined. With regard to the question of divorce in general, there is no doubt that sometimes there are unhappy marriages, but from the social point of view, without considering any other point of view, the obvious evil would be so great, and it has been proved to be so great in other countries, that I do not think any person would have any difficulty&mdash;at least I would not&mdash;in making a choice on this matter.  I do not think any useful purpose could be served by such a discussion as the Deputy has indicated. If we were to open out into a broad discussion on the matter it would, as I understand it, only lead to one result and it would not be useful to enter into it.  With regard to the cases mentioned by Deputy Costello and Deputy Rowlette, I will have them examined to see if we could modify this Article to meet these cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 133:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1, to delete sub-section 2º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of the President, I am sure, that in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> Professor Berriedale Keith singled out the particular <Col N="1890" /> provision of sub-section 2º of Section 1 of this Article as the thing in the Constitution which most offended against the idea of the unity of Ireland.  It was, he said, a thing that was likely to create misunderstandings and objections in the minds of persons in the North of Ireland.  My feeling about it is that the sub-section in question is entirely useless.  It really means nothing.  It does not establish the Catholic Church in a privileged position.  It does not offend in any way against the principle of equal treatment of people of different religions. It seems to serve no purpose except to create misunderstandings. That being the case, unless some reason for it can be brought forward that has not yet occurred to me, I suggest that it would be better to leave out this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  The recognition of an obvious fact is there, and that fact must have considerable influence in the life of the State.  It is bound to have There are 93 per cent. of the people in this part of Ireland and 75 per cent. of the people of Ireland as a whole who belong to the Catholic Church, who believe in its teachings, and whose whole philosophy of life is the philosophy that comes from its teachings.  Consequently it is very important that in our Constitution that fact should be recognised.  A short time ago Deputy Rowlette spoke about the question of divorce, apart altogether from the question of what views an individual might have on divorce from a social point of view.  That is the point of view we approached it from here.  There is no doubt one would have to bear in mind what were the views and the feelings and the attitude of mind of the vast majority of the people.  If we are going to have a democratic State, if we are going to be ruled by the representatives of the people, it is clear their whole philosophy of life is going to affect that, and that has to be borne in mind and the recognition of it is important in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the other paragraph is to indicate that these Churches are recognised too, that their existence in <Col N="1891" /> our midst is recognised.  The fact is that there has been no objection taken.  It might be said that this does not go, from the Catholic point of view, the distance that would be desired by a number, but no objection has been taken by the Churches to this.  The other parts are very important, because it is necessary to indicate that, notwithstanding that the vast majority of our people belong to one faith, nevertheless the State recognises the liberty of every citizen to practise his religion and to adore the Almighty in public and private.</P>
    <P>The other Articles are largely a rewriting, in the form in which this whole Constitution has been written, of Articles already in the old Constitution. It was obvious in a matter of this sort that, to allay any possible apprehensions, it was desirable to keep as far as possible along the old lines.  In places the Articles of the old Constitution are preserved as a whole. It was considered desirable not to change the old Constitution so that there might be no anxieties held by any sections of the people as to the continuance of the guarantees of freedom to practise their religion which were in the old Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The President said, absolutely correctly, that the words of this section are the recognition of an obvious fact, and he went on to say that that fact is bound to have its influence on legislation in this country and the deliberations of a Legislature. These things are perfectly true; nobody could question them or object to them in any way.  He went on to say that, if they were so, it would be advisable to have this in the Constitution. I suggest that the fact is so obvious and the deductions to be made from it are so very obvious, that there is no need to have this in the Constitution. In so far as that is a statement of fact, anybody can agree with it or give assent to it; but, in so far as there may be a suggestion in it, possibly in the future, that it gives any position of special privilege to one Church, even where that Church is the Church of the great majority of the people, a certain anxiety undoubtedly <Col N="1892" /> will arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot referred to the opposition that the mere statement of that fact may create in Northern Ireland.  I do not excuse the timorousness in Northern Ireland or the opposition it may give rise to; but I suggest, with considerable reluctance, that the statement here going into the Constitution is unnecessary and it may give rise to a suggestion in the future that the Catholic Church, having been specially recognised, is in a position of special privilege as regards giving advice to the State, and so on.  The President rightly said that religious opinions and the attitude towards religious philosophy of the members of the Legislature will be reflected in the legislation.  That is, of course, true; but I suggest that that is the way in which the special influence of the Catholic Church will make itself felt legitimately and properly, and any possible stretching of that in the future is to be avoided by anything that will look in the Constitution as a direct recognition.</P>
      <P>I am not afraid of this clause at all as it stands; I am not afraid of anything happening in my lifetime that will interfere with the liberty of those who differ in religion from the majority of the people; but I see a possibility, perhaps a distant one, of difficulties arising in the future.</P>

      <P>I need not tell the Deputy that I gave this matter very careful consideration before I decided to put the Articles in the form in which they stand.  They are the result of serious deliberation and careful thought, understanding the position rather well and recognising the difficulties that would arise if the matter was not put on a proper foundation.  First of all, with regard to the criticism of Professor Berriedale Keith, or anybody else, we can only take these things as they come.  I think it was Deputy MacDermot who said to-day that in this Constitution, and by its nature in any Constitution, you expose a very wide surface to attack.  The whole of life has to be dealt with. Here you have also a most important fact.  There is no question that anybody <Col N="1893" /> who has a religious belief at all will admit that it is the most important thing in life.  You have to deal with it, and I think it is dealt with here in a way which has not aroused any antagonism.  In fact, it was put down here only after careful consideration and, I might add, testing, as to whether there was anything that was going to cause reasonable objection in any quarter.  In the form in which it is, I think we can let it remain without any qualms or fears.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 135 deals with rather a different point, but I will confess that when I put down that amendment I had overlooked the fact that sub-section 5º, to which it refers, is taken bodily from the old Constitution, so that no change is being enacted.  Had not that been so, I would have questioned the wisdom of putting religious property on a different basis from other property.  I would have been as eager as anyone to guarantee rights of property to a religious institution the same as to any citizen, but I would have questioned the wisdom of making a distinction between religious institutions and individual citizens in relation to rights of property.  This portion of the Constitution adds nothing new and I propose to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond in an amendment, proposed earlier in the debate, asked for the insertion of a certain provision in another Article. She sought to have put in the words &ldquo;without distinction of sex, religion or class.&rdquo;  The President said he would consider it again when we came to this Article 44.  He referred to Section 2 2º of Article 44, which says:</P>
      <P>The State guarantees not to endow any religion, and shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
      <P>That gives a very considerable amount of protection but it is not quite the same as declaring that there is no distinction in the rights of citizens on the grounds of religion.  It might read as if it were simply a declaration of toleration and not a declaration of rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that at this stage I am not ready to deal with that.  We shall have to make sure to deal with it on Report.  The question I was considering was whether the whole clause had some suggestion in connection with endowment. I had read it as if the clause were by itself without any reference to endowing any religion&mdash;&ldquo;that the State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.&rdquo;  I think that would be sufficiently wide to cover everything. The only question is whether, in the context of endowment, it might narrow what I thought was the completely general statement.  I will have the matter looked into.  I may say that in regard to citizenship, the line we are trying to go on is to get some general classification of citizens and, if necessary, to mention in that classification this question of religion and sex so as to cover the whole thing. <Col N="1895" /> I dislike bringing in this sub-clause &ldquo;without distinction of sex and religion&rdquo; and that sort of thing every time you mention the word &ldquo;citizens.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 137:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 4 to delete sub-section 2º and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The State recognises the right of all citizens to work and obtain work, and that in this respect the rights of men and women are equal.  But the State shall endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers and the tender age of children shall not be abused and that no citizen or child shall be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their sex, age or strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another of the series of amendments drafted by various Deputies, including myself, to endeavour to allay the fears of many of the women citizens of the State that some of these sections might be misread so as to put some bar in the way of the freedom of action of women in their work and not merely in regard to political standing.  The President has said that the political equality of women was recognised throughout the whole Constitution, or that it would be by the time he had done with the Constitution, and had <Col N="1896" /> put in some amendments he had promised, but what women are afraid of is not so much any deprivation of their political equality, but some deprivation of their economic equality, and this amendment has been drafted in order to make explicit that they shall have equal rights of work with men. It is intended as a substitution for the last paragraph of the Article.  I do not think anybody has any quarrel with the actual words of that paragraph but there is the fear that, taken in conjunction with other Articles, it may be used to interfere with the activity of women in cases other than those where their strength might be endangered by the nature of the avocation.</P>
    <P>I touched on this in discussing another amendment a day or two ago, and I do not want to weary the House by going over the same ground, but I would suggest that the President might be willing to accept the amendment which, in its first clause, pledges itself definitely to give equal rights as regards the right to work and to look for work to men and women.  That first sentence of the amendment: &ldquo;The State recognises the right of all its citizens to work and obtain work, and that, in this respect the rights of men and women are equal,&rdquo; would to women be a charter of economic freedom embedded in the Constitution which would, I think, allay a great deal of the anxiety at present existing.  It is said that this anxiety is quite unnecessary. That may be so, but it does not do away with the fact that there is anxiety.  One has learned from personal communication, from communications in the newspapers and from various resolutions passed by women's societies, that this anxiety is felt.  It is not being expressed by irresponsible people, but by many of the most responsible women's associations in the country.  I have been very much impressed by the names attached to some of these communications.  Some of the leading women professors at the universities and other women who have taken a leading and very important part in public life for years past are amongst them.  They do fear that this Article, taken in conjunction with <Col N="1897" /> others, may be used in the future to limit their activities, and many of them asked that particularly this first sentence of my amendment should be pressed on the House.</P>
    <P>The rest of the amendment accepts, almost word for word, the clause which appears in the Draft already, but instead of having special reference to women, it applies in the broadest sense to all workers, which is important. Surely workers of every sex, men and women, require protection as regards their strength and health, and our laws provide for some control in that respect and that employers are not to be at liberty to overwork their workers to a gross degree.  Only in the last year or two, the Government introduced and the House busied itself in passing a measure of considerable protection for the health and strength of workers.  I take it there is no objection to that being embodied in the Constitution, and I would suggest that instead of pointing to women as requiring protection, it should point to all workers, including women, as requiring protection.  The only other point that is altered in the Draft is that, instead of women or children, as set out in the clause, the amendment suggests it should refer to &ldquo;no citizen or child&rdquo; and should read: &ldquo;... and that no citizen or child shall be forced by economic necessity...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is the wish of all of us&mdash;that no citizen, adult man or woman, should have to enter an avocation unsuited to their age, strength or sex.  There are avocations suitable to women and it would be deplorable if men were to enter such avocations. Many of them are forced to do so at present by virtue of the fact that they cannot obtain any other kind of work. However, that is beside the question. I ask the President and the Dáil to give very close attention to this paragraph of the Draft.  The right of women should be set out as equal to men in regard to working and seeking for work, and the special reference to women in the second part should be dropped out and words referring broadly to workers and citizens should be substituted.  I do not think that <Col N="1898" /> there is anything controversial in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the two paragraphs must be read closely together&mdash; paragraphs 1º and 2º.  In the first paragraph, it is stated that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the weaker sections of the community&mdash; the sections most likely to be exploited or whose powers might be abused. There is no doubt that there is a tendency to exploit women labour.  The State is pledging itself generally to guard with special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, mentioning special classes &mdash;the infirm, the widow, the orphan and the aged.  We go on in the second part to ensure that the inadequate strength of women or of children shall not be abused.  It is, perhaps, true that in modern times the abuse is not on the strength of women in the sense that would occur to one if you took the example given to-day of a woman going down a mine and moving heavy loads about or the example, as I saw some time ago, in a picture, of women loading coal on steamers in China. That is not now so much the danger and, perhaps, the term &ldquo;inadequate strength&rdquo; is not the most appropriate. In general, I have no objection to the amendment.  I shall have it examined carefully.  I think that the Deputy did not intend to go as far as is set out in the amendment.  There are two propositions involved.  I take it that the intention was to stress the equality of right.  There is however, the further proposition&mdash;the right to work and obtain work.  Is not that so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving that question over, I do not know whether we shall get agreement as to the right of all people to get a means of livelihood.  It is very difficult to secure that, but in modern society&mdash; the word &ldquo;enmeshed&rdquo; was used here to-day&mdash;the right to a means of livelihood exists, and it ought to be the endeavour of society to see that the right is given effect by trying to make <Col N="1899" /> the means available.  However, this is a definite commitment and we ought to see our way a little ahead before we adopt it.  If I can get the whole proposition generally accepted, I shall do so, but I shall do it with the necessary qualification that it should be an endeavour, because we cannot promise any more than a sincere endeavour at the moment.  So far as the equality of right to a means of livelihood is concerned, there is no doubt that that applies to the woman as well as to the man and, so far as that goes, I do not think there will be any difficulty in getting acceptance. I shall consider whether the other proposition is contained in that and I shall go as far as I can to meet it.</P>

      <P>I do not see much use in moving this amendment at this stage.  Therefore I propose to postpone it.  I am fortified in that by the belief that there is to be a redrafting of this section.  When we see the draft of this particular section we may then be in a position to decide what will happen, but at the moment, with the thing in a state of flux, if that is not too definite a word to apply to anything coming from the President, we are not in a position to do that.  As I say, every amendment that has been proposed by the Opposition, and every criticism that has been offered on this Constitution from these benches, or in the country, has been regarded almost as high treason by the President.  Now, we cannot be put into the position of simply legislating not on what is here before us on paper, but legislating some alleged thing that is in the President's mind.  It is not the President's word that we are enacting, and it is not the President who will have the interpretation of this <Col N="1901" /> Constitution, and therefore we can only deal with the documents before us.  We have been met so unreasonably, and have had to listen to such a lot of confused and absurd argument on the part of the President, that it would be wasting our own time and the time of the House if we were to go into this matter now.</P>

There might be an emergency in constitutional matters as in other matters, and if these had a unanimous vote of both the Dáil and the Seanad it cannot be said that there is a fear of something being done behind the backs of the people.  There are also matters in the Constitution that might be considered of insufficient importance to warrant putting the country to the expense of a Referendum.

The only objection I have is that that seems to weaken the fundamental sanction, because in the one case you have definitely to prove that, while in the other it is only, so to speak, by a process of deduction, having the unanimity which is called for here, you could fairly assume that if the matter had been put to the people it would have been accepted.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to accept the amendment, but I would like to have time to go into it fully and see what can be done.  One of the things in favour of it is that there might be an emergency of so compelling a character that it was only the element of time that mattered most, and that that would be appreciated to such an extent that you would get Deputies and members of the Seanad to agree that it should be done, or the matter might be of such a trifling character that the expense of going to the people would hardly seem to be justified.  That is an argument in favour of accepting the amendment.  The only thing against it is the general principle that once the Constitution is adopted by the people as a whole it ought to be changed only by their direct and immediate will.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 141:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete Sections 1 and 2 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In every Referendum voting shall be compulsory.  Failure to vote shall cause disenfranchisement at the next succeeding general election together with such fine as may be imposed by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is this, that it has been found in practice in countries where the Referendum exists, that any stipulation as to the proportion of people that must vote in order to make the Referendum effective has very grave dangers for this reason: that it has been found that the easiest way to defeat a particular proposal is not to bring out your voters to vote against it but to deter them from voting at all.  It is a very easy form of intimidation, because it is easy to ascertain whether or not a man has, in fact, gone to vote.  I have put in an amendment suggesting that voting should be compulsory in a Referendum, but that is not the real pith of my criticism.  I am not particularly keen to have voting made compulsory. <Col N="1904" /> I shall be quite satisfied if there is no stipulation as to a certain proportion of the electorate having to vote before a Referendum is effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to compulsory voting, we have discussed that already and there is no need to go back on it.  The Deputy, I am sure, realises the peculiar way in which this is cast. This is negative in form.  In other words, the theory behind it is that the legislation shall pass unless it is vetoed, the assumption being that, unless the people opposed to it were sufficiently interested to come out and vote against it, it has their approval&mdash;in other words, silence gives consent.  The people's House of Representatives, at least, have passed it, and their will shall be effective unless the people actively show that they do not approve.</P>
      <P>If the people, then, do not show that they are actively opposed to it by coming out in such numbers as would make sure of its defeat, I think it can be taken that it has their approval. I think that we might take that number of people as, roughly, one-half of what we would expect at a reasonably well-contested election.  I put the figure there at 35 per cent., because I think you will find that at a reasonably well-contested election you will have about 70 per cent. of the register polled.  Therefore, the basis on which this is laid is that, if this is a measure to which a majority of the people object, then when there is a vote taken on it, you will get that majority by having at least 35 per cent.  In other words, you are putting the responsibility on those who object to come out and vote against the measure and that is why you have the number there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that there may be some question of intimidation.  I do not think it would amount to very much. However, that particular aspect of it did not occur to me, and I admit that there may be some question of intimidation.  The aspect that I had in my mind was that it was necessary to make sure that a measure should not be defeated by the inertia of people who did not care what it was about, and that as many people would come out to vote against the measure to which they objected as would be <Col N="1905" /> sufficient to give you a majority in an ordinary well-contested election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, compulsory voting would answer the objection about inertia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, but I think we would be getting into another field altogether if we were to go into the question of compulsory voting.  After all, if you take the number on the register and subtract those who cannot come&mdash;very often, you will find that a number of people have died in the meantime, and so on&mdash;I do not think that the number that do turn out in an ordinary well-contested election is so very small in this country.  I think our people are sufficiently interested to come out and vote.  I have not seen a close analysis of any one constituency to find out how many, of the 100 per cent.  on the register, would, in fact, under a compulsory system of voting, be in that vote.  I know that compulsory voting in other countries has got up to 95 per cent., or well over 90 per cent., at any rate. Consequently, it is possible that you would increase the percentage somewhat if you had compulsory voting. On the other hand, there are evils in connection with compulsory voting which were adverted to here when we were discussing this matter before. Of course, it could be brought in. There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent, at any time, a law being passed making it obligatory on voters to go to the polls, or on those who are on the register to go to the polls. Accordingly, we are not closing the door on that possibility, but I should not like to bring it in here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two special difficulties with regard to voting in a referendum.  One is that the proportion of voters apt to turn out, until a country becomes accustomed to the referendum system, is generally very low.  They turn out and vote in much higher numbers in a general election where more personal interests enter in and where they are called upon to choose between one party and another, and where they are voting about something of a popular nature <Col N="1906" /> and about which they have a clear opinion.  When it comes to a question of a single law, however, the tendency is that the proportion of people who take the trouble to come out and vote will be very small, at least until a country gets accustomed to a referendum system.  Where they are accustomed to a referendum system, it is different.  For example, in Switzerland the proportion of those who turn out in a referendum has increased until now, I understand, the proportion in that country is very high.  Largely as a result of the referendum system the ordinary Swiss people are about the most politically educated people in the world.  As a matter of fact, it is amazing to find how politically educated the humblest class of people in Switzerland are.</P>
      <P>However, as I said, we must be prepared, when the first referendum comes along, to find a low percentage turning out.  I think it will be found, unless the referendum is concerned with some very sensational subject, that the proportion of voters who turn out will be very much lower than in a general election.  That is one reason why one ought to be very careful about setting any minimum such as is provided here. The other is the one I have mentioned: that it has been found, in the case of a referendum, that much the easiest way of intimidation is to prevent people from going there at all and causing the referendum to fail, in the sense in which they desire it to fail, by that method.</P>

      <P>I would really ask the President to accept amendments Nos. 142 and 143 because they just diminish a little bit the stringency of the conditions he is imposing, which, I think, are dangerous conditions in view of what I have just been saying.  As regards amendment No. 142, I put that down because the words used seemed to me to be slightly ambiguous.  Amendment No. 142 refers to Section 2, sub-section 1º, line 6, which says: &ldquo;Every Bill and every proposal, other than a proposal to amend the Constitution, which is submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people, shall be held to have been votoed by the people if a majority of the votes cast at such Referendum shall have been cast against its enactment into law and such majority,&rdquo; and so on.

      <P>No, I do not think it does.  It seems to me that the second &ldquo;majority&rdquo; differs in meaning from the first &ldquo;majority.&rdquo;  The words are &ldquo;if a majority of the votes cast at such Referendum shall have been cast against its enactment into law and such majority shall have amounted to.&rdquo;  That means the amount by which the successful votes exceeded the unsuccessful votes.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to reduce the minimum from 35 per cent. to 30 per cent.  In view of what I have said about the lowness of the vote in referendums in countries where the people are not yet accustomed to them, I feel that the amendment should be accepted. After all, 30 per cent. on one side means 30 per cent. of the voters on the Register on one side.  You might have 29 per cent. on the other side so that you would really have a very high vote, even with the minimum I suggest.  I would appeal to the President to accept the amendment because in practice I think it will be found that 30 per cent. of the voters on the Register means a very high vote.</P>

If we are using the word &ldquo;vetoed&rdquo;, then the responsibility for getting the measure &ldquo;vetoed&rdquo; is to be cast definitely on those who oppose it.  It might be a serious matter for the people who did not go to the poll.  You would not have compulsory voting and there might be a general feeling that there was only a small number opposed to the measure and some people might say: &ldquo;We will not go to the poll at all.&rdquo;  You might then find that you would be defeating the will of the House of Representatives because, I take it, it is only where a measure has been deemed to be passed and where there is a difference of opinion between the House of Representatives and the Seanad, that a measure like this would go to the people.  I want to provide that if it is vetoed, it will only be vetoed by an actual majority of the people opposed to it.  I am afraid that a lower proportion than 35 per cent. would not be very safe because 70 per cent. is not a very high vote in a well-contested election.</P>

      <P>It might and it might not.  We are more or less in the dark in this matter.  You could certainly, in a well-contested election, get very much more than 70 per cent. of a vote.  I shall try to meet the Deputy's wishes, but this is a matter which has been carefully considered and discussed.  I think that the will of the Legislature, the House of Representatives, should not be vetoed or upset unless it is clear that it is being vetoed by a majority of the people.  It should not be left to mere chance as to whether some people do their duty or not.  This proportion of 35 per cent. has been an agreed number, so to speak, and I have not the same opportunity of meeting the Deputy as I have in other matters.  I shall try if I can to get it down to 33? per cent.</P>

      <P>I would point out that you might have a referendum where 34 per cent. of the electorate would vote on one side and 33 on the <Col N="1910" /> other&mdash;a total of 67 per cent. of the electorate, a very fine vote.  The result of that referendum might be rendered entirely nugatory by this provision.  Of course, you might hold that the Legislature, plus 33 per cent. of the electorate should prevail over 34 per cent. of the electorate, but that is against the principle of a referendum.  On every referendum, of course, the figures might not be so close.  You might have 30 per cent. on the one side and 34 per cent. on the other, which would still be an extremely high vote, as referendums go.  I do not think that the decision of the people should be rendered nugatory by a rigid provision of this kind.  I think that 30 per cent. of the voters on the register would represent a very high proportion, and I certainly appeal to the President that it should not be made any higher.</P>

      <P>An idea has occurred to me while the Deputy was speaking, but I do not know whether it would be feasible.  We might have some corrective by providing that the total vote cast should reach a certain percentage. That would meet a case where you had a really good vote.  You could provide that there should be 35 per cent. of the voters on the register in favour of vetoing the measure, unless there was more than a certain percentage of the votes cast.  If the number of votes cast exceeded that percentage you could provide for a lower percentage than 35 per cent., otherwise there would have to be 35 per cent. in favour of the veto.  I do not want to complicate the matter too much if we could get out of it in any other way.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at this he will see that we are talking about the nation, which claims its national territory and, without prejudice to the claim that the Parliament which is being set up here should exercise jurisdiction, we are taking cognisance of the obvious fact that our jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the Parliament and the Government set up by the State, cannot effectively extend to certain parts of the country at the present moment.  Therefore, when we are talking about the people of Eire, it is obvious that it must be only the part which we can effectively control.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask for an elucidation of that point.  The President refers to Article 1 in which it appears that a certain thing is being done by certain people.  Those things are affirmed in the form of a Bill here, that is to say proposed but not having legal effect.  In Article 3 there is an admission that we cannot legislate for the area in which, in Article 1, we purport to be legislating for.  Then we come to the Preamble, and I do want some clarity on this question of &ldquo;Eire.&rdquo;  The President tells us it is quite clear.  There is a reference to the State.  There is a heading &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; and a heading &ldquo;The State.&rdquo; Article 4 says &ldquo;The name of the State is Eire.&rdquo;  There is nothing in this document defining for us what is meant by &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;the State.&rdquo;  The Preamble, as it is at the moment, says&mdash;I am giving only the effective sentence&mdash;&ldquo;We, the people of Eire, do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo;  I do not want to advert to the Irish text, but we do notice that &ldquo;The people of Eire&rdquo; is in the Irish text &ldquo;muinntear na hEireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President in another Article&mdash; Article 6 I think it was&mdash;actually pointed out that the people are referred to there in the form of &ldquo;pobal&rdquo;, &ldquo;on pobal&rdquo; and &ldquo;ag an bpobal&rdquo;.  Here we have it in the form of &ldquo;muinntear na hEireann.&rdquo;&ldquo;Muinntear na hEireann&rdquo; can only mean the people of Ireland.  We really must know where we stand.  In the English text we have &ldquo;The people of Eire,&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;We do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo; You have the subject, &ldquo;We,&rdquo; and then they perform a certain act.  They give.  They give to whom?  They give &ldquo;to ourselves.&rdquo; Who are &ldquo;We&rdquo; and who are &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo;? The President has stated time and again that in this document <Col N="1915" /> he is endeavouring to put the thing in a clear and lucid way so that everyone can understand it.  I would defy anybody to tell us what is meant here. There is &ldquo;We&rdquo; and there is &ldquo;ourselves.&rdquo; Are the &ldquo;We&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo; actually identical, or is it a fact that the people in one part of Ireland operate to give this Constitution to themselves and to other people?</P>
    <P>Time and time again I have asked the President to answer me, but I defy anyone to get hold of those words and point to a clear statement as to what this Preamble says.  &ldquo;We, the people of Eire&rdquo;; somebody, some plurality, I think, claims to itself the law-making power in this country.  To my mind there is only one law-making power in this country, and that is this Dáil. Here, some other people come along and tell us that they are enacting. Now, I admit that this Dáil, exercising its law-making power, can provide and actually has provided as to how a proposal shall become the law, and, in a certain instance, using its sovereign power, it says that one of the conditions for a proposal to become law will be that there must be a vote taken in the country.</P>
    <P>What are we to understand is going to happen?  We understand that the people in a certain portion of Ireland, a certain number of them over 21 who do not suffer from any disability, are to be invited to go and vote, and if a bare majority of those who vote, which it may be taken as practically certain is not going to be the majority in the area, then somehow this multitude of people, which presumably will be the minority of the adult people in the Free State for some reason claim the power to make law not only for those like myself who will vote against them, but for other people in the North of Ireland who have no right whatever to vote.  I asked the President time and again is he affirming something that is natural law or stating that this Government in the Free State is to exercise sovereign power to legislate and to lay down certain conditions for a majority of the people on the register.  If this <Col N="1916" /> Dáil passes a Bill through its various stages it shall only become law because there is a majority of the voters in the area.  I have to put it rather carefully as it will be actually a minority.  There are certain people over 21 years of age on the register, and I suggest that a certain portion presumably will vote. If the major part of those vote for the document, then we, by our legislation, are enacting that they have no sovereign power whatever and no law-making power.  We are merely allow ing them to perform a certain act and saying that unless it is done in a certain way a certain Bill will become law. We want clarity.</P>
    <P>Here we are going to have presumably a minority of the people with the right to vote in this area claiming power to legislate not only for themselves, and not only for people who vote against them, but also for people in another part of Ireland.  I cannot say that for certain, because the President carefully has in the ambiguous words &ldquo;in Eire&rdquo; in order to create ambiguity and to pretend that this is something it is not.  I cannot see any other reason.</P>
    <P>We are told that it is the people in Eire are intended, and that we are giving a Constitution to the same people.  They are described as &ldquo;ourselves.&rdquo;  I want a straight answer.  Who are the people of Eire? Are they the people in the Free State who are in favour of this Constitution, or the whole people of the Free State unified by the law-making power of the Government?  The Government have decreed that when a majority votes a certain way it becomes law.  Are they giving a Constitution to themselves, and purporting also to give it to the people in another area, for which we already recognise in Article 3 we have no power to make law?  The President says it is so patently clear that we have no power to make law for the Six Counties, that that is sufficient as a definition for what is meant by &ldquo;State&rdquo; when referred to here.  I am asking a straight question.  What is the Eire referred to in the Preamble?  Who are the people in it, and in the last lines indicating that they claim the law-making power?  For whom are they <Col N="1917" /> making that law?  Are they making it for the Twenty-Six Counties or for the 32 Counties?  In other words, are &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo; identical?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The State that will have functions when this Constitution is passed.  The name of that State is Eire.  In Irish, if the Deputy wanted to speak of the people of Eire, he would have only one obvious way of expressing it, &ldquo;muinntear na hEireann.&rdquo;  As I stated previously, we claim the same right as the remainder of France to call itself France, even though portion of its territory was taken away.  For obvious reasons, it contained a greater part of the nation, and hoped for the reunion of the part that was taken away.  Here we are asserting a right to have the home of the nation unified, and to have the portion that was taken away against the will of the majority restored.</P>
      <P>The claim is that the nation and the State should coincide, and that the territory and the effective jurisdiction of the nation ought to extend to the whole of the national home.  Patently the nation is divided at the moment, and a law passed by the Legislature in the greater part of the nation is not able to be put into execution.  But that does not prevent us making definitely the claim on behalf of the nation, so that there would be no ambiguity. The name of the State is set down as Eire.  In English, if you wanted to say it was Ireland, there would be a certain amount of confusion between the area &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and the nation or State, &ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If France had been an island, with a better defined boundary than it had, and if what was obviously a portion of France outside was kept out of the territory, there would be a certain amount of confusion between the State, France, and the territory called France.  As an island we have such well-defined boundaries that the people of the nation and the people of Eire are pretty well confused, and <Col N="1918" /> sometimes not kept separate at all. The reason I did not propose to use definitely the name &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the name of the State was to bring out the difference between the State and the national territory and the national home of the whole island.  It is easy to make the distinction in Irish.  In Irish you can take Stát na hEireann or Oileán na hEireann or Tír na hEireann.  In the same way, in English, if you want to distinguish between &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Island,&rdquo; you could talk of the Island of Ireland and of the State of Ireland.  If we were to accept Ireland as the equivalent of Eire in this document, wherever the name occurs, unless otherwise stated it would have to refer to the State and not to the territory.  This is a document about a State.  We only mentioned territory in Articles 2 and 3. Throughout the whole document we are talking of the State.  Whenever the word Eire occurs, it refers to the State unless otherwise indicated by some explicit word to the contrary.</P>
    <P>When we say &ldquo;We, the people of Ireland,&rdquo; surely that means the people of the State, &lsquo;and can only mean the people of the State effectively able to make themselves heard.  In the Preamble &ldquo;We, the people of Eire,&rdquo; means &ldquo;We, the people of the State,&rdquo; the effective part of the State talking, because no other part of the State will have its views heard.  Similarly, in the claim indicated in the text, we say that we would have the moral right to exercise jurisdiction but that we are prevented at the moment from doing so.  I do not see anything confusing about this, bearing in mind that this document is about the State and that &ldquo;territory&rdquo; does not occur except in Articles 1 and 2.  When you define the name of the State as Eire or as Ireland every time it occurs in this document, except when put otherwise, it refers to the State.  The Deputy talked about plurality, about &ldquo;We,&rdquo; the law-making power, and about the people having no law-making power.  That is topsyturvydom absolutely.  Who designated and gave us the right? Who indicated that individuals sitting on these benches were to exercise authority?  Who indicated that we are <Col N="1919" /> the particular individuals to do it? Clearly the people, and the people are capable of doing so unless they set up some other authority to do it.  They are capable, and have authority to frame a Constitution, and to indicate the form of the State, as well as the particular individuals who shall exercise authority.</P>
    <P>I do not care what theory you have, the donation theory or the designation theory, but in either case we individuals have been selected by the people&mdash;not selected directly as if this power came directly from Almighty God; but the same class of people, the voters, not the whole community, are selecting us, designating us as the people who shall have this authority for making legislation.  The very same people who designate us are themselves this time, primarily and directly and immediately, as is their right, going to enact this Constitution.  I cannot see how the Deputy is getting confused in his mind about this matter, about the meaning of Eire as it occurs in this text.  In this document, if Eire ever occurs and means anything other than the State, if it means the territory, the island, to save ambiguity you would have Oiléan Eireann or Tír na hEireann or something of that sort. Oiléan Eireann would probably be better, as Tír na hEireann would possibly mean the territory of the State. You will have to put in some word to indicate it.  Without any further qualification in it, it means the State. Where we say &ldquo;the people of Eire,&rdquo; we mean &ldquo;we, the people of the State.&rdquo;  As regards the second matter, it is a confusion I cannot understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have got it a little clearer.  The President says: &ldquo;How do we come to be here; who put us here?&rdquo; Because the Government got a majority of the votes cast, and because the positive law of this country says that under these conditions power goes to such a body of men.  There is no eternal law, no natural law, which says that that minority in this country which voted for Fianna Fáil, automatically or necessary, by natural law, conveys <Col N="1920" /> authority to them.  That is only the framework of our positive law.  Anyway what I want to get clear is this. I do not want to go into the Irish text, but I think it is a pity the President did not explain the situation to his Irish translators.  He says that everywhere the word Eire appears in this text it means what he calls the State.  But in the Irish text I find Muinntear na hEireann.  Why did not the President make it clear to his Irish translators that the word Eire did not mean the geographical entity?</P>

      <P>You have Oileán na <Col N="1921" /> hEireann, and then in the Preamble you have Muinntear na hEireann.  We are told that, somehow or other, it should be obvious that the people, Muinntear na hEireann there refers to a different entity from Oileán na hEireann in Article 2.  The President marvels at my lack of clarity.  He cannot see why anybody can make any statement about what is so patent and obvious.  He also says here: &ldquo;We, the people of Eire, ... adopt and give to ourselves&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The President talked about the claim being made to the right to legislate for any part of the country.  But what is proposed here is that the people in that area known as the Irish Free State are now claiming to legislate and to give themselves, that is, to themselves in the area of the Irish Free State, a Constitution.  There is not one man here, barring the President, who would have the effrontery to say that, reading that Preamble, you necessarily and automatically know that the word Eire means the Twenty-Six Counties and the people referred to as ourselves in the last line necessarily excludes the people of the Six Counties.  The thing is so ambiguous that even the President's explanation leaves it ambiguous.</P>
      <P>As the President uses the argument about silence giving consent, I will say that, if this House agrees and understands that what the Preamble says is that, for a certain portion of Ireland, to be arbitrarily and more or less by convention referred to as Ireland or Eire in this document, they propose giving to themselves, that is to say, the people of that area, by a convention for the moment being called Ireland, are giving to themselves this Constitution, I think it is all-important to have that clear.  I cannot even say now that the President has made it clear. I merely ask if I am wrong in saying that we, the people of Eire, the people of what is called the Irish Free State, give to ourselves, that is to us, the people of what is now called the Irish Free State, this Constitution.  That is what I understand by it, and I ask the President to say yes or no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must think I am quite an innocent person. <Col N="1922" /> I have stated that Eire in this document refers to the State, and that State is not a geographical notion.  The territory of the State is one thing, the territory of the nation is another thing; the State is one thing and the nation is another thing.  There are four things. You can have the territory of the State and the territory of the nation&mdash;the home of the nation; the home of the nation being the whole of Ireland.  But when you speak of Muinntear na hEireann, somebody may say there is a division, because up to the present that meant the people of the island of Ireland. But in this document, where Eire is defined as a State notion, Muinntear na hEireann must mean the people of the State, unless it is otherwise made clear.  Wherever there is anything mentioned in this&mdash;and we will have to go over it carefully to make sure that it is so&mdash;where Eire would mean anything but the State, we must make it quite clear that it means something other than the State. The State until reintegration had taken place would not be co-terminous, as far as its effective jurisdiction is concerned, with the island.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the territory of the State, that is the effective part of the territory, would not be the same as the Island; and if you say Oilean na h-Eireann before the integration takes place, the portion left is not Oilean na h-Eireann at all.  Therefore, there could be no ambiguity about it. Muintir na h-Eireann could have ambiguity about it.  As Eire formerly meant the whole Island, it might possibly now mean, apart from this definition, the people of Ireland.  Consequently it is necessary to bear in mind that Eire is defined here as the State.</P>

      <P>But what is the State?  We are told that the State <Col N="1923" /> is Eire and Eire is the State.  It happens that a part of France, a place called Llivia in the North of Spain and which once belonged to Spain is now part of France.  If you look to the North of the Pyrenees you will find this little place called Llivia.  When the Government of France refer to France they do not refer to France including Llivia.  Here in this Draft the President is making &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; mean one thing one time and another thing another time.  We read in the Preamble &ldquo;We the people of Eire&rdquo; give to ourselves this Constitution.  To whom are we giving the Constitution? I asked the President what was &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; and what was the &ldquo;State&rdquo; and he read out a long involved statement that was meant as &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  Now if I say the President meant &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in that reply I will be accused by him later of having misrepresented him.</P>

      <P>In line 10, after the word &ldquo;Nation,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Remembering, too, that nearly one-quarter of our people are united by ties of blood, tradition and sentiment with Great Britain; remembering the part played by our forefathers both of Gaelic and of British stock in founding and developing the British Commonwealth, and by our kith and kin to-day in guiding its destinies; remembering the security given by membership of that Commonwealth against attacks upon our independence from any quarter; remembering the long agony of Irish history due not solely to foreign oppression, but also to conflict of ideals and loyalties among Irishmen; and earnestly desiring to enable our country to grow to its full stature by conciliating our various traditions and aspirations so as to <Col N="1924" /> fuse them into one national consciousness and to attain that measure of unity in heart and mind which makes a nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to this amendment, I was anxious to ascertain whether &ldquo;we, the people of Eire,&rdquo; speak merely for the Irish Free State or for the whole country.  The President has told us that we speak on behalf of the whole nation.  That fact makes still more appropriate the insertion of the words that I desire to see added to the Preamble.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that there is an attempt made in the Preamble to recite the considerations which should be predominant in our minds when framing a Constitution like this.  My contention is that the draftsman of the Preamble left out some of the most important.  Therefore, I propose, in addition to what is stated in the Preamble: &ldquo;Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our nation&rdquo;, to add the words in the amendment.</P>
    <P>If those words were in the Preamble this Constitution would really be a step on the road to doing away with Partition.  In that case I venture to say that nobody who meant what he said in the Preamble would reject the other amendment I proposed, declaring ourselves free and equal members of the Commonwealth of Nations and acknowledging King George VI as King of Ireland, so long as we remain members of the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I maintain that it is a mockery to produce a statement of the motives that are in our minds at the head of this document which claims to be a milestone of the utmost importance on the road to national unity and to leave out the considerations that are included in my amendment.  I hope the President will accept it.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper, Nos. 1 to 4 inclusive, No. 2 to be taken in its appropriate place.

      <P>I would strongly appeal against any idea of sitting up to midnight.  The matters with which we have to deal are important, and I <Col N="1804" /> think we ought to try to deal with them efficiently.  They cannot be dealt with efficiently if we sit continuously from 10.30 a.m. until midnight.  I would strongly suggest that we should not sit later than 4 o'clock, and I would appeal to the Minister to make it definite that we shall not sit later than that hour.</P>
