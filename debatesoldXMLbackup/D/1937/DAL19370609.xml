      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) the date upon which the clearance order in respect of the 104 recently occupied houses in Listowel was made by the Listowel Urban Council; (2) the date upon which the Local Government inquiry into the clearance order was held; (3) the date upon which the clearance order was signed by the Minister, and (4) the date upon which the engineer's final certificate was given in respect of the houses; if he will state the reason for the delay which occured between the making of the clearance order by the urban council, and the date of the Minister's ratification; and if he will state the date upon which the engineer's final certificate in respect of them was issued.</P>

      <P>The replies are as follows:&mdash;(1) 18th September, 1934; (2) 15th January, 1935, to 22nd January, 1935; (3) 19 September, 1935; (4) 3rd May, 1937.  No avoidable delay occurred in my Department between the making of the clearance order and the confirmation thereof. The confirmation order was not issued owing to the legal proceedings in connection with the constitution of the council.  The engineer's final certificate was given on 3rd May, 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why the legal proceedings held up the action of the Department in this particular matter, seeing that his Department had, it was alleged, no doubt as to the legality of the position.  May I call his attention <Col N="98" /> to the fact that he has attributed the delay of three years exclusively to local causes&mdash;at least that is the implication in his speech at Listowel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no doubt how the delay occured.  The confirmation order was held up owing to the question of the legality of the council&mdash;the question of the council's work&mdash;having been raised in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When was that made legal by the Dáil?  My point is this: the Minister signed the order in September, 1935.  At that date was the legality of the council established by the courts?  Was not the question still before the courts?  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that the question of the legality of the council's position cannot be adduced as the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That and the secondary question that was raised&mdash; the council challenging the loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to direct his attention to this: that that question was not decided before the Minister appended his signature; and that, therefore, that cannot be adduced as the reason of the delay, because, if so, it would have delayed the Minister's signature much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The two questions were closely allied, as the Deputy knows&mdash;the question of the legality of the council and, therefore, arising out of that, the question of the loans. These two were closely allied, and the question of the loans, if you like, was subsidiary to the other question, but it was an important issue and it had to be decided by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister acted before there was a decision by the court.  Perhaps it might be well to point out that the Minister took the occasion of that reception for him, or rather that funeral march, at Listowel, to make certain charges against the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make charges against the local people, but against certain members of the local <Col N="99" /> council, and they were charges that were well founded.  With regard to that occasion, I hope that when the Deputy visits Listowel, he will get as good a reception as I got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, all I can say is that if that kind of reception is sufficient to satisfy the present Government, they have fallen very low in their aspirations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the reason for the delay in granting the necessary confirmation of the compulsory purchase order made by the Sligo Board of Health for the purchase of suitable land and the provision of cottages in Ballymote, and if he is aware of the terms of the resolution passed by the said board at a meeting on 1st June last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>A compulsory purchase order made by a local authority is not confirmed without full investigation. The acquisition of the site at Ballymote included in the order of the board of health on the 15th December, 1936, was objected to partly on grounds of its unsuitability and partly on other grounds.  The inspector who held the public local inquiry on the 9th March, 1937, reported that the site was unsuitable. There has been no avoidable delay.  I am aware of the terms of the resolution adopted by the board of health on 1st instant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJRogers" hpid="Mr. Rogers Mr. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, perhaps I might be permitted to quote the terms of a resolution that was passed at a meeting of the Sligo Board of Health on the 1st June, of this year.  The resolution reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That this board of health desires to bring to the notice of the Minister for Local Government the following facts in connection with our housing schemes.  We made a compulsory purchase order on the 15th December, for the acquisition of sites at Ballysadare, Rosses Point and Ballymote. Not till the month of March did the <Col N="100" /> Department move in the matter when it ordered a public sworn inquiry. This was duly held, and since meeting after meeting, we have been expecting a decision without avail.  In these circumstances we disclaim all responsibility for the backward condition of housing in County Sligo.  Copy of this resolution to be sent to the housing board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of that resolution, will the Minister tell me here, as a member of the Sligo Board of Health, whether or not it is our fault that that housing scheme has been held up.  We have done our best to get through with housing in Ballymote for the last five years, and still we cannot get ahead because the scheme is held up by the Local Government Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, Sir, I should like to know from the Minister what he considers to be a reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out investigations with regard to a compulsory purchase scheme.  The Minister made a rather sweeping allegation that, in his opinion, the Sligo Board of Health is not doing its duty in regard to the provision of housing for the working classes there.  Does the Minister consider that the withholding of confirmation of a compulsory purchase order for six months is facilitating county boards of health in carrying out their obligations under the Housing Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It might happen that six months would be necessary when a question of a compulsory purchase order is being investigated. As the two Deputies from Sligo have raised this question, I do want to say again here that the Sligo Board of Health has not done its duty in this matter, and, particularly, it has not done its duty in regard to Ballymote.  Deputy Rogers read a resolution in which he says that he, as one member of that board, disclaims responsibility.  What were they doing from August 1932 up to the 15th December, 1936, about housing in Ballymote?  That is a period of four years, and yet nothing was done.  On <Col N="101" /> the 15th December, 1936, they did adopt the compulsory purchase scheme with regard to one field, and, according to my inspector, half of that field is a swamp, and the people of that town have petitioned the inspector at that inquiry, and have also petitioned me, begging me not to sanction that site, as it is an unsuitable site.  I think that the Deputy himself, at the board of health, disagreed with the site and said that it was not suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJRogers" hpid="Mr. Rogers Mr. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I take it, the Deputy is pressing me to agree with that resolution, although he himself said that the site was unsuitable and dissented from the resolution adopted. I have the dates here, and, if the Deputies wish, I shall read out for them the particulars of the cause of delay.  The following note refers specially to the proposal in relation to Ballymote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board of health made a compulsory purchase order on 15th December, 1936, for the acquisition of 3 acres 0 roods 16 perches in Ballymote for the erection of 28 houses. Objection was made by the owner, Mr. Hogg, to the acquisition of the site on the grounds that (1) the property proposed to be acquired was portion of a farm containing about six acres; (2) one of his sources of livelihood was derived from the sale of milk in the town of Ballymote from cows kept on his farm, and the proposed acquisition would deprive him of same; (3) the residue of the farm, on which his dwelling-house is situate, would be considerably reduced in value and rendered valueless to him for the requirements of his occupation; (4) the lands included in the order would not be suitable lands for development in the manner proposed; (5) there were other lands more suitable for the purposes required in the immediate neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A memorial from the prospective tenants was received in the Department objecting on the grounds that (1) Mr. Hogg was a local business man owning two establishments in <Col N="102" /> the town and was a decided local acquisition; (2) the acquisition of the site would be a serious handicap to him as a farmer and a business man; (3) the site was covered to the extent of nearly one-half by an overflow from a mill-race; (4) the mill-race would have to be deepened and the field drained, and this would be too expensive; (5) there were other sites about the town which might be investigated which were eminently suitable and could be obtained.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board's engineer stated that, approximately, one-third of an acre of the site was inclined to be wet; and the Department's inspector, who held the public local inquiry as to the propriety of confirming the order, reported that the site was unsuitable; that the acquisition of the site would seriously disturb Mr. Hogg's business; that the north-west end of the field was swampy and the cost of drainage would be high; and that a deputation of prospective tenants attending the inquiry protested against the erection of cottages on the site.  It is proposed to ask the board of health to take immediate steps to acquire an alternative site.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we come to the dates.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following gives the relevant dates concerning the steps taken in the Department to deal with the order: The order was received in the Department on 21st December, 1936. The latest date for receiving objections was 6th January, 1937.  The inspector to hold the inquiry was designated on the 13th January, and he fixed the date of the local inquiry as 9th March, 1937.  Owing to prior arrangements it was not possible to fix an earlier date.  The inspector's report was received on 22nd April. The Legal Department were instructed on 19th May to prepare confirming order excluding the site at Ballymote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I think that should show that no avoidable delay took place so far as the Department of Local Government was concerned, and the board of health had from the time the Housing Act was passed in August, 1932, up to <Col N="103" /> the 15th December, 1936, before they took any action in Ballymote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must be aware&mdash;in fact, the report he has read out admits as much&mdash;that the delay there was due to a disagreement between his own engineering inspector and the consulting engineer of the board of health?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was due entirely to a disagreement about the question of unsuitable sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is my information. Secondly, the Minister must also be aware, if he gets proper information from his officials, that a full and complete housing scheme is ready for Ballymote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. There is no full and complete housing scheme ready for Ballymote.  The Deputy's colleague, who is a member of the board of health&mdash;I do not think the Deputy is&mdash;agrees with the Department that it is a most unsuitable site and the delay occurred because an unsuitable site was selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tries to put the blame on the board of health. I want to put it on the right shoulders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact, then, that the delay was entirely due to the Minister's own engineering inspector?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state how many acres of land were divided by the Irish Land Commission in County Clare during the year 1936; how many allottees were put into possession; how many acres of land are now in process of acquisition and distribution by the Irish Land Commission in County Clare, and if he can make an estimate of the total acreage still available for acquisition and distribution and the number of applications for houses made by allottees during 1936 in County Clare, and the number of houses erected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the calendar year 1936, 3,200 acres of untenanted land were divided by the Land Commission in County Clare among 325 allottees.  At the present time, approximately 400 acres of acquired lands are in hands for division in the county and definite proceedings for acquisition (that is to say, by way of offers to purchase or gazetting for acquisition or resumption or exchange of holdings) are in progress in respect of some 4,600 acres of untenanted <Col N="105" /> land; and in addition some 22,000 acres have been inspected or are in course of inspection with a view to ascertaining their suitability for acquisition. It is impracticable at present to make any reliable estimate of the total acreage which may ultimately be available for acquisition and distribution. As regards housing, statistics for the calendar year 1936 are not readily available, but in the financial year ended 31st March, 1937, the number of new dwellinghouses for which assistance was sanctioned by the Land Commission in County Clare numbered 55 and, in addition, sanctions were made for the repair of five houses and for assistance towards building four houses included in schemes of the Local Government Department.  These figures include houses for allottees of untenanted land before and after allotment.</P>

      <P>During the European war, crochet buttons were made at Corrotigue to meet the demands caused by the shortage of <Col N="107" /> materials for ordinary buttons.  Considerable employment was afforded, but on the termination of the war the demand for crochet buttons ceased, and the class reverted to the making of crochet jumpers, hair nets and caps. The demand for these articles ceased over ten years ago, until at one stage there were only two workers employed at Corrotigue.  In the year 1932 the centre was reorganised by the Department as a machine-knitting centre, since when the wages earned by the workers in each year exceeded any year since 1924.  The number of workers employed at the centre at present is 19.  Lace-making is not now carried out at any of the centres conducted by the Department, and the Department is satisfied that the conditions of the market are such that it would not be justified in reintroducing lace and crochet-making at the Corrotigue centre.  The development of the centre as a machine-knitting centre, however, is being fostered, and continuous work is being given to the workers.</P>

For, a Chinn Comhairle&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Frank Fahy will welcome this assurance&mdash;in County Galway the age of chivalry is not dead or, perhaps, it has been revived by the discussion of Article 41 of the Bunreacht and the well-known gallantry of Deputy Stephen Jordan and his comrades&mdash; in order to demonstrate to the world that they will stand for no lowering of the status of women &mdash; has decreed that on this auspicious occasion woman shall be given not only her traditional right to the last word but the first word.  I speak it now.  <i>Floreat Galvia</i>! Cathair na Gaillimhe abú!</P>
      <P>It may, perhaps, seem strange to the House that the voice which welcomes the restoration of the ancient civic dignity of Galway should yet be so strongly tinged with the Doric accents of the North.  But, as a student of Irish history you will remember, as in olden times the attractiveness of Irish life made the Norman invaders, like Deputy Stephen Jordan's forebears, &ldquo;<i>Hiberniores Hibernicis ipsis</i>,&rdquo;&ldquo;more Irish than the Irish themselves,&rdquo; so the charms of Galway, experienced through 25 happy years, have made a woman, born in one of the severed counties, feel entitled to describe herself as &ldquo;<i>Galviensior Galviensibus ipsis</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;more Galwegian than the Galwegians themselves&rdquo;&mdash;and so, perhaps, the choice of my colleagues in making me their spokesman&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;man&rdquo;&mdash;is not so unhappily directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, Galway people, have the good habit of looking backward as well as forward and this habit has given us that sense of direction, that justness of focus, that clarity of vision, which we find so useful while we take our bearings for the future from the study of the present Bill and adjust our conception of the reborn City of Galway&mdash;<Col N="110" /> the shining city of to-morrow&mdash;with our memories of the beloved and romantic Galway City of the past.  This habit is ingrained in us as we take our daily walks through Galway streets.  There we see how modern progress&mdash;well in evidence in the up-to-date business premises of Galway merchants&mdash;allies itself, without conflict, with the stately evidences of the past.  Lynch's Castle, that lovely old mansion, one of the most perfect gems of the 17th century architecture, still stands&mdash;clothed again in the beauty for which it was once famous, by the restoration of an architect of genius.  But instead of being a &ldquo;museum piece,&rdquo; it houses a thriving branch of an up-to-date and progressive banking establishment, the Munster and Leinster Bank.  Through the stately portals of the Browne Doorway, now happily preserved as one of the entrances to Eyre Square, we see, not only the figure of a Galway poet immortalised in Irish limestone by the genius of Albert Power, but the beautiful cut stone facade of a splendid modern hotel, the Great Southern.</P>
    <P>The University College, Galway, set in the loveliness of chestnut trees in blossom and copper beeches, not only nurtures the rising generation of our professional and public men and women, and gives them that up-to-date &mdash;because Irish Ireland&mdash;education which will fit them to play great parts in the Ireland of the future, but it counts among the treasures of its library the old Municipal Records, which tell the story of Galway's civic past, and the old 17th century map, which shows it in all its beauty.  What a glorious old city it must have been, and how its daughters and sons must have loved it! The yearning cry of one of them, exiled by the Cromwellians from the familiar streets, still rings out to us across the centuries from the panegyric of his native city enshrined in Archdeacon's Lynch's <i>Life of Doctor Kirwan.</i>&ldquo;Sentinelled by saints&rdquo; it rises before us evoked by his words and the delineation of the old map.  Here are his words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the western shores of Ireland stand the renowned City of Galway, the metropolis of Connaught, which, a <Col N="111" /> short time ago, was famed for the number of its citizens, and the wealth and enterprise of its merchants. This city was compassed by walls of green marble, flanked with many towers.  Within its precincts were mansions of the same green marble, several storeys high, and streets and squares of fine proportions elegantly adorned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The walls of green marble, which rise so vividly before the spirit eyes of Archdeacon Lynch in his St. Malo exile, have for the most part fallen down.  Their beauty in the remnants which remain is in &ldquo;the Lion's Tower&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Spanish Arch,&rdquo; and is sadly tarnished with the grime of centuries.  For my part, I cannot find it in my heart to lament that these walls have fallen, for through the breaches have entered not the Cromwellians but the Irish people; Gael and Gáll, O'Flaherty and Lynch, O'Connor and Burke, can now sit as brothers by the same council table, and the &ldquo;City of the Tribes&rdquo; will evolve, in the modern City of Galway, into the Capital of Irish Ireland.  It is in this capacity that its future is assured.</P>
    <P>Let us then, who love Galway, and greet with affectionate pride this auspicious event in her history, pledge ourselves to further that conception of Galway's rôle.  Let us determine that everything we shall do will work in that direction.  When our new harbour is complete, let us see to it that the thousands of visitors we hope to welcome on its thronged docks will find themselves landing not in what Eoin MacNeill once described as a &ldquo;shabby backyard of the British Empire&rdquo; but in a live, modern hustling and progressive Irish city.  Let the Irish tongue be the first sound that greets their ears.  Let the Galway people continue to be their Irish selves, courteous, cordial and natural.  Let our streets be kept with civic dignity and pride; let our homes and gardens show the traditional house pride, competence, and taste of the Irish Bean a Tighe. Let our University College be a bright centre of Gaelic culture.  Thus will the future of Galway be secured.  Mindful <Col N="112" /> of her great past, let Galway look forward to a still greater future; let her lead an Ireland united once more &ldquo;from Fair Head in Antrim to Mizzen Head in Cork&rdquo; towards the same future.  <i>Floreat Galvia</i>!</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for expenditure in respect of Public Buildings; for the Maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; for the Execution and Maintenance of Drainage Works; and for sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for £10 now before the Dáil arises out of a bequest made in a will dated 20th April, 1932, by Mrs. Margaret Pearse, who bequeathed St. Enda's, Rathfarnham, to the State</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to be kept as a memorial for her two sons, Patrick and William, the house and grounds to be cared for properly and kept in good order, and not to be used for a school or university of any sort whatever but purely as a memorial.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bequest was subject to a life interest in the property by her <Col N="113" /> daughter, Miss Margaret Pearse.  It is felt that there would be a general public desire that the State should accept this bequest on behalf of the nation, when in the course of time a decision would have to be taken in regard to that.  In the meantime, however, the property of St. Enda's is not in good repair.  A suitable sum of money must be spent to enable repairs to be carried out to the buildings, to preserve them from further deterioration until the time when the State comes into the full possession of the property.  The property is a very valuable one.  The buildings cover three quarters of an acre, and they are situated in a compact demesne of over 40 acres in extent.  Unfortunately, also, the net value of the estate of the late Mrs. Margaret Pearse amounted only to £2,630, and if the other dispositions in her will were to be given effect to it would have been necessary either to dispose of St. Enda's, or part of the Cullenswood property, or else to let the property at Terenure at present occupied by Miss Mary Bridget Pearse, or to sell the furniture at St. Enda's, a large part of which is of historic interest.  In order to prevent the dispersal of this property, the executrix of the will, has out of her own pocket, made provision to discharge a considerable part of the debts of the estate.  The amount which would properly fall due to her in order to recoup her for that expenditure has not yet been definitely settled, but it is not anticipated to exceed the sum of £600 which is provided for the purpose of that recoupment under sub-head M of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>That is so.  For example, in the case of the next amendment, there will be an amendment in the Irish text to correspond with it.

That was what I was working on and what I thought was understood.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how we stand upon that.  I thought that suggestion was approved by the House.  I am not doing this for the purpose of obstruction and will state my objection.  I understand this House is solemnly to go through and pass each section of the Irish text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind was this: That as practically every Deputy was able to follow the discussion in English, and follow the English text closely, we should deal with the amendments in the English language and get finished with them, until we have what I might call the complete text in final form.  When we have arrived at that stage, the House will be presented with an Irish text, supposed to be an equivalent.  The equivalent will be tested by the House. There are on both sides of the House Deputies who are able to follow closely the English and the Irish texts and to see that the intention of the House is carried out in the English text and in the Irish text.  For that purpose, it would be advisable, as the Deputy mentioned, to go through each text to see that the meaning is clear and that, as far as possible they would be precisely the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that on each section of the Irish text the question that will be put to the House is: &ldquo;That this section stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;  I will tell you my objection to that procedure.  I gather that there might be ten or a dozen Deputies capable of expressing an opinion upon that question and not more.  I should say, roughly speaking, there would be about half-a-dozen Deputies on each side of the House, and that would mean that about 90 per cent. of the House would solemnly pass a series of sections which they did not understand. To do that solemnly would, to a certain extent, make a farce of the proceeding; that we should decide to pass something we did not understand and accept the verdict of an informal committee of six or seven.  That would be abdicating our functions as Deputies. It might be better if a committee of the type suggested by the President <Col N="117" /> was appointed to report to the House and then let the House pass some resolution as to the text.  I would object solemnly to pass a thing we did not understand or to the passing of some other resolution that it is the correct text.  We could pass a resolution, if it satisfies the President, that the Irish translation is the official text, but I do not think it is proper that the House should solemnly pass a series of sections that it does not and cannot understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone must be obliged for the point in Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks, that it is difficult, when a large section of the House is not sufficiently acquainted with the Irish language to be able definitely to express their own individual judgment on each Article.  At the same time, I think we should make the Irish language the basic text.  As Deputies know, we have sometimes to take authority for a number of things.  We have to act.  We appoint special committees very often and act on the report of these committees, trusting to their good faith.  It may be argued that this would be carrying that principle further than would ordinarily be justified, and that objections might be raised to it on that account.  I think we ought, if we are serious about trying to restore the Irish language to its fundamental position, in the case of a text like this make the Irish text the fundamental text. We can assure ourselves either by getting the opinions of scholars or by a <Col N="118" /> committee as the Deputy suggested. We can get reasonable assurance as to the text.</P>
      <P>Remember, what is going to happen in practice will be that for a considerable period I have no doubt the English text will be taken as conveying the sense of the Irish text&mdash;for example in the case of judges who do not know Irish&mdash;and it is only when there is a dispute as to the fundamental meaning that there will be ultimate reference to the Irish text. At an early stage I saw that difficulty and I suggested to the House that we should wait until we had the complete English text and then take whatever steps were considered best to get over the final difficulty.  As to passing it section by section, I do not know that you need formally go through the act of passing the section, but simply approving of it if you like. If we want to deal with this in detail I suppose it simply means that we, at the end of each section, say, &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; The question would seem to me to be, &ldquo;Are you satisfied that that section does represent the intentions of the House as shown in the English text?&rdquo; That would rather approximate to the question that should be put at the end of the section. If, on the other hand, there is a strong view in the House that we ought to proceed by some other course, I am open, naturally, to consider it, because the difficulty is a real, genuine difficulty and everyone must appreciate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most of us appreciate that there is no sensible way out of the farcical situation created by the decision to make the Irish text the basic text.  The Gaelic League have got their pound of flesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Gaelic League.  Even if there was no Gaelic League, as there is a policy agreed upon generally by the country that we do want to try to bring back the Irish language to its proper position as the spoken language of the people, assuming we are serious about it, here is an opportunity&mdash;we are talking about putting the names of streets in Irish and doing all sorts of things in Irish&mdash;to <Col N="119" /> put the Irish text in its primary position and I cannot see how we can do that except by this means.  I think Deputy MacDermot will admit that there are a number of things we pass in this House, things of which we individually have not convinced ourselves absolutely; we are depending very largely upon expert reports given to us, information given to us in various ways.  There is the old example of the earth being round.  The few of us who had the opportunity of travelling round it were pretty well satisfied it is so.  So that in this case I do not think we will be stretching that principle abnormally far; perhaps I should not say abnormally, because we are stretching it a little beyond what is normal; but we are not extravagantly stretching it.  I am sure that the Opposition as a Party can quite well satisfy themselves that the Irish text does correspond to the English text as far as two languages can ever really correspond one to the other. Similarly, on this side of the House, we are able to satisfy ourselves, and I think the Labour Party, too, if they want to approach it from that point of view, can satisfy themselves as a Party that that is so.  It is a difficulty I see no way out of but this, either by means of an informal committee of members or by reference to experts.  If the Deputy wants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 8, Article 9, to delete Section I and substitute therefor the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;1º.  On the coming into operation of this Constitution any person who was a citizen of Saorstát Eireann immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution shall become and be a citizen of Ireland.</P>

      <P>3º.  No person may be excluded from Irish citizenship by reason of the sex of such person.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this is to try to meet some of the criticism levelled at the section as it stood.  I have tried to get over the difficulty in connection with this matter by trying to define the body of citizens but, as I pointed out already, that could not be easily done in the present circumstances; and the best we can do, to try and get a comprehensive catalogue at the moment, is to take over the existing position.  That is the intention in the first part.  The third sub-section is to meet the point raised by Deputy Mrs. Redmond's amendment, and I think it meets the point fully.  There was a point about religion and class in Deputy Mrs. Redmond's original amendment, but I pointed out the difficulty I have with the word &ldquo;class.&rdquo; I dislike seeing it anywhere in the Constitution, because I think it is too difficult to define.  With regard to religion, we have met that by another amendment in which to make it quite clear we have separated the phrase about endowment of religion and made another one in which we make it quite clear that there is to be no discrimination and there are to be no disabilities imposed on the ground of religion. That will cover this as well.</P>

The question is that you have a certain body of citizens at the moment.  You want to take that body over.  It is really a question of defining what class, so that you may know who are citizens and who are not at the moment.  It is not a question of saying that in future such-and-such <Col N="122" /> shall be citizens.  It is simply a question of taking over a class.</P>

      <P>There is a question which I would like to put to the President.  I do not know whether it is relevant.  The case I have in mind is where an English woman or a French woman married a man domiciled in Ireland, say, in 1917.  He got killed or died in 1920.  Is his widow a citizen of this State or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be able to answer that.  I would have to be accurate about it.  The Citizenship Act is one which takes over the body of citizens in Article 3.  There <Col N="123" /> are provisions made to deal with the situation that has arisen since 1923. There are certain marriage provisions in which, under certain circumstances, a foreign woman married to an Irishman can become, in a short period, a citizen.</P>

      <P>The President may remember there have been some very noteworthy cases in history, cases that have been extremely awkward.  There have been cases of men in high positions, quite as high as the President of this State.  There was a case of George III of England and Fredrick of Prussia who had the habit of getting temporarily insane. They did not get permanently insane. Is there any method provided in the Constitution for such a case?  You have a method of dealing with permanent incapacity.

      <P>In one of the Articles provision is being made by which if the President fails to perform the duties which he has been performing, these duties would be performed in his stead.  That does not meet the case where there would be discretion on the part of the President. But as regards that discretion, if he were temporarily incapacitated in the sense that Deputy O'Sullivan has mentioned, it would seem that his discretion would not be normal discretion.</P>

      <P>It is not beyond the wit of man to deal with this, but there is no way in which we can determine that here.  Just at the moment when he is deciding whether he will or will not give to the Taoiseach dissolution, there may be some aberration of one kind or another affecting his judgment.  It may be of a physical character and it may affect him completely.  You cannot get down to that and determine it.</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of a man being incapacitated for <Col N="127" /> six months.  If a man, for instance, is held to be of unsound mind during that period, there would be action by the Government to declare him permanently incapacitated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, in a case of temporary incapacity the commission will act.  The only question that we cannot satisfactorily determine is when his incapacity is of such a character that he cannot perform the act that is necessary.  You cannot say that he has failed or is incapable of actually performing the act.  If he is ill or unable to perform his functions, they can be performed for him.  There is a certain difficulty in the matter.  I take it that Deputy O'Sullivan was concerned with the case where a man would be mentally deranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless he was insisting, notwithstanding advice given to him by doctors and others, on performing these functions, I do not think you would have to declare him permanently incapacitated.  His work would be done for him over a period by the commission.  You cannot pursue this thing down to the point of saying that if a man is subject to momentary delusions or fits he should be permanently incapacitated.  It may be that just at the moment he is performing a vital function he gets deranged and he would not perform that function in the same way as if he were in his normal health.  I think every ordinary thing is covered here.</P>

      <P>The position is that if you leave these words in there without any qualification it would be open to the Legislature practically to exclude individuals or a class of individuals by legislation. Without these words it is safer in the case of a single person going for election before the people as a whole. There is little fear that any person will go forward or would have the slightest chance of election if he is of the type that would ordinarily be declared incapable by law; that is, a bankrupt or a person who was suffering imprisonment or who was guilty of corrupt practices or something of that kind.  There was a long list, I think, in a previous amendment, indicating the type of disability.  What I said in regard to that amendment holds here.</P>

      <P>It seems to be very unsatisfactory.  There are limitations upon persons who get elected to the Dáil and there are limitations on the classes who can hold office in the State.  This is socially the most important post in the State and politically it is a position carrying with it great power and it seems to me that there certainly ought to be some limitation on the class of persons who should fill that position.  It should not be open to any undesirable person to hold that position or be a candidate.</P>

I think that is a sufficient safeguard that you will not have people who would be unworthy of holding office, going forward for election. In any case this is an election by the people as a whole and the people will be able to judge.

      <P>I doubt very much if the wording of amendment No. 10 is sufficient.  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, line 3, Article 12, Section 4, sub-section 2º, paragraph i., to delete the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;either.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section sets out &ldquo;not less than 20 persons each of whom is at the time a member of one House.&rdquo;  It is possible to strain that to mean that the whole of the 20 would have to be from one House.  The difficulty is whether the words &ldquo;each of whom&rdquo; are suitable. It is quite clear that what is wanted to be expressed is that as regards the 20 persons who will nominate, each particular one of them, that you could read after his name &ldquo;he is a member either of the Seanad or of the Dáil.&rdquo;  I think that even with the word &ldquo;either,&rdquo; you could possibly strain it into the meaning suggested by Deputy Donnelly.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Each of whom&rdquo; may go with the class.  At first sight, this looks all right and a person reading it ordinarily and knowing what is at the bottom of it will read it all right, but if you get into your head the idea that it might mean that when you have 20 persons down on the list they must all belong to the same House, what it conveys is that each one of the 20 will be a member of the same House.</P>

      <P>My advice is that, in the ordinary way, the first form was right.  I believe that the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; does not improve it, and consequently, I will not move the amendment.  Whatever difficulty there is, if there is a difficulty, I <Col N="132" /> think it is not remedied by this proposed amendment, so I do not propose to move it.  So far as the drafting is concerned, I think those who drafted this particular Article are satisfied that it does express the meaning, and that each one of the nominators would say, after his name, that he is a member of the Dáil or Seanad and the mixing up of these does not matter.  It means that you can mix them up and all you want is that each nominator should be able to say, of himself, that he is a member either of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; is a slight improvement upon what existed before, but I think it a great pity that this very cumbersome mode of procedure should be adopted.  If there has to be a trial under this, the result will bring the whole State into complete ridicule and, as well, the verdict given will carry very little weight.  I think the President might very easily have the trial by five members of the Supreme Court just as he substituted five members of the Supreme Court for the Advisory Council dealing with the incapacity of the President.  I think it would be far more satisfactory if there were an ordinary trial by five members of the Supreme Court of a President who was charged with a misdemeanour instead of this very stupid method of impeachment &mdash; entirely antiquated, <Col N="135" /> old fashioned and bound, in effect, to prove unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be right to have the trial before the Supreme Court on a matter of this sort.  It is not a question of law or of the interpretation of law, but something wider in its character.  Why should it be regarded as stupid? After all, the procedure of each House is at its own discretion and if there is a question of investigating a charge, it can by its own procedure arrange the method by which that is to be done.  The use of the word &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; does not necessarily mean that the procedure should be the same as that adopted in the British House of Commons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Several modes of procedure suggest themselves at once. A special committee could be appointed to inquire into the questions of fact and the House could act on their report if it were necessary so to do.  We need hardly deal with the methods by which the investigation would have to be carried out if such a case arose.  You could have either a general procedure designed to cover all possible cases that could be imagined or you could have had <i>ad hoc</i> procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds of the House have to decide the issue.  Each individual has, upon his conscience, to decide whether the President is guilty or not guilty of the offence with which he is charged. That the individual should act on the verdict of some other body &mdash; whether a Committee of this House or not&mdash; without having heard the evidence himself, that he should exercise the <Col N="136" /> judicial function of condemning a man without having heard a single bit of the evidence upon which that man is to be condemned, would appear to me to be a terrible suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it is very unlikely that this provision will ever be used.  My difficulty is to see how the sort of thing we have in mind could be performed by the judicial bench.  We are considering a case in which the President might, in the opinion of almost the entire country or, at any rate, of Parliament, have unfitted himself for his position by scandalous behaviour, which might not be criminal but merely disgraceful.  He might be leading a scandalous life and Parliament might feel that it could no longer tolerate him in that position. If that were the case, I do not see what we could do except adopt some such procedure as is provided here. Though it may not be ideal, it is the best procedure that occurs to one's mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that this would be a scandalous procedure.  If we were charged with the investigation of a particular matter, we could choose a committee which would go into details and furnish a report. That would not mean that any member who wanted to get further information would be debarred from getting it.  It would be necessary to arrange for clearing up further questions which might be raised on the report and for any further examination which might be regarded as desirable.  I do not think that we would be completely washing our hands of the matter.</P>

      <P>Some members of a jury believe the evidence; other members do not.  In a charge against the President of, say, scandalous behaviour, witnesses will be called.  The credibility of these witnesses will probably be challenged by whomsoever is appearing on behalf of the President.  The credibility of the witnesses will probably be the main point.  The President may call other witnesses to contradict the witnesses who have been examined. Whoever is deciding the case will have to weigh up the probability of the stories and the credibility of the persons giving evidence.  You cannot decide upon the statement made by a person unless you have seen him giving evidence.  Nobody reading a newspaper account of a trial or even reading through the whole of the depositions in a criminal case would be in a position to form an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of anybody charged, unless he had himself seen the witnesses in the box and was able to decide from their demeanour whether they were truthful or not.  For the whole House to decide, on the report of a committee that witnesses are, or are not, telling the truth would be completely wrong.  I do not see how any such procedure could be adopted.</P>

There are cases in which the facts would be so obvious that there would be no need for the type of investigation to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney refers.  But we are not prescribing any mode of procedure for the investigation of these charges.  The House will be at liberty to devise, in any special case, a method which will enable it to come to a conscientious conclusion. I think that we can, with safety, <Col N="138" /> leave the matter in that way.  If I were to propose that the procedure should be along certain lines, the views put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would have much weight&mdash;that the only way that Deputies could effectively carry out their functions would be to sit as a jury and listen to the examination.</P>

Can he think of a more unsuitable body to act as a jury in what may be a political case?  A political assembly is the last body that should be asked to investigate a charge against any individual mixed up in politics.  To my mind, that is the principal objection to this proposal.

      <P>We have two questions here, one, the mode of investigation, and the other the question of the final resolution.  Suppose we had divided this procedure into two parts, and said, as I had suggested at one stage, that the charges should be investigated by the Supreme Court and on receipt of a report from the Supreme Court that the House by resolution should act.  In view of a finding by a competent body that the charges had been sustained, would there be anything contrary to natural justice or to right in the House, by resolution, declaring that the person was incapable of holding office?  I do not think so. I can imagine myself, at any rate, as a Deputy of this House, understanding that a certain charge was made against the President, listening to the report and to the finding, and satisfying myself that the investigation had been properly conducted, as well making any further inquiries that I thought necessary, coming to the conclusion that in view of that report the President was no longer fit to carry out the duties. I do not think that there is anything improper in that.  As far as the resolution is concerned, and leaving the investigation aside for the moment, it seems to me that it would be by no means improper for the House, consequent on that report, to pass the resolution. <Col N="140" /> With regard to the investigation, will it be held that according to our text here that the Dáil could not itself set up a body or commission to investigate the charge in detail and get its report?  When the report came along for discussion questions might be asked about it.  It might be sent back for further consideration.  The clause, as it is set out here, does not, I think, preclude that.</P>

      <P>It is by no means clear whether a sub-committee could be appointed by the House to make the investigation.  The words here are &ldquo;shall be investigated by the other House.&rdquo;  The natural interpretation of that would be &ldquo;shall be investigated by the whole House.&rdquo; Let us assume that there could be read into this that the House could investigate by means of a sub-committee, <Col N="141" /> and I question very much if it could, it certainly could not be investigated by anybody else.  There is the sound legal principle <i>delegatus non potest delegare</i>, that is, that a person appointed to do a certain thing cannot appoint somebody else to do his job for him.  Personally, I do not think that the House could appoint a sub-committee to investigate.  Of course, the question may be argued the other way, but I think the investigation would have to be by the whole House.  If the contention that it could be done by a sub-committee is right, at any rate it certainly could not be done by anybody outside.  In that case you cannot then read in with paragraph 7: &ldquo;as a result of an investigation by the House.&rdquo;  The whole House votes, and there must be a two-thirds majority, so that each member of the House has got responsibility for saying &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo;</P>

He would take the report and say: &ldquo;I am reasonably satisfied, in view of the people who have investigated this charge, that, in fact, it has been sustained.&rdquo;  I see no reason why he should not vote that the President was <Col N="142" /> no longer fit for office by reason of the fact that a body of men appointed for the purpose had investigated the charge and found that it had been sustained.  He could arrive at that decision as reasonably and as conscientiously as we can reasonably and conscientiously do most of the things that we have got to do in life.  Each member would have to be the judge of that himself.  At any rate, the final resolution is one which is passed by people who would have got some report on the matter, and who would say: &ldquo;Very well, in view of that report, which we think is a just report, we think the charge against the President has been sustained and that he is no longer fit for office.&rdquo;  At one stage, I thought we might put in &ldquo;shall cause to be investigated,&rdquo; but I do not want to limit the power of direction there.  I think that if you wanted to remove doubts, you would have to put in both phrases.  You would have to say &ldquo;investigate or cause to be investigated.&rdquo;</P>

You will have the High Court asked to mandamus Parliament.  Parliament, having constituted itself a court, you will have the High Court asked to mandamus it; or rather, with regard to the Parliament, it may be a question of <i>quo warranto</i> as to what power <Col N="143" /> it had to appoint a sub-committee. Anyhow, you will have the extraordinary thing of the courts going over the court in Parliament, and you will have a very nice constitutional issue.

      <P>Well, Sir, before we pass from this, I should like to ask whether the Deputies who have been discussing this matter from the opposite benches have any difficulty: in other words, supposing we are able to meet their suggestions with regard to the words proposed to be inserted by Deputies MacDermot and Fitzgerald-Kenney, will there be any further difficulty in connection with Section 7?  As I see it, there will be two other methods that might be regarded as alternative to this procedure.  One would be to let the investigation be by the Supreme Court.  I dislike that by itself.  I think that, if judgment is to be pronounced on the President, it ought to be by the people's representatives &mdash;the people who have a direct and definite responsibility and who, in the periods between elections, do represent the people and their authority. Now, that is one procedure &mdash; the Supreme Court by itself.  The other alternative would be to lay the responsibility of the investigation of the facts on the Supreme Court, whilst leaving to the Parliament the responsibility for the final resolution on receipt of the report.  Now, we changed from that idea of the Supreme Court being the body to investigate the facts, to the House itself putting the responsibility of investigation on the House itself &mdash; as far as I was concerned, on the idea that the House could design the procedure which would meet a particular case &mdash; for instance, if there were a number of lawyer members on both sides of the House, they could select a number of lawyer members who understand the rules of evidence and who would understand what was meant by a proper judicial inquiry into a case&mdash; but that it was on their report they would act.  I should be very glad if we could come to some agreement about this.</P>

      <P>I may tell the President that, so far as forms are concerned, I do not grumble in the slightest.  As a matter of fact, I think that, very often, too much importance is attached to forms, and if there was a finding by a tribunal of judges on the question of whether the removal was made by a tribunal of the House, I would have no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If what you have in mind is investigation by an outside tribunal, it is a question whether there is any point at all in the provision that the charge preferred by one House shall be investigated by the other House.  If a tribunal is to be appointed, I think there is no reason why it should not be appointed by both Houses acting together.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>You see, this is the result of a certain evolution.  If we were, in express terms, to say that the charge should be investigated by the Supreme Court, we probably would not have this machinery as it is here exactly; but we have put the responsibility of investigation on the House other than the House by which the complaint is made, and I think that if we can make sure that that House can set up a sub-committee or see in what way it can set up a tribunal on receipt of the report, or cause the matter to be investigated, then we have only slightly to modify Section 7 so as to fit in with these conditions.  I do not think it would be wise to specify that the Supreme Court should investigate the charge.  I think we should leave it to the House to decide what the tribunal should be.  I think we could, at this stage, postpone discussion of this matter until a later stage.  The Ceann Comhairle informed us that we could leave it over for an interval and take the matter up again.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the failure of the President to act will not be clear until the time within which he is to act has passed.  We want to make certain that the passage of time does not invalidate the action of the commission which would perform these functions instead of the President.  The amendment states that &ldquo;the said power or functions shall be exercised or performed under this Article as soon as may be after the expiration of the time so specified.&rdquo;  The point is that a certain time is allowed for the signing of Bills, etc.  Suppose the President had failed to act, his failure could not be determined until the period had passed.  Then the question arises as to whether the commission, notwithstanding the fact that the period had passed, could act.  To make it quite clear that they could act, we are inserting this new sub-section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled <Col N="149" /> in regard to how this clause will work out in practice.  Suppose the President refuses or neglects to sign a Bill, then the Commission comes into action, I understand, for the purpose of signing that Bill after the period has elapsed.  Does it then continue in action or does it cease, or have you got the extraordinary state of affairs that the President is exercising the powers of President for some purposes and the Commission is exercising them for some others?  If the President fails to act and the Commission comes along, does it continue to act through the continuance of his Presidency or what happens?  I am trying to understand it and to visualise what will happen.  It seems to me that you will have the Commission acting as President, and you will have the President acting as President, because there is nothing which terminates that situation. The incapacity of the President is simple enough because as soon as it has been found by the High Court that he is temporarily incapacitated, the Commission gets to work.  I take it then that the High Court &mdash; I do not really know who determines it but probably it will be the High Court &mdash; determines as to whether his incapacity has ceased.  I do not know whether that is the procedure to be adopted. Though that may give rise to some difficulty, it does not seem to me to be unsurmountable but I think this is altogether too vague as far as the &ldquo;failure&rdquo; end of the question is concerned because it is arguable that one failure to act may mean that for the rest of the seven years, you may have to put a Commission in his place.  I know that is not the intention but I am not on the question of intention. I am on the question of how the thing is going to work in practice.  It seems to me that there will be some very big difficulties arising out of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that will have to be watched very carefully. The intention is to give effect to the actual words inserted here. However, we can have another look at it in the interval and see, if by any chance, it may not work out in the manner desired.  The intention, as the Deputy is aware, is that if there was <Col N="150" /> a particular failure in regard to a particular act, the Commission would step in and perform that act.  If there was a succession of failures, they would nevertheless continue to act in the same manner until such a period had elapsed that it was quite clear that something had gone wrong with the machinery generally and that the measures that were designed for dealing with a temporary or momentary business, were being used as a permanent arrangement.  There would have to be certain measures taken to deal with that case.  It could happen, as the Deputy suggested, that you would have the Commission performing certain acts for the President and at the same time he himself might be performing other acts which he was willing to perform.  We are dealing with what is obviously an abnormal happening in this case and we only want to provide that in the case of such an abnormality the machine would not be brought to a standstill. It may appear a bit extraordinary that you should have two persons&mdash; using the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to cover the body, the Commission &mdash; performing the same type of act, but that would be altogether abnormal, and when we are dealing with abnormal situations we may expect that there will be some abnormal things happening.</P>
      <P>Ordinarily, of course, what is going to happen is that the President is going to perform his functions; that he is going to keep his oath; that he is going to act for the purposes for which he was put into office.  But you have to provide for the possibility of individual failures, or something of that kind, and the provision is made here. Again, we cannot possibly arrange for everything that might conceivably arise, but we have to see, at any rate, that the duties which are necessary for the validation of Acts and so on will be performed, and that the work of the State will go along, even though it seems to be going along with two bodies for the time being where there ought to be only one.  I think the Deputy will admit that that would not be allowed to continue for any length of time.  You would have to get rid of the President if he continued to act like that.</P>

      <P>I still think the very great difficulty is whether this Commission might continue to work, because there is nothing which terminates the power of the Commission.  It is really as much under Section 1 of Article 14 as it is under this new section that it arises.  There does not seem to be anything to terminate the action; once they have come into action there does not seem to be anything that puts them out of action again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>In the event of his absence or in the event of his temporary or permanent incapacity. Those things pass away.  When he is no longer incapacitated, then of course their functions do not exist, but, in the event of his failure to exercise and perform his powers and functions, who is to decide as to whether he is willing again to exercise and perform the powers and functions?  That is my difficulty.  Perhaps he may not be. Perhaps he may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought.  The difficulty, I take it, is that, when there is some individual failure on the part of the President to perform an act, the Commission comes in and performs that act for him.  Next day, he may be ready to perform his functions as before.  Now I take it&mdash;I am saying what I believe to be here; we will have it examined to see if there is any further point in what the Deputy says&mdash;that if, immediately afterwards, he performs that act, then the Commission has no right or power to perform any functions.  He is performing <Col N="152" /> the Presidential functions.  The Commission has power only in the event of his failure to do that.  If he does not fail they have no power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not fail, of course the commission does not come into being at all.  Leaving out the unnecessary words, it says here that, in the event of the President's failure to exercise and perform the powers and functions of his office, or any of them, &ldquo;the powers and functions of the President under this Constitution shall be exercised and performed by a commission.&rdquo;  As this stands, it would seem to me that once there has been a failure to exercise and perform the powers and functions of his office, the rest of the Presidential powers and functions of his office are in the commission, and that the commission exercises them for the rest of his presidency.  That seems to me to be the meaning of this as it stands.</P>

      <P>I agree, and I am quite glad that the Deputy has raised the point.  It is vital that the intention should be clear, and the intention undoubtedly is that the commission should only perform the individual acts which the President fails to perform, and that there should be no suggestion of the commission coming in, so to speak, to replace the President. As far as I can see from looking over this, it seems to indicate <Col N="153" /> that that is the intention.  On the other hand, by a bit of a strain it might possibly bear the interpretation which the Deputy suggests.</P>

    <P>This is to make explicit what I think was already implied in the draft which we had&mdash;the fact that there should be no law placing any citizen under disability or incapacity on the grounds of sex, or disqualifying any citizen from voting on that ground.  It is simply to meet a point raised by one of the Deputies on the opposite benches in connection with Article 16. There was a general right that they <Col N="154" /> would have irrespective of sex, and then there was a clause dealing with disqualifications to be made by law. It was thought important that those disqualifications could not be made on the grounds of sex.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that there was an amendment from the opposite benches, the purpose of which was to leave to law the whole question of the composition of the Seanad.  I resisted that on the ground that the more we could put into the Constitution the better, so as to give a certain stability to the Parliament.  On the other hand, a good deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed with regard to the electorate, and I do not think we lose anything by leaving that over to the law.  Deputy MacDermot, I think, has an amendment here providing a different method, and I think, on the whole, we lose nothing by leaving the question of the nature of the electorate &mdash;the manner in which the members who are on the panel should be elected &mdash;to the ordinary law.  If we had a really satisfactory suggestion I would naturally desire to see it in the Constitution, but I think nobody can say that we have got any really satisfactory suggestion as to the method of electing the Seanad.  That was one of the difficulties which I pointed out when we had those debates about the Seanad originally. We are now up against trying to get a satisfactory electorate.  This was one of the suggestions in the commission's <Col N="155" /> report.  I thought it was better than the Dáil for the reason that I gave on the Committee Stage, but I do not think it is sufficiently good to stereotype it and to make it permanent in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the President has decided to drop the clauses about the electorate which was to choose from the panels for the Seanad, because I think those clauses are the most unsatisfactory part of the entire Constitution; but I admit that the question they are attempting to solve is also, perhaps, the most difficult question in the entire Constitution.  It is an extremely difficult problem to get a satisfactory electorate to choose from those panels. I am very glad, too, that the President has decided to retain the general scheme of panels in the Constitution, where I think it ought to be.  I think it would be farcical to introduce a Constitution, creating a balanced system of two Houses of Parliament and a President, without giving an outline of the nature of one of these Houses.  I have amendments down in connection with the electorate.  We discussed one already, namely, the substitution of the Dáil for this combination of candidates elected to the Dáil and candidates not elected.  I felt that the other amendment was impossible of acceptance before a general election, whatever chance there might be after a general election. I am, therefore, exceedingly pleased that the question should be left over.  My feeling is that, if you are to have a Seanad which is not to function mainly on Party lines and with Party motives, the electorate to choose it should be a small one and a select one.  Therefore, I made the proposal in the amendment, that it should be a selection commission consisting of &ldquo;not less than seven and not more than 12 persons appointed by the President none of whom shall be a member of Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  Those who, at first sight, might be inclined to resist that should remember that, after all, other Second Chambers have functioned not <Col N="156" /> altogether unsuccessfully with considerably less democratic methods of appointment.</P>
      <P>There is in Canada, I believe, a system of nomination the particulars of which I have forgotten.  In Great Britain you have always appointments to the Second Chamber by nomination of the Prime Minister.  In the amendment it is proposed that selection from the panels should be not by the Prime Minister, and not even by the President, who is supposed to be a non-political authority&mdash;and whom I would therefore prefer to the Prime Minister for the purpose&mdash;but by a commission consisting of a small number of what I hope will be highly-qualified and independent persons appointed for the purpose by the President, with a full sense of his responsibility to the State as a non-political authority at the time of the appointment.</P>
      <P>If the President had accepted my amendment now, it would, of course, have added fuel to the flame being ignited all over the country with regard to the alleged threat of dictatorship by the new functionary, the President. Therefore, I saw plainly when I put it down, that he could not accept it. It may be that in another Parliament, whatever Government may be in office after this election, some plan of this kind will be seen to give the best chance of getting a selection made from the panels on a non-political basis.  All those interested in the question of the Seanad, bodies connected with trade, commerce and finance, that have been thinking about this matter during the last few weeks, have invariably felt that there was little chance under the provisions of the Constitution, as it stands, of getting the right men selected from the panels.  I am glad the clauses about the electorate have been dropped, and I hope the wisdom of the next Parliament will provide a more satisfactory solution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not suggested, <Col N="158" /> and if there is any point in that I would have to have the text before me to satisfy myself completely about it.  Originally we had an amendment to the effect that from the panel you were restricted in choice to this extent that not less than five persons could be elected from one panel and not more than 11.  We would have to have the whole scheme back again to see the full effect.  When dropping the electorate we wanted to preserve that one condition, the purpose of which is to prevent the Legislature in its laws from juggling around with numbers in the panel, giving what would be unfair representation to one panel and denying just representation to another panel.  The intention was to have any number which would fit in.  I had to work it out for myself to make sure that it was workable.  I had worked out a scheme by which we could say that law would be brought in to follow the provisions of the Constitution. I worked out the number under various panels, and I think I gave an illustration in Committee of the need for a certain amount of inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said the universities are given six members.  Presumably the professions and education will be fairly well represented on their selection.  Hence there does not seem to be as good a reason for giving on the education panel as large a number as there might be, for example, for giving labour or industry or agriculture.  Again, as to public administration, there does not seem to be as good a reason for giving as large a representation to public administration as there would be for giving it, say, to agriculture or to labour.  I wanted to provide for inequalities within a certain range.  We were leaving it over to law to determine the exact numbers to be elected from each panel, but we wanted to restrict the law so that it would not be open to the Legislature to say: &ldquo;We will only put on half-a-dozen, say, from agriculture, and we will put them on from labour,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will give only one for labour,&rdquo; or something of that sort.  We wanted to provide for inequality within a reasonable range, and the five and the eleven were a range within which I <Col N="159" /> have been able to work out a scheme myself.</P>

You want to have a correspondence between the functional organisation and the panel to which they would be allowed to elect members.

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 82, line 12, Article 40, Section 1, to add after the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; the words following: &ldquo;Such enactments shall, however, contain no sex, class or religious discrimination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We had a similar amendment down on the Committee Stage, and it was withdrawn to enable the President to consider certain points that arose in it. I do not know whether the President has any views on the matter or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My views are not changed on this matter.  There was no suggestion at any particular time pointing to any particular class.  Section 1 of Article 40 is of a positive character.  It is simply declaratory. But in this amendment there is a new principle binding the Legislature in future with regard to &ldquo;sex, class or religious discrimination.&rdquo;  I do not know whether &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; means distinction or only discrimination; it possibly means differentiation. I think we would be going very far if we say we are not going to make any distinction in the laws.  Without expressing an opinion I do not see why we should bind ourselves completely, in advance, in that respect.  It would <Col N="165" /> seem to me to be putting something in Section 1 which is not contained in it at all at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment may be open to the verbal objections that the President has raised as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; or whether it is unjust discrimination or otherwise.  The substance of the amendment, as proposed on the last occasion, was to the effect that it should be provided in the Constitution that the law in dealing with any of the matters covered by Article 40 should contain no sex distinction.  It was thought proper that coupled with that particular consideration as to discrimination or class distinction in legislation, that class distinction and distinction in religion should also be provided for. Section 1 of Article 40 being open to certain constructions, the general object of the amendment was, that it should be made apparent that these constructions would not allow of the enactment of law by the Legislature discriminating between classes of workers, and industrialists and different religions.  The President, apparently, has made up his mind on the subject and there is very little use in going over the ground that we went over before. I understand that the President, while objecting to the word &ldquo;class,&rdquo; promised to consider the question and to put something into this Article which would calm the fears of these ladies or women's organisations in the matter of these expressions here &ldquo;differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.&rdquo;  These words might be held to allow the Legislature hereafter to pass laws in such a way that sex or religious qualifications might be imported into our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that it would be possible, as far as we can go, to prevent the Legislature in future doing things that would be unfair or unjust.  But the danger is that in trying to prevent injustice we might also prevent justice from being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always contended that the second clause here has not the meaning which is attached to it.  The second part of Section 1 is to provide that the first part of the section should not be <Col N="166" /> stretched in a direction in which it was never meant to be stretched.  The point aimed at was equality before the law. That is justice in the court.  I think the amendment is importing into the Article completely extraneous ideas.  I see no reason why we should do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put one particular example of the kind of thing that would appear to be allowable under the paragraph of the Article as it stands and as it is proposed to stand? The clause provides that the State shall in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.  The expression &ldquo;enactments&rdquo; would, of course, include administrative action or orders made pursuant to statutes of the Legislature. Now, under these administrative actions and orders the Civil Service of the State is divided into certain classes or categories.  As between various categories in the Civil Service we find a distinction made between married men and unmarried men.  We find a distinction made as between men and unmarried women.  It is really to cover that class of case that the amendment was put down in its original form. It is well known, of course, that there are people working in the Civil Service in the same category and doing the same class of work.  One is married, the other unmarried.  They pass the same examination, but one gets more pay than the other.  That is permissible under the present law. But not merely would it be permissible, if this Constitution goes through, but it would get constitutional benediction and that is a matter that should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about getting a constitutional benediction. I do not agree with that.  If we have to provide for other things it does not follow of necessity that there has been a benediction for doing it in one particular direction.  I am not going to argue here the merits of that whole scheme of laws.  They were enacted by the previous Government and are continued by us.  If there <Col N="167" /> is any injustice being done, there is no reason why it should not be remedied.  I am not accepting it that there is injustice, but if the Deputy has a case to make, there is nothing here to prevent it being followed up or any representations being made in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from the discussion that has taken place that this is the situation: The President desires that the Legislature of the future shall not be deprived of power to legislate along sex lines, if they think it necessary to do so. The President feels that some future Legislature may desire to have regard to differences of capacity, physical or moral, as between men and women and he thinks it would not be right to prevent an enactment along those lines, if such were thought desirable.  I take it the President must see the possibility of legislation being required here which will make a distinction as between men and women and it is his desire not to have that prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not suggest that at all.  I am not taking the Deputy's summarising of the case as being accurate.  The position really is this.  I have not had sufficient examination of all the possibilities that might arise in connection with action such as the repeal of these enactments to which Deputy Costello has referred to say at this particular time that we would have here by means of the Constitution to override the existing situation. That can only be done by examination afterwards.  We are not going to pass something in the Constitution which might overrun and be pleaded against the whole of the existing situation.  If that situation is not satisfactory, let it be remedied on its own, and not by an Article in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Article sets out that all the citizens shall be held equal before the law.  Then we have the first exception, that the State may, however, in its enactments, have due regard to differences in capacity, physical <Col N="168" /> and moral.  I suggest as an amendment that such enactments shall not contain any sex discrimination.  Why will the President not accept that?  I suggest it is because he wants to leave the door open to future legislation based on grounds of sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that that is not so.  I say that if there are things of that sort that have to be remedied, let them be remedied on their own.  If there is something unfair in the existing situation, let it be remedied on its own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be acceptance of an amendment which sets out that there shall not be discrimination on grounds of sex.  The Constitution starts off with a phrase about the rights of the people, that the people shall be equal before the law.  But then we have it that the State must have regard to differences of capacity. When an amendment is moved suggesting that you shall not have any regard to discrimination based on sex there is a refusal to accept that.  What can one conclude?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter in which I take a special interest.  I think this should be preserved, because it is possible that a conscription law would be passed, and if everyone is equal and if equal rights would imply equal duties, it might be very unfair to women that they would be conscripted in the same way as men.  Therefore, there should be some protection for them.  I do not know what Deputy McGilligan means by discrimination.</P>

      <P>In any case, the same door was left open in the old Constitution and there were a great many sorts of evil legislation that could have been thought of by the framers of the old Constitution and that they could have sought to provide against and did not provide <Col N="169" /> against because they very sensibly thought it was a hopeless task to bind the Parliaments of all time in such a way as to prevent them passing mischievous legislation.  Is it, therefore, fair to say that the framers of the old Constitution were not legislating blindly, that they must have thought of all the evil things that could be done, and as they did not put anything in the Constitution to prevent those things being done, therefore they must have contemplated their being done, if not actually wanting them to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very puerile argument.  The fact that some door was left open by a previous Constitution is not an answer to a question of principle.  Whoever drafted that Constitution may have been wrong, but we have a chance of remedying it now if it was wrong.  To say that something else was done previously which ought not to be done now, that if the door was left open it ought not to be shut now is, to put it mildly, merely puerile. I was not endeavouring to remedy existing grievances or injustices.  The whole purport of the amendment is to provide that the law will not make any undue discrimination against women and in favour of men.  Could anything be clearer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy qualifies his discrimination with the word &ldquo;undue.&rdquo;  When Deputy McGilligan spoke it showed me how necessary it was to have this second portion here. I was not completely and absolutely convinced of the necessity for the second part until Deputy McGilligan went on to interpret the first part in a way altogether different from the manner in which it arose originally.  I think Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, when he was speaking on this particular matter, restricted the use of that to equal justice in the courts.  I have no doubt that was the original intention, that when people came before the courts, where it was A or B, the case was investigated irrespective of who A or B was.  Now, undoubtedly, it has stretched from that meaning to mean that in all law citizens should be regarded as equal, which would make all <Col N="170" /> law impossible, because we have constantly to distinguish between classes. If we want to be just we have to do it. We have to distinguish in our laws between the functions in the community. Whatever doubts I had before, I am satisfied from the way in which Deputy McGilligan has interpreted the meaning of the first part of this that it is essential that we should have the second part.</P>

      <P>We will see what happens if conscription is introduced and if the phrase corresponding to the phrase in Article 3 of the old Constitution were here.  That is where Deputy MacDermot has not even read the old Constitution.  Article 3 simply stated that every person, without distinction of sex, who had done various things&mdash; there were certain qualifications that had to be passed of birth and residence &mdash;becomes a citizen of the Free State, and, as such, is subject to obligations and duties and has the rights of citizens.  If anything was passed thereafter, that being the constitutional proviso, a constitutional case could have been argued as to whether it was right or wrong.  The phrase &ldquo;without distinction of sex&rdquo; put into this Constitution&mdash;the Article being &ldquo;all citizens without distinction of sex shall be held equal before the law&rdquo;&mdash; would suit perfectly.  If there is any case arising hereafter, it is a matter for constitutional argument, and if it is necessary to have it done as a matter of conscription, a constitutional amendment with regard to that special matter could be brought forward.  That is what is asked here, and that is what Deputy Mrs. Concannon, as a lady Deputy, is going to vote on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the situation not absolutely clear-cut? I do not think there is any necessity for further argument on it.  The Article says &ldquo;All citizens shall be held equal before the law&rdquo;, and thereafter it says: &ldquo;The State shall have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral.&rdquo;  I want to know does that mean a discrimination on the ground of sex broadly on the basis that certain people are going to be affected as men and certain others as women? I want to prevent that.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon does not understand what <Col N="172" /> I want to prevent, and she is anxious to let that discrimination occur on the sole ground of the possibility of there being a conscription law.</P>

It is relevant to consider what was done in the old Constitution, because, in the first place, <Col N="173" /> it is relevant to the question of the sincerity of the objections that are being made to this Constitution by the people who amended the old Constitution freely while in office and who might have amended it in this respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what I am saying.  They did not feel, while they had power to amend the Constitution, this urgent need to close the door against discriminatory functional legislation.  Why do they feel it now?  There is nothing in the principle laid down there about having regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and social functions that is in any way novel.  During the last year, throughout the Christian Front movement and Christian action activity and the propaganda based on Papal Encyclicals, great stress has been laid on all this and it is amazing that Deputies should now treat it as if it were an unheard-of novelty to suggest that there were these differences; but the statement of that undeniable fact, a statement that there may be cases when we are not prepared to rule ourselves out in advance from making any difference in our legislation between men and women, does not mean that anybody has a desire to start anti-feminist legislation.  After all, the fundamental fact with regard to this Constitution, with regard to the last Constitution and with regard to every Constitution is that you are essaying an utterly hopeless task if you try to close every door to bad legislation in the future.  You cannot do it.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that it is now Deputies on the other benches are discovering all these prohibitions that were in the old Constitution. I take it that they accepted in 1924 and, particularly in 1926, when the matter was raised, this question of the discrimination between men and <Col N="174" /> women in the public service, for example.  They had the old Constitution and, nevertheless, they went ahead and made that difference.  Reading Article 3, I see nothing in it which closes any door.  What we are doing here is trying to safeguard the first part of that Article from being stretched in a direction which I believe was an altogether unwarranted direction. It has, however, been stretched in that direction and I wanted to meet it in the statement that all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.  I believe that phrase originated in quite a different way from that in which it is sought to be used, that you must in law not differentiate between the sexes.  I believe you may have to differentiate in some cases and I am not prejudging the situation in this clause of the Article at all.  I am saying that citizens as human persons are held equal and that it shall not be held to mean, as Deputy McGilligan wants it to mean, that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity and so on.  I think we are acting wisely in leaving that section as it is.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that while Deputy MacDermot was speaking President de Valera must have been shouting out to himself <i>&ldquo;non tali auxilio&rdquo;</i> because I think Deputy MacDermot's intervention must have been a very sore and unpleasant one to the President.  What is his argument? The old Constitution is impeccable the old Constitution is perfect.  Is that not what it comes down to?  You have something in the old Constitution and, therefore, it ought to remain.  Taking it for granted that Deputy MacDermot is right, that the old Constitution cannot be improved upon, then the whole ground is cut completely and entirely from under the President's feet and I think the President obviously cannot be very happy when Deputy MacDermot brings the force of his mighty reasoning powers to his assistance, but certain things are expressed and, as the President himself has stated, everything cannot be dealt with precisely at the same time. In every measure, certain questions remain dormant, so to speak.  Then, <Col N="175" /> they become vitalised.  They come under discussion and are considered for the first time.  Then it becomes necessary for a decision to be come to one way or the other.  This particular question did lie dormant while the old Constitution was being discussed.  It is not dormant now.  It has come to life.  There are issues now before the House.  Since these issues have come to life within the House and have been, if I may say so, vitalised by discussion outside the House, the House cannot refuse to give a ruling on points which did not arise during the discussion of the Constitution now in force.</P>

      <P>This Article merely provides that the State shall have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social functions. I think that is already well recognised in the existing laws.  I may cite two examples of laws in which the State has due regard to the differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.  Recently, we passed a Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill. In that measure, discrimination is made between a widow and a widower. A widower cannot qualify under that Act for a pension.  If we omitted a statement of an obvious fact from our Constitution, would it be constitutional for us to discriminate between the social function of men and women and to grant pensions to widows while we denied them to widowers?  The second example occurred to me while Deputy McGilligan was speaking.  I refer to the Slander of Women Act. That is an Act in which the State has due regard to the differences between men and women.  No such Act applies to men.  From those two instances, it will be seen that the statement in the Constitution is a statement of an existing fact, already recognised by the laws of the State.</P>

Deputy Keely gives us examples from the past.  That is the whole atmosphere of the argument&mdash; the necessity for this discrimination. Let us move on to another point. Suppose you do want to discriminate on ground of sex, look at what is done. A grand constitutional right, to be adjudicated upon by the courts, is set out&mdash;that all people are equal. Then immediately comes in the question of the law.  The law will not be thrown down because it is contrary to the Constitution.  The judges will have nothing to say to that.  The requirements of the law will be set out, and we make clear here that we want to be able to take into account the differences between the sexes.</P>

      <P>The brilliant mind of the President does not conceive that that ought to be allowed&mdash;that it should be open to bring a case before the High Court on the argument that the law had not had &ldquo;due regard.&rdquo;  The President would not like <Col N="178" /> to have that made a constitutional question.  It is not possible to make it a constitutional question under this Article.  The Legislature will pass the law.  Does Deputy Donnelly think that the High Court or the Supreme Court is going to set aside under that Article as it stands any law passed here on the ground that due regard has not been paid to &ldquo;differences of capacity, physical or moral&rdquo;?

      <P>Deputies on the opposite side want this discrimination and they want it mainly&mdash;if I am to judge from the examples given&mdash;on the ground of sex.

      <P>Not even hidden? What was the old position, if I may return to Article 3?  I am amused by the fact that, although Deputy MacDermot has been here three years, he does not yet know what Article 3 means.  In a short time he will probably stop reading Article 3 and forget all about it.  Article 3 was not put in to last for all time.  Already I have contrasted the humility of the people who brought in the original Constitution with the attitude adopted by those who have brought in this Draft Constitution.  The old Constitution was open to amendment by the easy method of ordinary legislation for eight years.  That period was extended to 16 years, which period is still <Col N="179" /> running.  No attempt was made to close down on that although it could have been done.  If we wanted to leave a rigid Constitution behind us we could have amended that Article before we left office.  We did not do that.  We left the Constitution open to amendment by way of ordinary legislation. It was brought in, and it was stated when it was passing through the Dáil first, that undoubtedly there were things that would only be discovered after the Constitution had been tested out by experience over a number of years.  On an appeal being made the original period of four years was, without a division, enlarged to eight years, and later enlarged to 16. The present Constitution for a period of three years may, subject to the discretion of whoever is President, be amended by way of ordinary legislation. During that period the President may send any law to the people by way of Referendum, but after three years it becomes rigid and fast.  One of the things that you cannot amend in this Constitution is this three-year period. The House is now being asked to pass this constitutional right, and then there is to be a subtraction of all the good from that constitutional right by process of law.  That is going to be the constitutional position, that laws may be passed subtracting all the good from that constitutional right which cannot be amended except by Referendum after three years.</P>
      <P>What did Article 3 of the old Constitution give?  It established people as citizens, and went on to say that everybody who was a citizen&mdash;there was no discrimination of sex&mdash;had all the privileges and obligations of citizenship. There was a variety of Articles afterwards setting out the privileges of citizenship.  One was that there could not be any discrimination with regard to sex.  If there was any doubt about that it could have been tested as to whether that was the constitutional position or not, but such action was not adopted towards it.  Can it be said that we will have the same situation in the future?</P>

There was a safeguarding of the citizen.  This derision of the lawyers means also derision of the courts.  Article 3 established the constitutional position.  It could be amended as easily as any other part of the Constitution, but if the key had been turned in the padlock after the first eight years, then the whole Constitution was rigid.  Women would then have had the particular matter of citizenship on an equal footing with men, so that whatever Articles afterwards set out the rights and duties of citizenship, they had them equally with men as part of the Constitution.  That is not the position in this Constitution. Deputy Mrs. Concannon has told us that she does not believe that there is sex discrimination in the Article.</P>

      <P>The trouble with Deputy MacDermot is that he can only read one Article of the Constitution and understand it.  He cannot carry his understanding backward or forward to any other Article.  Article 3 of the <Col N="183" /> old Constitution provided that all persons, without distinction of sex, had the rights of citizenship, and a series of Articles after that set out the rights of the citizen.  One of them was the right with regard to associations. There was no necessity to put in a &ldquo;no sex&rdquo; distinction, because that was already in Article 3.  Once a person is a citizen, the rights flow, and you could not discriminate, when you are giving citizenship, on grounds of sex. So, if Deputy MacDermot will tire himself by reading Article 3 as closely as the other Article, he should be able to get the point clear.  As to the last point made by Deputy Keely, it is hardly worth dealing with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment a very serious issue arises.  A long discussion took place on this Article on the Committee Stage dealing with the effect of what I shall call, subject to protest&mdash;if I might put it that way&mdash; the proviso to clause 1 of the Article. Various suggestions were put forward from this side of the House as to the possible construction that would be put on this proviso, which would have the effect of limiting the right of free speech and the freedom of the Press. The President, I think, was to have considered some of the suggestions that we put forward, that the section was capable of being construed in such a way as to cut down the liberty of free speech and the liberty of the Press. Now I gather from the President that the only amendment that has been accepted, the only suggestion to which any weight has been attached at all, is the suggestion that the words &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy&rdquo; should be inserted in the proviso to clause 1, paragraph (i) of the Article. In my view the effect of that, so far from improving the Article, will, in fact and in law, render more forceful all the arguments we advanced here on the last stage of the measure in reference to the possible effect of this Article on the right of free speech and the liberty of the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat my arguments again, but I must just refer to this aspect very briefly.  I drew attention, <Col N="185" /> on the last stage of the Bill, to the Latin maxim, <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, which means that if you express one thing in an Act of Parliament, by implication you thereby exclude a large number of other things. Here in the first part of this section the State guarantees liberty to citizens to express freely their opinions, subject to public order and morality.  I stated here on the last occasion, and I re-state it here positively, that in the phrase &ldquo;subject to public order and morality&rdquo; are embodied comprehensively all the so-called limitations which exist in law and under our existing Constitution on the right of free speech and the liberty of the Press.  Everybody admits that the right of free speech and the liberty of the Press, which is only another manifestation of the right of free speech, are subject to certain so-called limitations.</P>
    <P>The right of free speech and the liberty of the Press must not be exercised in a manner that would be blasphemous, seditious or indecent. All these matters are, as a matter of law and construction, clearly enshrined in the phrase &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;  What is sought to be done in the proviso to that right is to emphasise that, in reference to certain methods by which the right of free speech and the liberty of the Press may be exercised, they are to be subject to certain limitations.  The proviso, putting it in a very wide way, sets forth that the State shall endeavour to ensure that certain organs of public opinion, such as the cinema, the radio and the Press, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  It is proposed now to make that clause read: &ldquo;to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you insert these words, &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy,&rdquo;<Col N="186" /> the danger is that you will exclude a large variety of other matters and thereby make it appear that because it was necessary to put in, as a sort of exception to this controlling power, criticism of Government policy, these other matters, not being included in that exception, are subject to the right of control in this proviso.  The proviso, when it is amended according to the President's amendment on the Paper at the moment, allows criticism of the Government.  Does it allow criticism of a member of the Government? You can criticise the Government, which is defined in the Constitution by Article 28, clause 1.  You may, if you like, criticise 15 members who are an entity called by the Constitution &ldquo;The Government.&rdquo;  But can you criticise the public actions of one of those members operating in his Departmental capacity?  Can you criticise his Departmental actions?  Can a newspaper refer in an adverse way, in the wind of adverse criticism, to the actions of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  That is not included here.  That may be said to be subject to this right of control in the interests of the education of public opinion. Deputy Norton may go out to his constituency at the present moment and criticise the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because of his failure to give adequate wages to a certain class in the Post Office.  After this Constitution is passed, can he go out and criticise that particular Minister, or must his criticism, in order to be constitutional, be directed against the Government?  That is one of the examples which I give as the possible construction that may be put upon this.  Can you criticise a Parliamentary Secretary?  Can you criticise Deputy Hugo Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance at the moment, or somebody else in his position hereafter, for his actions in connection with unemployment grants and matters of that kind?  Can you criticise a county council, or are you liable to be controlled, in the interests of the education of public opinion, by a Government that wants to muzzle criticism in that line?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Government policy,&rdquo; I am told, is <Col N="187" /> the alternative amendment.  I had not seen that, I confess.  I was dealing with the Paper I got this morning.  I should not be surprised if amendments to this Constitution sprung out of the air.  Until my colleague here pointed cut to me that there was another amendment in typescript, I had not known it.  The so-called improvement in the typescript makes the matter worse, because you can only criticise Government policy now.  You cannot criticise departmental actions.  You cannot criticise the policy of a particular Minister.  Possibly it might be said that you could, because there is a collective responsibility, and therefore the policy of one member is the policy of the whole.  I have already criticised adversely the policy of the Government in this Constitution in regard to that aspect.  I will even take it at &ldquo;policy.&rdquo;  Departmental action, administrative action, is not policy. Action carried out administratively in a Department by the officers of the Department, for which the Minister is responsible to the House, is not policy. It may not be policy.  Can we criticise a member of the Government? Can we criticise a Parliamentary Secretary? Can we criticise a county council for their policy?  Inferentially, we cannot.  All you say here is that you can criticise Government policy.</P>
    <P>Towards the close of the debate on this clause on the last Stage I asked the President would he agree with me that if a newspaper published an article deliberately intending to undermine the authority of the State, that would be something contrary to public order?  He agreed with me that it would, as obviously it would.  This clause still reads&mdash;and apparently it is the President's intention that it should continue so to read as part of our Constitution, if this becomes the Constitution of the State&mdash;that &ldquo;the education of public opinion being, however, a matter of grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the Press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, <Col N="188" /> shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or public order.&rdquo; You start the phrase by saying that the right is to be exercised subject to public order and morality, and you go on to say that the State shall endeavour to secure that this expression of opinion and the liberty of the Press shall be exercised subject to public order or morality or public order.  On its face it is nonsense, read in that way, construed in that way.</P>
    <P>Already, on the last Stage, I have directed the attention of the House to the fact that the courts always endeavour to give not a nonsensical meaning to Acts of the Legislature; still more will they be inclined to give a meaning, which will not make it nonsense, to a phrase or clause in the Constitution.  The courts will endeavour to construe this clause as having some meaning, being a proviso to the general guaranteed right of free expression of opinion and convictions. The courts can construe this in no other way, in my opinion, than as being a limitation upon that right, and if it is a limitation upon that right it is a duty on the State to do the things that are set out here in the interests of the education of public opinion&mdash;to control the radio, the Press, and the cinema.  Why the phonograph should not be controlled, or the gramophone, or the loud speaker, I do not know.  At all events, they pick the radio, the Press and the cinema.  We may have television, and I suppose that will not be controlled in the interests of the education of public opinion.</P>
    <P>The danger of this is not that it is going to be construed as nonsense. In my opinion, as it stands at the moment, it is capable of being construed as nonsense.  The danger is that the courts will say that the Legislature never inserted in the Constitution, above all things, a clause that could bear nothing but a nonsensical meaning, and that, therefore, it being put by way of a proviso to the statement of the general right of free expression of opinion, it must be something inserted by way of enabling the Legislature to control the exercise of that right.  Once you start controlling <Col N="189" /> the exercise of that right, there is almost an end to the right of free expression of opinion and the liberty of the Press.  There is certainly an end to it in the way that has existed in this country before this State was set up at all, and in the way that it was continued under our Constitution. Again, I emphasise the fact that everything that is desirable, everything that exists at the moment and that has existed in this country and in England since the freedom of the Press and freedom of speech became one of the constitutional rights of the people, is included in the expression, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I referred to the fact that the word &ldquo;libellous&rdquo; has not been mentioned in this Article.  It was always one of the so-called limitations on the right of free speech and freedom of the Press that it should not publish libellous matter.  We find blasphemy and indecency mentioned. Criticism of Government policy is mentioned, but libellous matter is not, although it is one of the things which at the moment, in accordance with the legal definition of freedom of speech, the right of free expression and freedom of the Press is imposed upon the exercise of these rights.  It may not be a very serious matter that the word &ldquo;libellous&rdquo; is left out, but when the words, &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; include libel, sedition, blasphemy, indecency, treason and other matters contrary to the authority of the State, and when you put in something specifically on top of that which can only be properly construed as a limitation of that right, then that Article in the Constitution is a dangerous one, and ought to be fought as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I participated in the discussion of this section on the Committee Stage, and I expressed the view that the whole object of this qualifying sentence was to restrict substantially the freedom which the Press has under the existing Constitution, and under our existing legislation.  The amendment which the President has submitted now in no way takes from the objectionable character of the qualifying <Col N="190" /> sentence.  As Deputy Costello stated, I think by its emphasis on criticism of Government policy, it appears to imply that criticism outside that narrow domain may well be dealt with as calculated to undermine the authority of the State.  The President appears to think, and so did Deputy MacDermot on the last occasion, that the phrase &ldquo;while preserving their rightful liberty of expression&rdquo; offers some solution towards preserving the liberty of the Press to criticise freely the doings of any particular Party or of any Government.  May I call attention to the fact that the whole emphasis in the sentence is on undermining public order or morality or the authority of the State.  So far as undermining public order or morality is concerned, any transgression in that respect is caught by the overriding words at the commencement of the section, so that there is no need for repetition in the qualifying sentence. We are left, therefore, in the position that the whole emphasis in the sentence is that criticism may not be indulged in calculated to undermine the authority of the State.  When you get a clash between what is the preservation of the rightful liberty of expression, and criticism calculated to undermine the authority of the State, the whole emphasis here is that anything calculated to undermine the authority of the State is a transgression of the rightful liberty of expression, and consequently can be banned by legislation which this Constitution foreshadows in that respect.  The term &ldquo;to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; is a vague and an empty term, capable of being used by any Government in any kind of situation.  If a Government were so disposed, the words &ldquo;to undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; could be construed as undermining the political security of a Government, and legislation could be introduced by a Government carrying a majority of one, giving it power, or giving one Minister power, simply to ban and proscribe any newspaper that was a challenge to the Government's continuance in office.  I am opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy <Col N="191" /> will allow me to remind him that on the Committee Stage there was a motion, but not to delete the words the Deputy is criticising.  The Deputy was not the only offender in that respect.  That amendment was negatived.  Therefore, the words stand.  The matter before the House for consideration is the amendment on to-day's amendment paper.  The section is not before the House as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand perfectly that it is the amendment which the President has introduced.  That is all we are discussing.  This is offered by the President, apparently to restore, as he thinks, some little measure of liberty to the Press.  I am taking exception to the amendment on the ground that it is not giving the Press the liberty which it has to-day.  I am confining my remarks to the net question of control of the Press.  I have not even referred so far to the control of the radio and the cinema.  I say that the amendment of the President makes this sentence just as objectionable as it was, and in no way improves the sentence from the point of view of those who want to ensure a continuance of the right that the Press has to-day.  In every democratic country, where liberty of mind is prized, the Press is permitted wide liberty in the way of criticism.  I think the preservation of that right of the Press is necessary for the maintenance of all the virtues which go hand in hand with the maintenance of democratic government.  This section, even as implied by the President, is not calculated to permit the Press the liberty and freedom which it had in the past, and which it has at present.  The whole object of the section and of the qualifying sentence is to whittle down the liberty that the Press has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated from public platforms on behalf of the Government that this Constitution is a Magna Charta, that it is the charter of the people's liberty, yet heavily enshrined in it is a clause of this kind, designed to give power into the hands of the Executive Council to throttle the Press, and power to suppress organs of public opinion if, in the opinion of the <Col N="192" /> Executive of the day, that criticism is calculated to undermine the authority of the State.  In every other country where efforts have been made to regiment the Press and to control organs of the Press, this has been one of the first steps for the setting up of a dictatorship and an oligarchy.  Here in this country we appear to be setting out on the same road, by the foreshadowed introduction of legislation which may deprive the Press and organs of public opinion of many valuable rights which they have to-day.  I do not think the President's amendment in any way improves the objectionable character of the qualifying phrase in the section.  It is still possible for the Executive Council to throttle the Press, to suppress any organs with whose opinions it disagrees, and to arrogate to itself a right of that kind.  That, in my opinion, is foreshadowing the utilisation of that kind of power in the same objectionable way as it has been used in other countries where that kind of power was given to the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton stated that the rights of the Press are being taken away.  Here is the existing Constitution, for which Deputy Norton voted, in its application to an organisation known as the National Guard and afterwards as the Young Ireland Association:</P>
      <P>The Tribunal may, on the application of a member of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of inspector, make an order declaring any book, issue of a periodical, pamphlet, poster or other document to be seditious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not have voted for it in that form, but he voted in favour of the application of Article 2A, which contains that clause, against the Blueshirts.  Now the Deputy says that the liberty of the Press is being taken away.  The liberty of the Press under the new Constitution, even as it stands, is a great deal <Col N="193" /> safer than under the present Constitution.</P>

      <P>I am not going to argue with the Deputy about definitions. I am merely speaking of his statement that the present magnificent liberties of the Press are being taken away.  I deny that statement. Another clause in Article 2A says that any document issued on behalf of any unlawful association can be suppressed, and a further Article says that the Government has complete discretion when deciding what is an unlawful association. That being so, what a farce it is to speak as if the present Constitution protected the Press against the sort of attack that Deputy Norton fears.  The Press have only got one real security in the present Constitution and that is the democratic feeling of the Irish people and the democratic feeling of this Assembly. They have exactly that same security in the new Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talks about the safeguard there is in the democratic feeling in this House.  It is impossible, apparently, to get the Deputy to realise the difference between a constitutional provision and a piece of ordinary legislation.  A Government may, if it has power to pass laws in the Legislature, once it is installed in office, do more or less what it pleases during the five years' term.  The only safeguard that the people have against the unauthorised use of power in the five years' period that a Government is elected for is in the Constitution, because whatever a Government does by its legislation, once it is installed, may be brought before the courts on the question: Is this unconstitutional or is it not?  If the Deputy can only get that fully realised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, it is only when sitting down listening to someone else, but when he stands on his feet it disappears.  What is <Col N="194" /> the good of the Deputy lecturing the House on the safeguard there is in the democratic spirit of the people, if they are prevented from using that for a period of five years?  Such a Government may boldly destroy for that period all the rights supposed to be granted to the people.  The Government have control during those five years, and the only way in which there is any impact on them is if they transgress that Constitution and may be brought before the courts for that.  Here again we find this which runs right through the whole Constitution. Article 40, sub-section (6), says: &ldquo;The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights,&rdquo; and then the phrase follows, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If there was nothing else in the Constitution except the enumeration of the rights of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions, if there was nothing else in the Constitution except what I have read, the situation is this.  If the Government bring in a law in any way to regulate the right of citizens to express their opinions, that can be brought before the High Court and the Supreme Court.  What the High Court and Supreme Court have to test is: Is that law properly basing itself on the terms &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;? The High Court and the Supreme Court are to determine whether something in the way of public order and morality is being encroached upon or not.  But, add what is in the rest of the Article and you have a new situation. There is a variety of pious expressions and then it states: &ldquo;The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion... shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;&ldquo;Public order and morality&rdquo; are already in the qualification.  Being in already, the persons to test it are the High Court and the Supreme Court. Why are they put in again?  To take the determination of what is subject to public order and morality away from the High Court and the Supreme Court and to give it to the Legislature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here, in addition to undermining <Col N="195" /> public order or morality, the phrase &ldquo;shall not be used to undermine... the authority of the State&rdquo;. Would a use of the Press which would undermine the authority of this State be contrary to public order and morality? Surely, it would.  Why, therefore, are these things again taken down from the qualification paragraph, where they stand already, and put in here for some reason?  &ldquo;Public order and morality&rdquo;, in the first two lines of sub-section 6 (1) are thrown to the courts to determine the meaning of the words and apply them to the particular piece of law.  Transfer them now, and the whole situation is transformed. In the paragraph which follows the question of undermining public order or morality, or undermining the authority of the State, no longer becomes a matter for adjudication by the courts, but for the Legislature to say what, in their opinion, is being done.</P>
    <P>So we have again this duplicity.  The right given, apparently thrown to the courts to be the safeguarding of the people, the terms of reference given to them; the people are to be safeguarded in the following rights.  But the exercise of these rights all the time is to be subject to public order and morality and we say, with a grand gesture: &ldquo;The courts will determine that.&rdquo; Having said that, we go on to write this extra thing, the full meaning of which is, notwithstanding anything contained above, if the Legislature think something is contrary to public order or morality or likely to undermine the authority of the State, then they can pass a law and destroy the freedom of the Press at their discretion.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured several times to get that point made clear&mdash;that there is an enormous difference between granting a constitutional right and allowing the judges to be the arbiters of the application of the qualifications and, in the sub-paragraph, to put in something leaving it to the determination of the Legislature.  If Deputy MacDermot is here what he may eventually come to realise is, that the first two lines give a right which the courts will safeguard and, in the next five lines, there is a subsidiary right of <Col N="196" /> determination given to the Dáil.  If the Dáil exercises that right, and says in legislation, &ldquo;We pass this because we think the exercise of these rights is likely to undermine public order and morality and the authority of the State,&rdquo; then the courts are ousted from any jurisdiction.  The only thing they may be called upon to pronounce upon is: was the piece of legislation technically correct in passing through the Dáil?  Once that is established, the courts cannot say it is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>On the last day, as far as I understand, only one amendment was put to the House and negatived.  That was Deputy Norton's amendment to delete from the Article the words &ldquo;the Press&rdquo;. An amendment in the name of Deputy Costello and myself to cut out all this matter from, &ldquo;The education of public opinion...&rdquo; down to &ldquo;law&rdquo; was withdrawn by Deputy Dillon, who said that he understood that the President intended to consider the matter raised on the amendment between then and the Report Stage.  Deputy Dillon said that he proposed to withdraw the amendment, reserving the right to put it down on the Report Stage if it was desired to divide upon it.  So far as I understand the situation, the House divided on the amendment to delete the words &ldquo;the Press&rdquo; and it was determined to keep these words in, and there was nothing more determined than that.</P>

    <P>The President now proposes to add after the word &ldquo;expression&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy.&rdquo;  We had his amendment No. 50 on the official sheet, to insert after the word &ldquo;expression&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including criticism of the Government.&rdquo;  What is now called an additional amendment is put down by the President to insert the words, &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy.&rdquo;  So that if either of these amendments is carried, the new Constitution will read: &ldquo;... while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy (or including criticism of the Government) shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the <Col N="198" /> State.&rdquo;  First we get this declaration with regard to a constitutional right, guaranteeing liberty for the exercise of the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions; then we begin to undermine the rights given.  After guaranteeing liberty to the citizens, there comes this: &ldquo;The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import for the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion such as the radio, the Press, the cinema...&rdquo; I am not so sure that television could not come in there, because the radio, the Press and the cinema are only examples. This is not an exhaustive enumeration of the organs of public opinion. We have this half-hearted beckoning to the original right, and then we have this expression that the liberty of the individual shall not be allowed to undermine public order or morality. What is this new phrase wrapped up in?  &ldquo;While preserving their rightful liberty of expression.&rdquo;  Who is denying that?  Is it the Legislature?  I presume so.  &ldquo;While preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy.&rdquo; If that is the amendment that is seriously proposed in this Article, and if I had the option, I would much prefer the other phrase in amendment No. 50: &ldquo;including criticism of the Government.&rdquo;&ldquo;Government policy&rdquo; may be relied on as being very much narrower than the other.  The implication that is possible on its wording is that criticism of the Government is criticism of the personnel of the Government.  I presume it is sufficiently wide to include Government and Government policy, but when we get &ldquo;Government&rdquo; alone it is segregated by itself.  Here you have a right given, &ldquo;subject to public order and morality:&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having said that, it would not be so bad if we went on to say: &ldquo;Such original liberty shall not be allowed to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.&rdquo;  But there is a peculiar twist in the expression. The phrase is so turned as to make the original liberty of expression not the important thing.  The <Col N="199" /> important thing in the phrase is the making of the exception and the taking away of the right given in the first part of the Article.  If anybody sought to pick out a wide phrase by way of preamble, he could not have got together anything wider than that. Then we have this wide expression: &ldquo;organs of public opinion such as the radio, the Press, the cinema.&rdquo; Enveloped in that is this matter as a mere parenthesis, &ldquo;while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy.&rdquo;  That phrase &ldquo;criticism of Government policy&rdquo; has tied up the original liberty.  Who is going to define the original liberty employed in connection with Government policy? The members of the Government Party here cannot be brought before the court and questioned to say what meaning they put on these words. Surely that will not be a matter for the courts.  The Dáil will have decreed not merely to take away the right, but to prevent that right being tested in court.  First we have the parading of the rights before the people, and then the subtraction of all the good that could be in that right by throwing it into the hands of the majority in the Dáil to destroy the whole benefits.  Deputy MacDermot is still concerned with the old Constitution. Article 9 of the old Constitution says&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The right of free expression of opinion as well as the right to assemble peaceably and without arms ... is guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality. Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class distinction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is a differently turned phrase from what is here?  The right of free expression of opinion is guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality.  We simply say that if there are any laws to be passed, there is this to be said, that they will contain no discrimination on account of politics, religion or class <Col N="200" /> distinction.  The Deputy has referred to Article 2A.  Now, whatever may be in Article 2A is also in this Constitution. There is in this Constitution the power to bring back Article 2A in all its terror and all its horror.  That is already in this Constitution which we are passing, so that whatever there was in Article 2A to terrify Deputy MacDermot with regard to the liberty of the Press, and any objection there was in that respect, is already in this Draft Constitution.</P>

      <P>We are discussing one of the fundamental rights of the citizens of this country.  We are discussing it in the Committee Stage. When these amendments were being debated on the last occasion the President said he would look into the matter.  The amendments were then held over indefinitely for later discussion. I do not see why there should be any attempt to strangle discussion on these amendments at the present moment.  If the rules of the House are wide enough to preclude these <Col N="201" /> being discussed, then the rules of the House are strangling discussion.  The amendment on the former occasion was not put to the House or ruled upon; it was withdrawn.</P>

It was subject to amendment, by agreement, on the next stage.  There is only one amendment before us now, amendment 49 (a).

I do not want to discuss it, but, if we cannot have a discussion on it, I suggest that we are having the purpose of this Assembly strangled by a rigid and narrow interpretation of the Standing Orders.

      <P>I want to make one last statement on this.  We propose to divide on this, to vote against this amendment proposed by the President. It is apparently put forward by the President as an indication that criticism of Government policy is not to be regarded as a contravention of the proviso in this Article.  We will vote against this amendment for the purpose of registering our protest on the Journals of this House that the right of free speech and the liberty of the Press are being infringed upon by this amendment and by the Article as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent I will be free to follow some of the arguments that have been put before the House in connection with this matter.  The first thing I cannot understand is Deputy McGilligan's attitude that this section somehow <Col N="202" /> withdraws from the cognisance of the courts the question as to whether a particular act will or will not infringe on the liberty of expression which is provided for here.  Surely the courts can, in regard to a particular act, say whether this was an infringement on rightful liberty or not?  Surely the courts will consider the question as to whether rightful liberty was being infringed upon or not?  I cannot understand the argument that this subsection withdraws anything from the cognisance of the courts.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of the whole argument?  As I pointed out in the previous debate on this it is to indicate clearly to the public that there is a rightful liberty and that there is an abuse of rightful liberty, and whilst lawyers who understand what is covered by the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; may be quite clear in their minds as to what is forbidden, the average citizen, who looks to this for his rights, may not understand it unless it is made clear.  The method by which it is made clear is that it is put as a duty, and I think a rightful duty, on the legislature, to endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, whilst preserving their rightful liberty of expression, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  That is my answer.  Should they be used, should they be permitted to undermine public order, morality and the authority of the State?</P>
      <P>Deputies have admitted that the authority of the State is already contained in &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo; Is there any harm in making explicit what is already implicit?  It is doubtful if we can get a net definition of public order and morality, such as Deputy Costello seems to have in mind.  It is founded, no doubt, on decisions of various kinds, but it is very difficult to get it in definite form.  We have tried to get a clear, well-cut, well-defined definition of &ldquo;public order and morality,&rdquo; and we have not been able to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the authority of the State, the only objection worth considering, in my opinion, that was raised to this <Col N="203" /> Article was raised when the suggestion was made that it might be argued that criticism of Government policy, or of the Government if you like&mdash;even legitimate criticism of the Government&mdash; might be held to be somehow undermining the authority of the State; that would be held to be excluded.  I have tried to meet that objection by making it quite clear that the rightful liberty which is guaranteed here includes that. I would say it would, even without express mention at all.  But, lest the undermining of the authority of the State somehow or other was being capable of being in any way construed to suggest that criticism of the Government was not permitted, then I proposed to introduce an amendment.  I do not care very much whether you put in &ldquo;Government policy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Government&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is. I think the construction of that whole clause is quite obvious.  You start off by saying there are three or four certain rights enumerated in different paragraphs, and then you put over and above the question of right, the right to express one's opinions.  You have a duty imposed, and it is in connection with the imposition of that duty on the Legislature that you have this subsidiary clause.  My own view is that it is better, in view of the doubts that were expressed, to include the amendment there.  I do not care very much whether it is amendment No. 49 (a).  It was policy that was suggested, and policy would, perhaps, cover wider things than the Government would cover.  Undoubtedly the conduct of a Department, in so far as it was an expression of Government <Col N="204" /> policy, could be rightfully criticised there.  I do not mind if you have both, but to say that introducing this makes it worse seems to me to be carrying some rules of construction to an absurd length.</P>

      <P>I know you cannot, but the Deputy knows they are capable of being applied in a very limited way, and there is nothing more nonsensical than to take rules of interpretation which are of a very well-defined character and say they apply somewhere else.  I think these rules of construction are easy to understand.  The situations where they apply are not difficult to recognise. But they are not applicable here. Any lawyer I have asked about this thing has been of the same opinion, that they do not apply here.  It is altogether a complete straining of these rules of construction to say they do apply here.  There is no use in arguing the matter further.  I have given it the consideration I promised. I have done my best to meet what I consider it was really necessary to meet in the suggestions from the other side, and I accordingly urge the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think the President has helped himself very much by the last remarks he has addressed to the House.  Here we have got a Constitution, and this Constitution is supposed to be clear and definite.  If the Constitution is to be of any value at all it should be a Constitution understandable by everybody. And yet we have the President gravely informing the House that he is using words here, &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo;, for which, as he says, it is utterly impossible to get a definition. He has struggled to get a definition and failed.  What is his difficulty in getting a definition?  Is it not as plain as a pikestaff?  His difficulty in getting a definition is that he does not understand what the phrase means.  Is that not perfectly plain?  The President has no idea of what is meant by &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; and of what it comprises or does not comprise he is <Col N="205" /> perfectly in ignorance.  If he were not, why cannot he have a definition?  Why cannot he even give a loose paraphrase to the House?</P>
      <P>Take his next point.  So far as I could gather from him, he thinks that the ordinary rules of construction do not apply here.  That is what I understood him to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That putting forth one thing limits the general proposition put previously&mdash;is that the rule of construction which he says does not apply, and if so, will he tell us why it does not apply?  He then goes on to say that the courts can interfere. Can the courts interfere?  Here you have a very curious thing.  You give a general statement here, to begin with&mdash; the guarantee of the State&mdash;but then you go on to set out the limitations, and they are that the State shall do certain things.  &ldquo;The State shall endeavour ...&rdquo; is an extraordinary expression, because I do not know how the State, as a State, can act itself. I presume what is meant by the State there is the Oireachtas.  I do not know what else it can mean and if it has any other meaning I should like to hear it. If the State there means the Oireachtas, there is a special duty put upon the Oireachtas.  It has not merely its ordinary duty, a general duty, but a specific duty put upon it which it must interpret itself.  How can you tell the State how to do certain things? To tell the Oireachtas and to make it compulsory upon it that it shall endeavour&mdash;it is not &ldquo;may endeavour&rdquo; but &ldquo;shall endeavour&rdquo;&mdash;to pass laws to the effect that certain things, while preserving the &ldquo;rightful liberty of expression&rdquo; shall not be used to undermine public order and morality, is surely making it the judge.  Putting a duty upon a person is surely making him the judge.  Telling him specifically &ldquo;You are to pass laws which, in your judgement, do that&rdquo;&mdash;what is that but giving him complete control and taking it away from the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What help are these particular words?  I do not know what the words are at present.  There seem to me to be two amendments before the <Col N="206" /> House, one of them referring to the Government and the other to Government policy, and I do not know which the President has moved and which he is relying on.  Let us take either of them.  &ldquo;Criticism of the Government&rdquo;&mdash;it has already been pointed out that that is a practically meaningless expression.  &ldquo;Criticism of Government policy&rdquo;&mdash;what does that mean? What is Government policy?  It is not Executive action.  There are two things.  There is criticism of the Government, which, I take it, is criticism of the joint personnel of the Government, and there is criticism of Government policy, which, I take it, is the policy they put into legislation; but where is the vital thing&mdash;criticism of Executive action?  Is not Executive action, much more than legislation, the matter which is likely to be criticised? There is no safeguard here as to criticism of Executive action.  Why not?  Yet you express policy and you direct the Dáil, and this Dáil is directing future Oireachtas to legislate on grounds which will allow criticism of Government policy.  Is that directly not telling them to legislate on grounds which will prohibit criticism of Executive action?</P>

      <P>The Deputy puts the point precisely.  I wonder would the Deputy answer the question: Does the inclusion of the phrase prevent the passage of law which would exclude the use of the exercise of free expression of opinion tending to undermine the Government through the criticism of Ministers?  Does the phrase &ldquo;undermine the authority of the State&rdquo; override the including criticism of Government policy?  Presumably, it does.  If there was to be an exercise of the right of free expression which would concern itself ostensibly with criticism of Government policy, but could be ruled on by the courts, if the courts ever got a chance of ruling on it, as undermining the authority of the State, would the phrase now sought to be included stop the passage of that law?  I suggest not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that criticism of Government policy is being defined by this amendment as something that does not undermine the authority of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that then, there could only be criticism of Government policy which would undermine the authority of the State.  That is what the Deputy believes.  So long as it was a criticism of Government policy, no matter how far it went, it could never have about it the atmosphere or the aim of undermining the authority of the State.</P>

Who is going to be the judge as to whether the matter sought to be suppressed is legitimate criticism of Government policy or whether it has advanced into the dangerous region of being something tending to undermine the authority of the State?  Is it the courts?  I suggest not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been deprived of the benefits of the President's presence for a little while.  We were arguing as to whether the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;including criticism of Government policy&rdquo; overrides the phrase &ldquo;undermining the authority of the State.&rdquo;  I suggest it does not.  I suggest that if the courts could ever have knowledge of a law of that type, and if they came to the conclusion that the matter tended to the undermining of the authority of the State, the mere fact that it was put up in the form of criticism of Government policy would not save it.  I suggest that that is right.  I simply want to know who is going to judge as to whether the suppression of free speech has been properly done because it undermines the authority of the State, or has been improperly done because it is merely a criticism of Government policy.  It is not going to be the courts, I suggest. If the President tells me it is, I want to ask him why has he put this matter about undermining public order and morality into the section which deals with laws and has not kept it in the overriding section which deals with constitutional rights?</P>
      <P>I suggest that there is only one result.  Whether it is the result of its being divided, I cannot say.  In the first two lines, where the written guarantees are given, the authority to decide is the courts.  When you come down and talk about the laws that may be passed, the mind that will decide is the collective body of the Dáil by a majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy believes that a law passed to prevent free <Col N="209" /> speech can be taken to the courts. On what ground?  On the ground that it is not a proper use of the power given in the Constitution?  The power given in the Constitution does not set up anybody as the authority to decide.  It does not say that it is to be established to the satisfaction of anybody.  It simply says that the State&mdash;as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has pointed out, the &ldquo;State&rdquo; in this case must mean the Oireachtas &mdash;shall endeavour to ensure that certain organs of public opinion shall not be used in a particular way.  If the Dáil comes to the conclusion that the use of the Press, the radio or the cinema is going to undermine public authority, and should be suppressed, no court will inquire into that.  The Dáil will not even refer to this unless it gets back to the habit, abandoned some time ago, of putting Preambles to its Bills.  Otherwise, there will be no advertence to this undermining of public order or morality or the authority of the State. The Dáil will simply pass a law. There is no constitutional safeguard.</P>
      <P>Even on the question of constitutional safeguard, I cannot understand the President.  He says that the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; is difficult to define.  Because it is difficult to define, he thinks he makes it clear by using it a second time. How you make anything clear by using it twice, I do not know.  &ldquo;Subject to public order and morality&rdquo; in the constitutional provision is a difficult matter.  How difficult it is will only be seen when cases arise, and these cases will be decided, on the first two lines, by the judges. We are to take this first vague phrase and clarify it by putting it in again, according to the President.</P>

      <P>Let me put it this way&mdash;whether it is or not wise to say that these organs of opinion will preserve their right to liberty of expression and of criticising the Government or Government policy.  I suggest that it is an obvious improvement to put in these words and that it is only special pleading to suggest that it is not.  I said at an earlier stage that I, personally, would rather that the whole of that paragraph were out.  But I see in it the consequence of a protracted agitation which has been going on for the last six months from which I feared worse things than we are actually faced with here.  It amuses me to think that at the time I was having a Press controversy about free speech, the <i>Irish Independent</i> was giving great publicity to letters from people who were against free speech.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke of the term &ldquo;public order and morality.&rdquo;  I do not want anybody to think that I regard these words as without meaning because I said it was not possible to give an exact or net definition of them.  They have a meaning.  However, they are of an elastic type.  Categories of offences are given in text books which would be regarded as against public order and morality.  It would, in the end, I take it, be left to the courts to determine whether a particular offence was or was not against public order or morality&mdash;<Col N="211" /> that is, in general terms, the peace and general welfare of the community.  As it is important that the authority of the State should not be wrongfully undermined by the abuse of liberty, it was desirable that that matter should be indicated, so that there would be no doubt whatever that it came under the heading of one of the offences which could be committed.  There is no difficulty in my mind except that the term &ldquo;authority of the State,&rdquo; whether you put it in that form or leave it under the phrase &ldquo;public order and morality,&rdquo; might be held to preclude legitimate criticism of the Government inasmuch as it might be said that undermining the authority of the Government by criticism would destroy its authority and would, therefore, be regarded as tending to destroy the authority of the State.  In the amendment I have endeavoured fairly to meet that position. I am, therefore, pressing amendment No. 49A.</P>

      <P>To my mind, this is absolute sheer nonsense.  It says that &ldquo;provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace.&rdquo;  Now, who is to determine in accordance with law, and what law are they to be determined in accordance with?  All laws, of course, that are inconsistent with this are now swept away.  All pre-existing laws which control the right of the citizen to assemble peaceably without arms are abolished, except so far as they are saved by this clause. Here you say that provision may be made in the future to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law to be calculated to cause a breach of the peace. As I say, all pre-existing laws are done away with, and you have no power to make any alteration, even if there were any existing laws, because you have no power except the particular law to prevent or to control meetings.  You have got no power to define for the future what class of meetings shall be prevented.  You must first get a determination&mdash;I do not know whether that means a determination by the courts or not&mdash;that a meeting is calculated to cause a breach of the peace, and when you have got that determination you may <Col N="215" /> then by law prevent or control it. To my mind, the section is simply humbug.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I do not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that it is humbug.  I think it is very dangerous.  I think this is a limitation on the existing right of public meeting.  We know what the right of public meeting was.  Anybody who has been a student of Dicey's Constitutional Law remembers the appendix to the book where the right of public meeting is explained as being merely the right of one person to talk to another, multiplied in accordance with the number of people that are there in the exercise of that right. Here we have an entirely different matter.  We are providing for a particular method of exercising that right which does not exist at the present moment.  We are providing that the exercise of that right may be determined and controlled by law.  In other words, a law may be passed by this House providing that any ordinary Civic Guard on point duty may think it his duty to prevent a public meeting in College Green if he likes. That is what it means, if it means anything at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have the lawyers differing on the opposite benches.  That is rather interesting. I certainly cannot follow Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in his difficulty about the section.  To me it seems clear enough that the Oireachtas can make laws to prevent or control meetings which are determined in accordance with law, which, I take it, will be made for that purpose, the determination to be set out as to the conditions under which meetings will be prevented or controlled.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to assemble peaceably and without arms is the general guaranteed constitutional right, but I do not think it would be possible for the State to continue without <Col N="216" /> having some method in the public interest&mdash;we have exercised it in the past&mdash;of controlling or preventing meetings that might, in certain conditions, lead to a breach of the peace.  That power must be safeguarded somehow, and the object of this section is to safeguard the power of the Legislature to pass laws which will be proper for the maintenance of public peace and to prevent the abuse or the misuse of the right of public meetings.  Again, if there were a situation in which there was an obvious abuse of its power, I take it that the courts would interfere and say that it was an abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  There is a general indication there of a right to be used properly: that is, without endangering the public safety.  You must give to the Legislature the power of regulating the exercise of these rights in such a manner as to ensure that the exercise of these rights will not be contrary to the public good.  That is absolutely necessary; you cannot avoid it, and you cannot tie yourself up by precluding the Legislature from doing it.  The Deputy may say: Then what is the good of your phrase here at all&mdash;this phrase about the right of the citizens to assemble peaceably?  He may ask, what is its value?  I say that it is of value, and that it is a general headline to the Legislature.</P>

It is vain to attempt to do it.  All we can do is to set headlines for the Legislature, as we are doing here&mdash;headlines with regard to the things the Legislature should aim at.  If, however, you are going to guarantee this right, without its being subject to some control&mdash; and there is no way to control it properly except in this way&mdash;if you give that right and guarantee it, without giving any opportunity to the Legislature to exercise control over meetings, then it is quite clear that you would have a state of chaos.

      <P>Nobody has suggested at any time that there should be an unlimited right of public meeting. Nobody has suggested at any time that disorderly assembly should be carried on, or anything of that kind.  However, we have got a very interesting admission now from the President as to what is the meaning of a constitutional guarantee, and the definition we have got from the President of a constitutional guarantee is that the constitutional guarantee is to be nothing more than a headline to the Oireachtas as to what it is to do; but as a guarantee to the subject, which it is supposed to be, against the Oireachtas&mdash;as a guarantee to the citizens of the State of certain rights that the Oireachtas shall not have power to interfere with&mdash;we now discover that it is not that guarantee at all but that it is just a headline for the Oireachtas.

If it is to be a question between the general good of the community and the good of the individual, the determination of that, in any particular case, will have to be left to the Legislature which, after all, is composed of the representatives of the people, who are interested in preserving the individual rights, and many of us who are arguing here for leaving the door open so that the Legislature may be in a position to deal with any circumstances that might arise, would probably find ourselves, in a particular case, arguing not on the side that a law should be enacted, but against the enactment of that law.  For instance, if this question came up that we had a moment ago&mdash;the question of the liberty of expression&mdash;I would probably find myself against any use of that power which would create another evil which might be more dangerous than the evil we are trying to deal with.</P>

      <P>The President talks about the balance.  Now, let us look at this balance.  On the one hand, we have a public right given, subject to public order and morality and subject to the determination of the courts, and immediately we find that provision may be made by law to prevent or control meetings, and once a law is passed here the courts cannot touch it.  Provision may be made to prevent or control meetings which are determined by law to be calculated to be a danger.  The ordinary way that it is determined that they are calculated to be a danger is that it is left to a member of the Government or a member of the Civic Guards to say that such a meeting is calculated to do certain things. Accordingly, the law comes along and says that a Civic Guard can say that a meeting is calculated to be a danger or a nuisance to the general public, and out goes the right to peaceable assembly.</P>

      <P>It can pass such a law under this.  This phrase not merely invites them to pass such a law, but gives them the power to do it, shows them the way to do it, and tells them how easy it is to do it. It says that all you have to do is to get some law passed here, and it will rule when meetings are declared to be calculated to be a danger or a nuisance.  First of all, you have the liberty for the exercise of the right guaranteed, subject to public order and morality, and public order and morality is analysed and determined by the independent judiciary.  What do we put instead of it?  We find that the Dáil in its wisdom may pass some piece of legislation giving over, say, <Col N="220" /> to a Minister&mdash;probably the Minister for Justice&mdash;or to a Civic Guard, the question of the determination of this matter, and once either of them pronounces, then the courts are ousted. That is the balance the President talks about.  Did the President ever read, or did he ever see, the play, &ldquo;Thompson in Tír-na-nÓg&rdquo;?  The Thompson in the play was a man who wanted all his rights and who went around parading with his &ldquo;ould gun&rdquo; until one day it went off and he was &ldquo;blew up,&rdquo; to use his own phrase? Well, I think there is a great deal of that in this parading of rights in this Constitution and that they may be &ldquo;blew up&rdquo; too.</P>

      <P>In page 86, lines 33 and 34, Article 41, Section 2, to delete the words &ldquo;life within the home&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;work for the home&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to direct attention to the phrase in the Draft &ldquo;in particular the State recognises that by her life within the home&rdquo;.  I was not present when the speeches were made on a similar amendment on the previous stage, but as I read the debates, the attitude of the President was that he was insisting on woman's value in life and what women did in the way of adding value to life.  He happens to have enclosed all that by the phrase &ldquo;life within the home&rdquo;.  I do not think these words, &ldquo;within the home&rdquo;, should have been used at all, but seeing that an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;within&rdquo; was deleted I am now moving to delete the words &ldquo;life within the home&rdquo; and to substitute the words &ldquo;work for the home&rdquo;.  That will mean that whenever we do look at whatever women do, in order to ascertain what value is to be associated with it, we shall look at the work done, not merely within <Col N="221" /> the home but what has to be done for, and towards, the upkeep of the home.</P>

I do not know whether he is prepared to consider it still or whether he has decided against it.  My suggestion was to substitute the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; for &ldquo;life&rdquo;, the idea being that &ldquo;life&rdquo; might be read to imply the whole of woman's active life in the home, whereas if you use the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; we might cover woman's function in the home and other activities outside.</P>

      <P>Nothing in this section, however, shall be invoked to prohibit, control, or interfere with any citizen proposing to engage or being engaged in any legitimate occupation for remuneration.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment to remove an anxiety that is said to have been induced by the phrasing of sub-section 2º.  We were told that this Article was framed in the interests of women, and that we were going to prevent women being driven out to do work to the neglect of their duties in the home.

The State having acknowledged the work that is done in the home by women performing their duties to the family, the clause states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The State shall endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised a point and gave me an example on the last day.  The only point raised was whether the phrase as it stood would mean that the mere dissolution of a marriage&mdash;whether, according to our law, it was a valid marriage or not; whether it was invalid <i>ab initio</i>, or was a valid marriage according to our law&mdash;would, of itself, prevent one of the persons involved from marrying here.  That was pointed out by the Deputy, and I think it has been met by this amendment.  No other point of that sort has been raised.  Naturally, a matter of this importance was <Col N="226" /> one which did receive very careful consideration, and if Deputies raise any particular points about it we will be able to meet them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 90, Article 42, Section 4, line 1, after the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;including school books, requisites and a free meal during school hours for each child attending school.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this Constitution we are setting out to declare that the State shall provide free primary education, presumably for children of school-going age.  As we are making a constitutional provision for education of a primary character, I think we ought to go further in that respect, and recognise that the mere provision of primary education, in existing circumstances, is not adequate provision, having regard to the moral responsibility which ought to devolve upon the State to ensure that education is imparted in the best possible circumstances and under conditions which will enable the children to absorb the maximum amount of education.  The object of this amendment, therefore, is to provide that the State shall supply free primary education, including school books, requisites and a free meal during school hours for each child attending school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is well within the knowledge of members of the House that, in the case of thousands of children who are at present required to go to school, their parents are not in an economic position to purchase school books for them.  The result is that we have schools provided, we have teachers provided, but through economic necessity the children are forced to go to school without school books, and have to try to absorb education by looking over the shoulder of another child to see what subject is being taught. Similarly, we have children going to school whose parents are in such an economic plight that it is not possible for them to provide the children with sufficient food in order that their frail bodies may be equipped for the task of absorbing education.  Again, economic <Col N="227" /> necessity is the root cause of that kind of evil and that kind of hardship which is inflicted upon school-going children.  The object, therefore, of this amendment is to ensure that if the State is providing free primary education it should also provide school books, requisites and a free meal during school-going hours, so that every child attending school may have an opportunity of absorbing education free from those disabilities which go hand in hand with economic depression in the child's family.  I think if the State wants to endow education in this way they ought to recognise that education does not merely consist in providing a school building and a teacher, but should also include the provision of books, requisites and a meal at school.  In asking that that should be done here, I am not making any unusual or revolutionary demand, because in many other countries school meals and school books are provided for school-going children.  Under a Constitution which says that the family has inalienable and imprescriptible rights, I think the best way in which that could be recognised would be by ensuring that the children in the family would be provided with education under circumstances which would enable them to derive the maximum benefit from such educational facilities as are provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I think matters of that sort can very well be left to be dealt with by law.  Where there are questions of public controversy we cannot decide them in the Constitution.  If I were to argue that question, or enter into a discussion of the merits of it, apart from the Constitution, there are many things I would <Col N="228" /> have to say about it.  I agree that it seems to be waste to provide teachers if proper education cannot be given, and if an essential necessity is not being provided.  There is another side to the picture.  The question is: how can we best, so that there will be least abuse and most value, meet that situation? I have for a long time held the view that there is a great deal of waste about books in schools.  I think the present position about text books in schools, and text books generally is a deplorable one, but it is not an easy one to rectify.  I hope to see that situation met in some way in a relatively short time.  I think there should be at least cheap books.  I am afraid of completely free books, but cheap books ought to be available.  If we had suitable text books, I think the old system, by which a book in a family was passed from one child to another, by which the elder children were able to become private tutors, so to speak, to the younger ones, and parents who had used the same text books were also able to be tutors, was very much better than the present system.  Every household in which there are children is full of books that, in some cases, are worthless, and that seem to me to be almost rubbish. However, that is another day's work. I am not going into the merits of the question now.  It is not a matter we could deal with in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 92, Article 44, Section 2, to delete sub-section 2º, and substitute the following two sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2º.  The State guarantees not to endow any religion.</P>
      <P>3º.  The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief, or status.</P>
      <P>That is simply to carry out the promise which I gave to separate the question of endowment from the general question of imposing disability on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>

      <P>I want to ask him that seriously.  Deputy Keely told me on an amendment I was moving earlier that, if some words of mine were accepted, and if there was a conscription law passed, there could not be an exception made in favour of the clergy. Let me read what the President has: &ldquo;The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status&rdquo;.  So that if there is conscription, the clergy are in with the rest.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>Deputy Keely <Col N="231" /> thought my words were an insidious attack on the Church.  I said it was a matter for derision.  The President does not say so.  I was proposing a rough and ready amendment, and, naturally, my words were not very definitely considered.  Consider this, if the Constitution is to carry, in the religious section, this phrase: &ldquo;2º.  The State guarantees not to endow any religion: 3º.  The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.&rdquo;  If there is going to be conscription, can you exempt the clergy under that?</P>

      <P>I see Deputy Keely has arrived.  The President's view now is that there could be an exemption made in favour of the clergy generally, but not in favour of one body as against another.  Is that what is meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say the meaning is, as it was in the old Constitution, that you were not to discriminate unjustly as between persons of one religious belief and another.  I think that is clearly the meaning of it there.  I do not think that that would prevent the Legislature from discriminating and relieving clergymen if it thought wise from the application of a conscription law.  What you could not <Col N="232" /> do is, you could not do it for one religious belief and not give the same concession to others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If &ldquo;belief&rdquo; were the only word in it the argument is sound, but once you put in &ldquo;profession or status&rdquo; it extends it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may think that that is the interpretation, but I have given mine.  The meaning in the context is clear.  I have no doubt that the meaning in the context is that there shall not be unfair discrimination in favour of those of one religious belief, and unjust discrimination against those of another.  I think it is quite clear that that is the meaning.  If we have to bring Deputy Keely's point into this connection, I would say that, if you wanted authority for making an exemption, you could do it on the ground of having due regard for social function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Discrimination on the ground of religious profession means that you can discriminate between all clergy and the laity, but you cannot discriminate between the clergy <i>inter se.</i>  That is not in the Article.  I do not care what is meant.  We will not have this Article with the glosses on it here&mdash; we will have the Article alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seriously suggested that that allows discrimination as between the clergy as a body and the laity as a body, while it does not allow discrimination between groups of clergy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hold, yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You may hold that in a very sincere way, but it is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the ground of different religious belief or status. <Col N="233" /> Clearly that would carry what is said, but that is not there.  It is on the ground of religious profession.  Supposing there is a conscription law passed and a general exemption of the clergy in it, surely it is a law making a discrimination on the ground of religious profession.  What else is it? I do not care whether it should be there or not, but we must argue on the merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into the matter from the point of view of the whole context.  That is a repetition of the clause that was in the old Constitution. I told the House why I thought it wise to take advantage of these Articles.  We lived under them for a number of years.  There had been no criticism of them.  They were found satisfactory.  We adopted these and the word &ldquo;discrimination,&rdquo; too.  I think that in the whole of that context the intention is clear that it is discrimination in favour of one denomination against another; an unfair discrimination is the meaning there.  I would deny, straight off, Deputy McGilligan's contention.  I do not see anything wrong with the clause.  If this were a single clause and we were asked to determine what was its meaning, I could only say that discrimination would be only differentiation; although unjust discrimination is in some contexts unfair discrimination.  But in this context I would have to admit that discrimination here would be on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status, and would seem to imply that you could not make an exemption if you are depending on that alone.  But my point is we are not depending on that alone.  There is a clear indication that &ldquo;social function&rdquo; would cover it.  However, on further examination, if there is anything to be covered by that, I am prepared to look into it; but unless there is very good reason for changing it, I prefer to leave it as it was for a number of years.  I do not want to introduce any new element.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The State guarantees not to endow any religion.&rdquo; The distinction there is endowment of <Col N="234" /> religion.  Then there are three other conditions&mdash;religious profession, belief or status.  Religious belief means what the President is arguing about. Religious profession means something. What do they mean?  What do they add to the phrase &ldquo;religious belief&rdquo;? Article 8 of the old Constitution did speak of making &ldquo;any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to look into it again.  I did satisfy myself that the word &ldquo;status&rdquo; did cover this and that it had a meaning in the old Constitution and was intended to cover a very definite matter.  At the moment it had escaped my memory.  I will look into it again and see how the matter stands in the light of criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 96, Article 45, Section 3, sub-section 2º, line 5, before the word &ldquo;against&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and the workers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section opens with: &ldquo;The State shall endeavour to secure that <Col N="235" /> private enterprise shall so be conducted as to ensure reasonable efficiency in the production and distribution of goods and as to protect the public against unjust exploitation.&rdquo;  We have a declaration here that it is desirable to protect the public against unjust exploitation.  I would imagine in providing an Article of that kind the President would have thought of those who are actually engaged in that kind of enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are &ldquo;the public&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the consumers of the goods produced by the enterprise. If the enterprise happened to be a bacon factory, a worker in it who did not like bacon would not be a consumer. We have an Article here saying that private enterprise shall be conducted so as to ensure reasonable efficiency in the production and distribution of goods.  The Article refers to the public in that context.  Surely that is meant to protect the public against exploitation in the production and distribution charges or to protect the public from being held up to ransom in order to obtain unreasonably high prices for goods produced. In this Article it is apparently only those who are likely to be exploited as consumers who are protected.  There is no protection given to those who are immediately employed in the enterprise. Such protection given is for those who were consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody would hold that the term &ldquo;public&rdquo; used here would include those who are actually workers engaged in the industry. Therefore, if this Constitution is to have an Article protecting anybody against unjust exploitation from private enterprise, surely the protection ought to be for those who were actually engaged in the enterprise and who may be exploited and who are a greater subject for exploitation by the enterprise in the form of asking them to work for low wages or for long hours and under such conditions as would constitute a very severe hardship upon them.  If the President thinks that &ldquo;the public&rdquo; includes <Col N="236" />&ldquo;workers&rdquo; I do not think he is correct in his contention.  If it is to include the workers this section ought to be given a better definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Article reads: &ldquo;shall be so conducted... as to protect the public against unjust exploitation.&rdquo; The question is &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; I take it, as opposed to the private owner.  If the word citizen were used the Deputy would not object.  The view that the Deputy takes is that in his particular context what you want to prevent is the exploitation of the consumer.  That would be narrower than the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; used here. However, I will put in the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;public.&rdquo;  It will then read &ldquo;to protect the citizen against unjust exploitation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The section opens with the declaration that private enterprise shall be so conducted as to ensure reasonable efficiency as regards production and distribution, and as to protect the public against unjust exploitation.

      <P>It will be approved as a headline for the Legislature. The difference between Deputy Norton and myself is this: I would rather have a comprehensive term to cover, as Deputy MacDermot suggested, all concerned, both the workers and the owners.  I could imagine conditions in which the owners were being exploited, too.  I do not want to indicate that it is only for a certain section or certain sections of the people. The word &ldquo;public&rdquo; was the widest word to cover all that.  The Deputy is reading it as if &ldquo;the public&rdquo; meant those not actually engaged in the enterprise &mdash; what I might call the outside public.  I am afraid the criticism of Deputy McGilligan would be more or less against the use of the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; if we were consistently going to use &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in the sense in which it is defined as being a person of <Col N="240" /> Irish nationality, belonging to the nation.</P>

      <P>May I put it this way to Deputy Mrs. Concannon, that if I admonish her to-morrow that her great-grandfather's great-grandaunt did not think a certain type of legislation was good legislation, and she ought not to approve of it, she would probably reply that the aunt died somewhere in 1692 and the views that obtained then do not obtain now.  This Article simply puts on record the current opinion of the great great grand-uncles of our great great grand-nephews.  This is supposed to direct Oireachtas Eireann for all time, and it is addressed to posterity, if you please.  What on earth would our great-grandchildren care about what we think is a desirable form of law?  It is quite a different thing if we lay down a fundamental law and give people constitutional rights, because if you want to change that law you first have to convince the people that it should be changed.  But you need never change anything to depart from Article 45.  Therefore, two courses are open, one, to pay no heed to it, and the other is to let everybody put in a word.  It does not matter what you put in or what you do not put in; it has no effect on anybody at any time or anywhere.</P>

I do not think that the workers need safeguarding, that they need special protection, because we have the whole system of social legislation which will be dealing with that aspect.  The intention was that the words &ldquo;the public&rdquo; would protect all concerned, but &ldquo;all concerned&rdquo; seems by itself a rather indefinite phrase.</P>

      <P>In page 96, Article 45, Section 4, to delete sub-section 2º, and substitute the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2º.  The State shall endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children shall not be abused and that citizens shall not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their sex, age or strength.</P>
      <P>I already indicated that I would accept the first part of the amendment which Deputy Rowlette moved on Committee Stage, the amendment of which this is part.  He suggested that there, with an earlier part, were two propositions, and I feel that that would be out of the context.  That particular part introduced propositions which, if they were to be put in at all, would be more appropriate elsewhere. We say in part of the Constitution that the citizens may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, and the first part of the proposition is not really <i>ad rem.</i></P>

He has said that it would be irrelevant to this section, and I am not quarrelling with the view; but if he does not quarrel with the sentiment, it seems to me a very fundamental thing that <Col N="243" /> it should be got in somewhere.  So far as I can see, there is no statement anywhere in the Constitution that women have an economic equality with men. The President has stated, and I agree with him, that they are given political equality in the Constitution, but I do not see anywhere that they are given economic equality or economic freedom and I would ask him again to consider it to see where he could best fit it in.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rowlette ought to remember &mdash; I hope he will pardon my reminding him &mdash; that an amendment of mine, amendment No. 54, was refused to-night.  In the section dealing with the family and in the particular section dealing with mothers, I moved to insert: &ldquo;Nothing in this section&rdquo;&mdash;the matter dealing with mothers&mdash;&ldquo;shall operate to prevent, prohibit or interfere with any citizen proposing to engage or engaging in any legitimate occupation for remuneration.&rdquo; That was refused.  The dagger is still unsheathed.  It is there for use and women may be discriminated against definitely and entirely on the ground of sex in respect of employment. I have amendment No. 61 down but I do not care much about discussing it or any amendment to Article 45, it having the status it has in the Constitution, but let us consider what happens.  We opened that Article with a section in which we mark out for distinction the inadequate strength of women and the tender age of children, and we went on solemnly to declare, for the general guidance of the Oireachtas, that women or children should not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their sex, age or strength.  I wanted to remove from that the reference to women so that the section would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The State shall endeavour to secure that the tender age of children shall not be abused and that they should not be forced to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President does a double twist and where we previously pointed to the inadequate strength of women and children, we now, if it pleases you, <Col N="244" /> point to the inadequate strength of the whole lot of us, men, women and children.  We now solemnly give, for the guidance of the Oireachtas, this admonition:</P>
    <P>The State shall endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children...</P>
    <P>the children still get special mention of their age</P>
    <P>.... shall not be abused ....</P>
    <P>the sting is still in the tail</P>
    <P>.... and that citizens shall not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited...</P>
    <P>to what?  Their sex, age or strength. Cut out the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo;.  Why leave it in?</P>

      <P>I have said to the Deputy that we cannot, with our eyes open, close every possible door from the point of view of social legislation which will be to the benefit of the community as a whole.  The point is that you are leaving these questions as a matter for the future to determine.  We are looking for rights that were not guaranteed hitherto, and what I am prepared to stand on definitely is that men and women are entitled to and have an equal right to a livelihood, being members of the community.  A further right than that I cannot see.  I doubt very much whether two men have an equal right to a particular occupation.  I do not think they have. Differences of capacity might make one of them quite unfitted, and if we are going to read &ldquo;an equal right to work&rdquo; as meaning that if there is a particular position vacant, two of us have the same right to it, I think it <Col N="246" /> would be absurd.  We would not have the same right to it.  It would depend on our ability to perform the work. You cannot say off-hand that citizens shall have a right to work if by that you mean other than the right to earn a livelihood.  You cannot restrict it and be honest.  Whether they be men or women, well-equipped or ill-equipped, they have a right to a means of livelihood.  That is a fundamental right.</P>

      <P>Because there is a host of other things not mentioned. There is no pretence that this Constitution is a complete catalogue of individual and family rights.  We are trying to provide certain foundations for <Col N="247" /> a State organisation and, on the social side, we are providing certain directives. An equal right to work is not a thing that can be predicated of men or women.  I do not think it is a true proposition.  Whether they be men or women, well endowed or ill-endowed by nature for the competition which exists, they are entitled to an adequate means of livelihood. From that point of view, there is equality of right.  I am quite prepared to put that into an appropriate section of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I shall try again. This is something apart, and it is hard to get a suitable place in which to insert it.  The right that should be guaranteed by the community is, I think, the right to an adequate means of livelihood. What is &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; would be difficult to define, and we do not want to have vexatious cases brought before the courts.  If we put it in the courts section we would have such cases.</P>

      <P>The best we could do would be to indicate somewhere in Article 45 that we recognise it as a fundamental right that citizens should have access to an adequate means of livelihood through their occupation, or, if that fails, through community action. An equal right to work might mean an equal right to a particular post, which would be absurd.  I shall try to get in what I have said somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has talked profoundly and sincerely about the value of these fundamental human rights.  When it comes to translating sentiment into action, he is merely prepared to embody this phrase in Article 45, which opens with the delightfully innocuous declaration that the application of the principle contained in it shall not be cognisable under any of the provisions of the Constitution.  The President could put almost anything into Article 45 because there is no means of enforcing the right.  The President agrees with Deputy Rowlette that this provision should be made, and then proceeds &mdash; I do not think he intends to do so &mdash; to sell him a pup in the kennel labelled &ldquo;Article 45.&rdquo;  The President could not only give Deputy Rowlette the right he asked for in this Article, but he could give him a sack of rights.  What is wanted is a right enforceable by law. Why not put the right into an Article other than 45?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware of the fact that Mr. John Flynn, Lognavadogue, <Col N="108" /> Turlogh, County Mayo, though willing to pay his annuity and unable to do so through the neglect of the Irish Land Commission to furnish him with a receivable order, has had demanded from him the amount due together with costs of notice 5/-, and costs of seizure £1 9s. 5d., by the sheriff for County Mayo; and if he is further aware that this is not an isolated case and that other annuitants have been similarly rendered unable to pay their annuities through the failure of the Irish Land Commission to furnish them with receivable orders, and in such cases is the Land Commission prepared to refund all costs and expenses, including sheriff's fees incurred by such annuitants, and, further, to ask the Minister if he is aware that the notice sent out by the sheriff was not addressed to Mr. John Flynn, but was in the name of his deceased father.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not aware that John Flynn is in occupation of the holding referred to as he has not lodged documentary evidence of his title thereto.  A receivable order for £2 3s. 5d. was issued in respect of the December, 1933, gale to William Flynn whose name appears in the Land Commission records and this instalment was paid and the receipted receivable order returned in the ordinary course.  This receivable order made provision for payment of all gales to June, 1936, inclusive.  The Land Commission records show that the instalment from June, 1934, to December, 1935, inclusive were paid by reference to the six-day notices issued to the tenant.  Receivable orders are issued to all tenant purchasers and the Land Commission have no power to forego payment in any case of costs incurred by reason of default in paying the instalments of annuity as they accrue due.</P>
