      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon (for Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the Executive Council have considered the question of terminating diplomatic relations with the Ministry at Valencia, Spain, and of taking steps leading to the recognition of General Franco's Government, and what decision they have reached in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of Saorstát Eireann as a member of the European Community of Nations is to take its share in establishing and maintaining peace and stability.  In pursuance of that policy it is our intention to follow the normal rules relating to recognition which the Deputy will find formulated generally in Deputy MacDermot's question of yesterday.  Any departure from these rules based on long experience would be more likely to do harm than good.  That is the view of practically all the States of the world. Diplomatic relations between this country and Spain were established on the 3rd September, 1935, that is, long before the events leading to the present terrible conditions.  The assumption that Governments in diplomatic relations with Spain condone the horrors which have been committed against nuns, priests and civilians simply because they have not formally accredited their representatives to General Franco's Government is without any foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Minister for External Affairs, will he say does he think it desirable that this country should hold itself out amongst the nations of the world as one which considers it desirable and <Col N="486" /> expedient to maintain diplomatic relations with a Government that is notoriously Communist and which is primarily concerned in Spain at present to drive religion out of that country and to deny the very existence of God?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Minister to Spain has been sent to St. Jean-de-Luz in French territory where a number of the representatives formerly resident in Madrid are now stationed.  He will be able from there to keep in touch with both sides and safeguard as far as possible the interests of Irish citizens in all parts of Spain.  Our representative will, of course, supply us with reports on the situation as he finds it, but the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement by the existing circumstances must necessarily narrow the scope of these reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that persons have applied for National Health Insurance benefit and have been left for over two months without any answer to their application; if he will state how many cases of people in such circumstances have come under the Minister's notice, who, in spite of weekly doctors' certificates, have been left without any reply, and if he intends to take any steps to ensure that these members will be placed in as favourable a position as they occupied under the former insurance societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that persons who have applied for benefit to Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte have been left over for two months without any reply.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Society that claims are examined on the day of receipt and cheques issued to local agents for delivery on the following day unless there is some irregularity in the claim.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence in the Department which would support the allegation made in the second part of the question.  Complaints of the nature indicated, if they have occurred at all, are extremely rare.  I am satisfied that insured persons are not in a less favourable position than that which they occupied under the former approved societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I wish to say that I am afraid I had a very rare case.  I got a reply which I do not propose to go into except to say that, apparently, there is a point made by the insurance society that the notice of illness was delayed.  Well, in the case of a lad in a lodginghouse, he has not got a whole lot of resources in the way of messengers or other attendants.  I would ask the Minister to look into cases such as this, because the circumstances go to show that the permanent officials of the smaller and older societies in the past were in contact with their members in a way that does not appear to be possible under the present régime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the case concerning which Deputy Dockrell wrote to the National Health Insurance organisation.  I have gone into it fully, and I have all the letters and other documents supplied, and as far as I can see, the delay that arose was definitely due to the fact that the insured person did not comply with the regulations.</P>

      <P>Of the persons who lost their employment at Messrs.

Of this number, three men were discharged, <Col N="490" /> amongst others, in consequence of redundancy.  Before these discharges took place all the temporary staff at the exchange were interviewed and their domestic circumstances ascertained, so as to ensure the minimum of hardship in the selection of those to whom it was necessary to give notice.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that one of the persons so discharged, after four years' service in the exchange in rather important work, was discharged in spite of the fact that he had a widowed mother and a brother and sister to look after, both of whom had been unemployed for long periods?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether James Sharkey, of Burtonport, County Donegal, was discharged from the coastal patrol service on March 11th, 1924, as medically unfit while a patient in St. Bricin's Hospital, where he was a patient consequent on heart strain and pneumonia contracted while on active service; and, if so, if he will state why his claim for a disability pension is not granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. James Sharkey was discharged from the coastal patrol service on 10th April, 1924, in the ordinary course of &ldquo;demobilisation.&rdquo;  He submitted an application under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of heart trouble stated to be due to over exertion while on military service.  The application was refused because Sharkey's disablement was found to be not attributable to military service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware if ever Mr. Sharkey had any period of temporary service between the date of his discharge and the present time? My reason for asking that is that my information is that he had some period of temporary service subsequent to his discharge, and that it was during that period of temporary service that he developed the pneumonia, which has since shown symptoms of tubercular trouble and which has completely incapacitated the unfortunate man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  His service ended on the 10th April, 1924.  However, he <Col N="492" /> was a patient for pneumonia in St. Bricin's before that date, but the pneumonia was cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I see; but the Minister has not been informed that, as a result of certain lesions that remained after the primary pneumonia was cured, Mr. Sharkey is now permanently disabled, because these lesions have become aggravated with the passage of time.  The Minister, of course, could not have known of that when the first application for superannuation or compensation was being considered.  If evidence can be produced that the man's present tubercular condition can be reasonably related to the pneumonia contracted by him while on active service, will the Minister undertake to give consideration to such evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this case cannot be re-opened under the law. The case was gone into by the Pensions Medical Board in 1928, and they found that his condition then was not attributable to military service.  If it is not attributable to military service, they have no power to make the award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister will see the point that, while they might finally dispose of any question of heart strain, it is conceivable that the pneumonia would leave after it certain causes of deterioration, and if there was deterioration after 1928, it does seem a hardship that this man should be sick and destitute without any prospect of having his case re-opened.  Of course, if the Minister is satisfied that he has no statutory power in the matter, it is useless to bother about it further, but if he has discretion, I should be grateful if he would look into the matter with a view to having some adjustment made.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the measure is to prevent posting outside the Saorstát, by Saorstát residents, of correspondence for delivery within the Saorstát, with the object of securing the benefit of lower postage rates.  In order that the necessity for the Bill may be appreciated, I should explain that the rates of postage on packets sent by printed paper post and by letter post are lower in Great Britain and Northern Ireland than in the Saorstát.  For example, a packet for Saorstát Eireann exceeding 1 oz. but not exceeding 2 ozs. in weight can be posted by printed paper post in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for ½d. while the charge for a similar packet in Saorstát Eireann is 1d.  A letter for Saorstát Eireann not exceeding 2 ozs. may be posted in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for 1½d., whereas the Saorstát postage on a similar letter is 2d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence certain firms in Saorstát Eireann from time to time arrange for the posting, in Great Britain mainly, of circulars and letters, for addresses in Saorstát Eireann.  The practice, I am glad to say, is not resorted to on any very serious scale, but, whatever the scale, it is wrong in principle, unfair to this administration, and it is desired to put a stop to it.  In this connection, I should explain that all fully prepaid correspondence received from outside the State must under the International Convention be delivered free as a reciprocal arrangement, so that, in respect of correspondence improperly posted outside, this administration receives no revenue. The abuse is one with which most postal administrations are faced, and the International Postal Convention to <Col N="496" /> meet it provides that postal administrations which so desire may, in the case of packets posted outside their territories with the object of securing the benefit of lower rates of postage, either return them undelivered to the country of origin or before delivery charge them in full with the appropriate postage at internal rates.  There is no authority under the existing powers of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to enable this provision to be enforced, and it is necessary, therefore, to introduce legislation for the purpose.  The operation of the measure will not involve additional cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the Dáil being of opinion that the prevailing high rate of postage within Saorstát Eireann is largely responsible for the evasions of postage to which the Post Office (Evasion of Postage) Bill, 1937, refers, declines to give a Second Reading to this Bill until the Minister has made inquiry and reported to the Dáil (1) the immediate effect on the revenue of the Post Office of (a) reducing the postage rates on (i) letters, (ii) printed matter, and (iii) parcels, to those obtaining in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and (b) of providing a daily delivery in all parts of the country, and (2) the probability or otherwise of such changes bringing about an increase of business to the Post Office in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice a very remarkable thing&mdash; that the Minister himself stresses that the reason for introducing this Bill is the difference in the rates of postage as between the Saorstát and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I thought that perhaps he might make the case that the printing of the matter posted was being done outside the country, that circulars which normally would have been printed in this country were being printed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that as a result there was a loss to the printing trade in this country.  The Minister, however, <Col N="497" /> has made no such case.  We can, therefore, discuss this Bill entirely on the question of the difference in the postal rates.  The Minister says, almost explicitly, that a certain amount of espionage is now to be set up and that when particular classes of letters come into this country, if a suspicion is entertained that these letters have been posted with the object of evading the payment of the higher charges here, these letters will be opened and the matter investigated. There is, therefore, a principle contained in some of the remarks of the Minister and apparently enshrined in this Bill, that I think should be looked into more closely.  I hope an opportunity for closer discussion will arise on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>What I want to direct attention to at the moment is the fact that the commercial community in this country are labouring under very great disabilities both as regards the cost of their postage and as regards the unsatisfactory machinery for delivery that exists throughout the country. Netly, the ordinary letter in this country costs ½d. more to deliver here than in Great Britain, and a letter above 1 oz. sent by printed paper post costs ½d. more to deliver than the same letter in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  Then the commercial community have also thrown upon them a fairly substantial increase in the cost of postage of parcels.  The postage for parcels under 3 lbs. is, I understand, the same here as in Great Britain.  but when you reach 3 lbs. the cost of postage on a parcel is 3d. more here than in Great Britain, the cost of 4 lbs. is 2d. more, and the cost of 5 lbs. is 1d. more.  When you reach 6 lbs. the cost is again the same, but when you go over 6 lbs. the cost here is 3d., over 7 lbs. 2d. and over 8 lbs. a 1d. more than in Great Britain.  For every group of 3 lbs. the cost is therefore 3d. more than in Great Britain.  Then a telegram in Great Britain containing nine words can be sent for 6d. while a similar telegram in this country costs 1/6. That is the position in which the commercial community finds itself.  In the early days of the Free State, <Col N="498" /> as far as my recollection goes, there was a responsibility put on the Post Office to see that it would gradually reduce the rates and, from time to time, it had been the practice to look at the situation to see whether the rates of postage could not be reduced or whether greater facilities in deliveries throughout the country could not be given.  That was at a time when we had even a substantially smaller revenue than we have to-day. Now, the revenue has swollen enormously; Government expenditure has swollen enormously.</P>
    <P>There are certain things in the situation that require to get a certain amount of consideration.  Customs duties, in the first instance, and then quotas, in the second instance, have slowed down the tempo of commercial life in the country to a very great extent.  The inadequate delivery in certain parts of the country was responsible for a certain amount of that in the past, but it was nothing compared with the slowing down of the tempo in commercial transactions that the enormous number of tariffs, and particularly the quotas, have brought to the commercial community.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear Deputy Moore dealing with the matter.  I will say this, that commercial <Col N="499" /> life in the City of Dublin, and I am quite certain throughout the rest of the country, has been slowed down enormously in its tempo, first by tariffs and then by quotas.  Something is required to improve internal communications in the country, at any rate, and I suggest it would do something to improve the situation if the commercial community in the cities could be given a better postal contact with the country.  Any businessman to-day sitting down to make preparations for the evening post knows that, as regards a certain percentage among the group of letters before him, he might as well put them into a bottle and drop them into the outgoing tide on the Liffey, it is going to take him so long to get a reply.  He is entitled to feel that way when you consider how many parts of the country have only two deliveries in the week.</P>
      <P>As well as getting a cheaper post, he is entitled particularly to a better service throughout the country.  What is the position throughout the country? There are substantial parts of the country where you have a three-day or two-day delivery and there is a great hanging-up of commercial communications as a result of that.  On the other hand, certain conditions have been created as a result of things flowing, I admit, from the Government's policy. There is more marching from one end of the country to the other to-day as a result of unemployment and as a result of registering at the labour exchanges than there is over the battlefields of Spain.  How many men in our various counties are marching from one end of their district to another to register as being unemployed or to receive unemployment assistance benefit and what amount of money is being spent on them?  Take agricultural employment. We complained last year that the figures in that connection showed a substantial decrease as against 1921. In June, 1936, in Leinster, male agricultural employment was down by 3,908 as compared with 1935.  In Munster the figure was 4,839.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to that period of the amendment which suggests that there should be a daily delivery in all parts of the country.  I suggest that, in the first place, there should be a lessening of the amount charged to the commercial community for carrying on their postal services; that, in the second place, there should be an improvement in the service; that moneys are being spent throughout the country in very substantial sums&mdash; something like £1,500,000 was spent last year in unemployment assistance benefit&mdash;that a transfer of some of that money to provide a daily delivery in the country would improve the position of the commercial community with regard to their services, and, I also suggest, would improve the income of the Post Office later on.</P>
      <P>Between 1935 and 1936, male agricultural labour throughout the country fell by a total of 13,160.  I want to refer to what that means in one or two areas.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has divided the country into a certain number of unemployment areas.  For instance, North Connacht contains Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  One man in every ten out of the males in these counties is registered as looking for employment, and every one man out of 13 was drawing State assistance on the 25th January of this year.  In South Munster, which includes Kerry and Cork, every one male out of 15 was registered as looking for employment, and every one out of 20 was in receipt of public assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to deal with you, Sir, on the subject of order.  I think if I am out of order it would help the Dáil, and help the subject under discussion, if the subject of order were left between yourself and myself.  I do suggest that when the Minister comes before the House and says that evasion is taking place, and that in order to stop it he must subject to a kind of detective scrutiny correspondence coming into this country, and open it in order to be fair to the administration, he ought to realise that it is the high rates here which are bringing about that state of affairs; that the subject of high rates has been considered from time to time as a matter that was a burden on the community, and that that ought to be changed if possible.  When he comes before the House and asks us to accept a Bill like this, all I ask is that before invading the secrecy of the post&mdash; because that is what it amounts to&mdash; he should tell us what it would cost to bring the rates down to the Northern Ireland level, what it would cost normally to give a daily delivery <Col N="502" /> throughout the country; and, looking aside from that, that he should see whether, in view of the expense of the marching round the country, there could not be some link with the Department of Industry and Commerce, even as a temporary measure, to improve the position for the commercial community; and that he should give us his opinion as to whether, in the long run, benefits would not flow to the Post Office itself as a result of adopting some measure like that to deal with the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, I should like to say that, while we can all agree to a certain extent that all the money for postal facilities should be spent in this country, at the same time I should like to be sure that the Minister is not going the wrong way to achieve the object which he has in view.  First of all, I suggest to him that if there is going to be any considerable scrutiny of the post in order to see who is evading the provisions of this Bill, it will entail still further delays in the post, and I am afraid there will be another excuse added to the already long list of excuses which the Post Office give for delays, namely, that a package was held up on the suspicion that it was evading the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the evasions are wrong in principle.  I am afraid that a very large number of citizens of this country do not regard the Post Office as any more sacred than any other institution, and that they look upon the Post Office as a means of getting services rendered in the easiest, quickest and cheapest manner. If the Minister looks at it from a purely business point of view he will find he is somewhat like a man in business who has two rival business bodies, one on each side of him, and, without wishing to throw any bouquets at his competitors, they are keen and alert people.  We are all familiar from time to time with ways that I suppose the Minister would describe as ways of evading the postal provisions, but I am sure that if he pressed such persons they would say that they found that by adopting certain methods they could <Col N="503" /> get the business they wished carried out done for half the money that the Irish Post Office takes from them for postage.  There seems to be in the Post Office a certain vicious circle, and I would very much like if the Minister could see his way to break away from that tradition.  When a person complains, for instance, that some of the methods of the Post Office are old-fashioned, he is told: &ldquo;That really cannot be brought up to date; the cost would be too considerable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has enlarged on the other side of that, namely, that the unemployed could be very usefully put to carrying out some of the services that are at present not being efficiently carried out, with benefit to the community and to the revenue.  I do not propose to go into that any further than to say that, as far as the business community are concerned, the high postage rates that they pay are linked up with the service.  If you have a high postage rate and very high efficiency you have some compensation, but when you have a high postage rate and inefficiency people are prepared to pay anything to get over the difficulties they encounter.  It has come under my notice that people receiving very important letters from the other side find they cannot be sure of the delivery.  For instance, when it comes near the end of a sweepstake there is a very considerable delay.  One wonders why extra hands could not be employed to keep the delivery up to normal.  People are prepared to pay 6d. to have a letter delivered to another address so that they may get it somewhat earlier than by the ordinary delivery.  That 6d. goes to the other side, to the big business competitor of the Minister's Department. Of course, the trouble about that is that people do not know what letters are important.  Certain letters may arrive from people regularly for a few days with practically nothing in them, and the next time that a letter arrives it may be late; yet the person would have paid anything to have that letter delivered in time.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has not been touched upon is the question of the growing air mail and the very high <Col N="504" /> charges for delivery to places abroad. At the present time it is quite a common practice for people here to send letters to friends in England who post them by air mail from there. The Minister gets 2d. for that service, but the other country gets 1/6 or 2/-. I should like to put that aspect to the Minister.  I have spoken about the vicious circle that the Post Office are in&mdash;that they do not seem able to consider either looking for efficiency or looking for economy and following that up resolutely.  I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment, I consider that the cause of evasion is due to the fact that postal rates are higher here than in neighbouring countries.  I did not hear what the Minister estimated is being lost by evasion, and I do not suppose it is a very large sum, but I wonder if it is worth while causing delay in the delivery of letters that may arise by passing this Bill.  Another aspect of the matter is, that this will give an excuse for the opening of letters where perhaps it should not be necessary to open them at all.  People who live in different parts of the country know that there are complaints that letters are tampered with and, in many cases, opened.  This Bill can be made an excuse for examining letters to see if they were posted in proper quarters.  That is a very serious matter, and the confidence that the public have in the Post Office will be very much undermined if such a practice is encouraged. I would not expect that the Minister would give encouragement to such a practice.  Is it really worth while advertising another disadvantage that exists in this State compared with conditions prevailing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland? The Bill will cause resentment because it points out that disadvantage.  Will it be an inducement to bring about a reconciliation with the Six Counties in order that they would come into the Free State?  The President says that it is his policy to make conditions so attractive here that the Six <Col N="505" /> Counties will be induced to come in for their own benefit.  Will they be inclined to come in to share the disadvantage of higher postal rates? Seeing that we have higher postal rates is it worth while drawing attention to them?  I think the Government is making a mistake in this matter.  By adopting the amendment the position will be met and, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, unemployment that is costing the Treasury so much and that gives no return, will be relieved.  Under the amendment the delivery of letters will be as regular as in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree heartily with what Deputy Mulcahy said that this is a business matter and should be met in a businesslike way, and not in the absurd way of legislating in this manner.  There are things that this type of legislation cannot remedy.  This Bill invades the rights of private citizens.  What right has the Department to invade the privacy of the ordinary citizen, the decent common taxpayer?  We are worried and plagued enough in that respect.  I think the Department should look into itself, and study its own house to see if it cannot improve things there.  I will give an experience I had.  I had occasion to send a gift to a foreign country at Christmas, thereby increasing our export trade, as I was sending something that was made in the Free State. The tax on the gift in the foreign country was 12½ per cent., but the postal authorities here would not take it unless I paid 50 per cent. ad valorem tax.  I did so and I have not got it back since.  If the Minister likes I can give him the details.  Another way in which the Post Office irritates and stops a certain amount of trade is in connection with the accursed statistical tax for which the Post Office or the Minister for Industry and Commerce are responsible.  Any person who gets foreign books, as I do, from the other side, continuously, has to pay sixpence on each parcel.  The incidence of that tax is most dishonest because it adds to the cost of the parcel post. The main reason I support the amendment is because I object to the privacy of the individual citizen being invaded, <Col N="506" /> and to an excuse being given for such invasion by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill that I feel I cannot support, in the first place, because I think it is unworthy of the State that such a Bill should be brought into the House.  As far as I am aware it is a revolutionary proposal as far as legislation is concerned. I do not know if the Minister gave any figures or advanced any reasons for the Bill.  I understand he did not.  It tackles a new phase of life, one that hitherto has not been so much invaded by the Post Office.  The very fact of bringing in such a Bill will have a disquieting effect not only on our citizens but on citizens of other countries who correspond with us.  The second reason why I cannot support the Bill was touched upon by the last speaker.  We always felt that the Post Office was an institution that did its business without broadcasting and that a letter with an ordinary stamp on it had about it an element of secrecy and of confidence which one feels it should have in a Department of State and could not be interfered with.  We have always been told that even if an official talked about what was written on a postcard that would be an offence against the regulations.  Now we have a Bill giving full powers to open all correspondence of which there may be any suspicion.  I think that will shake the foundations of confidence in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our packets and our letters are to be liable to this scrutiny, it means that there may be a week's delay or more before an ordinary business letter or packet can be delivered.  That is surely intolerable in these days when we like to ensure that in our State, at any rate, a letter posted to-day will be delivered to-morrow.  The founda tions of the business life of to-day are built on expedition, on the fact that there will be no delays in the doing of the business of the State.  This is an invitation to delay which I think is unwarrantable.  The fourth reason which I would suggest is that like some other Bills which were brought into this House it cannot achieve what it sets out to do.  I have not studied the <Col N="507" /> implications of it in very great detail, but, on such scrutiny as I have given it, it seems to me that if we attempt to get after the citizens of this country who set out to post packets in some other country, it will only mean that they will have to be more careful and have an address in the other country. We cannot make it an offence if they are in another country from our own. We cannot make it an offence for them to correspond with their friends or to correspond with citizens of this country, and it would only mean that there can be evasions of anything the Minister may set out to do.  In conclusion, I would repeat what I said at the beginning&mdash;that the Bill is unworthy of this State, unworthy of the business life of this community, and one which in my opinion, will be ineffective to secure the object we set out to perform.</P>

      <P>All the speeches from the Opposition on this Bill have been surprising speeches, most of them surprising in their vagueness, but the last speech was the biggest surprise of all. Because of his attitude to the Sweepstakes Act and other things I think the general opinion of Deputy Haslett has been that he is a Puritan, yet when it comes to a question like this, involving evasion, when proposals are made for dealing with citizens who attempt to use the services of this State but are too mean to pay for them, Deputy Haslett says: &ldquo;Let them go ahead and more power to them.  You are really doing a shockingly bad thing in attempting to interfere with such a practice.&rdquo;  That is certainly a surprising attitude on the part of Deputy Haslett.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to do with that, but there are people who never were suspected of being Puritans who would be ashamed of that attitude. I infer from Deputy Dockrell that one of his grievances is that letters are already considerably delayed in the Post Office, or if not considerably delayed that there are frequent delays. I have never had that experience, I confess.  It is a matter one does not <Col N="508" /> hear much about.  I was under the impression that under the Post Office system if a letter is delayed, if there is even a suspicion of delay, the postal authorities are prepared to inquire into each individual case.  Deputy Dockrell did not tell us whether he had ever brought such a case to the notice of the Post Office authorities, and if so, what was the result.  He fears there may be further delay now because of the working of this Act.  That would be a matter for the Post Office authorities, but if delays are not more serious than at present I do not think they would be a cause for refusing the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is very much concerned about the commercial community. Instead of this Bill he wants better facilities for the commercial community in reaching their clients in the country.  I do not know that Deputy Mulcahy has any ground whatever for believing that the commercial community are not well able to get into communication with their clients under the existing facilities.  It is quite true that there are many parts of the country where there are not good services, but the last people to suffer from those defects are the commercial community.  The five-acre farmer or the ten-acre farmer, in so far as he is concerned with correspondence, has the grievance that he does not get frequent deliveries, but the last people who suffer from those deficiencies in the postal system are those who would be in touch with the commercial community, either in Dublin or in any other city. Everybody knows that since motor transport became so general there is no part of the country that is not in daily contact&mdash;and several times a day contact&mdash;with the chief centres of the postal service.</P>

      <P>Do I understand from the Deputy that the practice has arisen of sending letters by the drivers of motor cars throughout the country, and do I understand that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs knows of and does not interfere with that practice?</P>

      <P>I do not suggest that any such practice has ever arisen, but I do suggest that there is nobody <Col N="509" /> involved in the commercial life of this country who is not, through motor transport&mdash;through his own motor transport chiefly&mdash;in direct contact with the chief postal centres.  I think the last grievance that the commercial community has is the infrequency of deliveries, or delays in the post.  I am sure the Deputy would not find in six months one instance of any trouble or loss arising through anything like that. But, as I said, there are certain people who are affected by it.  They would like to hear from their friends more often; they often have to complain that letters which were of importance to them were not delivered for several days.  Those are the humble people of the country, who have not got the means of sending to the post office when they are expecting letters.  It is to be desired, I am sure, that such parts of the country should have more frequent deliveries, but I do not think that can be used as an argument against the passing of this Bill, and I doubt very much that Deputy Mulcahy, when he put down his amendment; intended to use it as a serious argument against the Bill.  In fact, I do not know that he really intended any part of his amendment to be taken seriously by the House.</P>

      <P>From the opening remarks of Deputy Moore, I thought we were going to hear something of importance with regard to this Bill, or even with regard to the amendment. The Deputy commented on the vagueness of the speeches delivered from this side, and naturally one expected that Deputy Moore was going to give us something tangible.  So far as I could see, he avoided the Bill and he avoided the amendment.  He told us nothing at all.  He endeavoured to draw our attention to the duty of citizens to the State.  I hope that Deputy Moore and the Government realise by this time that the State has duties to the citizen.  If we are suffering from the disability of high postage rates, I do not think we are doing very much good by drawing attention to it in this way.  I do not think it is creditable, and, from Deputy Moore's reference to the amendment, I think he must not have read it.  I think it very sensible and I think the Government are not entitled to bring in a Bill of this sort without having resort, either in their own official way or in some other way, to the methods suggested in <Col N="511" /> the amendment.  I think it is a very business-like amendment and if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs comes in here with a Bill of this type without having done what the amendment suggests, and without telling us what the result of that has been, he is doing something he ought not to do.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Moore has left the House because, coming to the Bill itself, there is a feature in it to which I should like to refer in his presence. He is recognised as being very closely connected with the Irish industry side and, to my mind, at least, there is a sub-section in Section 2 which ought to make some of the Irish industrialists sit up.  We have heard a lot lately of alien penetration into Irish industry.  I remember reading in the paper recently of some big functions, dinners and so on, being given here in Dublin by industrialists and the one fear with which they were apparently beset was alien penetration.  I wonder how they will welcome this Bill which Deputy Moore says is going to be welcomed by the country when they realise that, under sub-section (2) of Section 2, those people who are at the moment earning fat dividends in this country, through the establishment of certain businesses here, and who have businesses outside the country also, can take advantage of the cheap postage rate while the purely Irish firm cannot?</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of that section sets out that the provisions of the Bill are to apply to every postal packet which (a) is posted outside Saorstát Eireann and (b) is addressed to the addressee at an address in Saorstát Eireann and (c) purports to come from or to be sent by or on behalf of a person residing or carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann.  These are subject to all the penalties laid down in the Bill; but, then, we get a way out for the aliens, the people who have two businesses, one here and one in another country. Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-section of this section, this Act shall not apply to a postal packet which purports to come from or to be sent by or on behalf of a person who carries <Col N="512" /> on business both in and outside Saorstát Eireann unless such postal packet purports to come or be sent only from an address, or all the addresses, of such person in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>A boot factory which has a branch here&mdash;and we have a lot of that&mdash;and which has its main house in Notting ham, can send out what stuff it likes at the cheap rate in reference to its Irish business from Nottingham.  That is what this Bill provides.  If the Minister thinks that it is not enough to advertise that in this country we are mulcting our citizens in postage and package rates, but that, in addition, we are going to give cheap rates to the aliens to advertise their goods, he can do it, and I suppose he will do it because he has his majority.  That is the position we find ourselves in. Apart from the important point which has been made that one of the strongest factors in favour of the Post Office at all times was its privacy and that that, too, is going now, from every angle, I think the Bill is ill-considered and I think the Minister is not entitled to bring it in until he has first done what Deputy Mulcahy suggests in the amendment, that is, to have an examination of all the factors and find out whether if the postage rate were reduced to what it is in England and across the Border, the people would suffer and, in general, to try to level ourselves up to the advantages which other people have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  I think the Bill is one of the gravest votes of censure that could possibly be introduced in this House on the administration of the Post Office.  For the last three or four years, on the Votes for the Post Office, I have referred to the tortoise policy of the Post Office in its administration and its absolute refusal to take a broad view of its future and to develop in such a way that not only will it fulfill the duties which it should fulfill to the citizens of this country, but to put itself in a competitive position with post office machinery in adjoining countries.  I could enumerate specific cases of the antiquity of the <Col N="513" /> management of this branch of the State.  I do not wish to speak to the Minister in any extra critical way.  He is a new Minister and it is quite possible that he has no contact at all with the management of a Department of this kind, but I want seriously to put to him that he should apply himself with all his energy, both mental and physical, to looking at what is being done elsewhere, getting a grip of it and applying it to the machinery of his own Department.</P>
      <P>I go down the country occasionally and I have from time to time gone into what appeared to be an exchange controlling two or three counties.  I have asked to send a telephone message or a telegram, and the girl goes over to a machine which is sending out messages to two or three counties and starts to twist a handle.  One would think she would have twisted the county with which you wanted to get into contact out of existence altogether before you got through and you feel inclined to put your hands in your pockets and to walk out.  What is the proposal in this Bill?  It is one of the most ridiculous things that one could imagine and it is, as I say, one of the gravest votes of censure that could be passed on the Department. Since Great Britain had the vision to reduce the postal charges&mdash;and I suppose there were a lot of old fogies there who were so cob-webbed that they thought the Post Office was going to lose and the general tax payer was going to be saddled with a huge but den as a result of the reduced charges &mdash;I have pleaded for a reduction of postal charges.  What has been the result?  The result is what anybody with any business vision could have foreseen&mdash;a stupendous success in the way of increased revenue together with a reduction in the cost of the service. In fact the service simply amazed everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But while the whole world has been moving towards rapidity in transport the Post Office here has been sitting on the fence suffering from fear and terror at the suggestion of reducing the twopenny postage to a three halfpenny postage.  I quite admit that the Minister is very new in his office but <Col N="514" /> I can tell him that if he spends twenty years there and continues this tortoise policy as it is at present, the result will be that, as the years go by, while he pursues that policy the Post Office will go on increasing in inefficiency, until not only will the twopence postage remain on but that twopence will be increased to threepence. This is an age of revolution and the tendency should be forward and not backward.  Instead of showing the House and the country something in the way of progress, we have to-day before us this tattered miserable Bill. In so far as the Bill relates to England I would not mind saying much, but the damaging thing about it is that the Bill applies to a portion of our own country, the portion that is partitioned from us.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the moment in this country?  I know, so far as my constituency is concerned, that small packages of letters are taken across the Border daily and posted there.  We have Deputy Moore here wrapped in wool telling us that it is unpatriotic to post letters across the Border.  I tell the Deputy that this is a purely business matter.  The man who does not run his business efficiently is bound to go down.  Is the Post Office going to adopt inefficiency as its policy?  I do not want to be unduly severe on the Minister who has newly taken up charge of this Department.  But I wish to put this case to him as cogently as I can.  Why is it that people get their letters posted in the Six Counties?  Simply because the letter will go on a 1½d. stamp in the Six Counties while the Government here persists in charging 2d.  Surely to goodness the charges already imposed upon commercial people in this country are quite heavy enough without having this additional imposition in the way of postage.  Why should there be this smuggling of letters across the Border?  Why are people making these desperate attempts and risking embroiling themselves in serious consequences?  The difference in the cost of the postage is what is involved here.  I submit there should be no difference in cost of <Col N="515" /> postage between our Government and the Government of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>In the last two years when this Vote was before the House, I appealed to the Minister to reduce postage and telegraphic costs.  Those responsible for the Post Office financing shake their heads and say: &ldquo;Oh, not at all; we would be ruined by this enormous loss in the revenue to the Post Office.&rdquo;  But we have tried that policy long enough already and we have the fruits of it to-day in this Bill.  Why not try the other thing now?  I am prepared to stake my reputation that the reduction of postage charges would result in more prosperity to the Post Office.  We know very well that the heavy charge of 1/6, which is the minimum charge for a telegram, is killing the telegraphic service in this State.  People look a considerable time at 1/6 before they are prepared to part with it in the sending of a telegram, whereas if the charge had been the same as in England considerably more use would be made of the telegraph service.  More particularly is this the case at the other side of the Border, where they can send a telegram for 6d.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not going to get us anywhere. It is only going to fortify the Post Office more in its ineffciency. One of the direct results of the present Post Office policy is a restricted revenue and more inefficiency.  The Department simply say when they see the revenue going down: &ldquo;We will get the Minister to pass a Bill to protect us.&rdquo;  The only policy that will really succeed is efficiency, the making of the Post Office as efficient as it is in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred already to the statistical tax.  I think there is nothing more jarring to the feelings than this statistical tax.  The fact is that on these parcels the postage rate has already been paid, and then the recipient is asked for 6d. additional.  I am not now going to say anything about the institution of that tax. Nobody knows anything about the results of any experiment until the experiment has been tried.  This tax was an experiment, but I say now that <Col N="516" /> from the point of view of efficiency it was a failure, and its retention is a sign of incompetency.  Its effects are the holding up of business and preventing people from ordering the things that they would otherwise order. There are certain things people have got to order, and I do not think that a Department of State should be entitled to come in and extract their pound of flesh because of the fact that people have to order these things by post.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  The very first thing we should be told on the Second Reading of this Bill is what the probable cost of reducing the postage rates and bringing them into line with Northern Ireland and Great Britain would be. That is really the issue involved. Instead of that, the Minister comes in here and simply tells us that Free State citizens post their letters outside this State.  That is because there is a difference between the postal rates of the Six Counties Government and Great Britain and our postal rates, and some people are taking an advantage of the lower rates outside our State.  But that is no reason and no justification at all. The obvious answer of business people and the public generally is, &ldquo;Make the charge the same as in the Six Counties and in Great Britain.&rdquo;  That is the obvious answer of the people to this Bill, and there is no use in trying to give them any other explanation.</P>
    <P>As to the service given by our Post Office, one is presented with something that is very pathetic.  When one goes down to rural Ireland and spends some time knocking around there, one sees, as Deputy Mulcahy has already described, in portion of the country marching and counter-marching.  In parts of my constituency you have got the entire community on the road twice a week.  A large proportion of these people are getting as unemployment assistance 12/6 a week.  The weekly wage paid to the rural postmen in that area is 16/- a week.  There are large numbers of men getting 12/6 for doing nothing.  The poor postman is on the road every day in the week, for, though there is a reduced service in the country, the postman has different districts different days in the week.  He <Col N="517" /> has a different route each day.  He has to walk miles across a wild moor in the wintry weather, and he is paid 16/-, while the man who does nothing draws 12/6 a week.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Why not give some of those men who are drawing 12/6 a week unemployment money an additional 3/6 a week and restore the daily service of letters to the public? Is the suggestion that the cost would be too much?  Surely, a man would be better employed at a few shillings a week extra in making the postal service more efficient than in drawing 12/6 a week and giving no return.  If the State can afford to pay 12/6 to a man for doing nothing, it should be able to give more than 16/- to the man who is working every day.  This Bill should not be passed by Deputies, irrespective of the side of the House they are on, until the request of Deputy Mulcahy is acceded to.  The Minister should postpone the Second Reading until he can put before the House an estimate of what it would cost to bring the postal rates of the Saorstát into line with those of adjoining countries. I ask the Minister, in the interest of the prosperity of his own Department, and of its future development, to accept the amendment.  That Department will finally be driven to do as requested.  It will sink into greater inefficiency until, ultimately, somebody will come along, clear up the mess, and bring the postal business into line with similar business in other countries, as should have been done a couple of years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill introduced by the Minister.  For many reasons I think that its introduction was too long delayed.  The object of the Bill is to curb the activities of business people resident in the Saorstát who are quite content to be citizens of Saorstát Eireann and to live here, who are quite content to make profits out of other citizens of Saorstát Eireann but who want to transfer their postal custom to Great Britain.  The aim of this Bill is to deal with that. <Col N="518" /> But for those business people who prefer to post their packets in Great Britain because they can get the benefit of a cheaper postal rate, there would be no necessity for this Bill.  If you allow people to travel to where the cost of the commodity or service they require is cheapest, it will be but a short step from that to saying that they are entitled to go anywhere they like and to get any kind of service or any kind of labour they like just because it is cheaper than here.  The philosophy of the persons with whom this Bill is intended to deal is the philosophy of people who want to get goods cheaply and who are not concerned with either the morality or propriety of their own action in getting them.  I am glad that the Minister is taking steps to secure that people who are resident in Saorstát Eireann, who make their profits in Saorstát Eireann, who get the protection of the State in Saorstát Eireann will be compelled to do their postal business in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My complaint is that this Bill does not go sufficiently far to protect the Post Office monopoly in regard to the transport of letters.  There is a firm in Dublin known as Messenger Services, and I understand that it is possible for a firm to contract with that private company to have letters delivered to addresses in the city.  That, in my opinion, is an invasion of the Post Office monopoly.  On technical grounds, they may be able to escape the legal consequences which would follow an infringement of the Post Office letter monopoly, but there is no doubt whatever that the carrying on of that particular service is a very definite infringement of the Post Office monopoly&mdash;the right of the Post Office to have exclusive power to control the collection and delivery of letters.  I wonder whether Deputy McMenamin stands for the continuance of that kind of service because, as everybody who is familiar with its activities knows, it is operated by a number of small, uniformed boys whom we see in residential districts in Dublin delivering letters which, in the ordinary way, ought to be handled by the Post Office. These boys are aged from 14 to 16 years and their rates of wages compare <Col N="519" /> most unfavourably with the rates of wages paid for similar work carried on by the Post Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Even by auxiliary postmen. I venture to say that some of these boys cannot be paid more than a couple of pence an hour.  It is possible for a firm of that kind, just as it would be possible for the Post Office, to provide cheap delivery rates for particular kinds of zone traffic.  In the case of the company to which I refer, it simply collects the remunerative section of advertising traffic.  It will deliver letters in Dublin over particular routes because there will be a considerable number of letters for a particular route, but if you offer that firm the delivery of letters in a rural area to isolated addresses, you will find that they will not take that kind of business at Post Office rates.  The kind of business they will take at rates equal to or less than Post Office rates is the remunerative kind of traffic. The unremunerative traffic is left for the Post Office.  A private firm, acting purely in the interests of its own profits, is being allowed to invade a State monopoly and to get behind the right of the Post Office to have absolute control of the collection and delivery of letters.  The Post Office should, in my opinion, insist on its right to handle that kind of traffic. The State should conserve for the Post Office&mdash;a State institution&mdash;the right to deal with traffic of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is interesting in more ways than one. Deputy Moore put his finger on the origin of the amendment when he said that the Deputy wants to deal with matters out of which he can make a good deal of political capital in anticipation of the forthcoming general election.  There seems to be no limit to Deputy Mulcahy's artfulness and, similarly, no limit to his inconsistency. To-morrow certain organs of the Press, who charge 100 per cent. more to-day for their newspapers than they did before the war, will applaud Deputy <Col N="520" /> Mulcahy's efforts to get them cheaper postal rates.  That will be so while they continue to collect 100 per cent. more on their newspapers than they did before the war and while their advertising rates have also gone up considerably as compared with the prewar rates.  Deputy Mulcahy imagines that certain unthinking sections of the community will take him to their bosom as one of the pioneers in advocating a reduction of postal rates.  If Deputy Mulcahy were here now, I should like to put him a few questions. If Deputy Mulcahy were urging this reform as an ordinary Deputy who had never acted as Minister, one could understand his action.  If Deputy Good were to table this amendment in favour of cheaper postal rates, one could understand his action.  There would be no inconsistency in Deputy Good demanding cheaper postal rates now, because he has always done so.  But he has never had an opportunity as Minister of advocating that course within the Cabinet.  On the other hand, Deputy Mulcahy was a Minister for the best part of ten years.  The Government of which he was a member was in office for that period, and it maintained postage rates at the present rate for letters and the present rates for paper matter over that period of ten years.  So that when he had an opportunity of reducing postage rates, an opportunity extending over a period of ten years, Deputy Mulcahy, as a member of the Government in office in that period, stood for the higher postage rates which obtained from 1922 to 1932.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that we are told nowadays that the years from 1922 to 1932 were the years when the State was most prosperous, when the Exchequer was in a good healthy condition, when the Budgets were balanced each year, and when there was none of this kind of governmental extravagance going on that is now alleged by the Fine Gael Party.  Yet, with all the State prosperity which is supposed to have abounded between 1922 and 1932, the Government of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member was not able to do in respect of postal charges what the Deputy now wants done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> Deputy McMenamin may not be as inconsistent as Deputy Mulcahy, but I think he is more thoughtless.  He is supporting the amendment moved by Deputy Mulcahy, and in the course of his speech talked of the horrible crime of increasing the charge for telegrams from a minimum of 1/- to a minimum of 1/6, while sitting under him, when saying that, was Deputy Mulcahy, the mover of the amendment that we are discussing, whose Government was responsible for increasing telegraph charges from 1/- to 1/6 per message. The increase in telegraph charges was imposed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I think it was a shortsighted and a foolish step, a step which ought not to have been taken at that time.  I think that the problem in respect of the telegraph services at that time could probably have been dealt with much more effectively by a widespread publicity campaign designed to popularise the telegraph services than by increasing the minimum charge from 1/- to 1/6.  I think that an experiment in that direction is something which ought not be ruled out of consideration at the present time.  The fact remains that it was the Government of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member that increased telegraph charges from 1/- to 1/6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a success in this way that it helped to stifle postal traffic and to reduce the deficit on the telegraph side.  It also reduced telegraph traffic.  That was due to the high charges.  Another contributory factor which has retarded the development of the telegraph service has been the widespread development of the telephone service.  Deputy Mulcahy wants an inquiry with a view to reducing postage rates on letters, on printed matter and on parcels.  He also wants a daily delivery of letters provided. I think that a daily delivery ought to be provided in every area.  I think that every member of the community is entitled to get from the State the same kind of State facilities.  If a man happens to be living in an area which is not thickly populated, that is no reason why he ought to have lesser postal services than the person living <Col N="522" /> in a more thickly populated area.  I think the Minister ought to look into the matter of providing a daily service, but that is not a reason for holding up a Bill of this kind.  Here, again, I think Deputy Mulcahy betrays an amazing inconsistency.  Up to 1923 there was no such thing in this country as a delivery of letters of less than daily frequency, but in 1923 the Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Posts and Telegraphs dismissed 500 part-time postmen.  They were dismissed by reason of the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Minister for Posts and Telegraphs introduced a three day a week delivery service for the six day a week delivery service previously provided.  Deputy Morrissey could have told Deputy Mulcahy of the intentions of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in 1929 when Mr. Heffernan was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Though Deputy Mulcahy now wants a daily service, at that time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party proposed to still further curtail the services in the rural areas, and proposed to dismiss 700 auxiliary postmen by reducing the frequency of the service. In 1937 Deputy Mulcahy, whose Government was the author of that proposal, wants a daily delivery provided. If anything is more inconsistent than that, then I do not know what inconsistency really is.  The whole question of a reduction of postal charges, and the consequent effect of such a reduction, is something that requires very careful consideration. Deputy McMenamin, like Young Lochinvar, jumps in and wants the Minister to take a bold step.  The Deputy is prepared to stake his reputation on the fact that if postal charges are reduced in existing circumstances the revenue of the Post Office will benefit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that if postal charges were reduced Post <Col N="523" /> Office traffic would increase, that the financial position would improve considerably, and the Minister would not have to contemplate the doleful kind of financial development which the Deputy forecasts for him in connection with the present Bill.  In other countries, where a reduction in postal charges has taken place, there has undoubtedly been an increase in traffic, some of it a normal increase, some of it due to a reduction of postal rates, but the outstanding fact is that in all those instances there has been a loss to the Post Office by reason of the reduction that has taken place in postal charges.  Take the case of Britain.  Britain is a bigger country than ours.  Taking it on a unit basis, the letter-writing community there is much greater than ours.  Notwithstanding all that, the British example typifies what has happened in other countries, and particularly in every English-speaking country.  In 1935 the British Government reduced its charges on parcels.  As a result of that reduction the parcel traffic increased by 11 per cent., but the parcel revenue decreased by 5 per cent.  The increase of 11 per cent. in parcel traffic is not compensated for by reason of the reduction of 5 per cent. in parcel revenue. The percentage increase in parcel traffic would have to be much higher in order to compensate for a reduction of 5 per cent. in parcel revenue.  The British Postmaster-General admitted that the entire increase of 11 per cent. in parcel traffic was in no sense due to the fact that parcel charges had been reduced.  He indicated, in fact, in the British House of Commons that a substantial portion of the increase in parcel traffic was part of the normal growth in parcel traffic which had been taking place before the reduction was made, and which continued after the reduction, so that the net increase in parcel traffic in Great Britain, as a result of the reduction in parcel rates, did not compensate for the loss to the Post Office occasioned by the reduction in charges.  There, you have got to remember that you have a much more concentrated parcel post delivery than you can possibly have in the circumstances existing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> In 1922, the British Government reduced the charges for letters from 2d. to 1½d., and for postcards, from 1½d. to 1d.&mdash;just the kind of thing that Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Mulcahy want to do now in a relative sense.  Deputy McMenamin has staked his whole reputation on the fact that a step of that kind will bring a greater surplus to the Post Office and that it will result in a deficit&mdash;although there is no deficit now&mdash;being turned into a substantial surplus.  If that is likely to happen here, I suggest to Deputy McMenamin that something comparable was also likely to happen in Britain when the same step was taken there.  Here, however, are the facts, as they developed in Britain, following that reduction.  Postal revenue&mdash;that is, purely postal revenue &mdash;of the British Post Office, from the 1st June, 1921, to the 31st March, 1922, amounted to £32,700,000.  From the 1st June, 1922, to the 31st March, 1923&mdash;the same period, but in the fol lowing year&mdash;the British postal revenue was £27,700,000.  So that the reduction of postal charges by the British Administration in 1922 showed itself in revenue figures by a loss of £5,000,000 on the postal side alone. Deputy McMenamin may still be willing to have a bet, with his reputation at stake, but I suggest that he ought to be less heroic in having bets, in view of the facts&mdash;the incontrovertible facts&mdash;as revealed by the British experiments; and these experiments in Britain typify what happened in other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But Deputy McMenamin himself did not do that.  If he had, I could have followed him.  Perhaps Deputy McMenamin may like to have another kind of bet, namely, that a great increase in traffic would result from a reduction in charges.  Let us <Col N="525" /> see what the British found in that respect&mdash;and we can examine the British experiment without any political animus at all, because this is purely a business and mathematical transaction.  Speaking in the British House of Commons on the 4th March, 1929, Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, the British Postmaster-General, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was expected then that the increase in traffic&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, following the 1922 reduction.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;would be 10 per cent. in the case of letters and 20 per cent. in the case of postcards.  The actual realised increase in the case of letters was 5½ per cent. instead of 10 per cent., and the increase in postcards was 4½ per cent. instead of 20 per cent.  It must further be realised that from this increase we have to deduct the normal yearly growth which one would expect to take place, in any case, in postal traffic, and that would be something like 2 per cent.  Therefore, the net growth induced by the reduction made in 1922 was about 3½ per cent. in the case of letters and 2½ per cent. in the case of postcards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that any prophecy that a reduction in postal charges is going to result in a very substantial increase in postings is not justified by the results of experiments which have already been carried out in that respect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall, now that the Deputy has asked for it.  I can tell him that it is estimated by the British Post Office to-day that, even allowing for an increase in traffic&mdash;for a normal increase in letter traffic&mdash;and even allowing for an artificial increase by reason of a reduction of one halfpenny in the letter rate, as the British Postmaster-General said, in the British House of Commons twelve months ago, the immediate loss to revenue on existing inland letters under present conditions, based on a reduction of the letter postage by one halfpenny, would be £7,100,000.  That is the estimate of the loss to revenue as a result of the introduction of cheaper postage rates in Britain.  It may be, of course, that Deputy McMenamin's statistics are much more reliable than those produced by the British Administration.  It may be, of course, that the Deputy's gallantry, if put into operation, would produce results very much better than those produced in Great Britain; but the fact remains that here are cold statistics produced after the British experiments had been tried, and these cold statistics utterly controvert the prophecies of Deputy McMenamin here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least. Would the Deputy give the figures of the returns to the Post Office for 1935 and for the first year of the reduction in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin, of course, is trying to compare things that are not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not comparable to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, to any sensible person.  I will let the Deputy nominate anybody, and outside the House he can discuss with him the points he is raising.  I say that I defy the Deputy to produce any evidence to the contrary&mdash;if he does produce it, I will apologise to him in the House&mdash;that the British surplus would be very much higher than it is, on the Post Office and on the postal side of the Post Office, if the postage rates had been <Col N="527" /> allowed to remain at their former level; every British Postmaster-General, to whom Deputy McMenamin cares to write, will prove that statement to him and confirm that statement to him.  I think, therefore, Sir, that if Deputy Mulcahy's amendment is one designed to increase traffic, while a reduction in postal charges may result in an increase in traffic, it is also going to result in a considerable deficit on the working of the Post Office, and that means that the existing surplus of around about £200,000 is going to be given away to the users of the Post Office in the form of a reduction of postal charges. If the Minister has that sum of money to spare, I suggest to him that there is a section of the community in need of it&mdash;much more so than some of the users of the Post Office.  Many of the firms that would benefit by a reduction in postal charges are paying dividends to-day of from five to eight and even ten per cent.  Some of the new industries that have been established are paying dividends of 15 per cent. Are these the people who are to get the reduction of postal charges?  Are these the people who are to be objects of our sympathy, and are these the people to whom the surplus in the Post Office is to be distributed?  If the Minister has any surplus to distribute in the Post Office, I suggest that he ought to distribute it amongst the people who have made that surplus possible and that he ought definitely to remove from the Post Office the stigma that it employs thousands of people at rates of wages which are utterly unable to maintain them in anything like a civilised or Christian standard of existence.  If there is any surplus available then the claims of those people who make the surplus possible should be considered by the Minister.  So long as these people are compelled to work at low rates of wages, so long as over 3,000 of them are at present condemned to part-time employment and so long as hundreds of them can only secure employment on three or four days a week, I think the Minister should utilise any surplus he may have in providing for the needs <Col N="528" /> of these people rather than distributing it amongst people in industry who, according to the latest commercial returns, can make profits which indicate that they should not be objects of commiseration in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Norton's sole objection to this amendment is that it has been moved by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy would be in some difficulty in voting against it, because the tenor of his whole speech against the amendment was that it had been moved by Deputy Mulcahy and that it should not have been moved by Deputy Mulcahy, because Deputy Mulcahy was a member of the Government that did so and so.  The Deputy talked about 1923 and made certain comparisons.  Will the Deputy suggest that the conditions of 1923 are comparable to the conditions now?  The Deputy ignores some very obvious facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, but I am not going to run away from certain things that happened.  The Deputy is not going to get over them by trying to ignore them.  I want to say quite frankly that in the sentiments expressed in the concluding part of Deputy Norton's speech I only differ from him very slightly.  He said that the surplus should be utilised to pay a decent wage to people employed in the postal services.  I want to put it to the Deputy that the employees of that or any other service ought to be paid a decent wage whether the service has a surplus or not.  The wage should not depend on whether the Post Office is being run at a profit.  This amendment simply asks that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should inquire into the whole matter and report to this House as to whether the matters set out here would result in increases or reductions.  It goes on to suggest also that they should inquire about restoring the daily delivery service in <Col N="529" /> this country.  Is there anything wrong in asking that they should do that? We ought to look at this matter from our own standpoint.  We cannot blindly follow the lead of Great Britain because, as Deputy Norton pointed out whenever it suited his own particular arguments, conditions there are not comparable.  We ought to try to satisfy ourselves, through an examination by our own experts, whether a reduction in postal rates would lead to a reduction in revenue and would again get us into the position when the Post Office would be run at a serious loss.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Deputy in the course of his speech did not advert to the point raised by Deputy Brennan that, I think in Section 2 of the Bill, firms which had their headquarters in Great Britain, with certain branch establishments recently established in this country were being put in a privileged position as against purely Irish firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a great many Committee points himself, if I may say so.  The Deputy did not deal with the principle of the Bill at all.  It seems to me that an attempt has been made to envelop this amendment in a smoke screen.  I do not want to get into any of my colleague's mixed metaphors about wool and barnacles, but Deputy Norton has tried to get the House to believe that there is a great deal more in the amendment than appears on the surface.  I suggest to the Deputy that he would have enlightened the House a great deal more if he had first read the amendment with proper emphasis.  I suggest that there is no person in this House who should be more in favour of the amendment than Deputy Norton himself or who should be so ready to vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say very much on this Bill, except that I am more or less opposed to legislation of a piecemeal nature.  It is a well-known fact that this practice of introducing amending Bills is rather confusing for the general public.  A person who wants to know where he stands in <Col N="530" /> connection with a particular Act has to go back for years to look over various other Acts in order to get an idea of what is contained in these Acts. I think it has been advocated, not alone in this country but in other countries, that Governments should, if at all possible, bring legislation of this kind up to date.  I think that, instead of introducing this Bill, the Government should bring in a comprehensive measure dealing with the work of the Post Office in general.  That is all I desire to say on that point.  I could say a good deal about the way in which the Post Office is carried on, especially with regard to the workers.  I pricked my ears more or less when I heard Deputy Norton objecting to this amendment.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I was of opinion that the leader of the Labour Party would welcome this amendment, and, also like Deputy Morrissey, I came to the conclusion before Deputy Norton was very long speaking that it was a question of sour grapes.  He is opposed to the amendment because it is introduced by Deputy Mulcahy.  To use the Deputy's own words, he thinks that, with the near approach of the general election, Deputy Mulcahy might get some kudos out of the amendment.  In other words, he thinks that there is nobody entitled to speak on behalf of the workingman except Deputy Norton and the six members of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have stated here previously that I have been a trade unionist and a workingman, and that, as such, I am as much entitled to speak on behalf of the workingman as Deputy Norton.  I would advise Deputy Norton, in dealing with an amendment of this nature, to get rid of that narrow-minded spirit that seems to prevail in his Party, to view things in a straightforward way for what they are worth, to get away from the spirit of jealousy, and not to allow his conscience to be warped because an amendment like this happens to be introduced by a particular member of any Party.  I have not the means at my disposal to go into the facts and figures connected with the financial position of the Post Office. Neither have I burned any midnight oil in preparing my case, nor have I, what is better still, any paid officials <Col N="531" /> to supply it to me.  I generally use my commonsense in these matters.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Norton state that the mere fact of the postal rates being reduced in Great Britain reduced the revenue.  In other words, Deputy Norton judges the work of the Post Office in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  He has made no allowance for the benefits conferred on the general public as a result of the reduction of the postal rates in Great Britain. What about the workingman, of whom we hear so much from the leader of the Labour Party, the man who has not the 2d. to send a letter to his friend, but who, possibly, has a penny?  Is the reduction of the postal rate in England not a benefit to the thousands of poor working men there?  Would the reduction from 2d. to 1d. not be an advantage to thousands of poor people in this country, including the agricultural labourers with their miserable wages? Would it not be an advantage to such a man to send a letter to his friend in England or America at the reduced rate?</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Norton say here that State institutions should not be run for profit, but in the interests of the general public.  Yet, the tone of his speech is that he deplores the fact that the postal rates were lowered in England, and, as a result, the revenue was lowered <i>pro rata.</i>  If Deputy Norton's speech conveys anything, it conveys the impression that the postal rates should not be lowered under any consideration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could give the House some idea of the loss involved through the policy pursued by certain firms in this country who have branches in England, of addressing their letters from Great Britain, thereby taking advantage of the cheaper postal rate.  I should like to know what the loss really is.  I would remind Deputy Norton, and members of the Fianna Fáil Party also, that they are out day and night inviting people from Great Britain and other countries to start industries here. Those Deputies cannot have it both ways.  Deputy Norton was glad to invite certain people to Kildare in <Col N="532" /> order to start up industries there.  He did not care whether they came from Hong Kong or any other part of China. I am tired of all this talk about national industry, patriotism and nationality.  It is all a question of £ s. d.&mdash;the whole thing.  Deputy Norton would not object to any of these firms coming to Kildare to start industries, and he would not object if they sent every letter from Great Britain.</P>

      <P>My chief objection is to this question of piecemeal legislation.  I think this subject is sufficiently important to engage the attention of the Government and to encourage them to go into the whole question and bring in one big, comprehensive measure dealing with the business of the Post Office and particularly the position of the workers.  You cannot measure this service in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in quoting figures issued by the British Postmaster-General. I thought that when we would have our own Government we would hear no more about how the business is being conducted in a foreign parliament.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the leader of the Labour Party should welcome this amendment and take it for what it is worth.  It was put down in a genuine manner, not, as Deputy Norton suggests, to get votes at the coming general election.  If there are any Parties against whom that taunt can be flung they are the Fianna Fáil <Col N="533" /> and Labour Parties.  I think the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will admit that they are adopts at securing votes and putting up arguments and reasons why people should vote for them.</P>
    <P>This amendment is quite reasonable and it should commend itself to the Government.  It is submitted in a reasonable manner and not with any ulterior motive.  I am going to treat the thing on its merits, and I think the Government would do well to accept the amendment, then go into the whole question and introduce a comprehensive measure which will meet with the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I want to assure Deputy Mulcahy that there is a regular review of the situation in respect to these rural postal deliveries. Hardly a day goes by, certainly never a week, when the question of the restoration of some of the rural postal deliveries is not carefully examined with a view, wherever it is humanly possible, to restore those particular deliveries.  It should be remembered that the Post Office is a business concern and, that being so, one must deal with it from the point of view of pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were certain statements made <Col N="534" /> by Deputy Dockrell and, I think Deputy Alton, in respect to a fear which they had as to the possibility of the secrecy of the post being invaded. There is no question of the secrecy of the post being invaded any more than it was ever invaded.  I want to make it clear to the members of this House that the Post Office has no power whatsoever to open letters.  If the necessity ever arose for opening a letter, the Post Office would have to go to the Minister for Justice and secure a warrant before they could interfere with any closed packet.  Of course the printed matter to which this Bill mostly refers, being in open envelopes, can be inspected to see if there is an evasion of this particular Bill.  That, I take it, will be operated, but in no case will there be a question of anything being done that has not been done since this State was established.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin talked about the necessity for a revolution in the Post Office in order to secure efficiency.  I think Deputy McMenamin was talking without knowledge of certain facts.  If we were to produce a huge deficit on the Post Office I know the Deputy would be one of the first to endeavour to start a revolution in this House in view of the fact that we were responsible for the deficit.  Because of the Deputy's statement as to the inefficiency of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I want to give a few figures which will show that the Department is an efficient business concern run by efficient officers.  In the year 1922-23 there was a deficit in the Post Office of £1,108,260; in 1923-24 that was reduced to £773,749; in 1924-25 it was still further reduced to £471,974; in 1925-26 it was brought down to £413,967; in 1926-27 to £379,756; in 1927-28 to £262,774; in 1928-29 to £191,357; in 1929-30 to £162,678; in 1930-31 to £45,107.  Then for the first year a profit was shown.  In 1931-32 there was a profit of £66,947; in 1932-33 a profit of £17,357; in 1933-34 a profit of £35,707; in 1934-35 a profit of £206,860; in 1935-36 a profit of £317,812.  That does not point to the necessity for a revolution, as the Deputy suggested.  It shows a continual improvement.  If I so desired, <Col N="535" /> I could make a much more useful propaganda speech on these figures than Deputy Mulcahy made on his amendment, but there is a proper place for carrying on that type of propaganda, and I suggest it is not this House. When the occasion arises for making use of these figures, I hope to do it with some effect on the hustings.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Norton's reference to the messenger service, all I can say is that I will have the matter examined to see what is the actual position.  Most of the other queries which were mentioned I do not think require any very definite answer, but in order to make the matter clear I will just say this: as has already been explained, the Bill has been introduced to enable this Administration, in common with other countries, to give effect to the procedure prescribed at the International Postal Convention. Even if the letter and printed paper post rates here were reduced to the British level, the powers which the Bill secures for the Department would still be necessary to prevent evasion arising from posting in countries other than Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Furthermore, assuming that the Saorstát rates were now brought to the British level if, later on, the British Administration reduced its rates, is it contended that the Saorstát Post Office should again similarly reduce its rates or be faced with the abuse with which the Bill is intended to deal?</P>
    <P>I may mention that reduction of the letter post rate to the British level would involve an immediate loss in revenue of £267,000, approximately, per annum, while a reduction of the printed paper rate would lead to a further loss of over £7,000 per annum. The internal Saorstát parcel post rates were reduced last year and are now practically the same as the British rates.  The suggested reduction of the letter and printed paper rates would actually involve a total loss of revenue which would exceed the anticipated profit of the Department for the current year, viz., £200,000, and would put the Department back on a nonpaying basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> As regards the question of a probable increase of business arising from the application of lower postage rates, the experience of the Department is that any such reduction leads only to a negligible increase in traffic.  The Saorstát postcard rate was reduced in 1925, but there was no pronounced increase in traffic in consequence. Following upon the reduction last year of the Saorstát internal parcel post rates there is, so far, no noticeable traffic increase.</P>
    <P>While I do not see any connection between the subject of the Bill and the question of the frequency of delivery, I should point out that, commencing in 1923 for purposes of economy, frequency of delivery on some 1,300 rural posts was reduced, and the services of 491 part-time employees were dispensed with.  The restoration of these deliveries would, it is estimated, cost £36,000 per annum, while to afford delivery each weekday on all rural posts throughout the country would cost at least £50,000.  I may add that the Department frequently reviews rural posts to see if an increase of frequency would be justified.</P>

      <P>As I said in my opening statement, the question of the amount involved is not the principal reason why we had to introduce the measure.  The principal reason is the fact that there are concerns evading the postage rates here while decent firms are paying the rates due to this country.  It is in order to stop that and to bring these people down to the same level as the decent houses that we are introducing this.  I cannot say what the actual loss is, but, as I say, it is the question of principle that is involved and not the question of loss.</P>

The remarks of the Minister dealing with the finances of the Post Office show that there is very considerable and very efficient machinery for dealing with financial matters.  Do I understand that no <Col N="538" /> part of that machinery has been addressed to the question of estimating the loss arising out of evasion, or what it is likely to be?</P>

Probably I would be able to give it if the Deputy repeats the question when the Bill is next before the House.  It would be difficult to give an accurate estimate, because of the fact that these things have been going through, and as there was no machinery to stop them no cognisance of the amount going through was taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to effect a number of comparatively minor amendments in the provisions of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, none of which affect the principle of that Act and all of which arise out of the experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce in its administration.  They are, in the main, designed to make more elastic in certain respects the machinery which the Principal Act established for the regulation of imports.  I think Deputies may find it more convenient to discuss the detailed provisions of this Bill in Committee, as they are more or less unrelated one to the other, and have relation only directly to the provisions of the Principal Act.  However, I will indicate the main changes which it is proposed to effect by the amendments embodied in the various sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the Principal Act provided that the Executive Council should be empowered to make quota orders, but it was found that it was impossible to exercise the provisions of the Act for the purpose of providing for certain exemptions from the general prohibition of imports affected by a quota order.  The original legislation provided for the making of quota orders with reference to particular descriptions of goods.  In many cases the necessity to exempt from the general prohibition of importation arises from the purpose for which the proposed importation of goods was intended.  I might mention, by way of illustration, the importation of small quantities of goods by way of personal luggage. While there is power in the original Act to exclude from the prohibition of imports goods imported in quantities not exceeding a specified number for the personal use of the importer or members of his household, I think it is clear that the necessity of the case will change in particular circumstances. What is a reasonable importation in one particular case might be completely inadequate in another.  Another instance which I might mention is the importation of goods for the purpose of use in a stage play and intended to be subsequently re-exported.  Provision has been made in this Bill to remove these defects, and to provide for greater freedom in the matter of defining exemptions from general prohibitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also considered desirable to make more flexible the provisions of the Principal Act in the case of special quotas.  By the terms of the Principal Act a part of a general quota could be marked off and required to be the product of a particular country. Licences are issued within the quantity so marked off, and those licences are available only for the importation of the goods from that particular country. Under the existing Act, however, it is possible to use licenses issued as part of the general quota for the importation of goods from the country to which the special quota applies. That particular country would, therefore, gain both by the special quota and also by the use of general quota licences for its products.  Provision is made in the present Bill which would <Col N="541" /> enable licences in respect of the special quota to be restricted so as to enable importation from the country covered by the special quota to be restricted to licences issued under the special quota. Moreover, existing legislation is cumbersome in that in order to limit the importations of a particular country to a specified quantity of goods, that is goods covered by a quota order, it would really be necessary to make a large number of special quotas within the general quota for all the other countries concerned, leaving only a small or negligible quantity which could be imported from the particular country concerned, with others.</P>
    <P>Provision has also been made in this Bill by which the goods of a particular country may be excluded from the quota, and therefore remain subject to the general prohibition of imports imposed by the quota.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that that is quite a new principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And a new principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is a minor amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the general effect produced would be that, in fixing the quota quantity, the goods of a particular country or countries may be excluded, so that, in effect, the Saorstát importation is directed to the goods of one or more countries, and, where a special quota is issued, the goods coming from the particular country benefiting by that special order will be limited to the licences issued under the special quota, and may not be imported under the licences issued under a general quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also recasts the provisions in relation to persons who are entitled to registration in the register of importers.  In the first place, there is under the existing law the definition of a national of Saorstát Eireann, which has to be satisfied by any person applying for registration.  We are proposing to change that test to one of citizenship of Saorstát Eireann, and thus follow the general practice which has <Col N="542" /> been more recently adopted, making the test a general one instead of one having reference to a phrase like &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; which is the particular meaning conveyed by the definition embodied in the Bill itself.  In addition, it has been found desirable to extend the list of persons who may be registered, and to include therein Government Departments, in the first instance, and also certain corporations and institutions which normally import goods as part of their general operations.</P>
    <P>We are also making provision to allow of licences being issued in excess of the quota quantities in order to meet very special circumstances which might arise, where it was found impossible to import from a particular country owing to international difficulties, and in order to maintain supplies of quoted goods, that is, where it would be necessary to make provision for importation without waiting for the time which is necessary under the present law before fresh quota quantity orders can be issued.  That provision would also help to meet the situation which did arise here, in which there was an unexpected cessation of production, due to a fire at the works of the principal firm concerned in the production of the particular goods, and, for that or similar reasons, an unexpected cessation of production might arise in future and the necessity created for rapid importation of a quantity of the goods subject to the order.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the removal of persons from the register of importers.  These new provisions do not seriously affect the rights of individuals. Under the existing law, there are only two grounds upon which a person can be removed from the registers of importers, firstly, for the commission of any offence under the Act, and, secondly, if that person should fail to use licences issued on quota periods to the extent of at least 25 per cent.  Strictly speaking, as the law stands, a registered importer cannot be removed from the register even at his own request, and that position has resulted in registers containing the names of a number of people whose <Col N="543" /> continuance on the register serves no useful purpose, but who, because of the nature of the existing legislation, are entitled to receive licences in each quota period.  That situation is, as I have said, being remedied by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Power is also being taken to require the furnishing of information by persons applying for registration, which it has been found necessary to do in many cases.  Under the existing law, applicants are entitled to refuse the information which the Department might require, if they were so minded.  Failure to furnish information, when requested, is being made an offence in this Bill.  There are certain other minor changes which I do not think it is necessary to enumerate at this stage.  I have given an indication in general terms of the provisions of the Bill and I think I am justified in saying that they do not really import any new principle into the legislation, but that they are aimed mainly at simplifying and making more elastic the machinery set up by the Act where experience has shown such changes to be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's statement that this Bill introduces no new principle.  Section 5 is designed to complete what is to me, and to our Party, the odious and dangerous structure of the quota system in this country, and we gladly take this opportunity of accepting the challenge that we take this Bill to be from the Fianna Fáil Party on the general question of what the attitude of this country shall be in the future on trade and international commerce. Fianna Fáil with this Bill finally decorates itself and presents itself to the public as the sky-high tariff and quota Party.  We gladly accept that challenge and differentiate between ourselves and Fianna Fáil as the Party which regards all quotas as fundamentally, economically and politically unsound and which believes that, while the tariff weapon, prudently used, may be of inestimable value to the community, used as <Col N="544" /> Fianna Fáil has used and is using it, it can do nothing but injury&mdash;if we take the long view.</P>
      <P>We believe that it is not only the right but the duty of any Government in this country fearlessly to use the tariff weapon to provide protection for our own industrialists against a deliberate attempt by a foreign Government or foreign <i>cartel</i> to dump merchandise here, with a view to destroying an Irish industry in the hope of being able to exploit the Irish consumer after the Irish industry has been destroyed.  We believe it can be legitimate to use that weapon after due inquiry of as exhaustive a kind as it is practicable to make, in order to equate the labour conditions in any foreign enterprise with those which Oireachtas Eireann have determined to be suitable for citizens of this State working in industrial conditions here.  We believe that in the early stages of our fiscal independence&mdash;and we are still in those early stages and will be for some years to come&mdash;it is perfectly legitimate for the <i>bona fide</i> Irish industrialist who is enterprising, and who is prepared to risk at least part of his own capital, to come to the Irish Government and to say: &ldquo;I am prepared to put up a substantial part of my own capital; I am prepared to give adequate guarantees of good employment under good conditions of a kind that will be a social advantage to the State, provided I get the assistance of the Government to get under way in this industrial field, though I am far behindhand in the matter of time as compared with some of the great established foreign industries of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that much, Sir, to make perfectly clear&mdash;and it is true to say that it is something which this Party is proud of&mdash;that we stand as a moderate tariff Party against the sky-high tariffs imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I say that lest the misrepresentations of the Fianna Fáil Party and their kept newspaper which is engaged in a campaign of misrepresenting our policy to the people may <Col N="545" /> prevail.  That is why it is necessary that I should state categorically what our position is.  But this Bill calls for a special warning to the country that little men such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this country and his prototypes in several European countries are possessed with the illusion that they can with advantage to their native country dry up the channels of international trade by tariffs and quotas of a kind for which they have responsibility.  I say and I believe it can be proved beyond question of doubt that there is one effective method of blocking up the channels of international trade and that is blocking them up with the bodies of human beings.  If a policy of this kind, like what is being pushed in this country by the Fianna Fáil Government, is to be followed by the other nations of the world, then I say that war is to follow in the tracks of such a policy as surely as dawn is to follow night.</P>
    <P>A great many people think that you can gradually strangle all international commerce between yourself and any other country so long as it is to your own advantage to do so.  It cannot be done without accepting the inevitable consequences.  We are not the only country who have suffered under the delusion that such a thing can be done. But we are unique in this, that we are a country which has before it the example of many other countries who made the same attempt and failed, but got wisdom and are now trying to struggle out of the morass into which they unconsciously made their way. But with that object lesson in front of us we are trying to do exactly the same thing that those other countries in their folly did.  We have not got the excuse for our illusion that some European nations did have who talked of the necessity of having everything available within their own borders lest war should break upon them.  That argument can carry little or no force here because we are so circumstanced, that not having the natural resources to convert into the finished industrial product, there is no use in our talking about our creating a self-sufficient economy in this country.  We have to import rubber, coal, oil and so on from other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> If we are going to maintain a moderate standard of life in this country, absolute self-sufficiency is unattainable and we have to model our international relationships in the light of that fact.  The United States of America tried that.  They introduced an economic policy closely analogous to that which is at present proposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here.  That attempt brought upon the wealthy United States of America an unprecedented catastrophic economic debacle under which that great country is still struggling and struggling under the directorship of Colonel Roosevelt and Colonel Cordell Hull, the latter of whom went to Geneva and said: &ldquo;It is our duty to state in public that we are largely responsible for leading the world in this unwise policy, and because of this policy that we pursued we now recognise that it is our duty to show a way out of the desert into which we led the people of the world.&rdquo;  That is a fair paraphrase of the speech delivered by Mr. Cordell Hull at a meeting in Geneva a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>We lately saw something in the Press about the so-called holiday that Mr. Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade has taken at Ottawa. Does anyone who knows anything of international politics believe that it is a holiday that Mr. Runciman is taking?  Well-known rumours show that his object in going to America was to break down the obstacles that lay across the path of international trade between Great Britain and America. We hear again that the Oslo Convention is being revived and that the Scandinavian Governments are trying to get the adhesion of countries outside the Scandinavian group to that Convention with a view to establishing freer trade between that group and any other group they can find to trade with them.  We have France abandoning her high tariffs and announcing an all-round reduction in these tariffs.  France is doing that not because she loves somebody's blue eyes but because she recognises the wisdom of turning her back on the old economic heresy and facing the future and the problem of devaluation.</P>
    <Col N="547" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Was her action not entirely in consequence of devaluation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Devaluation was brought upon them by their own policy of high tariffs.  The savings of the small peasant and the small bourgeois in France have been reduced because of that.  However, since the Deputy objects, I want to raise no scares in this country, but perhaps the Deputy will consider what happened in France and ask himself could it happen in Ireland.  Every one of these countries and groups of countries to which I have referred are turning their backs on the very thing towards which we are now marching and marching with our eyes open.  To me the peculiar exasperation is that when policies of this kind are being followed the economic justifications for them are never advanced.  But we are always told that an economic policy of this character is vital to the national independence and the dignity of the country that is pursuing such a policy.  Herr Hitler and the German Reich are carrying on with the same codology there that the Fianna Fáil Government is carrying on here at the present time for the purpose of advancing this policy of economic self-sufficiency. The Government of the German Reich is at present proclaiming to the world that the economic self-sufficiency which they hope to accomplish by their four-year plan is for the purpose of establishing the national independence of Germany amongst the great powers of Europe.  We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce here saying that this policy is called for in order to knock the shackles off Caitlin Ni Houlihan's feet.  With the lesson from other nations before us we are using in connection with our policy the self-same words that are being used by the war-ridden Governments of Central Europe.  That is a misrepresentation. It is false, but what is horrible about it is that it is a most effective way to exploit sentiments that have done honour to our people for generations. Our people are prepared to make sacrifices, and will make sacrifices, if they believe they are doing so in defence of national integrity or national honour.  When they are told, on the authority of somebody whom <Col N="548" /> they have grown to trust, that these things are true, if they are themselves unable to understand the ratiocination that led up to these conclusions, they take them on faith and make their sacrifice.  When I contemplate the day when they will discover that it has all been an illusion and that the immense sacrifices they are being asked to make were secured by false pretences, it fills me with alarm.  We had a discussion here yesterday on the cost of living. This Bill is going further to exacerbate the problem which the Labour Party raised here yesterday.  It is going to force higher and higher the cost of living on the poorer sections of the community.  That is what the Bill is designed to do.  If these sacrifices were necessary to national independence, I believe our people would make them, just as the unfortunate people of Germany, inflamed with an exaggerated form of patriotism, are prepared to make them, but the cruel thing is that these sacrifices are quite unnecessary and do nothing to exalt the freedom or independence of this or any other country. On the contrary, they are bound, sooner or later, to lead this country into a position which may gravely imperil its independence and completely shatter its economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every country in Europe where this policy has been pursued to its logical end, money that ought to be spent on food for the people is being spent upon guns and armaments.  If I could only drive home to Deputies' minds that one fact which, on reflection, ought to be clear to them, then, this debate, for me at all events, would have served a useful purpose. There is only one means of securing economic nationalism.  You can secure economic self-sufficiency behind a hedge of bayonets and a wall of dead men's bodies.  Without these two protections, economic self-sufficiency is a pure chimera, a will-o'-the-wisp that can never be caught.  Erect these two defences, send out your men to war, spend your national income on the implements of war and you may preserve your economic self-sufficiency for a time but, in the long run, all your sacrifices will have been in vain.  Your <Col N="549" /> manhood will be slaughtered, your substance spent and, in the long run, you will have to recognise that, in order to live under modern conditions, humanity must trade.  We want to trade.  We want to preserve in this country a complete and balanced life for our own people.  These two things are not inconsistent.  Far from it.  A growing volume of international trade is complementary to a more and more abundant market for our domestic produce, agricultural and industrial.</P>

      <P>If there is an opportunity for mind to play upon mind and argument to clash with argument, which can be done without heat of any kind, it matters not which side is educated as to the truth of the matter, some good work will have been done. I think that the policy enshrined in <Col N="550" /> this Bill must lead to immense and futile sacrifices by our people and, if widely developed throughout the world, to certain war and all the disasters associated with such an event.  I believe also that, with growing international trade, with busy ports in this country receiving and dispatching goods, we can make our people more prosperous and develop our industries more successfully.  We can raise the standard of living of the people higher than we have ever done before.</P>
      <P>I take it that the view of the Fianna Fáil Party is the exact opposite to that&mdash;that they stand for economic self-sufficiency, for producing in this country everything this country can produce, whether its production be economic or not, and for the view that the less imports we have the better for everybody.  I say that if you do not sell you cannot buy.  I am quite prepared to take the verdict of the country upon that sooner or later.  When all the by-play about constitutions and political fol-de-lols which is rolling about the country is forgotten, the issue on which we are joined here to-day is going to be the vital issue.  If we can get the people of the country to face it, to open their minds to it, to examine it closely and, so far as in them lies, to understand it, I shall be quite content.  I am quite certain that if we could get the people &mdash; and particularly Deputies opposite&mdash;fully to understand what this problem really means, we might get unanimity in making this country a happier and more prosperous place for our people.</P>

      <P>A long time ago, Benjamin Franklin said that experience was a hard school but it was the only one fools could learn in.  It is going to be a very hard school before certain people in this country learn what their economic folly means and repent of it.  Deputy Corry got one lesson here in a debate which took place not so long ago that it cannot be easily remembered.  Deputy Corry had not got the experience in government which his colleague, now Minister for Agriculture, who used to talk as much folly as himself, acquired <Col N="551" /> after three or four years.  In a debate in this House dealing with the wages of agricultural labourers, Deputy Corry put a question to the Minister which the Minister himself might have put three years ago for Deputy Corry or, at all events, with the approval of Deputy Corry.  &ldquo;Why not stop all exports from this country to England,&rdquo; the Deputy asked.  The Minister for Agriculture assured him it could be done.  So it can.  The Minister for Agriculture went on to give the Deputy this lesson with regard to international trade, even the limited international trade between this country and England.  If we liked to stop all agricultural imports to England, it could be done at the cost of the suppression of one-third of our agricultural produce and the sacking from their employment of one-third of the three quarters of a million people employed in agriculture.  These things can be done.  The only question is: Is it wise to do them?  We have had our own experience here in the last five years.  It has been hard enough and bitter enough to have taught most people what the real lesson is.  Deputy Dillon has talked about the lessons expanded before our eyes in foreign countries.  Let us turn our eyes inwards and look at what has happened here.  Deputy Dillon talked about France and Deputy Moore interjected something about the devaluation of the franc.  Does he think that devaluation was a cause or an effect in France?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy read any commentator on what has happened in France, and he will find this, that when there suddenly emerged in France the first socialist Prime Minister the country ever had he found himself faced with a situation that meant a very ugly choice for him. He had to choose between what we are doing here&mdash;quotas and restrictions &mdash;and a lowering of tariffs.  His own statement was that looking ahead a choice in the first mentioned direction led to exchange restrictions.  He expressed his view in this way that that led inevitably to dictatorships such as they have in Germany and Italy.  His socialistic temperament reacted violently from that, and he took the other line open to him namely, a lowering of tariffs and the devaluation of the franc.  That is not the only example that can be given.  For two years past there has been this movement towards freer trade and a breaking down of international barriers.  It was started by Mussolini who called together the nations grouped round him, Austria-Hungary and Yugo-Slavia. Conferences were held and separate Treaties were entered into between those countries.  They all saw that they had to reconcile their complementary national economics.  Roumania did the same.  She held a series of conferences with countries around the Danube, and there also Treaties were entered into.  Later, the then Prime Minister of France made a declaration which still stands against any proof that can be brought to the contrary.  M. Flandin said that in no country could it be shown that economic nationalism could be a success.  He added that, on the contrary, in any country in which it had been tried it had been either a comparative or an absolute failure. Deputy Dillon referred to the United States of America, the nation which <Col N="553" /> was the first to embark on this policy of self-sufficiency.  The representative of that nation, Mr. Cordell Hull, came on a mission to Geneva to try and get the international barriers broken down.  While he was operating at Geneva in one particular summer period, the President of the United States of America had asked Congress to give him certain powers&mdash;these powers were that, so long as he did not reduce tariffs by anything more than 50 per cent., he could so operate in reducing tariffs without going near Congress.  In the exercise of that power he made 17 new Treaties on reduced tariffs.  If he did want to reduce tariffs by more than 50 per cent., he had to go back to Congress.  The Baltic nations recently grouped themselves at Oslo, and the Scandinavian nations, Finland, Holland and Denmark&mdash;all have agreed to have freedom of trade between themselves.</P>
      <P>We have then the movement started at Ottawa.  It is being persisted in. Apparently, it is going to be improved this year when the Prime Ministers meet in London round about the time of the Coronation.  It seems as if there is going to be a movement for better and freer trade amongst the nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations in which we are now happy to be for the good of this country. That general survey, brief as it is shows that while we are still infatuated with this nonsense, the other nations of the world at any rate are trying to get free of the shackles that they had put upon themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing from what is taking place in foreign countries, let us look at the situation here.  We have had a five years' test-out of a high tariff policy garnished with quotas, import restrictions, State credits, State loans and the rest.  What is the result?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave us one day as the test of employment in this country, the only test that anybody could have resort to so far as insurable occupation is concerned, and that is the number of insurance stamps sold.  The answer which the Minister gave to a question of mine addressed to him before Christmas shows that as between 1936 <Col N="554" /> and 1931 about 38,000 people have been put into insurable occupation. He said that about 22,000 had been put into employment on house building in 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that any discussion on insurable employment, the yield to the revenue from the Unemployment Insurance Fund is out of order on this Bill.  I am quite prepared to discuss these matters, but I would like to have an opportunity of sending for certain papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should send for them immediately.  According to the test put before us by the Minister himself, 38,000 people have been put into insurable occupation.  How many of those are in building and how many on relief schemes of an insurable occupation type?  On an occasion here when we had a debate about relief schemes, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance assured me that more than 50 per cent. of the moneys spent on relief schemes was expended on relief work of an insurable occupation type.  The number of people, therefore, who got into occupation of that type in 1936 &mdash;occupations financed by the expenditure of public money&mdash;has to be taken from the tot of this figure of 38,000 before we get the number of those who have found their way into industry in this country through quotas, tariffs, Government loans, Government credits and all the rest.  We have to start <Col N="555" /> off with this basic figure of 38,000, and to subtract from it the 22,000 that the Minister talked about in 1934 as being put into house building.  Of the 16,000 left, let us say that 5,000 found occupation on relief works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of whole-time employment right through the year.  We start with the basic figure of 38,000.  How many are on relief works on the basis of full-time employment, on the basis of being in insurable occupation?  I suggest, as a modest estimate, 5,000.  That is the figure that has to be subtracted from the 16,000, after having accounted for the 22,000 put into house building.</P>

      <P>It was nothing of the sort.  A test of unemployment insurance figures, based on full time occupation, shows a difference of about £149,000 between the fund in 1931 and 1936; on a basis of £4 put into the fund for each man occupied for 52 weeks, that is about 38,000 people put into employment.  From that, however, there has to be subtracted those who are occupied in the building trade, whatever the number is, because that has to be regarded as a temporary phase of employment.  I also suggest that there must also be subtracted some number&mdash;I do not know what the number is&mdash;representing those who have found their way into insurable occupations through relief schemes.</P>

He has said himself that the amount of noncompliance was about 2 per cent.&mdash;the same as it was in my time.  As I have said already, the stamp fund is the test, and the Minister himself realises that it is the test.  He gave me the figures for the stamps sold in 1936 as opposed to the stamps sold in 1931, and it showed such a sum as, transmuted into terms of people, gives a tot of 38,000 people.

I know that they represent out-workers in a good many cases, as well as juveniles, but when the calculations have been made backwards and forwards against all these factors, there is one outstanding figure, and that is the test of the stamp fund, and as between 1931 and 1936, 38,000 people are shown, but the Minister told us&mdash;of course, I am not taking that as a guarantee of accuracy &mdash;that 38,000 had been put into insurable occupations, and that in 1934 about 22,000 people were engaged directly in house building.</P>

      <P>That is what he purported to say.  I followed that up by saying that it was a seasonal occupation, and the answer I got was that there is not a variation of 1,000.  The Minister's statement was absurd, and I think he realised it was absurd.  I think he wanted to ease people's minds by talking about employment in connection with tariffed industries, and I think, therefore, that he exaggerated the employment in connection with building.  I do not believe that there were more than 19,000 or 20,000, but there was that.  What we must find out, however, is what increase in employment has occurred as a result of tariffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister is going to give his usual figure of 70,000.  I see where the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day gave the figure as 100,000, and maybe the next figure will be double that.  The stamp fund is there, however, and we want to get that fund calculation.  We were offered that test before by the Minister himself, so let us test it.  The figure may be 17,000 or 20,000&mdash;call it 25,000&mdash;it may go as low as 12,000&mdash;but there is some number of people who have got <Col N="558" /> employment through tariffs in the last five years.  What have we paid for it? Again, the Minister published two figures on the increased production. One of these masquerades as gross production, and the other is under the heading of net production.  The first is said to have been calculated in this way: that one found out what was the amount paid for the goods produced in manufactories in this country.  That represents the moneys got by the producers for the goods they have produced. That is up by £12,500,000 in certain industries.  That is a big sum.  It is a big sum, but when it is viewed in other ways it is not such a big sum. However, it is a big sum.  Certain overheads, however, have to be taken from that.  One overhead charge is the cost of the raw material, and then there is the cost of light, heat, and all the other things, and then we arrive at net production.  What is the result?  The net production, even including subsidies, which are not properly related to the matter, is about £2,500,000 on £12,500,000 gross.  That represents, not the whole, because the retailer has to come in, but it represents part of what the consumer has to pay.  Therefore, our tariffing of industries in this country in five years has meant that in certain groups the consumers are paying something additional to an increased cost of £12,500,000, and in the end we have a net production of £2,500,000.  That is interesting when one looks at it from the point of view of the relation between the employee and the manufacturer.</P>

      <P>Oh, I mean it seriously, but hardly seriously enough to warrant the Minister taking a note of it&mdash;that is, if it is to be dealt with in his usual way.  That figure of £12,500,000 represents part of the cost to the consumer, but not the entire cost.  The net increased production shown by the Minister's figures is about £2,500,000 and, of course, we <Col N="559" /> have to add on the retailer's profits and the retailer's ordinary charges. What is the result of that on the ordinary individual?  It is a notable fact that in most countries throughout the world, until this madness sort of swept everybody off their feet, Labour Governments were generally anti-tariff.  They were anti-tariff for the reason that they knew that the increased cost to themselves would well offset anything they would get in the way of increased moneys as a result of these tariffs.  One exception was Australia, and the reason Australia was an exception was that in that country there was an arbitration board consisting, in the majority, of Labour members, who always took care that increased wages would be kept a little bit ahead of increased prices. In the main, however, countries, in which Labour majorities ruled, showed their appreciation of the circumstances, of which they had had bitter experience, by being very much anti-tariff.  Whether they are so in this country or not, I do not know, but I know they are paying for it.</P>
      <P>It used to be a principle of taxation that a man was left, without its being subject to tax, a certain proportion of what he made.  It was understood that a man would require, for himself if he was unmarried, and for himself and his family if he was married, a certain subsistence allowance, and that was supposed to be free from tax.  In no country, except Germany in recent years&mdash;in her bad years&mdash;was such a blatant injustice attempted as a tax on the income of poor people.  That, of course, has been effected here.  It is possible in countries, and has been regarded as normal occasionally, to tax a necessity of life when circumstances demanded it, but in what country in the world does one find all the necessities of life taxed as they are here?  In this country you have a tax on bread, butter, sugar, and tea, and you have the tax imposed to the accompaniment of statements made by two members of the Government Party &mdash;one, that if you only taxed luxuries, people could avoid the taxation by not taking the luxuries, and therefore you had to come to necessities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I am talking of what the tariff policy has done here.  It has increased costs and it has driven the Government to the point of taxation of the poor man's necessities.  The second statement made when these taxes and assessments were imposed, was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  He said that it was absurd that, in a country like this, the workingman should not be forced to pay and the one way in which he could be forced to pay was through the taxation of such things as he required in order to sustain life.  Now, as I said, in most countries it is a principle of taxation that the first £100, the first £120, £150 or even £200, is supposed to be left free from the demands of the State by way of taxes but when you get your poor man, when you even get the man who is living on unemployment insurance, on unemployment assistance, even the man who is living on home assistance, taxed in necessities, it surely indicates the pitch to which this country has been brought and, I suggest, brought by the impact of the whole mad tariff movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you tax such things or if you raise the costs of such things as bread, butter, sugar and tea, the unfortunate man who has been kept from being completely destitute by the home help the State gives him, is subscribing to the State through the taxing of his resources.  In that way, it is possible, of course, to increase old age pensions on the one hand and to take back more than the amount of the increase through what is gathered in, in taxes on bread, butter, sugar and tea.  That is what we have been driven to as far as one side of our national economy is concerned at the moment.  We have increased costs out of all proportion. <Col N="561" /> We have driven down the poor man's subsistence allowance below the point at which it used to be regarded as nontaxable. We have taxed him even on that lowered standard.  We have added considerably to the burdens of the middle classes as well as to the almost complete extortion that has been imposed upon those who are supposed to be wealthy in this far from wealthy community.  It is, I think, just necessary to refer to the fact that the National Debt has gone up by £10,000,000 and that the local debt has gone up by something between £8,500,000 and £10,000,000.  That is, of course, a charge that we are not feeling at the moment.  It is being off-shouldered but it will have eventually to be paid, and paid by further encroachment on the subsistence allowance of the poor people.</P>
    <P>If there are benefits from these tariffs, where do the benefits go? The Minister decided that after the healthy impact of competition had been definitely removed from prices in this country, he was going to have prices regulated through the Prices Commission.  It is hard to be serious about the Prices Commission but it would be wrong to do them an injustice.  A more ineffective body has never functioned in a State and yet that body was given a task such as has never been known in this State. They were asked to do what has not been successfully accomplished in any other country, except during periods of war when there is no question of fair play and there is just a certain amount of ruthlessness required.  As far as control of prices by the Prices Commission was an ideal, it has certainly not been realised.  Somebody is getting the benefit from all these tariffs.  We, the consumers, know that.  We are paying outrageous prices; we are paying a price that the ordinary business man will charge if he is free from either competition or control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy from Cork told us that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy from Cork, who unfortunately is not here at the moment, told us that like any <Col N="562" /> other business man he would make what he could out of tariffs, and he said that business people would be fools if they had not been operating in that way.  Of course, they were operating in that way.  What business man would refuse to operate in that way when the chance is given to him?  If even the prices, or the benefits of these prices, were being scattered through the general community through increased wages, that would be one advantage.  If, however, the benefits are going to a small select group of individuals who will not have the same spending capacity, as a big number of smaller people, then we consumers get no benefit.  If wages are raised in tariffed industries through the impact of these quotas and tariffs, the money is kept in circulation and the general community will gain because there will be a lowering of relief and a lowering of all these other burdens that we have with us at the moment&mdash;unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, home help and so on.  But the situation is that prices have been very definitely increased over what we used to regard even as inflated prices, and there is a very small number of people getting benefit from increased employment. There is a very big sacrificefrom the community which they pay through taxation and which they partly pay through meeting borrowings, borrowings which are partly off-shouldered but all of which posterity will have to meet.  And the Minister comes here with this Bill and feels that he is doing a serious day's work in presenting it to us! He closes his eyes in regard to anything that is wrong in the world outside in regard to these matters.  He tries to distort the facts in order to get a more pleasant view of what is happening in the country.  Suppose he is going to be as successful as any man might appear to be in this matter, what has he touched?  The mere margin of life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These quotas and restrictions are imposed, as far as 90 per cent. of their effect is concerned, on industrial goods.  What does the Minister hope to achieve?  We know what he <Col N="563" /> has achieved.  Supposing they are going to operate amazingly well, does the Minister not know that his own statistics again show that more than half the countryside, more than half the people who are occupied in any gainful way, are occupied in agriculture? A fact that emerged from the 1926 Census of Production was that of every 100 people engaged in work in this country, 51 were engaged in agriculture, 14 had to do with industry and the remaining 35 were someway parasitic on the 51 engaged in agriculture and the 14 engaged in industry. The Minister in this Bill is dealing with 14 out of every 100.  What does he hope to raise that figure to?  Supposing his most optimistic dreams were realised, what is the turnover in the new 100 we will have to examine in, say, a census of production five years hence?  What will the 14 have risen to?  Will it go as high as even 16 out of every 100 in the country?  If it does show an increase, where will the reduction be?  Will it be a reduction in the 35 who are engaged in the trading and professional classes or in the 51 who are now in agriculture?  If industry is going to gain even in man power employed, where is the subtraction going to be?</P>
    <P>The Minister must also recognise a certain artificiality in this matter, apart from the general consideration as to how work is divided in this country as between agriculture and industry.  The Minister for Agriculture told Deputy Corry that, as far as this country was concerned, it must continue to produce agricultural products surplus to our own home requirements.  If we were going to confine ourselves to producing what this country needed, we would have to put on the unemployed market about 250,000 people.  The Minister for Agriculture told us, almost in the same breath, that his only hope of getting rid of our agricultural surplus was in Great Britain.  The Minister is going to impose under this Bill a variety of restrictions and quotas and he takes power to differentiate as between countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Some five years ago this Bill would have been introduced with a whoop of exultation as to how the British would be perturbed through its impact.  All that has gone.  It is now said that we are expecting, not very optimistically expecting, that we may get the Coal-Cattle Pact renewed with Great Britain.  The position is that we may get the coal from them if they think fit to supply us with it.  What an amazing turn! At one time we would not burn British coal; we had a tariff against it and we quotaed it.  Then the quota over night became a restriction in favour of British coal and nothing else.  Now we are hanging round expectantly, with our hats in our hands, wondering whether we will get the coal from Britain.  What a position! Our people for some two years have been forced to take British coal to the exclusion of other coal.</P>
    <P>One of these days, in this country, the labour community is going to awaken to what is going on.  There is a certain amount of anger developing in different circles at the sight of people meeting every year to preen themselves on what they have dug out of the consumer, with Government aid, through quotas and restrictions and tariffs.  There never was very much hostility that I could discover, properly placed, aroused by the inequalities of wealth and poverty. Outside the landlord class, who have disappeared for so long, if there were any great examples of wealth it was recognised that the people who had achieved it, had achieved it in the face of very stern competition; they were good employers and there was an appreciation that their gifts had brought them where they were and that there was no artificial aid required and no outcry for artificial aid.  Nowadays we have a different spectacle and it is developing a certain amount of anger amongst those who have to pay and who see the proceeds going into a very small number of hands and not being distributed widely through the country. There is a feeling of anger developing that that condition of affairs should not merely be tolerated, but that it should apparently be approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> We have the so-called prosperity of the country elevated to our notice when you have certain commercial issues over-subscribed and eagerly grasped, when some heavily tariffed industry in the country offers itself to the public and guarantees a 6, 7 or 8 per cent. preference share.  Some day labour is going to awaken to the fact that that 8 per cent. is fastened more or less permanently and is going to be paid before there is any attention devoted to the wages given to the workers, and it is going to be paid along with a possible increased wage to the workers, if that is demanded; but it is all going to be paid ultimately by the consumer, who has no redress and who cannot get any way of checking prices either by way of competition from outside or control inside.  All that is lauded here as being a sign of prosperity.</P>
    <P>This is the worst feature of the Bill. It is fiddling with insignificances.  The impact of that on the economy of this country is going to be small, but it is going to attract attention, and perhaps it is going to attract more than attention; it may, perhaps, attract anger and we may find, through the hostility aroused by the futility of this, that a good thing in the capitalist system may be dragged down.  There are quite a number of people in this country who are beginning to despair of a capitalist system which only perpetuates the abuses and cannot keep any of the virtues of that system which had lasted so long.</P>
    <P>It used to be that men risked their money, threw in their enterprise, their talents and whatever energy they had, picked up whatever money they could secure, and worked it all out into some sort of production on their own initiative, without outside help. There was this good in it, that when these people did work in that way and were subject to competition, the general public gained, because they got something that was produced against competition, that was produced and sold at a reasonable rate and there were organisations of the trade union type to see that that was not done by sweating workers.  Nowadays we get the goods not so well <Col N="566" /> produced, in the main; we get them sold, in the main, at high prices; we find that, in the main, the net production figures I have spoken of are not to any degree divided amongst workers and employers.  We find the community is paying the cost and a small number of individuals are reaping whatever gain there is.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, quite a number of people, who still believe in the capitalist system as an institution, would rather see in this country even bureaucratic control, with all the inefficiency that that means, than see a small number selected, by what means one does not know, and allowed&mdash; definitely and clearly the word must be used&mdash;to batten on the unfortunate people without displaying any of the virtues of the old capitalist system. The Bill, because it develops this system and all the abuses of it, is a Bill that is to be condemned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke of the movements in the world and he mentioned the Trade Ambassador in America who had been sent across to try to make amends for what that country did by starting this ramp.  There was a recent announcement by Mr. Cordell Hull, when looking for an extension of the Trade Agreements Act.  He addressed a letter to the Senate in America a few days ago.  He urged favourable action in regard to this Trade Agreements Bill as a means of easing the present-day political tension which is pushing many nations in the direction of military conflict.  He followed that with the declaration that there was not the slightest doubt that America's abandonment of the trade agreements programme at this juncture would mean the resumption of the international economic warfare which was showing such marked signs of abatement.  He spoke of the serious injury that would accrue to the United States in case of war, notwithstanding that their country would do everything humanly possible to keep out of it.  He said there was one sure way for that country to be spared a war and that was that they should see war would not occur.</P>
    <P>This is all argument addressed to the Senate with a view to passing a trade <Col N="567" /> agreement measure.  He led up to this, that in the years that lie immediately ahead an adequate revival of international trade is the most powerful single force for easing political tension and averting the danger of war.  The same newspaper issue that contains all that, contains the statement that a distinguished Frenchman had been sent to America, and the statement as to his mission was that he was to work for the <i>rapprochement</i> of the great democracies, which should unite in proving that stability can be achieved by freer trade.  There is a record in the same column of the meeting of the Oslo Powers' Conference trying to hammer out their view of freer trade amongst that group of nations.  As a finish to the column there is a remarkable speech made by General Smuts on world trade, which was the only way out of the otherwise inevitable war that he saw brooding over the world.  Against all that tendency in the world we offer this Bill. It is like nearly everything that has been done in this country.</P>

The Minister denied, as he denied before most emphatically, that any people were driven out of employment in this country during the last four years.

I gave the figure on the last occasion when the matter was under discussion and the Minister said it was nonsense and absurd and questioned where the figure was got.  Then I discovered that, as a matter of fact, I had given a figure 2,000 less than was given in answer to a question here by the Minister for Local Government some days previously regarding emigration.  There are 100,000 additional persons, according to the Minister and the <i>Irish Press</i>, put into employment, and at least 50,000 have gone to Great Britain in the last three years.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to effect certain minor changes in the machinery for the regulation of imports into the Saorstát.  Having repeated that, I still retain the position of being the only Deputy who has referred to the Bill, and I can now proceed to deal with the speeches of Deputies.  We are legislating here for the area comprised in the Irish Free State.  We are not legislating for the Continent of Europe, or the Continent of America, or even for the British Commonwealth of Nations.  It may seem strange that I should have to point out that fact to Deputies, but it appears to be necessary, at any rate, to make it clear to Deputies Dillon and McGilligan that nothing in this Bill is going to cause or avert a world war.  Nothing in this measure, or no action taken under this measure, is going to have any appreciable effect upon the general trend of international policy.  Nothing that we can do here is going to free the channels of international trade or secure the new development, which Deputy McGilligan tells us the Secretary of State in the United States of America, General Smuts in South Agrica, Hitler in Germany, and a number of other people to whom he referred, are striving towards.  We are legislating here with full regard to the present national and international position.  It <Col N="570" /> would be the extreme limit of folly for us to act as if the millenium had come throughout Europe merely because certain people are talking about it.  We have to deal with hard facts and those hard facts have to be met by the inauguration of new methods of administration, devising new machinery for dealing with economic problems and equipping the Government and people of this nation with the same weapons for dealing with difficulties associated with international trade that other nations have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon may be right or may be wrong as to the causes of the American debacle in 1929.  The great majority of the American people I do not think would agree with that view.  That is of no great importance. It merely proves that the great majority of the American people must be wrong.  But the American people have not left themselves bereft of the power of protecting their industries, of restricting imports, of entering into trade treaties with other countries on the basis of an exchange of specified goods.  The Trade Agreement Act to which Deputy McGilligan made reference, was designed for that purpose. Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan may be right or wrong, as to the cause of the recent temporary change in French policy.  I do not think it matters to us.  So far as we are concerned, we have to deal with a situation in which every nation with which we do trade is engaged in the process of restricting imports, diverting exports, and regulating its international trade regulations generally by means of quotas, by means of tariffs, by means of exchange restrictions and other devices not yet adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear from Deputies opposite frequent references to the British market.  If Deputy Dillon was sitting on these benches, and was concerned with the negotiation of trade treaties for the benefit of this country, concerned with the immediate practical problems associated with the international trade position, he would have to equip himself with precisely the power provided by the Control of Imports Act, which we propose to <Col N="571" /> amend by this Bill.  Even if he were to confine trade treaty negotiations to Great Britain, the British Government has quotaed imports, has a quota on our imports, and if we want to negotiate a trade treaty with Great Britain, Germany, Belgium or America, we have got to be in a position to say that we are prepared to take from these countries a specified quantity of their goods in return for their taking a specified quantity of our goods.  If we had not the Control of Imports Act we could not enter into these agreements, because we would have no power to impose the necessary restrictions on trade. That is why the Bill is necessary.</P>
    <P>It may or may not be true that free trade for the Continent of Europe would be better for the population of Europe and for all mankind.  We can debate that question on some other occasion.  Here we have to deal with practical problems, and the practical problems we have to deal with are those associated with the restrictions which all other countries can impose on our exports, and which we can only break down by a process of bargaining, by agreeing not to impose restrictions on their products if they undertake to remove restrictions on ours.  I am not so sure that if the change in policy to which Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon made reference were to be made that it would prove beneficial to this country.  We have had experience of free trade.  We have had more experience of free trade than any other European people, because for the best part of a century there were no restrictions of any kind upon imports or exports, and during that period we learned a bitter lesson.  It may be that certain classes of our people benefited by that freedom of trade.  Those engaged in the production of live stock undoubtedly increased very considerably during that period.  Its exportation became the biggest item in our trade returns, but during that period we had to offset the benefits secured by that small section of our people by the hardships imposed upon the great <Col N="572" /> majority, hardships so great that a vast number could not stand them and left this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talks of this policy of trade restrictions as being paid for in human life.  Four millions of our people left this country in the period of free trade because of the situation produced here by free trade, yet, Deputy Dillon tells us that his ideal is to get back into that position.  Our experience was a bitter one, and he would be a rash man who would seriously propose to the Irish people deliberately to set about restoring that position.  It is perfectly legitimate, said Deputy Dillon in his condescending manner, for Irish industrialists to approach the Government for protection but foolish for the Government to grant it.  The Deputy described his Party as a model tariff Party, remembering, no doubt, that the classical definition of &ldquo;model&rdquo; in the dictionary is a small imitation of the real thing.</P>

      <P>In our circumstances, and having regard to factors of which he is aware, should we adopt that policy; should we open our ports for the products of other countries whether they open their ports for our products or not?  Surely not.  He admits that if we are to move towards freer trade the movement must be reciprocal, but until that happens <Col N="573" /> legislation of this kind is necessary and cannot be avoided.  Our concern surely must be with the effects of this legislation and the policy which gave birth to it, upon our own people. Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Morrissey tried to deal with it. Deputy Dillon talked of the clash of minds and of the process of self-education. Deputy McGilligan has no enthusiasm for the clash of minds or of facts upon facts.  During the course of the past five years I have never yet succeeded in dealing with Deputy McGilligan's so-called facts and arguments in his presence in this House.</P>

      <P>That is the number of persons insured against unemployment. I am not claiming, and it would be foolish to claim, that all these people were in permanent employment during the whole year.  The actual increase in employment it would be difficult to express in the form of figures, and is <Col N="574" /> something less than that, but it is obviously more than the figure Deputy McGilligan gave.  The Deputy proceeded on another basis.  He assumed that everyone was in full-time employment, and that any increase took the form of an increase in the number of persons in full-time employment.  The figure 38,000 that he gave was wrong, but it was on that basis he made his calculation.  He took the total of contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, divided it by another figure which would represent the annual amount paid by those in full-time employment, and took the result as the number of persons in employment. It is nothing of the kind.  It is a notional number, which would represent the number in employment if everyone was employed for 52 weeks. Another and a better way to express it is the average number employed in each week of the year, and that number increased between 1931 and 1936, not by 38,000, but by 45,000.  That is the figure which represents the increase in the average number employed weekly one year against another in insurable employment; there was an increase in other forms of employment as well.</P>

      <P>That is, all types of employment which are classed as insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  I am not claiming that there is an increase of 75,000 or even 45,000 in employment in tariffed industries.  Nothing of the kind.  I will give the actual numbers employed in tariffed industries in a minute.  The increase resulting from all the activities of the Government in employment of that kind is about 75,000.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, the average spell of employment has <Col N="575" /> increased in length compared with 1931.  It could be said in respect of the year 1931 that, on the average, every insured person got about six months' work.  Some people, of course, got a full year's work, and some people got only a couple of weeks, but on the average they got six months' work per man, and that has increased to roughly eight or nine months' work per man per year.  The number of persons employed in industries&mdash;that is, industries of the kind which are covered by the partial census of industrial production taken annually&mdash;is, of course, a different figure.  Every year there is a partial census of industrial production. There are very important industries not included in that partial census &mdash;industries in respect of which the total employment is much more important than in those which are covered by it&mdash;but in respect of the industries covered by that partial census there are some interesting figures.  In 1929 there were employed in such industries 47,439 persons; by 1931 that figure had fallen to 44,819.  I want Deputies to note that fact&mdash;that when this Administration became responsible for the conduct of the affairs of this country the number of people engaged in industrial production had decreased, and decreased at quite a substantial rate.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy can think of one he will have plenty of opportunity for explaining it; I am merely drawing attention to the fact. Between 1931 and 1935, the last year for which we have got the figures, the number of persons employed in that limited group of industries increased by 25,000 There was an equally substantial increase during the course of last year, but what it was we will not know until some time about June or July of this year.  An extra 25,000 people were in fact employed in that group of industries.  We are told, of <Col N="576" /> course, that there is really no increase in employment at all; that the policy of the Government has put out of employment as many people as were put into employment.</P>

      <P>The number of male persons who were ever at any time engaged in the tobacco industry registered as unemployed in the whole of the twenty-six counties is 47, so we cannot possibly account for the 25,000 people there.  They have to be accounted for, if the Deputy's argument is correct, by reference to the tobacco industry alone.  In any case I have here a list of every occupation in the Saorstát in which people are employed, and, against the names of those occupations, the number of persons formerly engaged in those occupations and now unemployed; I cannot find a single one in which there has been any substantial increase in the number of unemployed. There are one or two cases of minor increases, but they are of no importance, and have no bearing upon the arguments of Deputies.  In the great majority of cases there is in fact a substantial decrease recorded.</P>

The number on the live register last week was 94,000, and a large proportion are either farmers or sons of farmers who were never previously regarded as unemployed, and who in fact do not come within the definition of &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; operative in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  If we want to compare the unemployment position with the unemployment position in other countries we have got to relate our total to some other figure.  Let us relate it to the population.  The number of persons upon our live register, even though that figure includes small farmers and others not included in a similar register in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, constitutes 3.1 per cent. of our total population. At the present moment, despite expenditure on armaments, despite all the efforts of the British Government, the number of unemployed in Great Britain is 3.7 per cent. of the population of that country. The number of unemployed in the Six North-eastern Counties, considered in relation to the population of that area, is double the number of unemployed in the Twenty-Six counties.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked where the people came from who were put into employment in industry &mdash;the 38,000 people to whom he referred; the 75,000 people about whom I am talking.  He said that that increased employment in industry was offset by decreased employment in agriculture.  Between 1937 and 1931&mdash;this is just for Deputy Morrissey's information&mdash;the number of persons employed in agriculture as members of families working on the family farms decreased by 29,000. Since then it has increased.  It has increased, I will admit, by a comparatively lesser figure.</P>

      <P>We will take one year at a time.  I am merely interested in comparing 1936 with the last year for which Cumann na gGaedheal was responsible; the period of free trade; the period in which we are assured everything existed which, if it existed now, would bring prosperity; the period when the Party opposite had realised their policy to its limits, and had produced their best results. There was, as I pointed out, declining employment in industry.  The number of persons employed in tariffed industries was going down; it fell by 4,000 between 1929 and 1931. The number of persons employed in agriculture was going down, and fell by 29,000 in the same period.  Since then the number has gone up.  In last year the number of permanent agricultural workers employed for wages, and the number of temporary agricultural workers employed for wages, was the highest ever recorded in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Our population, of course we are told, is now going down.  It is not going down.  It is true that the census of 1936 showed a slight diminution in the total population as compared with 1926, but to assume that that diminution was continuous throughout the whole of that period would be entirely fallacious.  There was in fact <Col N="579" /> a sharp drop in population until 1931, and a steady rise in population since then.</P>

It flattened out then to the same figure in June of 1935, and nine months afterwards the decline was shown.

The Deputies opposite are very concerned about emigration now. The total emigration in the four years 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935 added together was less than in the average year during Cumann na nGaedheal's term of office.

We have been doing our <Col N="581" /> best and the figures I have given show the extent to which we have succeeded. When we were talking about employment in 1931, we were talking in circumstances in which nobody knew the number of unemployed in the country. I will take off my hat to the political acumen of our predecessors, if not to their fair dealing with the people of this country, in the measures they took to conceal the unemployment existing here.  It was impossible to get even the material upon which to base an estimate as to unemployment here until 1932, when the new arrangements were made for registration and, in fact, until 1934, when the Unemployment Assistance Act came into operation. We then got for the first time a true indication of the extent of unemployment here and in every year since then, we have been able to record a substantial decrease in unemployment, a decrease totalling almost 20 per cent. in 1936 compared with 1935.</P>

      <P>Was it occasioned by the tariff policy?  Did they put taxes on tea and sugar in 1931 because of their tariff policy, the moderate tariff policy that Deputy Dillon talks about? Deputy Mulcahy knows quite well that Deputy McGilligan was talking nonsense. He is prepared to support that nonsense because he thinks it will bring in an occasional vote.  Deputy McGilligan does not care whether it brings in a vote or not.  He will talk nonsense anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> It used to be the practice, Deputy McGilligan told us, for the enterprising business man to put his money and his initiative into industry without seeking Government aid and without going to the Government and asking for any tariff protection, subsidy or other assistance.  It used to be, but where?  Not in this country.  That enterprising business man whom Deputy McGilligan visualises was very conspicuous by his absence during the years Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Certainly no enterprising business man came forward in that period to put his money, his initiative and his enterprise into an industry without Government assistance or without the benefit of protective tariffs.  If Deputy McGilligan can name the individual he has in mind, we can bring him forward as an example to the rest of the community, but, in my opinion, in this country the person who put his money into an industry without the benefit of protection, without the benefit of Government assistance in the restriction of imports from much more highly industrialised countries, where industries are capitalised on a much larger scale, would deserve to lose that money.  He would certainly not be an enterprising business man, in my opinion, but a philanthropist, giving money to contractors to build a factory and to suppliers of equipment to provide machinery, and then proceeding to shut down the whole concern, because that could be the only result.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for the people of this country, a country of 3,000,000 population, limited in its resources, side by side with the greatest industrial country in the world, within easy reach of a score of highly developed industrial nations, to develop its industrial activities without protection, without the assistance of measures of this kind, and without direct State intervention to restrict the competition which these other countries could bring to bear against our native industrialists. No industrial development would be possible otherwise, and it is sheer nonsense for Deputies opposite to pretend that an enterprising business man can make good without that assistance.  It could not be done, and <Col N="583" /> any Party that seeks to convince the people of this country that it could be done are merely wasting their time. We learned by experience that it could not be done.  We learned that the policy of moderate tariffs was merely a policy of taxation.  This idea that tariffs are a form of taxes upon the people persists in the minds of Fine Gael Deputies because that was their experience of them&mdash;the 10 per cent. duty here and the 5 per cent. duty somewhere else which was paid by the importers and made no difference whatever to the volume of imports.  That was the moderate tariff policy they operated.  It was not until the Control of Imports Act was brought into operation that really effective protection could be given to Irish industrialists, and the results of that effective protection are noticeable in every one of the industries concerned.</P>

      <P>In the case of boots and shoes, in the year 1933, we imported 8,436,000 boots or shoes and we produced here 3,178,000.  That figure represented an increase of 50 per cent. on 1931.  The Control of Imports Act came into operation in respect of that industry, and in 1936 we imported, not 8,000,000, but 1,800,000 and we produced, not 3,000,000, but 8,757,000.  In the case of rubber footwear, we imported, in 1933, 4,184,000 and, in 1936, 948,000.  We produced in 1933, none at all and in 1936, 1,448,000.  In the case of motor cars, imports decreased from 2,508 to 226 in that period and production increased from nil to 10,836.</P>

Our production in 1933 was 475,000 pairs and in 1936, 3,800,000 pairs.  I could give figures like these for everyone of the industries concerned but I will not delay the House by doing so.  I want to draw particular attention to one fact which these figures reveal and that is that not only has there been a substantial increase in home production but there has been a substantial increase as well in consumption.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy want more figures?  The consumption of boots and shoes in 1935 was 9,995,000 pairs; in 1936, it was 10,600,000.  Rubber shoes consumption in 1935 was 1,737,000 and in 1936, 2,296,000.  Motor cars in 1933, were 4,000; 1934, 6,400; 1935, 8,520; 1936, 10,836.  In silk and artificial silk hose the consumption increased from 3,546,000 pairs in 1933 to 4,554,000 pairs in 1936.  In woollen and worsteds the increase was from 5,534,000 yards in 1933 to over 6,000,000 in 1936.  It is not necessary to go on. I will merely draw attention to the fact that that increased consumption of these goods is indicative of the increasing purchasing power made available to the people of this country by the policy of this Government. This is election year and the best action the members of the Party opposite could take to secure the triumphant return of the Fianna Fáil Government would be by their voting against this Bill.  I invite them to do it.</P>

      <P>In submitting this Supplementary Estimate to the Dáil, I should like to make it clear that additional funds are not needed under the Estimate. This will be observed from the fact that the Estimate is for a token figure. The real purpose of the Estimate is to secure the sanction of the Dáil for extra statutory payments made or to be made within the present financial year to which the power conferred on the Minister by the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1934, does not extend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To explain the matter, it is necessary to point out the effect certain provisions of the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1934, had on the general principles of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929.  Under Section 3 of the Act of 1929 the Minister was empowered to make grants and loans towards the erection or improvement of dwellinghouses in the Gaeltacht subject to the condition set out in Section 11 (3) that a preference should be given to the occupiers of dwelling-houses in which the Irish language was the habitual language of the home, but no such preference was stipulated in connection with the making of grants and loans under Sections 4 and <Col N="588" /> 5 of the Act towards the erection or improvement of poultry houses or piggeries.  The provision of proper and healthy dwelling accommodation was the primary work to be performed under the Act, and the number of applications received from Irish-speaking households in connection with the erection or improvement of dwellinghouses was so large that it became quite clear that similar applications from non-Irish-speaking householders could not be attended to for an indefinite period.  It was therefore decided, when the Act of 1934 was being prepared that, from the point of view of applicants from English-speaking households, no useful purpose would be served by the continuance of their right to make application as there was no possibility within a reasonable period of applications from such households being dealt with.  To obviate, therefore, a possible injustice or breach of faith, it was considered advisable to restrict the making of grants and loans in connection with the erection or improvement of dwellinghouses to cases where Irish was the habitual language of the home.  The policy of restricting application to households where Irish was the habitual language was intended to apply to dwellinghouses only and at no stage was it intended to apply to householders making application for assistance towards the erection or improvement of poultry houses and piggeries.  It was recognised that the measure of assistance provided under Sections 4 and 5 of the Principal Act in this regard was concerned with economic conditions rather than with the language question.  This intention was clearly demonstrated when the Minister who had charge of the 1934 Bill stated, in reply to a question from a Deputy, that there would still be power under the Act to continue to give assistance in connection with the erection or improvement of poultry houses and piggeries to occupiers of dwellinghouses in the Gaeltacht, where Irish was not the habitual language of the home.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1934 having been passed, it was administered as understood to include power to grant assistance towards the erection or improvement <Col N="589" /> of poultry houses and piggeries, irrespective of the language of the household.  The proper interpretation of Section 4 of that Act having come into question recently, the matter was submitted to the Attorney-General, who advised that the section, as it stands, restricts the giving of assistance of all kinds under the Act to occupiers of dwelling-houses in which the Irish language is habitually used as the home language of the household.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that there is no statutory authority for such payments already made or falling to be made in the financial year 1936-37, and in order to prevent hardship to those who have incurred expense on the strength of sanction given by the Minister, it is necessary to obtain authority from the Dáil to charge against the Vote those grants which were sanctioned before it was ascertained that there was no statutory authority to cover them, and which, it is estimated, will fall due for payment during that year.  Of the gross amount being asked for in this Estimate, £164 10s. 0d. has already been paid out, and a further sum not exceeding £135 10s. 0d. will, it is estimated, be payable before the end of the financial year.  As already stated, additional funds are not necessary, as the amount required was included under sub-head H (3) in the original Estimate for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Dáil it may be stated that no loans in amplification of the grants referred to have been sanctioned, and, therefore, no necessity arises for the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate for the authorisation of loans of that kind. The amount of such grants sanctioned by the Minister before it was ascertained that the Act was being infringed is £2,105, affecting 260 cases, and it is intended to seek Dáil sanction for estimated requirements for the remainder in Estimates for future years.</P>
    <P>It is being considered at present whether the policy of making grants for poultry houses and piggeries to occupiers of dwelling-houses in which Irish is not the habitual language of the home should be continued.  Other Departments are concerned, and the <Col N="590" /> matter will be discussed with them with a view to an early decision. Should it then be deemed advisable to continue making these grants, fresh legislation will, if necessary, be prepared without delay.  However, the matter now before the Dáil is the question of obtaining authority for the payments made during the current financial year or to be made before the end of that year.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the cause of the misinterpretation of the Act will be appreciated, and, doubtless, the Dáil will readily agree to accord its sanction, so that the absence of authority to make the grants out of the Vote for Gaeltacht Services will not inflict hardship on any person who has been promised this type of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is being asked to agree to an expenditure of £300 for the construction of poultry houses and piggeries in certain parts of the Gaeltacht.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that it is necessary for the House to do this in order to prevent possible injustice or a possible breach of faith with the people in the Irish-speaking districts.  I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary any information as to what the people in the Irish-speaking districts think of the usefulness of their poultry houses and piggeries to-day?  The Minister for Agriculture has been advised that the pig-rearing industry is nearly extinct in some parts of those areas, and that there has been a tremendous decrease in the production of poultry.  If ever there was a case of &ldquo;Fál an bhodaigh tar éis na foghlach,&rdquo; we have it with us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £300 is going to be provided for the construction of certain piggeries and poultry houses in the Irish-speaking districts I would like to draw the attention of the House and of the Parliamentary Secretary to what the people in the Irish-speaking districts think of the present situation. He may have seen the representations made by the people in the parish of Ballyvourney to the Minister for Agriculture, or he may not; but I think that when asked to vote money for the building of further poultry houses and further piggeries in <Col N="591" /> the Irish-speaking districts, the members of the Dáil ought to have this statement in front of them.  It was a statement addressed to the Minister for Agriculture arising out of a meeting held on the 31st January, 1937, and it says:</P>

    <P>The Minister is asking the House for £300 for more piggeries and more hen-houses.  Why is it possible for a statement such as I have read to come from a district like Ballyvourney and districts representative of the greater part of West Cork, Kerry, Mayo, Donegal&mdash;the greater part of the Gaeltacht?  Why is it possible, I ask? Because circumstances exist here which, <Col N="594" /> in the last few years, have reduced our exports of poultry by a quarter of a million pounds, and our exports of eggs by £1,234,000, and reduced the number of pigs in the country during the last two years from 1,227,000 in 1934 to 1,087,000 in 1935, and 1,016,000 in 1936; or a reduction of 200,000 pigs in the country in the last two years.  Surely, when the Parliamentary Secretary talks of possible injustice and breach of faith with the people in these districts, it is merely an ineffective taoibhín he is putting on the situation for the people in these districts when he offers them £300 for more pig-houses and more hen-houses, when the Parliamentary Secretary knows very well that what is down there in that statement is perfectly true.  I should like the Minister to address himself to the condition of the people.</P>

The number of hens and pigs in these districts has been very substantially reduced.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in what areas these new hen-houses and these new pig-houses are going to be provided, and if he will tell us what change has taken place in the number of poultry and in the number of pigs in those areas in which he is going to have those new hen-houses and pig-houses put up.</P>

      <P>The question which has been before the House is to make good to certain people who have undergone a certain amount of expense for the erection of poultry houses and piggeries, their expenses in accordance with the undertaking given by the Minister in introducing the 1934 Amendment Act.  As I explained in my opening statement, it was found, when that Act came to be administered, that there was no statutory authority for making these payments, and the amount I am now asking the Dáil to sanction is to save these people from being at the loss of the expense they have incurred in the erection of these poultry houses and piggeries.  It was understood that these moneys could be paid to people in whose houses the Irish language was not the habitual language, but it was found, when it came to administering the Act, that that section of the Act was confined to people in whose homes Irish was the habitual language.  The amount is merely a token Vote to legalise the payments which have been made, or which will come to be made before the close of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the questions which have been raised by Deputy Mulcahy I do not propose to deal with them, as they might more properly be directed, <Col N="597" /> I think, to other Departments.  For instance, the question of the control of prices and of all matters pertaining to prices is, I think, a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is not my function to deal with such questions.  I am merely asking the House to sanction those payments to enable the Government to keep its contract with these people.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is to give effect to the agreement reached at the International Non-Intervention Committee on the 17th of this month, namely, that the Governments who are parties to the non-intervention policy should, as from midnight on February 20th-21st&mdash;that is Saturday&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;extend the non-intervention agreement to cover the recruitment in, the transit through or departure from, their respective countries of persons of non-Spanish nationality proposing to proceed to Spain or the Spanish dependencies for the purpose of taking service in the present civil war.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered that in August of last year, on the initiative of the French Government, the International Non-Intervention Committee was established.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann became a member of that Committee in the belief that the policy of the Non-Intervention Committee was best in the interests of Spain itself as well as in the interests of European peace.  The Governments represented on the Non-Intervention Committee decided, towards the end of September, to prohibit exports of arms and ammunition to Spain from their respective countries.  It is common knowledge that the prohibition of the export has not been strictly adhered to.  It is also well known that during the last three or four months, considerable numbers of volunteers from various countries have joined the armies of the two parties in Spain.  No matter what side in the present conflict one's sympathies may lie&mdash;and there can be no doubt on which side is the sympathy of the vast majority of the people of this country&mdash;there must be a general desire to see the present conflict in Spain brought to a speedy conclusion. The Governments represented on the Non-Intervention Committee realised that so long as arms and ammunition <Col N="599" /> were imported into Spain and that Volunteers from various countries could join the ranks of either party, the present war in Spain was likely to continue almost indefinitely.  Apart from the fact that the continuance of the war would entail increasing loss of life and property, the presence of foreign volunteers in Spain greatly increases the danger of an international incident which might seriously affect the peace of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Governments represented on the Non-Intervention Committee accordingly agreed that they would prohibit their nationals from taking part in the civil war on either side.  They also agreed to a system of supervision of the land and sea frontiers of Spain in order to prevent the exportation of arms and ammunition to that country. The Government of Saorstát Eireann have agreed to the proposals of the Non-Intervention Committee because they believe it is the only contribution the Saorstát can make towards bringing the present conflict in Spain to an end and preventing that conflict from spreading beyond Spain, thus endangering the peace of Europe.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann also believe that it is better that the Spanish people should settle their differences free from outside interference and work out for themselves the form of Government most suited to their own ideals and needs.  Clearly, it is only such a Government that can last there.  It is for these reasons that the Dáil is being asked to pass the present Bill.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the text of the Bill itself what steps it is proposed to take and I do not feel that any explanation of the various sections is called for.  There is one section, however, to which I should like to draw particular attention.  I refer to Section 10 which gives power to the Executive Council to prevent the export from Saorstát Eireann of articles which, in its opinion, are implements of war or war material.  Deputies may be aware that by Section 16 of the Firearms Act, 1925, the export of arms and munitions from Saorstát Eireann is prohibited unless licensed by the Minister for <Col N="600" /> Justice.  The Firearms Act, however, does not cover all implements and material of war.  The International Non-Intervention Committee are anxious that the prohibition regarding the export of arms and war material should cover all classes of arms and war material They have, accordingly, requested all Governments represented on the Committee to take steps to prohibit the export of all types of war material.  As Saorstát Eireann does not manufacture arms or war material, it is unlikely that this section will have to be used but the power to prohibit the export of such material is taken in order to carry out the request of the Non-Intervention Committee for uniformity regarding the classes of material the export of which is prohibited in the various countries.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have indicated, I propose the Second Reading of this Bill.  Before I sit down I should like to ask the House to enable us to meet the wishes, so far as it is possible, of the Non-Intervention Committee, to make this Bill effective and to give us the necessary powers to prevent the enlistment of volunteers and the export of war material, as from Saturday. From the manner in which I was met last night I had reason to hope that I would be facilitated in this matter.  I would like to know as soon as possible from the Opposition whether they can give us this Bill to-morrow.  I do not like to ask the House to come back on Saturday.  I know that a large number of Deputies have arrangements of various kinds made, but we would like to fulfil our obligations and do our part in making the Bill effective as from midnight on Saturday.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the President a question.  We have come back after the Christmas recess.  The Spanish war has been on for a long time.  The President, no doubt, has been in touch with the situation through channels from which he may have got information, but he has not communicated any information to this House or to the country.  We have done very little Government business and now we are asked to sit late, <Col N="601" /> longer than the ordinary parliamentary week, for the purpose of bringing about a certain state of affairs on Saturday that does not appear to matter twopence as far as the position in Europe or in this country is concerned, and that could quite as satisfactorily be done next week in the ordinary parliamentary time. What business is going to be done during the ordinary parliamentary time next week that would prevent this matter being finally concluded after we have had more time to consider it than the President now suggests?  I would like to ask him what is going to be the effect on the situation in this country and its relation to Spain, or what is going to be the effect on the position in Europe of our not passing this Bill until, say, Wednesday or Thursday next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear that our only desire to get this Bill through by Saturday is to fall in with the agreement that was reached at the Non-Intervention Committee. It may not matter a great deal here, but it may matter a good deal to Spain and other countries in Europe that all the Governments concerned should uniformly have come to an arrangement by which recruitment and the export of war material to Spain could be prevented.  I do not want at all to rush the House.  If the Opposition are opposed to my doing it now, we can, of course, deal with this on Wednesday, but I think it is my duty, anyhow, as Minister for External Affairs, to ask the House and urge upon Deputies that we should co-operate with other nations in getting this thing made effective at the time agreed upon.  If the Opposition are not prepared for that course, I will simply have to give way.</P>

      <P>We are asked to sit specially in this country to bring ourselves into direct line with a group of statesmen in Europe who, from our point of view, have been botching the situation in Europe and who have been playing for their own ends in different ways.  The President may have information that would take that impression from our minds.  The President <Col N="602" /> is being asked, in amendments put down here, to meet the wishes of the House and the wishes of the country in certain ways.  If the President meets the House in the way in which the reasoned amendments are asking him, then it might be quite easy to wind up the discussion of this matter quickly.  Even if the attitude of the President is that he is not prepared to meet the Opposition in the reasoned amendments put down, I think he will admit that, in justice to the House and the country, we ought to have the period between now and Wednesday to think further over the matter and that nothing is going to happen in Spain by reason of the fact that we take three or four more days to do a bit of work that is rushed before us in such a way that it was not even on the Order Paper yesterday, all in order to be in line with a group of people who do not seem to be doing their own business very well or very speedily.</P>

He wants to drag the State in, in connection with our freedom of action, where we are prepared to defend with our lives the Faith&mdash;Christianity and the Catholic religion&mdash;and it is to defend that that 2,000 Irishmen are to-night in the trenches before Madrid.</P>

There was, I suggest to the President, ample opportunity to-day for this Bill to be taken, but it was not taken. Other Bills, the urgency of which I cannot see, were taken to-day.

      <P>It was quite obvious that we should give a reasonable time, so far as was possible, to the Opposition to study the Bill&mdash;it is not a very long one&mdash;to prepare any statements they wanted to make and to look up any newspaper clippings or anything else they wanted.  Evidently there is a great deal of difference of opinion on the opposite benches as to what to do about the Bill. Last night I got the impression that we were going to have no difficulty with this Bill, that the need for it was recognised on the opposite benches, and that everything possible would be done by the Opposition to make it possible to have the measure in time.  We have all day to-morrow to consider it.  I think Deputy Mulcahy misunderstood me. I do not wish to bring the House back on Saturday.  I stated that I felt it my duty as Minister for External Affairs to implement my promise, as far as I could, without using the majority here just to pass the Bill, without giving those who <Col N="605" /> are opposed to it a fair opportunity to give their views on the matter and to discuss it.  As Minister for External Affairs and the person responsible for the Bill I am anxious, so far as it lies in my power, reasonably to implement that promise.  I believe it is important that all the Governments should have powers at their disposal by Saturday next to prevent recruitment and to prevent the going of volunteers to either side in Spain, and also to prevent&mdash;it would be more a matter for other countries than for this country&mdash;the export of war material.  If the Opposition is opposed to that, the only thing I can do is to give them until Wednesday.  Then on Wednesday I will expect to have all the Stages of the Bill finished.  That is, that we can discuss this again to-morrow and on Wednesday.  At the same time, I would ask if it is at all possible for the Opposition to facilitate us by making it possible for us to line up with the other nations. There are 27 nations.  All the nations of Europe are represented on this Non-Intervention Committee&mdash;all of Europe.  I am anxious that we should play our part in trying to shorten this conflict in Spain by preventing the export of arms to the combatants and also by preventing recruitment for the various sides who are fighting out in Spain&mdash;a fight which for most of them, at any rate, is not the sort of fight that we think it is, but is a fight for one &ldquo;ism&rdquo; against another.</P>

      <P>Might I indicate to the President a means by which it might be possible to get the Bill through by Monday?  I suggest that with the exception of the mover of the motion and the mover of the amendment&mdash;who I hope will not take more than two hours&mdash;there might be a common agreement limiting the speeches to 30 minutes.  The President, for once, might break precedent and suggest to the Ceann Comhairle, or the Ceann Comhairle suggest to the House that all <Col N="606" /> Deputies who want to speak on the matter should confine themselves to 20 minutes, because I can foresee, judging by some of the marathon speakers we have in the House, that we might otherwise have to go on until Wednesday month.  I make the suggestion seriously because it is a very serious matter.  As a matter of fact, I feel, as one who can fairly interpret the feelings of the community at large in matters such as this, that there is considerable opposition to this measure in the country. For that, if for no other reason, I feel that the President should give a little extra time.  At the same time, I feel that we should at least have that much respect for the President and the high office he holds as, in a matter of this kind, to submit at least to the curtailment of speeches so that full and free expression can be given to views on every side of the House.</P>

      <P>With the permission of both benches, I may be permitted to move the amendment which I handed in to-day:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the following: &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a second reading to the Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Bill, 1937, until the Government have broken off diplomatic relations with the Caballero Government in Spain.</P>
      <P>I hoped that the mere handing in of the amendment might have been utilised by the President to depart from his usual practice, at least that it might have conveyed to him that this Bill was not, in its present form, and in the present circumstances that surround it, by any means the non-contentious measure he seems to imagine it is.  I thought he might have availed of the opportunity in introducing this Bill to make the position of the Government clear, or at least somewhat clearer, and in another way than I am afraid he has made it&mdash;I say afraid because there were some remarks dropped by the President which I do think did make the President's position rather clear. That particular remark is one to which I shall have to refer later; that the fight in Spain is a fight between &ldquo;isms.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  There are few things ever said by the President that, being listened to, have not one interpretation, and a long time after get another interpretation that seems to be exactly the opposite.  I am going to quote from other members of the Party more definite views expressed to that same purport.  I <Col N="609" /> was hoping that the President would make a decision on our attitude towards the Spanish civil war, or as I prefer to call it, the war now going on in Spain, because it is much more than a civil war and there is a great deal more involved in it.  I have no objection if in the Short Title it should be hurriedly referred to as the Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Bill, but I wish to make it quite clear from the start that I am convinced now, and have been convinced for months, that the civil war aspect is the less important aspect of that particular struggle.  It is, if the President likes, a struggle between &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; between Communism and Religionism, I suppose it might be called.  That is what it is essentially, and that is why we thought last November, and in the questions put to-day to the President, that he might avail of the opportunity given him to make clear, at least to the people of this country, and to any other people that may be interested in our views, what our attitude was towards this struggle between &ldquo;isms&rdquo; in Spain.  What is the Government's policy as regards this struggle?  The President said in a very vague and guarded way that we should not mind what our sympathies might lead us to do.  He was equally vague and equally guarded, with nothing definite, as to where the sympathies of the Irish people lay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does it matter what the majority of the Irish people think? What does it matter what their sympathies are?  The President is going to do the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; thing. Perish the idea of what the Irish people may think.  What does it matter about <i>their</i> sympathies?  Does that influence the President?  No.  He is going to be &ldquo;correct,&rdquo; because he suggests that this is a measure that will help to bring an early end to the struggle in Spain.  Apparently he is not interested in what the end will be. Why should he be, in this struggle between &ldquo;isms&rdquo;?  The main thing is to bring the struggle to an end.  He thinks this Bill will facilitate that. Surely the Minister for External Affairs should, at least, have had various opportunities, since the question was first raised in this House, <Col N="610" /> and even before it was raised here, to give us, on behalf of the Government, some account of what is happening as regards the policy of non-intervention. The President says that this State, whose foreign policy I gather is not guided from any outside source, is a member of the Non-Intervention Committee; that there are 27 States in all, of which admittedly we are one.  Can he tell us to what extent that policy of non-intervention has been a success, to what extent the engagements entered into by his 26 colleagues have been honoured? These are matters on which he could have given us information.  He preferred not to say a single word about that, except to suggest that there was bad faith on the part of some other members of the Committee.  Does the President deny that interpretation of what he said as regards other members of the committee?  Did he not convey to the House that members of the committee had entered into commitments which they did not observe? The President could have made a case. He did not make it.  I can see that a case could be made, and that there are sound grounds for the policy of non-intervention, if that policy could be made a reality.  He did not bother to make that case.  He has never made that case.  I think the only words said in favour of that case were not said by the President but, by the Opposition.  All the President has done is to hide himself behind the skirts of the Non-Intervention Committee. So far as the people of Ireland are concerned they require no information.  What do they matter? This wretched little people off the shores of the Continent! Need they be told?  No! He and other people&mdash; unnamed as far as the bulk of the Irish people are concerned&mdash;have come to an agreement.  Why have they come to an agreement?  Nobody knows. Each man can think it out for himself. He will get no help from the Minister for External Affairs in that particular matter.  Is that the way to administer the Department of External Affairs?  Is that the way to treat the Irish people, to keep them absolutely in the dark, when a measure is being passed, that the <Col N="611" /> President, by implication, acknowledges outrages the feelings of the people or, in case I misinterpret him, is not in accordance with the sympathies of the people?  Surely if that is so, the President should have put the case.  Even if he has the contempt for this House that he has often shown, ought he to have the same contempt for the Irish people?  He may have the view that we are a paltry people off the shores of Europe but, at least, we have to decide our own conduct in this matter, and worthless as our sympathies may be, to be contemned as they may be, at least the people deserve better treatment and more information than they have got in this matter.</P>
    <P>The President in the course of a little essay gave us really no information. Does the President pretend that he gave us anything except what was in the newspapers for the last few days?  He spoke about the failure of the Intervention Pact on arms.  He is now entering into an agreement which he can enforce in this country.  Has he any guarantee that the same agreement is to be enforced by other countries? How is it to be enforced?  No indication.  The President said there were 27 members.  May I ask one question, the answer to which will help? Is Mexico a member?  Surely the President can answer and help the debate to that extent.  Will he answer? He refuses.  That shows the help given in democratic parliamentary institutions by the most recent convert to democracy&mdash;not the most recent convert as Russia is more recent.  He will not tell us.  Supposing Mexico is not a member what is to prevent the passage of volunteers from, say, Russia to Mexico and their then coming back to Spain.  Have the Non-Intervention Powers power to blockade the ports of Spain against States that are not members of this committee?  I do not know why the President will not give us any information.  He is a member of the Non-Intervention Committee.  I admit that he is not a member of the Select Committee&mdash;he is not select enough for that&mdash;but he is a member of the Non-Intervention <Col N="612" /> Committee.  What part did we take in this whole discussion?  What care has the Government given to this whole question?  Had they any evidence to show that they have ever thought over the matter one way or another?  If there is such evidence, I put it to the House, is it before the House?  I put it to the country, is it before the country?  Surely those are reasons why the President must see that it is an outrage to try to rush a Bill of this kind, riling the sympathies of the majority of the people.  I presume that is what the President meant. I presume he meant that the majority of the people are on the side of General Franco.  I wonder did he mean that, because he was careful not to state it. What he stated was that there is no doubt where the sympathies of the majority of the people of this country are.  I have never got a clear indication from that particular Party as to where they think the sympathies of the majority of the people of this country are.  At present I know only one what I can call official statement, apart from the &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, which I have unfortunately misinterpreted, on the part of the President.  Here is a quotation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn.  I take it from the Government organ&mdash;excuse me, the Fianna Fáil organ.  At Gort, on Sunday, 2nd August, 1936, we had this contribution from the Government Benches: &ldquo;Systems of Government in parts of Europe were in a state of flux.  They had dictatorships in Russia, Italy and Germany, and at the present time in Spain the struggle was concerned with an attempt to change the system of Government.  There was a struggle going on between Fascism and democracy. Fianna Fáil had no use for Fascism.&rdquo;  I give that to the President as a gloss on his &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, the struggle in Spain is a struggle between &ldquo;isms&rdquo;&mdash; between Fascism and democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And according to the statement of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite; I have dealt with that.  And Fianna Fáil has <Col N="613" /> no use for Fascism.  We have had many boasts in this House as to where the views of the majority of the people of this country were represented.  Am I to assume that the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;I gather that he spoke altogether in that capacity this evening&mdash;can believe for a moment that the sympathies of the majority of our people are on the side of what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, calls democracy in Spain?  Is that what the President meant to convey?  I have appealed to the President before in this matter, and so has my leader, Deputy Cosgrave.  Last November we introduced a resolution here.  Owing to the peculiar tactics, owing to that great respect which the President has for parliamentary institutions and the extraordinarily peculiar way he has of showing that respect, the Opposition was practically limited to those two speeches.  At least one thing characterised those two speeches. The President might agree with them or disagree with them, but I challenge any fair-minded man to examine those two speeches and say that they did not go as far as was possible to avoid raising anything in the nature of purely Irish party politics in reference to that matter.  We tried to keep that entirely out of the dispute, and the only answer we got from the President was a Party political speech of the characteristic type.  Knowing the seriousness of this particular case, knowing that the fate of Europe, and, therefore, the fate of this country was involved, we tried to lift that particular plea that we were making out of the ordinary realm of Party politics.  I do not think there was a word that could be taken as having reference to the politics of this country; yet the only answer we got was a Party political speech of the worst type, and there was no attempt to answer our questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons why we did that in November, and why we are doing it now, is this&mdash;just to do our best to contribute to the defeat of a certain type of propaganda that is going on all over Europe&mdash;in this country, in Great Britain, and in every country in Europe&mdash;a propaganda that tries to make the suggestion that the struggle <Col N="614" /> in Spain is a struggle between Fascism and democracy.  The very thing that the Parliamentary Secretary for Finance accepted is the thing we are anxious to combat; we are certainly anxious to deny that this struggle in Spain is merely a struggle between &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  It is nothing of the kind. But I will say this: I have always had an extraordinary admiration for the power and cleverness of the propaganda of the Communist International and of the Soviet Government.  I do not know if its success has ever been more clearly demonstrated than in the present case.  When this revolt broke out in Spain last July, I think the general opinion in Europe was against the Communists.  The Communists and Anarchists had put themselves out of court by their conduct.  But by subtle propaganda, by raising false issues, by suggesting that this was a struggle between Fascism and democracy, between Fascism and anti-Fascism, that this was a struggle on the part of the people against military dictatorship and Fascist dictatorship, they have been able to win over a large bulk of public opinion in Europe.  This has been done by raising false issues.  They have done it in an unmatched manner. They have changed the names of their journals in different countries, dropping Communist labels and substituting popular front labels.  They have changed the names of their organisations, dropping the Communist labels and substituting other labels&mdash;all for what purpose?  To get it across, as apparently they have got it across to the Fianna Fáil Party, that this is a struggle between Fascism and democracy. It is nothing of the kind.  Here was an opportunity, as we pointed out to the President before, to show that it is not.  We asked him to do it. There was no censure involved.  We asked him to do it&mdash;to show that there was a Government in Europe which nobody could accuse of not now being a Parliamentary Government, whatever its ultimate aims might be, a country with democratic parliamentary institutions, that was against the Communist Party in Spain.  The President had an opportunity of doing that.  He failed to avail himself of that opportunity <Col N="615" /> last November.  He has failed to do so now.</P>
    <P>Can anybody explain the obstinacy with which he goes against what I at all events hold is the sympathy of the great bulk of the Irish people?  I interpret it in a way different from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance; I have no doubts as to where the sympathy of the Irish people is.  I have no doubt as to the strength of that sympathy.  I believe that the great bulk of the Irish people know perfectly well what is at stake. Here we had an opportunity for at least doing our little bit.  The President may not think we are much; at least we had an opportunity of doing our little bit to counteract that propaganda&mdash;one of the most successful things that have been carried through by the Communist International.  The President brings in a Bill of this kind; it is unfortunate but at least he did not have to remedy that. But at the precise moment that he is bringing in this Bill his Minister accredited to the Caballero Government goes back to resume his functions, goes back to the place where most of the diplomats of Europe are. I think everybody will admit that the answers given by the President to-day in that respect are a revelation, and not the kind of revelation that the country will like.  He tried to convey as little information as possible, but there were certain things which slipped out and to which I should like to call his attention.  To the first question, as to terminating diplomatic relations and assuming relations with other people, I am not aware that there is any particular time at which States determine to recognise Governments. The President seems to think that a time suddenly comes when, almost of itself, recognition comes from all Governments.  That is not so.  The same Government has been recognised by different Powers at different times, and there is no hard and fast rule as that behind which the President tries to shelter himself.  He need not pretend that there is.  See the length of time it took the different Powers of Europe to recognise the <Col N="616" /> Government of Soviet Russia.  It is the same with other Powers.</P>
    <P>He speaks of established Governments. Is the Caballero Government the established <i>de facto</i> Government of Spain?  Over what portion of Spain does it rule <i>de facto or de jure</i> at the present moment?  Can he explain why he keeps his representative with that particular Government, ruling over a small portion of Spain, <i>de facto</i>, and refuses to send him to the Government ruling over the larger portion of Spain?  Or are his views represented in this particular Bill as to the people warring in Spain?  Section 3 sets out that the word &ldquo;belligerent&rdquo; means one of the Governments or organisations in the nature of Governments between whom war is being waged. Perhaps the President will explain what he means by that?  Are there Governments in Spain?  This Bill recognises that there are.  The President introduces a Bill here which recognises different Governments in Spain.  Otherwise there is no meaning in that particular drafting.  There are other juntas, too, apparently, namely, &ldquo;organisations in the nature of Governments,&rdquo; but there must be more than one Government in Spain, according to the President's own Bill. Why is it he recognises one and only one?</P>
    <P>How can the Irish people interpret his action?  I pay very little attention to the words &ldquo;There is no doubt as to where the sympathy of the majority of the Irish people lies.&rdquo;  The Irish people will judge by his action, and how can they interpret his action in any way except this, that he regards, and that this country is held to accept the view, that this is a struggle between Fascism and Democracy and that he has his representative with the democratic Government?  I fail to see how the Irish people can interpret the action and words of the President in any other manner but that.  Then, in so far as this country is known in Europe, and I will agree with the President that perhaps there is not much known about it in Europe, there are certain things known about it there. I think it is known in Europe that we <Col N="617" /> have certain ideals and beliefs in this country.  How can Europe, in so far as Europe is interested in us, any more than the Irish people, interpret this combined action of the Minister for External Affairs and of our Government in bringing this Bill in and in sending its diplomat back to the Caballero Government?  How can it interpret it otherwise than that this Government has made up its mind that this is a struggle in Spain between &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; between Fascism and Democracy, and has made up its mind that the anti-Franco cause is the cause of Democracy?</P>
    <P>I do not see how the President's action can be interpreted in any other way, and it was to prevent that, to prevent misinterpretation of that kind, that we moved our amendment.  We made it quite clear at the time.  We gave an opportunity in Questions to-day and we give an opportunity to the President now of at least getting rid of that misconception on the part of our people and any other people who are interested in our views.  Deputy Dillon to-day, in reply to the first answer, put a very pertinent supplementary question.  In that question he suggested the undesirability of this country holding itself out amongst the nations of the world as one which considers it desirable and expedient to maintain diplomatic relations with a Government which is notoriously Communist, and which is primarily concerned in Spain at present to drive religion out of that country, and to deny the very existence of God.  It was a very definite and clear question. What was the illuminating answer the President gave to the House and to the Irish people?  &ldquo;My answer explains the question.&rdquo;  That is a serious treatment of a serious question!&mdash;&ldquo;My answer explains the question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, possibly owing to the lack of subtlety that prevails on this side of the House, being unable to understand precisely what the President is talking about, asked: &ldquo;Does the Minister for External Affairs decline to answer that supplementary question?&rdquo; and we got the very enlightening words: &ldquo;I have nothing to add to my answers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quite admit that it is a matter <Col N="618" /> for laughter for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I quite admit that for the Party that thinks this is merely a struggle between Fascism and democracy, it has its humorous side; but we have maintained, and still maintain, in this House that a great deal more and much more vital issues are involved.  It is absurd to try to get away from that issue.  Then when he was asked in a second question about accrediting a Minister he then did what is, I am sorry to say, quite characteristic of the President, he tried in some extraordinary, back-stairs way to suggest that this man had been in touch with Franco.  Why did he not answer straight out that he was not accredited to Franco?  Why?  Because he was ashamed to say that straight out. Is there any other explanation why when the question was deliberately put&mdash;was our Minister who is at present in St. Jean de Luz accredited to Franco, he refused to answer? Why did he refuse to answer?  There is only one explanation.  He knew perfectly well to what side the sympathies of the Irish people strongly lean and he tried just to pull the wool over Irish eyes; there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Look at the seriousness with which he treated the question! He was asked a very serious question.  It is not the professor of mathematics who is giving us a lecture.  It is the Minister for External Affairs who, we are asked to believe, takes himself seriously, very seriously, indeed.  He is most anxious that a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; attitude should be adopted by the Government of this country.  He was asked what did he mean when he said that our representative was in St. Jean de Luz and that there he would have an opportunity of observing what occurred on both sides.  He was asked a straight question&mdash;did he mean to say that the Minister was accredited to both sides, and his reply was that if Deputy Dillon would look at the map he would see that St. Jean de Luz was nearer to Burgos than to Valencia.  Well, now, this is a very serious Minister for External Affairs! This illustrates <Col N="619" /> the serious mind we are asked to bring to bear upon this question&mdash; this is the President who is so overcome with the seriousness of the question that he wants to rush this Bill through.  That is the way he treats the House.  I will say this: the President is running true to form.</P>

      <P>I need not stress the vital character of this struggle.  I have done so already and I do not intend to repeat it.  This is a struggle in which the very defence of our European civilisation is involved, and the President need not shut his eyes to it.  Personally I do not think he minds what the result may be.  I have never found any indication that he does.  No doubt he will get up at the final speech on this Bill and say he does, but up to the present he has abstained from giving any definite opinion that he does mind how the struggle will end.  But let him not as President but as Minister for External Affairs in the few moments he devotes to that office ask himself this question: Suppose this struggle does end in one way, with the victory of the Communist Party in Spain, does he ever consider what that means for Europe&mdash;giving Communism a foothold in one of the oldest states in Western Europe&mdash;does he ever ask himself what will that mean for Western Europe?  If the struggle should end that way it will be far the biggest victory the Communist Party have gained since the winning over of Russia to Communism.  It will mean that Communism will have come to the very gates of Western Europe, and, threatened as Europe is at present, it will then be in the grip of Communism as in a pincers.  Still we are told that Communism is only a question of &ldquo;isms.&rdquo;  How can we have any confidence in a Government; how can we have any confidence in a Bill they introduce or in their proposals to the Dáil; how can we have any belief in a Government that treats an important question in the way that the President has always treated this question, as if the Reds were harmless <Col N="620" /> playboys who had to be treated kindly?  There ought to be some sense of responsibility in the Government.</P>
      <P>If the policy of non-intervention could have been carried through there is a great deal to be said for it.  I even doubted myself the prudence of a certain line of action.  I doubted it for this reason, and I want to make it quite clear:&mdash;First and foremost, because I thought that the policy of intervention would be used to a far greater extent&mdash;because one of the countries was in a position to so utilise it&mdash;on the side of the Communist Party in Spain than on the side of their opponents.  I wish to know from the President who asks the House to pass this Bill has he evidence that the frontiers of Spain will be rigidly guarded against the ingress of volunteers to Spain?  Is he convinced that the arrangements will be more satisfactory than the arrangements already entered into and that he himself has condemned as being faulty?  Certain frontiers can be guarded by fleets. Again I do not know how far they can get different nations such as Mexico who are not parties to this compact to observe this non-intervention.  How far can they go to keep the people coming through from Mexico to Spain? Is the President convinced that he or those in league with him in this matter can effectively guard the frontier between France and Spain?  Is he convinced that the machinery to be set up will be adequate for that purpose? Is he convinced on that matter?  If he is, he has not put a particle of evidence before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As usual, the President asks for a blank cheque.  Some time ago he asked for a blank cheque on his own behalf, now he asks it on behalf of the 26 other Powers that he himself has confessed had failed to carry out the agreement into which they had entered.  Surely the President knows the difficulty of carrying out such an agreement as this.  It may be that his information is confined to information from one side.  He may have heard information that thousands of Italians and thousands of Germans have landed in Spain and that war material has <Col N="621" /> been landed in Spain from Germany and Italy.  But anybody who listens to the wireless broadcasts of other countries, not merely reading the English newspapers, would be easily convinced that there is a strong opinion on the part of others of his colleagues that thousands of Russians and tens of thousands of Frenchmen are crossing the frontier into Spain to assist the Communist Government there, and that the very people who made most propaganda&mdash;and I again pay a tribute to their cleverness in this matter&mdash;are the very people who themselves violated most the principle of non-intervention. What guarantee has the President that the same thing is not going to happen in this matter?</P>
    <P>What steps did the President take before he committed himself to this agreement?  Did he examine it at all? I do not believe he did.  We are asked to give him a blank cheque following that already given by him to others who, as he himself confesses, have not up to the present honoured their agreements.  The President can enforce this Bill here.  Undoubtedly he can. Again I say that a great deal can be said for that policy of non-intervention in regard to Spain.  I was convinced in the long run that intervention would be stronger on the side of the Reds than on the side of their opponents. For this reason I thought a great deal could be said for non-intervention. The President put forward no reason for non-intervention except that the others had agreed.  Therefore, let us honour what the President has done without examination! That is the position of this country.  What we object to is this: There is a measure brought in here with no justification, without any proof of the effectiveness of the means proposed.  I see that his colleague&mdash;no, it is the Home Secretary&mdash;is going to prosecute all British citizens.  Is there identical legislation being introduced in all countries? Apparently not.  We are going one step better than the British.  We are going to prosecute people of all nationalities if they do certain things. The British, I gather, are going to prosecute &ldquo;British subjects,&rdquo; whatever they may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> I wonder has the President asked his colleague in one of the intervention Powers what exactly was meant by that phrase: &ldquo;British subjects passing through England.&rdquo;  That is one of the little questions that apparently he did not think worth bothering about.  I understand that he is getting back document No. 2.  Is he also getting back to the Cuban position?  It is not unlikely.  There is no information and no justification for this Bill.  You have, as I have already stated, the unfortunate coincidence&mdash;I will put it no stronger than that&mdash;of the return of our Minister.  He could not get a diplomatic illness.  No.  The return of our Minister coincides with the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Why this haste to accredit to the Caballero Government?  Is the position with regard to that other Government to which our Minister is not accredited, shall we say, that of an honourable spy?  Is that the position? I gather that is the actual position, so far as the President's statement to-day gave information to the people. The country cannot help being extremely uneasy and very perturbed at the whole attitude that the Government has adopted in this matter.  I have never seen them so contemptuous in a matter that is dear to the hearts of so many of our people as on this particular question.  There is no justification attempted and none offered on the various opportunities that the President and his Department had to put matters before the country.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the success of the campaign, and the President and his Party are contributing to it, for the view that this struggle in Spain is between Fascism and Democracy. Everyone knew at the start of the struggle that it was a contest between Communism and anti-Communism. Now what do you see practically in most of the papers printed in English both here and in Great Britain?  (As regards Ireland, I am speaking of the principal Dublin daily papers; the majority of them imply that this is a struggle between Fascism and Democracy.)  They have got the lie across.  Why should not they get it across when the President's <Col N="623" /> own Party and one of his colleagues, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, state that this is a struggle between Fascism and Democracy and that the Fianna Fáil Party have no use for Democracy.</P>

      <P>Occasionally, by mistake, even the truth can be told about the Fianna Fáil Party. Unfortunately I was giving my own views for the moment about the Fianna Fáil Party, and I forgot that I was quoting what Deputy Hugo Flinn had said.  One of the most heartening things in the whole of this is the conversion of the President to democratic principles.  It is almost as touching, as I have already said, as the conversion of the Soviet Union to the same democratic principles.  A couple of years ago we were told that the majority had no right to do wrong.  A couple of years ago the Soviet Union had nothing but contempt for democratic principles.  Now, it is the great upholder of democratic principles. Some of their colleagues in the Non-Intervention Committee are careful to speak of the union of democratic countries.  The President shows that he has overlooked these particular matters.  I regret that a Bill for which, in the abstract, a great deal could be said, should be brought forward in this atmosphere.  If this Bill had been introduced at the very start, a good deal could be said for it if the policy it embodies had been put into force from the very start.  Then, I think, it would have been beneficial to Spain and to Europe.  I can see quite well the dangers of a conflagration in Europe if intervention on a large scale is indulged in.  I am sorry that the President has not utilised his opportunities to make the attitude of this country, on the question of what is going on in Spain, perfectly clear. He could have done that without in the slightest way endangering this question of non-intervention.  If he had done that he would have the whole people behind him.  So far <Col N="624" /> as this country counts for anything, we could have been behind him.</P>
      <P>When refusing our motion last November, the President said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our line has been in accord with the general line taken by States in circumstances like these.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He knows well that there are two striking exceptions.  How does he get over these exceptions?  Germany and Italy have accorded recognition to Franco, according to the President, but they have accorded recognition from clear and immediate political motives.  As for the other nations of Europe, they are quite innocent, I suppose, of base political motives.  The only scoundrels in Europe that allow their high conduct to be interfered with by political motives are, unfortunately, the two Governments that have decided against Communism in Spain.  It is unfortunate, but that is the President's view.  Furthermore, I would like to suggest to the President that there are higher things than political motives; and even if the President is convinced that Russia and France and some other States are motived by nothing else except the highest possible motives of humanitarianism, that there is nothing political behind them, and that everything that the Soviet have said has nothing to do with the spread of their particular gospel, there are higher things to be considered. That he may have forgotten, but he could remember even if we were convinced that Germany and Italy were merely actuated by political motives, that this country might be actuated by something higher than political motives.  He refused to do that.  He refused to take the opportunity offered to him last November.  He refused to take the opportunity offered to him to-day. He prefers to stand in with Russia and France and their purely altruistic motives.</P>

There is only one way that can be understood in the country, and only one way in which it can be understood in any portion of Europe that is <Col N="626" /> interested in our views, and that is that the sympathies of the President are certainly not where the sympathies of the bulk of the Irish people are.</P>

      <P>Sir, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Bill, 1937, until the Government has formally recognised the Franco Government in Spain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I must certainly say that I was astonished at the opening statement of the President, and I am sure that the whole of the Free State, and not only the Free State or Ireland, but Irish men and women the world over, will be astonished at the statement made by the head of the Government of this country.  If I understood him aright, he said that this Bill was to give effect to an agreement entered into with the Non-Intervention Committee.  Yesterday we were informed that we, the people of the Free State, have full power over our own foreign policy.  Why has the Minister for External Affairs not exercised full power over our own foreign policy?  Why has he handed over the conduct of our foreign affairs to a Non-Intervention Committee, to a European Committee, on which he has no representative?</P>
      <P>When they crack the whip, evidently, he comes in here to this House and says, in effect, that a piece of legislation must be rushed through without the elected representatives of the Irish people getting a fair and full opportunity to consider that piece of legislation, or without giving the people of this country an opportunity to analyse that legislation, particularly in the light of the President's acting to-night as Minister for External Affairs.  It is beyond my ability, at least, to make two persons out of one as dexterously as Deputy O'Sullivan was able to do it when he was addressing the House.</P>

      <P>Even though the subject at my disposal may have two or many personalities&mdash;even though he has two offices&mdash;I cannot dissociate an important statement made in one capacity of that person from his acting in another capacity.  Although he is Minister for External Affairs here to-night, he is President of this Dáil, which means Dictator of this country in present circumstances, for there is not a Deputy behind him there who dares question any public or private utterance or any decision of the President. There is no Senate, there is no Governor-General, and so, what the President says is law in this country.  The President has said here to-night that now that he has got his orders from the Non-Intervention Committee&mdash;that he has got his orders from John Bull&mdash;he is here to-night to carry them out.  These are the plain, simple facts of the situation, and the sooner we get down to them the better.</P>
      <P>The President says that the Government agreed to the Non-Intervention Pact.  The Government has agreed to everything that has been introduced in this House here to-night, asking this House to consider what we are considering here to-night on the authority of the President, which has been agreed to already by the Government of this country.  If there is any doubt about that, and as this is a most important measure, and a most important decision will have to be taken to-night, to-morrow or Wednesday&mdash; some day very soon, at any rate, a very important decision will have to be taken on this matter&mdash;will the President call off the Whips and let the Deputies of this House vote according to their conscience on this? There are Deputies of his own Party, who, I know, are anxious&mdash;more anxious perhaps than any other Deputies in this House&mdash;for the recognition of General Franco's Government, but they will not be allowed to vote according to their conscience and they are not men enough to act up to the dictates of their conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> The President said: &ldquo;Well, we have decided, or a decision has been taken by the Non-Intervention Committee, that Spain should be left to fight out this civil war; that Spain should be left to decide its own destiny.  We want to fulfil our obligation to the Non-Intervention Committee.  The fight in Spain is merely a local fight, a fight between two &lsquo;isms,&rsquo; and we should have no concern in them.&rdquo; That was the statement of President de Valera in this House to-night. Now, apart from the humiliation of our Government, our representative of External Affairs, to my knowledge, not having uttered a word on this conflict in Spain since it started; having allowed, for some reason or another, our Consul or our Minister or representative in Spain&mdash;whatever the name of his office may be&mdash;to return home here and, trying to keep a leg on two horses, to keep him at home here so that he would not have to explain that we have no representative with the Caballero Government if we have no representative with the Franco Government, now, when he thought this job was near its consummation, this Minister gets orders to go out and reside in France, near to Burgos, but acting and accredited to the Caballero Government &mdash;accredited to the Prime Minister of the Government of anti-Christ. These are not my words.  They are the words of the Cardinal Primate of Spain, used in my presence in his little bed-sittingroom at the foot of the Pyrenees in Pamplona, on the 24th November last.  The room in which he was accommodated was a combined office, sittingroom and bedroom.</P>
    <P>President de Valera can get up in this House and say that the fight in Spain is a fight between two &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; but the Cardinal Primate of Spain, a second dignitary of the Catholic Church, the Church to which the President and I belong, and the Church, therefore, to which we should give respect and credence, does not say that it is a fight between two &ldquo;isms.&rdquo;  He says it is a fight between Christ and anti-Christ that was started and is being waged on Spanish soil.  Does the President deny it?  If he does, <Col N="629" /> here is the pastoral written by the Cardinal-Primate of Spain.  Here is the original in Spanish with an endorsement to myself signed by the Cardinal himself in Pamplona.  President de Valera, in substance and in fact, by his statement here to-night, has said in effect that the Cardinal Primate of Spain is a liar.</P>

      <P>Our friends on the opposite side will not stand up to it when it is put under their noses.  They will sneer, laugh, grin and make fun of this whole matter until they are brought up against it.  Is this war in Spain a war between two &ldquo;isms&rdquo;? Is it a war between Fascism and democracy, or is it a war between those who believe in God and those who do not?  The Government of this country has recognised since July last a Government that does not believe in God and which openly has declared this war on God and on religion.  The authority you have for that description is the authority of the Cardinal-Primate of Spain.  Do you deny his word?  Do you believe him?  You must either believe him or disbelieve him.  President de Valera apparently does not believe him.  He has looked into his own heart and he has seen the answer there, just as ten or fifteen years ago he said that he had looked into his own heart in regard to Ireland and had seen the answer there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here another endorsed document by the Cardinal-Primate of Spain, an open letter to Signor Aguirre, the leader of the Basque Nationalists.  I have here also an endorsed copy of his pastoral letter dated 12th February, from Pamplona. Here is documentary proof of the nature of the fight in Spain.  This country has now got to stand up to it in face of the evidence here produced. We have got to say whether we stand for Christ or anti-Christ.  That is the issue, nothing else.  I am not the author of this evidence.  The Cardinal, who is on the spot, is one of the authors of it.  He is Cardinal not only of Burgos, Salamanca, Malaga, Cadiz, <Col N="630" /> Alegciras and Pamplona, but he is Cardinal also of Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona.  His Private Secretary is Canon Despojol, who was a Canon in Barcelona when the trouble broke out. For two months he had to masquerade as a commercial traveller.  He showed me a photograph in which he was shown with a moustache and wearing an ordinary lounge suit.</P>
    <P>There was a long struggle&mdash;I remember it in my young days&mdash;for higher education for Catholics in this country. I was sorry to notice that a representative from the university smiled or grinned when I was making these remarks. Higher education and education generally is going to be put to the test now.  We have got to drive Communism out of this country, whether it be in the National University, Trinity College or in a &ldquo;snug.&rdquo;  Why was the Cardinal-Primate of Spain, if this was a fight between two &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; on that November night accommodated in a little room in a convent in Pamplona instead of living in his palace 400 miles away in Toledo?  I had been in Toledo a few days before that and his palace was shut up.  Why was not the Cardinal of Spain in his palace in Toledo, if it is a fight between two &ldquo;isms&rdquo; and not a fight involving religion?</P>
    <P>From whatever line of approach you come to examine and analyse the subject, there is not a shadow of excuse for the President coming to the decision to which he states he has come or a shadow of excuse for the statement he has made here to-night.  I am not surprised that he wanted to rush this Bill.  I am not surprised that he did not want to hear the literature, the exhaustive literature, exhaustive <i>ad nauseam</i>, to prove the real nature of the war in Spain.  I saw before I went to Spain, and so did my colleagues, that no matter what evidence we would get, it would be countered. We knew where that was coming from. Now we know why all the mud that was flung by a certain organ of the Press against a certain non-political movement in this country, alleging that it was political, was flung at it.  I had always a doubt that the Fianna Fáil Party was &ldquo;pink&rdquo; but, after the disclosures made here this evening <Col N="631" /> through its chief spokesman, I am now afraid it is &ldquo;red.&rdquo;  The President was anxious to get this Bill through quickly but, when he expressed himself as he did here to-night, he must go slowly.  If he has not studied the Spanish problem, or the problem of the Spanish war, we shall have to take him over some of the evidence, some of the incontrovertible proof that we have, as to the cause and the nature of the Spanish war.</P>
    <P>Let me quote from the pastoral letter of his Eminence the Archbishop of Toledo, dated 23rd November, in Pamplona.  On page 7 the Cardinal Primate of Spain says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The war which has been devastating a great part of Spain and destroying magnificent cities is not, in its popular and national aspect, a struggle of a strictly political nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies here, and I ask the people of this country, to say whether on this matter they are going to accept the statement of the Cardinal Primate of Spain or the dogmatism of President de Valera, given 1,500 miles away from the scene of this war.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a fight for or against a republic, as some partisans of the republic would pretend.  The dynastic question is not an issue, for the moment the form of government has been relegated to the background....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This sanguinary war is at bottom a clash of principles, of doctrines, of a concept of life and of one social order against another. In brief, it is an armed clash between two totally opposed civilisations. It is a war which the Christian soul of Spain has undertaken against that other soul or spirit&mdash;if such it can be called&mdash; which would wish to lay Marxist materialism as the foundation of all human activity, from the loftiest aspirations of the intellect to the trifling events of our every-day life. On one side are ranged men who, in varying degrees, represent, wholly <Col N="632" /> or in part, the old tradition and history of Spain; on the other side is an ill-assorted conglomeration of types whose object is, even more than the conquest of the enemy, the destruction of all the monuments of our old civilisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on he proceeds to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact was that religion and fatherland were in the gravest peril in a country dragged to the edge of the abyss by political action totally at variance with our national sentiment and history.  Hence it was that the reaction was more intense where the religious and patriotic spirit was best conserved. For the reasons stated this movement has assumed a religious character, which has manifested itself so clearly in the fields of battle where our soldiers fight wearing sacred emblems openly, and in the outburst of deep religious feeling among the non-combatants at home.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the religious aspect plays such a part in the actual war is amply proved by the fact that the present struggle, without the religious impetus, would be straightaway enervated.  Certain it is that the patriotic motive has also been a great stimulus in the ranks of the national army; but nobody acquainted with the facts is unaware that it was those regions precisely, where the Faith was most deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, that gave the largest number of volunteers in the beginning, and that it was the religious ideal which rendered these volunteers the bravest in the patriotic army.  We can go even further and say that the war would have been lost for the patriots were it not for the stimulus of religious fervour.  The Christian soul of both the soldiers on the battlefield and the non-combatants at home, who were supporting them with their encouragement and help, thrilled with fervour at the remembrance that the fight was one in defence of their Faith.  We omit the consideration of any other supernatural motive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not clear evidence that this is <Col N="633" /> a fight for Faith, for Christianity, in Spain?  Yet President de Valera tells this House and this country to-night that it is nothing of the kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for a moment?  I have got here the report of my speech, what I actually said.  What I said was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am anxious that we should play our part in trying to shorten this conflict in Spain by preventing the export of arms to the combatants and also by preventing recruitment for the various sides who are fighting out in Spain, a fight which, for most of them, at any rate, is not the sort of fight that we think it is, but is a fight for one &ldquo;ism&rdquo; against another.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the honesty of the people in this debate can be judged by their desire to misrepresent me.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to misrepresent the President at all, but the President occupies an important office in this country and in this grave moment he speaks for all Irishmen and women the world over and he should speak; he should not half speak.  Do not tell us what some people believe the Spaniards think is an issue in this fight.  What do you think is the issue in this fight?  That is what we want to know.  Do not half speak.  Speak as the representative of the Irish people and do not be ashamed or afraid of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the President. We have to shoulder responsibility for this and the President in his high office should shoulder his.  Do not tell us what the Spaniards think this is a fight over; do not tell us what people in this country think it is a fight over; tell us what <Col N="634" /> you, as representing the Irish people, as representing the Government of the Irish people, think this is a fight about.  And we should know it.  The President has not yet made up his mind as to what he will say on this matter.  He wants to have innumerable lines of approach and retreat so that, if he is attacked on any front, he can escape in another direction. Now, we are going to make a decision from which there cannot be escape and the decision is whether we in this country are going to stand by the Government of Christianity or the Government of anti-Christ in Spain. Let me quote further:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And let it be here laid down as a certain fact that, even though the actual strife appears to be of a purely civil nature, fought out on Spanish soil and by Spaniards, in its essence it should be recognised as a real crusade for the Christian faith, which has vivified with its spirit the history of Spain for centuries and has constituted, as it were, the core of its organisation and life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here the Cardinal again affirms that this is a fight for the Faith.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let us here dispel a prejudice which might have most dire consequences in time to come.  A war against Marxist Communism, as is ours, is not against the proletariat, corrupted as it is in great part by the Marxist agitators.  In the defence of religion we have taken up the sword.  We fight not for the humiliation of the working classes or to perpetuate old abuses which should not have lasted to our day. To say that we do so is a calumny and a crime, which has in it the seed of future class war and of religious disturbance.&rdquo;</P>

The translation of this is vouched for by Canon McMahon, Theological Censor, and has the Imprimatur of his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and I do not think it will be questioned.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody in Spain to-day is unaware that Communism had prepared a <i>coup d'état</i> after the best Muscovite model, to be staged during <Col N="636" /> the very days in which the national movement began.  It was to be one bold stroke by which would be overthrown everything that could serve as a bulwark or support or social bond of our old civilisation.  The religion, the family, property, authority, the fundamental institutions of the old order of things were to suffer the terrific smashing blows of the revolution, which had been organised to destroy them all and to raise on their ruins the Soviet régime.  Five years of propaganda, of inconceivable toleration by the Government, of organisation and acquisition of war material made it possible to foretell the outbreak almost to the day... The first onslaught of the revolution was against the great fact of religion itself, which constitutes a basic element in every civilisation and in every nation, and which, moreover, in Spain presented a social programme surpassed by none.  Religion is the support of all civilisation, giving to it its force and peculiar character.  Everyone who remained staunch to his Faith and dared to show it suffered accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the &ldquo;ism&rdquo; recognised by our Government then and since, with which a special trade agreement was made and has been since preserved, and the monopoly of that trade handed over to a group who are in the main publicly acknowledged and avowed Communists.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Never has the history of any people afforded such an accumulation of horrors as Spain has witnessed during the last few months. Thousands of priests and religious have been massacred...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are not my words.  I could have collected the information and brought it home and published it here, and perhaps be paid for its publication. But if I quoted it in this House to-night, certain Deputies, seeing how they are conducting themselves, would only laugh and say: &ldquo;These are wild stories; what do you know about Spain?  You were only there a few days.&rdquo;  I am too long on the road not to know what I would be up against, so instead of collecting the information I got it collected from authoritative <Col N="637" /> sources.  Not only is it published over their names, but they have actually autographed copies of the pamphlets which they sent here.  I have these autographed copies here and will show them to any Deputy who doubts it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thousands of priests and religious have been massacred, among them ten bishops....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What sort of &ldquo;ism&rdquo; was it that slaughtered ten bishops?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....many of whom perished midst scenes of obscenity and with unheard of torments.  The priest is &lsquo;the man of God&rsquo;; to destroy God, those men who call themselves the &lsquo;Godless&rsquo; and the &lsquo;anti-God&rsquo; must naturally eliminate from society His representatives.  When the world learns the facts&mdash;for to-day they lie hidden in the regions not yet reconquered&mdash;this hecatomb of God's anointed will cause horror and confusion. As well as &lsquo;God's ministers,&rsquo;&lsquo;the Houses of God&rsquo; have also suffered.  Innumerable churches&mdash; many of them works of art in themselves, historical monuments containing many priceless gems accumulated by the faithful throughout the centuries, and living centres of the traditional faith of our people&mdash;have been razed to the ground.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For what purpose?  Is it for the defence of democracy, as we understand it?  Is it for such people as we are who, before we start our business here at 3 o'clock, get up and say a prayer, while our representative is accredited to a Government of that kind?  On the Adjournment Debate in August last, I drew attention to the fact that the House was adjourning for a few months, leaving the trade routes open to the Reds in Spain.  I asked if we were not going to discontinue our trade agreement with that country.  I was laughed at then.  I warned the President that perhaps before the House reassembled the people of this country would have spoken on the question.  They have spoken on it, as over 100,000 citizens gathered in College Green to cheer for the success of the arms of General Franco.  Has the President not heard of that?  That was more than all the machined organisation could get <Col N="638" /> together, even before to-night.  After this the numbers who will do that will be five times as many as he will ever see together again at his call.  Those of us who have families and responsibilities want to leave this country as good as we got it, for our children to bring up their families.  I am not preaching religion here.</P>

      <P>There is as good a field for missionaries in the Dáil as there is in China, and some of them would be harder to convert than the Chinese.  The Cardinal Primate goes on to say: &ldquo;We cannot but blame the treachery of the authorities.&rdquo;  Is there not a terrible similarity?  I saw loud speakers cut down and the air thick with bricks while hundreds of Civil Guards stood around not daring to interfere.  We see the mentality revealed here to-night.  The sooner that mentality is revealed all over the country the better it will be for the country, though it will be a rude awakening for the people.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We cannot but blame the treachery of the authorities, the ignorance of the masses, the passions inflamed by war, and the spirit of vengeance and rapine, for the part they played in causing this terrible disaster...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am only reading passages from this document.  I did not <Col N="639" /> intend to read it until I heard the President's statement.  It was news to me to hear the quotation given by Deputy O'Sullivan from a speech made in Galway last August by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Flinn, in which he stated that the fight in Spain was a fight between Fascism and democracy.  That is what the Communists all over Europe are saying. Honestly, I did not believe that any Deputy would stand up anywhere and make such a statement.  I felt that before I could make a case for my amendment I had to prove beyond yea or nay that the fight in Spain was not a fight between Fascism and democracy; that in reality it was a fight between democracy and Communism; a fight for freedom against the tyranny of Communism.  Fortunately I have at my command what is perhaps the most authentic document available on the question.  I have a document that I saw signed by his Eminence Cardinal Gomá Tomás.  I can identify his signature on the documents he sent me for publication in connection with the civil war.  I think it is absolutely necessary, with your permission, Sir, that there should be no shadow about the real issues of the war in Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What has caused the corruption of the Christian spirit of our country, and made possible that catastrophe already referred to, was the unremitting work of infiltration for years of doctrines abroad, impious legislation passed at the behest of international secret <Col N="640" /> societies, Soviet propaganda assisted by the gold that has been pouring into Spain unceasingly, which has made possible the bribery of those in power, and the perversion of the masses by the false allurement of the Communistic doctrines</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The spirit of Russia, the genius behind international Communism, is that which has supplanted the Christian spirit in a large portion of our people.  It has caused them to turn wildly against that Spain which, formed at the &lsquo;Counsels of Toledo&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Cardinal has been good enough to think of other nations, and has sounded a warning note &ldquo;to nations which sympathise with us in our misfortunes and to those which are faced with similar dangers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let Spain prove both a warning and a lesson.  Do not consider yourselves immune from the evil that has anguished the soul of our nation, and has led it to the brink of ruin. There is no body politic that does not present a favourable field for the growth of Communism if it is unfaithful to God, Who gives life and union to souls, and to His law which is the only guarantee of justice and of the social order.  And it is God and His law that are being cast aside in nearly every country of the world to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 19th February.</P>
