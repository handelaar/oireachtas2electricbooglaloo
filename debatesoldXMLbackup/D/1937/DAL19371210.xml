      <NameTxt>The Vice-President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take the business as on the Order Paper to No. 4, inclusive, omitting No. 2.  When public business is finished, Private Deputies' business will be taken and the Dáil will adjourn till Tuesday, 14th December.  It is proposed, if the public business on the Order Paper be not concluded by 12 o'clock noon, to continue public business; not to give Private Deputies' time, and to continue public business until concluded.  Probably it will be necessary to move to sit late to-night. I do not know if it is possible that public business will be concluded by the usual hour to-night, if we sit late; but if not, I would like to give notice that we may have to sit to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If my recollection is right, no such proposal has been <Col N="2134" /> moved.  We have got a contingent suggestion from the Minister that public business be disposed of by that time.  We have now reached 10.45 a.m. and we have had no business considered yet.  I should like to know exactly where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Vice-President The Vice-President">
      <NameTxt>The Vice-President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that public business be continued, if not concluded by 12 o'clock noon, and that there be no Private Deputies' business taken to-day, unless public business is concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is that Private Members' business be not taken.  I object to that.  I presume that the reason why that motion is moved is because of the congestion of business on the Order Paper.  Now, so far as the House is concerned, it has been perfectly willing, since it commenced to sit in October, to meet the Government with regard to sittings.  No objection has been made about meeting here at any time that it was thought necessary to assemble the House.  But we have now reached a point, by reason of Government incompetence and the fact that the business was not ready, when there is congestion, just coming towards Christmas.  It is not the fault of the House that that situation has arisen. It is entirely due to the Front Bench or possibly, if one could speak in that negative manner, to one absent member on the Front Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill was brought before us in the name of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I do not believe the Minister ever read it.  It is introduced by another Minister.  Last night, in his absence, a different Minister altogether was unable to tell the House the subject-matter or substance of a particular amendment before the House.  In these circumstances, we are told that we cannot have Private Members' time.  We did not get Private Members' time this week, and it is possible the Dáil may have to sit until midnight to-night and to-morrow as well.  Some Deputies had to travel long distances from the country and no Deputy had any information before his pilgrimage up here this week of these arrangements.  We <Col N="2135" /> had the usual humbug of Minister pretending to the public that this State was respecting a Catholic holyday, while every civil servant had to come in to his business and was not even allowed time to attend Mass.  I object to this proposal and I am going to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A complaint has already been made about the manner in which the business of the House has been organised, or rather disorganised, during the past four months.  During that period, the Dáil did not sit at all on some weeks.  On other weeks, it sat on only one day.  When business has got into a congested condition, due to the manner in which the sittings of the House have been arranged by the Government, the Dáil is asked to sit for four days and threatened with the possibility of a five-day sitting.  That condition of affairs reflects no credit on the Government and does not manifest any great competence for regulating the business of the House in such a manner as to permit of the business being dealt with with reasonable convenience to Deputies.  Ministers say it is necessary to dispose of Government business before we can get Private Members' time but, last night, we had an exhibition which was in no way edifying to the House or creditable to the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture was left in charge of the Seanad Bill about 9.20. His business was to move amendment No. 91.  The Minister was induced to move the amendment only after considerable encouragement by Deputies other than Government Deputies.  When he did move the amendment, he contented himself with moving it formally. When asked for some explanation of the amendment, it was clear that the Minister knew absolutely nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he was pressed to explain the provisions of certain portions of the amendment, the Minister displayed a lamentable incompetence, with the result that a whole hour&mdash;from 9.30 to 10.30&mdash;was wasted here last night. Then, when the House adjourned at 10.30, I do not think any Deputy had <Col N="2136" /> got an answer&mdash;certainly not a very intelligent answer&mdash;to the questions put as to the real meaning of amendment No. 91.  How can business be dealt with effectively and expeditiously when a Minister is left in charge of a Bill of which he knows nothing and left to move an amendment of which he does not know the ramifications and which he will not explain.  Is it any wonder that the House should have to spend a considerable time discussing a Bill when a Minister who knows nothing about it is left in charge?  The Vice-President tells us that, unless we finish Government business to-day, we shall not get Private Members' time. That is the effect of the present motion. Unless the Government get the Seanad Bill passed&mdash;unless Deputies are prepared to pass it in a cursory and perfunctory manner&mdash;we are not to get Private Members' time.  That is the threat made by the Vice-President. The Dáil sat on Tuesday and Deputies were required to remain in town on Wednesday.  The House sat again on Thursday and is sitting to-day.  With three complete days of Dáil session this week, not a single minute has been given for Private Members' time.  We are threatened that if we do not pass the remainder of the amendments dealing with the Seanad Bill, there will be no Private Members' time this week.  I think that is treating the Dáil in a scandalous manner, and it displays a wanton disregard for the rights of private members.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year it has always been customary to allow Private Members' time, and always been customary to permit Private Deputies to discuss matters in which they are interested, but we have seen during the past few months a definite conspiracy to prevent Private Deputies availing of the time normally set aside for them.  That mentality has now taken on a new orientation, and we are told that we cannot get time for Private Deputies' business unless we are prepared to pass the Government amendments to the Seanad Bill.  I think that attitude reflects a very bad mentality from the Government standpoint. I think it is gross discourtesy to the Private Deputies who want to <Col N="2137" /> discuss Private Deputies' business, which is a million times more important, in my opinion, than the passing of a Bill which interests nobody except the people who hope to get jobs in the new Seanad.  The House would be much better occupied in dealing with Private Deputies' business, which at least relates to the hard economic realities of life in this country. Instead, we are now asked to sit here until twelve o'clock, simply because the President, having abolished the Seanad, now wants to create another Seanad. I know of nobody in the country, except the potential Senators, interested in this Bill.  Certainly the ordinary man in the country, the unemployed man, the man working three or four days a week on a rotational scheme or trying to exist on 24/- a week as an agricultural labourer, is not concerned with the provisions of this Bill, and does not care whether it is passed to-night or this night 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity some Minister could not have been induced to talk last night and to explain the provisions of amendment No. 91.  Although the Minister for Industry and Commerce entered the House while it was being discussed last night, he did not show any special brilliance in explaining it.  It is a pity he could not have talked last night, even with the same kind of accuracy with which he talks elsewhere.  I am protesting against this motion.  I think it is another effort to muzzle Deputies and to prevent them from discussing matters in which the country is interested, and another effort to get the country talking about the Seanad, when the real problem before the plain people of the country is that while the Government is asking the Dáil to pass the Seanad Bill, the people of the country are finding it harder than ever to make ends meet in the existing situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has <Col N="2138" /> protested against the time taken up by the Seanad Bill.  Why has so much time been taken?  Because there has been obstruction on it.  The Deputy has talked about the unedifying spectacle that took place here last night. What was it?  It was the continuous reiteration of the same question by Deputy Norton and the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to matters dealing with economic questions about which Deputy Norton pretends to be concerned, and if we are not getting on with them, it is because Deputy Norton and the Fine Gael Party are holding up the Dáil by unnecessary discussion of the various amendments to this Bill.  The Deputy spoke about the delay in getting the business of this session properly under way. Everybody knows why that delay occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this Bill, after passing its Second Reading, instead of coming before the Dáil in Committee, was referred to a Special Committee, and that was done with the consent of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the Opposition members of the Dáil. <Col N="2139" /> Instead, therefore, of the business coming before the House, it came before a committee of the House, and that reduced the volume of business for the Dáil.  The work on the Committee Stage of the Bill, however, was proceeding, or, at any rate, it was intended that it should, but the Special Committee proved a fiasco because the Opposition Deputies decided to play Party tactics instead of trying to deal with the particular problem in respect of which that committee was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And because you lost your temper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has got to get through.  There is a number of other urgent measures which the Government is anxious to have enacted as quickly as possible, but which apparently cannot be enacted before Christmas and which may necessitate an early reassembly of the House after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that what we are getting our allowances for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We ask co-operation of the Opposition Parties in getting this business disposed of so that we can get down to these other matters, but it is perfectly ridiculous for them to protest against a delay which they are causing.  Deputy Cosgrave made what was in my opinion, a most unjustifiable reference to the fact that the Dáil did not meet on Wednesday last, a Catholic holiday.  He knows quite well, as other Deputies know, that the decision that meetings of the Dáil should not be held on Catholic holidays was made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It was not a decision of the Government, and on that Committee on Procedure and Privileges Deputy Cosgrave's Party was represented and they assented to that arrangement.  This discussion is itself wasting time.  It is necessary that the Seanad Bill should be disposed of in this session, and if Deputies are willing to co-operate with us in that, we can get on to Private Deputies' business, even though the motion to be discussed <Col N="2140" /> under that heading is sheer nonsense and the discussion on it serving no purpose whatever.  On the general question of the restriction of the rights of Private Deputies, I ask Deputy Norton to look back over the records of this session.  He will find that in respect of days on which the Dáil has sat, Private Deputies have got more time than the Standing Orders entitle them to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, having had his own say on this matter, dropped a hint to the Vice-President that he might now move the closure.  Towards the end of his own speech, he said that we were only wasting time on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to sit here until 12 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about wasting time on the motion being discussed as Private Deputies' business, but he succeeded himself in wasting two hours on it, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance another two hours.  I stated here on the first day on which the Government moved in this session to take Private Deputies' time, that the object of the Government was to keep away from the motions on the Order Paper.  That is now quite clear, and what this motion to-day means is that Private Deputies are going to be deprived of their rights, not only to-day but until the Dáil comes back after Christmas.  It is quite clear that we will have the same excuse for taking Private Members' time advanced next week.  The Seanad Bill must be got through before the Dáil adjourns for Christmas and, therefore, there will be no time available. There will be no opportunity to bring before the House any of the matters mentioned on the Order Paper, such as the cost of living, wages, and unemployment. In the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce these matters are of no importance. What is of importance is the Seanad.</P>

No one knows better than the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the position was indefensible last night.  We are told that there has been obstruction, but the Government are so incompetent that they were only able to have meetings of the Dáil on seven days in 17 weeks.  The Vice-President stated last week that the trouble was that the Dáil was facilitating the Government too quickly&mdash;that it was getting through the Government business so quickly, and that co-operation was so good, it was not necessary to sit more than one day every week. The Minister for Industry and Commerce appreciates that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's plea, the delay is owing to incompetence on the part of the Government, and nothing else.  It is quite obvious from the Minister's tone that he is following the President's example, namely, that he does not want discussion on anything except on little fishes and on scrap iron.  These are the only things we are to discuss, according to the Minister.  We had to waste one and a half hours last night, and then Deputy Norton proposed that the House should adjourn.  Why?  Because <Col N="2144" /> we could not get any answer from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You got too many answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister remembers why such a motion was made.  Because he sat there dumb. A Deputy described the situation as one in which the Minister was not there at all.  For all practical purposes the Government Benches were empty. When questions were put to the Minister he refused to answer.  He did not understand the questions.  He could not grasp them.  After one hour we got some kind of an answer from the Minister, but it was quite obvious that he was completely unfamiliar with the Bill.  We are asked to discuss the general principle and the details of these Bills by the President.  When we asked a Minister the meaning of a particular section he was unable to tell us. Gradually it drawned upon him what was meant.  Then we got some extraordinary submissions with which we could not deal.  It is quite obvious that the Minister is deliberately preventing the motions on the Order Paper being discussed.  There was ample opportunity to do so.  Meetings of the Dáil were called week after week for a couple of hours' Government business and disposed of.  On more than one occasion they were asked to give Thursday for the discussion of these motions.  They refused.  The cause of the delay is entirely the fault of the Government. We have another Bill now that we are expected to take to-day.  Why is it before the House now for the first time?  It is a lengthy Bill, a Constitution (Amendment) Bill.  We are told it is urgent now.  Why was it not urgent two months ago?  Why was it not introduced and passed before this? Because the Government has no track or control of the business.  We had a lamentable exhibition of that last night from the Minister.  He knew nothing about the Bill and refused to answer questions.  He treated the House the way that other Ministers treat it, with extreme insolence.  The Government that is responsible for wasting time has now the insolence to suggest that there has been obstruction.  The obstruction <Col N="2145" /> last night came from Ministers.  There might, at least, have been some co-operation from Ministers in charge of Bills when they are put before the House.  The Minister refused to answer questions.  When driven to try to answer, it was quite obvious that he did not understand the points that were made.  We got all sorts of answers. I think that procedure illustrates the Government's general conduct towards Parliament and its institutions, and that is why I oppose this motion.  The Government have no respect for the House.  Their members do not come into the House to listen to what is happening, or to take part in debates, except to obstruct motions dealing with Private Members' business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of his remarks, intimated that the Opposition, and particularly the Labour Party, were responsible for a great deal of the obstruction.  He intimated that they were obstructing the putting through in this House of a measure that is very dear to them, the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill.  I would remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce that that Bill was introduced before the present Dáil sat, and, as Deputy Norton reminded him, for the purpose of securing votes at the last general election.  Since the House sat, other Bills have been introduced and disposed of.  Some of these were Bills of a very trivial character, and although introduced subsequent to the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill they are now law.  One of them was a Bill for the protection of immature fish.  I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that if he brings in any more measures of that sort he should introduce one to exterminate a fish commonly known as &ldquo;cod&rdquo;, and perhaps if he does he may get more business done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the <Col N="2146" /> answer given a few days ago to a question asked by a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Donegal, is it not painfully evident that there is another reason behind the Government's objection to let Private Deputies have time for the consideration of motions on the Order Paper in their names?  We all know that the next business to be taken in Private Members' time is the Second Reading of the Labourers Bill, introduced by the Labour Party, the object of which is to give relief to the tenants in the occupation of labourers' cottages.  It must be evident to every member of the House that the Government fear a discussion on that measure. That is clear from an answer to a question given in the House recently, that they themselves propose introducing legislation akin to, if not on parallel lines with, the Labourers Bill introduced by the Labour Party.  Last week, when I referred to the fact that the Opposition desired to be constructive, we got a rather expressive &ldquo;What&rdquo; from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I suggest that one of the principal reasons why the Government are taking Private Members' time is that, amongst other things, they are afraid of a discussion on the Labourers Bill introduced by the Labour Party, because they know that the discussion would show them up in a rather peculiar light in the country.  At all events, I think we can congratulate ourselves on this fact, that the Government Party are now emulating the example of the Labour Party by introducing a Labourers Bill on practically parallel lines.</P>

      <P>Presented with a choice of discussing a matter and forming a brick in the wall of silence here, I prefer to discharge the function of a legislator and discuss a matter which is brought before the House.  The Vice-President now tells us in that kind of simple heroics for which he is distinguished that he is going to stick out his chest and stick out his chin and sit late, until 12 o'clock to-night. That is simply because the Government cannot display any competence whatever in organising the business of the House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is very much concerned at the waste of time.  Well, I never saw time wasted more scandalously and more wantonly than the way it was wasted between 9.30 and 10.30 last night.  We had the Minister for Agriculture speaking last night, and he displayed to the House that he knows even less about the Seanad than about agriculture.  He was asked last night to move amendment No. 91.  It was obvious that he was in a state of mental panic when he was asked to explain its provisions, because he knew nothing about it, and when he was asked to explain sub-section (3) he excited the sympathy of all parts of the House last night.  Question after question was addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, and he sat there on the Front Bench last night and there was <Col N="2151" /> as much noise coming from him as from the effigy of Victoria in front of the House.</P>

      <P>Because Ministers are put in charge of Bills and amendments about which they know nothing, time inevitably is wasted here.  Consequently, not only must the Dáil sit late, until 12 o'clock to-night, but, in fact, Private Members will get no time unless they are prepared to respond to the intimidatory attitude of the Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that he was bursting to introduce certain other types of legislation of a very important nature.  What is the type of legislation he wants to introduce?  In June last we had a motion put on the Order Paper for a First Reading of the Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill.  The Minister, remembering that the election would be held at the end of June, that shop assistants had votes, and that the putting of this Bill on the Order Paper might probably have the effect of deluding some of them into voting for the Minister, the Bill got a First Reading in June last.  But the Second Reading of the Bill was not taken when the House resumed in July, or in August, or in September, or in October. It was only in November that the Second Reading was taken, although the Bill got a First Reading in June.  In the meantime we had Bills on such world-shaking subjects as little fish, the Presidential seal, tidal waters and scrap-iron&mdash;Bills which not only got a First Reading, but a Second Reading, and passed their Third and Fourth Stages all in the space of a couple of weeks; while the Shop Assistants Bill, which got a First Reading in June, had not the Second Reading taken  November.  Is it not <Col N="2152" /> patent to anybody except perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the purpose of putting down the First Reading in June last was to try to get votes?  Of course that trick did not work.</P>

      <P>They were few enough. The Minister comes along and puts a Bill on the Order Paper for the purpose of trying to get votes, and does not take up the consideration of the Second Stage for four months after the First Reading.  Now he comes along and says: &ldquo;Please pass this Seanad Bill in order that I can get on with the Bill about which I have been delayed for four months.&rdquo;  It is perfectly obvious that that kind of argument by the Minister is only just an attempt to excuse his failure to proceed with the Second Stage of the Shop Assistants Bill.  I suppose the Minister will now tell us that the Shop Assistants Bill could not be dealt with earlier because it was not ready.  We all know that it was not ready, that it was not ready when the First Reading was taken, and that the purpose of the First Reading was to try to get votes at the election.  Now we are asked to sit until 12 o'clock to-night so that the House can continue to waste time discussing this Seanad Bill in which, as I said, nobody is interested. The ordinary people of the country do not care whether the Bill is passed or not.  They do not care whether it is ever passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are motions dealing with the standard of living, with labourers' cottages, with the low wages paid to agricultural workers, with the low price paid for certain types of agricultural produce, with the exactions of ground landlords, with the low rates of unemployment assistance benefits which are being paid, with the notorious rotational schemes, with teachers' salaries, with the defective National Health Insurance Acts, and a number of other matters.  We are now to be prevented, unless we are prepared to pay the price of passing this Seanad Bill, discussing matters of that type which are of much more importance than the Seanad Bill.  I do not wonder that the Government wanted to get the Seanad Bill through.  After what transpired when, discussing amendment No. 91 last night, the quicker the Government can pass this Bill probably the better for themselves; because, when the public realise what is being done in amendment No. 91, they will have more contempt for the Seanad than they ever had before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to compel the House to sit until midnight in order to discuss a Bill in which nobody is interested, which will just leave the poor people as poor as they are when it is passed, which makes no contribution whatever to the relief of the sufferings of the tens of thousands of people in this country, which will not put another halfpenny in the pocket of the agricultural workers, which will not give another farthing to the recipients of unemployment assistance, which will not stop any person from going to <Col N="2154" /> Great Britain to look for work who cannot get it here.  Yet, we are asked to discuss a Bill of that kind until midnight when the country is confronted with social and economic problems of a magnitude which it has not known for many years.  That is what the House is being asked to sit for until 12 o'clock.  I think it is an outrageous motion.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the motion is to stifle discussion on any subject which is in any way related to the realities of life in the country.  The manner in which Private Members' time is being filched from them clearly indicates that the Government do not want the House to discuss in Private Members' time any of the important matters on the Order Paper.  All the Government want to do is to keep the people talking about Seanads and Presidents in the hope that their excitement over these things will keep them from feeling the economic pain inflicted upon them in other directions.  I think I said a very true thing, that in ancient Rome the people cried for bread and were given a circus.  Here, when they cry for bread and protest, against the rotational schemes and the high cost of living they get a, Seanad Bill to discuss and pass which is in charge of a Minister who knows nothing about it.</P>

The next time the President leaves the Minister in charge of the Bill, he should prescribe that only that matter should be discussed while the Minister is in charge.  What the people will be much more interested in is the kind of people who are going to be let in while the Minister is busily engaged in keeping the Labour representatives out.

I am glad that the Government are, apparently, going to give the Minister an opportunity of saving his face this morning, having properly instructed him as to the line he is to take on amendment No. 91. The Vice-President, in moving this motion, did not give any reasons for <Col N="2156" /> doing so.  I would advise Deputy Brady, and if I might say so, Deputy Tom Kelly, if they would like to know what a motion like this means, to go down to the Library and read some of the reports of the proceedings here in 1927, 1928 and 1929.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not want the House to have an opportunity of considering the motions on the Order Paper.  The Minister told us a short time ago, somewhere down the city, that we were going to have a general election early in the new year, and the Minister does not want his colleagues put into the position of having to go into the Lobby and vote against the motions on the Order Paper on the eve of a general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very confident of winning in Galway also, but the Minister is beginning to find out some things, and the sooner this general election, about which he has talked, is held, the sooner he will learn a little more.  I grant you that the Government have succeeded in deluding the people much longer than most people thought they could, but the Minister has heard of the old saying that you cannot fool all the people all the time.  If he does not know it, he will very soon know it.  I thought that in accordance with his usual form he would say, as he said in respect to another incident on that occasion, that it was untrue that he threatened a general election.  I want to say that the Government are trying to stifle discussion in this House on matters that concern the people.  I believe that there are Deputies on that side of the House who do not want to be forced to go into the Lobby to support a wage of 24/- a week for agricultural, labourers, who do not want to go into the Lobby and vote against the derating of agricultural land or who do not want to go into the Lobby and say, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to some little time ago, that there has been no increase in the cost of living in this country. That is the reason why we did not get any speech made when the motion was moved.  There was no attempt made to justify the motion.  There is going to be no attempt made to justify other matters on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2158" /> The motion is to sit until 12 o'clock to-night if necessary.  It is quite easy for Ministers who have their homes in the city to sit until 12 o'clock to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not compelling you to sit until 12 o'clock to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You are compelling us, because this motion is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;Either you give us the Seanad legislation without any discussion or you shall sit here until 12 o'clock to-night.&rdquo;  That is the threat we get from the Government.  The Government does not want the Seanad Bill discussed.  They want it passed without discussion.  What we really have in this motion is the threat: &ldquo;You must give us this Bill without further discussion or you will sit until 12 o'clock.&rdquo;  That makes very little difference to Ministers who are fortunate enough to be living in the City of Dublin, but it makes considerable difference to Deputies who live 100, 150 or 180 miles from here.  Deputies are threatened and accused of obstruction if they do their ordinary normal duty here by trying to extract the information that they sought last night and by trying to point out to the Minister and the Government certain defects which we conceived were in the new section.  Is it not better to do that now than to have the Government, as happened on a number of other occasions, passing the Bill hurriedly now and being forced to bring in another Bill to amend it next week or the week after?  That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is well to be clear on certain points. This is the stage we had reached last night.  The Minister was quite satisfied that legally a council which was elected in 1928, dissolved say in 1930, and not re-elected in 1934, is still a council for the purposes of this Act. He is so convinced of that that he does not intend to have further inquiries made into the matter.  The next thing that he is quite clear on is that the Corrupt Practices Act does not apply to those electors for the Seanad.  He further stated&mdash;this is on his own authority and I have grave doubts about it myself&mdash;that the Corrupt, <Col N="2161" /> Practices Act does not affect members of the Dáil who are members of that electorate, but the House will remember that he is quite definite that so far as this other electorate is concerned the Corrupt Practices Act does not apply, and the Government has no intention of making the Corrupt Practices Act apply to the members of that electorate.  That is the position as defined after a lot of trouble; that is the statement of the position we were able to get from the Minister last evening.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, he was also quite clear on this point, namely, that any member of a dissolved county council, who had been a member at the dissolution of that body, but had subsequently been found guilty of offences that might have involved penal servitude, and who might still be in jail, is entitled to vote in this particular election, and on that also the Government intends to do nothing.  There was no reason given why the Government should not make the Corrupt Practices Act apply to the members of the electoral body. That a member of the Dáil can receive bribes for what he does, it is new to me that that is not a corrupt practice. What is clear is, according to the Minister, that at least the 210, or whatever the number is, of these members cannot merely accept bribes, but can advertise in the paper that they will accept bribes.  That is the position taken up by the Minister and he says he does not intend to remedy that position and the Government have no intention of doing it.  The position then is that people who may be in jail owing to offences committed after the dissolution of the council, are to be entitled to vote.  That was the position we got from the Minister after a great deal of trouble yesterday.  Indeed, it was exceedingly difficult to get any answer from him, but at last he was induced to return categorical answers and they were of the kind I have indicated.  That is undoubtedly a very pretty situation that he is asking the House to accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to this whole scheme, I think any member of a county council can be elected as an <Col N="2162" /> elector and that person who is elected as an elector may be a Deputy, with the result that you might have a Deputy with two votes; he might have a vote in respect of being selected by the county council and in respect of being a member of Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sub-section (3), which sets out that persons who originally belonged to dissolved county councils can be called together for a particular purpose, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to amendment No. 90, which we are supposed to have passed.  Paragraph (b) of that amendment states: &ldquo;the persons elected for the purpose by the councils of counties or county boroughs&rdquo;.  The persons elected for the purpose mean the particular persons who will be selected as voters, selected by the councils of counties or county boroughs.  When another piece of legislation was before the House, the Minister for Local Government was so convinced that all the powers, duties, privileges and obligations of a county council were reposed in a commissioner who was acting for the time being, that he felt obliged to bring in another Bill to indicate what the intentions were.  The point I want to emphasise is that the commissioner is the council; he is acting as the council and the Minister for Local Government so held when he was obliged to bring in a Bill in order to clarify that particular position.</P>

    <P>Now, if the commissioner has reposed in him all the powers, responsibilities and privileges of a county council, because he supersedes a county council and was appointed for the purpose of <Col N="2163" /> carrying out all the duties and privileges and responsibilities of a county council, I submit that equally he has them here and he has them under this particular sub-section just in the same manner as he got them from the Minister for Local Government in relation to a position where the county council had certain privileges with regard to nominations.  If the county council has certain privileges in that respect and the Minister felt obliged to introduce a Bill in order to put that matter right, I submit we are in exactly the same position here.  Anything we say in this sub-section here does not deprive the commissioner of the powers he has acting as a county council.  I would like to know the Minister's opinion on that.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Brennan has raised a point that was not raised last night, a new point.  The point is that, going back to No. 90, it would appear that if we say in a Bill that county councils have certain rights, that then the commissioner can claim to have the same rights.  With regard to the amending Bill relating to the nomination of President, it was not held by this side of the House that there was any necessity for it; it was pressed by the Opposition, and, in order to remove any doubt, the amending Bill was brought in.  We are inquite a different position here.  Even if the commissioner could claim that right, it would be impracticable to apply it.  For instance, the Bill sets out that two members of a county council must nominate and then the county council must select seven of their members.  It obviously cannot apply to a commissioner.</P>

      <P>The serious portion of this amendment seems to me to be the kind of development that is possible under it, and unless the Minister changes his mind this morning as compared with the mind revealed last night, I think the House is going to put itself into a position in which it should not put itself under any circumstances. When we were discussing this matter last night, I put to the Minister a very definite case, and I would like to know from him what the Government propose to do in connection with that case.  A certain county council elected in 1928 functioned until 1932, and then, because of municipal inefficiency and mismanagement according to the Minister for Local Government, the county council was suppressed and in its place was put a commissioner to administer the affairs of the county.  Because of the fact that the commissioner was installed in 1932, and that the Department were not satisfied that a new election should take place so soon as 1934, the commissioner continued to function in 1934, and, in fact, there was no election for the county council in that year.  In fact, those persons who were members of the county councils which were elected in 1928 ceased to be entitled to call themselves county councillors once there was a general dissolution of the county councils of 1934.  In one case, certain members of a county council were, in fact, arraigned on a charge of municipal misfeasance, brought before the criminal courts, and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  I think that one of the charges against a councillor was that of selling his vote for a certain sum when a labourer's cottage was being allocated.  Is it possible, under sub-section (3) of this section, that a person whose municipal misfeasance was discovered after the installation of <Col N="2165" /> the commissioner will be entitled to be deemed a member of a county council for the purpose of electing seven members to constitute the electoral college? Will it be possible for him also to be one of the seven county councillors who will, in fact, constitute portion of the electoral college for the purpose of constituting the new Seanad?  Perhaps the Minister would answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this point was raised last night, I said that, as the section stands, according to my interpretation, a person guilty of an offence since the council was dissolved would be eligible as an elector.  When Deputy Norton asked me if anything could be done to prevent that, I said it would be extremely difficult because it would involve the getting of a police report on every one of these county councillors.  Obviously, that would be a rather difficult thing to do even if it were not considered inadvisable. We might be able to provide a compromise scheme in this way&mdash;that if it was reported to the Seanad returning officer that a person had been guilty of an offence that person would be excluded.  That, however, would not guarantee absolutely that the person entitled to vote for an elector would be free from any offence in the meantime. The matter will be considered before the next stage, and, perhaps, something will be put in by way of amendment to meet that particular case.</P>
      <P>I should like to go back for a minute to the point raised by Deputy Brennan.  If Deputy Brennan would read sub-section (3) of amendment No. 91, he would find that the case is very well covered, because that sub-section provides that, in the case of these dissolved councils, the electors shall be elected from amongst themselves by the surviving persons who were members of such councils immediately before dissolution.  That would appear definitely to eliminate the commissioner for such a county.  In his place, we have the surviving members in office immediately before the commissioner was appointed.</P>

Is a member of the Gárda, who is normally not entitled to exercise his vote in a Dáil election, to be entitled to act in this case?  Although I think that strong reasons could be adduced to show why, seeing he is liable to taxation imposed by the legislature, such a person should have a voice in the constitution of the legislature, the State says that there are reasons why he should not have that right.  This man was a member of a local authority which was suppressed and, during the past few years when there was recruitment for the Gárda Síochána and when even persons who were over the normal age for recruitment were admitted, he obtained entrance to the force and is now a member of the Gárda.  Is that person entitled to vote for the purpose of electing a new Seanad?</P>

      <P>I have told the Deputy that we were examining the position to see if we could find any easy means of dealing with the case of a person who was guilty of an offence in the meantime. In fact, I think the amendment would take the form that, if he were ineligible for any reason to be a county councillor, he should be ineligible to attend this meeting.  The case mentioned by Deputy Gorey would be an exception to that.  County councillors who had gone out of office might have become contractors to the commissioner or county council since then.  There is nothing wrong or illegal about that, and I think they should not be excluded.  However, for other reasons, such as a criminal offence or becoming members of the Gárda or Army, I think they should be excluded, and we shall try to have an amendment submitted on next stage to meet these cases.</P>

      <P>I want to see if I understand the position aright so far as it has emerged this morning.  It appears to me that the Minister now takes up the position, in reference to those people who had at one time been members of a dissolved county council, that he is prepared to consider bringing in an amendment that they shall not be entitled to vote if they were subject to disqualification of certain types.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>He is still going to allow the position that, while Deputies can be deprived of their votes for the Seanad election, if they suffer the disqualifications set out in the Electoral Act, 1923, the same law is not to apply to these seven nominees of county councils, and lastly, he is going to leave the position as it stands at the moment, that both Deputies of the Dáil and the nominees of county councils, whether dissolved or otherwise, are entitled in law to sell their votes for the Seanad.  That appears to be the result of the discussion, and there is no intention to change that at any subsequent stage of the Bill.  It is well that the public, thinking of this scheme, should realise that that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> There is one other point I want to raise.  I have already adverted to it in the remarks I made on the previous amendment about the electorate. Under the proposals as they stand, each county council and meeting of members of dissolved county councils has to nominate seven people, and these seven, when nominated, are to be the electorate.  I directed attention to the fact that although the Constitution provides for secret postal ballot, the proposals in this amendment can be so operated as to nullify that constitutional provision.  I want to know from the Minister what status these seven nominees have, what are their duties and what are their rights. Are they to be seven independent people once they have been nominated by the county councils and entitled to exercise this franchise entirely independent of the body that appointed them, or are they to remain subject to the control and directions of that body?  In other words, are we going to allow the position that these seven nominees, before they are appointed, will have to give an undertaking to the members of the county council who are going to elect them that, if elected, they will vote in a particular way, or for certain candidates, or are they going to be allowed to be completely independent of the body that appointed them?  If they are subjected, or to be subject, or allowed to remain in a position where they may be subject, to pressure from a county council after or before appointment, I think there is grave danger that the constitutional provision is going to be nullified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in this Bill entitling a county council to bind its delegates in respect of their vote.  They will be perfectly free to vote for whatever candidates they think best.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Costello as to the Corrupt Practices Act, the position is as I stated last night, that there is no reference to that Act; but I am told that the next Bill coming before the Dáil, that is, the Consequential Provisions Bill, may deal with that matter.  It may revive&mdash;it is a matter of interpretation, I suppose&mdash;the <Col N="2170" /> provisions of the Act which applied to the election of the old Seanad and which would naturally apply to all electors to the new Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will. What I want to get from the Minister, and what I think the public are entitled to get from the Minister, is a statement of Ministerial policy on this point.  It is not a question of what may or may not be, if there is a doubt about it.  I myself think there is no doubt that the position is that these seven nominees will be entitled by law to sell their votes.  I am not sure about the position of Deputies, but I think it would be an offence at common law for a Deputy to sell his vote: but I think that these people are being created a new class to which neither the common law nor the Corrupt Practices Act applies.  I think there is no doubt about the position, but whether there is a doubt or not, the public is entitled to know what is the Ministerial policy on this matter. Do they, or do they not, want these seven nominees to be in a position lawfully to sell their votes by public auction, private contract, or otherwise? What is the Ministerial policy on that point?  In reference to disqualifications, I think we are entitled to have a clear statement of policy, irrespective of what the position may be.  If there is doubt about it, if the position is not clear, do the Government intend to have it clarified, and, if so, in what direction&mdash;whether in favour of free sale or of the application of the Corrupt Practices Act?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that there are two possibilities of scandal here&mdash;one, the scandal of selling votes, and the other revealed by the Minister last night, when he took up the attitude that these people were entitled to sell their votes and gave as an excuse for that that the Dáil members were so entitled.  He was asked did the Government intend to do any thing about it, and he said no.  Since then, this man who is in charge of the Bill, has been told that possibly certain provisions may be revived by a Bill that is still to come.  There were two scandals&mdash;the possibility of selling a vote, and the attitude of the Minister last night when he definitely stated that he accepted the position that they were entitled to sell their votes and that the Government had no intention of preventing it.</P>

I said there was no doubt that this Bill contained no clause with regard to corrupt practices, or the other matter mentioned by Deputy Norton as to members of dissolved councils who had since committed some crime.  That is undoubtedly the position so far as the Bill is concerned, and I do not see why we should insult the electors on county councils by putting in the Bill anything about corrupt practices, while leaving Dáil members out.</P>

It was not that anybody accepted this Bill as dealing with the matter, but the Minister was asked definitely if the Corrupt Practices Act applied, and <Col N="2172" /> he said no.

      <P>There are two aspects of this Corrupt Practices Act which require consideration.  It may be held that it does apply in the case of persons who are at present members of a county council and who may be elected as part of the seven who will constitute the electoral college, but will the Minister say in what manner the Corrupt Practices Act will apply in the case of a person who has ceased, since 1934, to be a member of a county council and who is now just an ordinary citizen?  In what manner is he tied by the Corrupt Practices Act or prevented from selling his vote?  This question of the sale of votes in connection with this Bill is a very important matter.  We ought to know definitely whether it is possible for those who will constitute the electoral college to put an advertisement in the newspapers in these terms: &ldquo;County Council: two votes for sale.  What offers?  Best offer over £20 accepted.&rdquo; One is a member of the county council and one is the member of the borough corporation.  Is that possible under this Bill?  That is a simple question. We should know definitely whether it is possible.  It seems to me that it is possible unless you bring these people under the Corrupt Practices Act.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with an aspect of this matter that is raised by the section.  It does not affect people who have since the dissolution of county councils committed an offence, but, in fact, by taking part in the deliberations of the reconstituted county councils they will, under the section, be leaving themselves liable to prosecution.  The matter was referred to last night.  I addressed remarks to the Minister, and he said that persons who were formerly members of county councils which were dissolved, and who have contracts with their successors in title, would be entitled to come forward and take part in the deliberations of county councils so reconstituted, for the purpose of electing seven electors at the Seanad election.  Up to the present, and until these county councils are reconstituted, persons who may have contracts with local bodies would not have committed <Col N="2174" /> any offence, but it is quite possible that, in the condition of the law as it is, they will have committed an offence, and a very serious offence, in taking part in such deliberations. I refer the Minister to Article 36 of the Application of Enactments Order, 1898, made under the Local Government Act, 1898.  While it is no offence for a member of a local body to have a contract with that local body, at the same time he is, pursuant to that enactment, disqualified from acting. Once he acts he commits an offence, an offence for which there is a penalty, and he would then find that a very serious position would arise, as certain disgruntled persons, not satisfied with the method of election or with the seven people selected by the county council, would be entitled, as the law stands, to go to the nearest Civic Guard station and there insist upon the Attorney-General's Department instituting a prosecution in regard to what these people had done.</P>
      <P>The point arises as a result of what is proposed under this section.  I hope I will not be criticised for making this suggestion or, as a member of this Party, criticised for holding up the business of the House.  The suggestion I make is a constructive one.  I would like to see something put into the section to make it clear beyond doubt that a person who has a contract with a local body will not be penalised under the Local Government Act, 1898, and the Application of Enactments Order, 1898.</P>

      <P>I do not think they could be.  It is not a meeting of the county council, it is a meeting of the members constituting the county council.

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give an undertaking to re-draft the section.  As far as the House can understand the position, and as the <Col N="2175" /> Minister has admitted, the way is left open for all sorts of happenings. Things that were hitherto illegal can happen under this proposal.  For instance, it has been stated that one might sell votes freely.  That is a position we should not allow.  A further illustration regarding the selling of votes is that it has been suggested that some person might have two, three or four votes.  It was stated that one Deputy would have three votes.  There may be other Deputies who would have two or three votes.  That would be introducing a peculiar situation. Apparently they could not as Deputies sell their votes, but they could sell the other votes.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this proposal and to give the House an undertaking that it will be re-drafted in such a way that when it comes before the House again we can be all satisfied that the things that have been suggested could not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be easier and more convenient to let the section go into the reprint of the Bill and then have it considered.  Otherwise, there would be a gap in the reprint.  The amendment that has been suggested could be put in at the next stage.  It is much better that the section should go into the reprint and be amended on the next stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Bennett, that is not the position. If any Act, such as the Corrupt Practices Act, could apply to members of the Dáil, it would apply also to others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that we are asked to pass a section which is bristling with difficulties and capable of immense corruption.</P>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that a person may be permitted to vote for the new Seanad even though he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for some criminal offence, and may even vote although he is at present in jail.  The Minister has admitted that that is possible and, further, that it is possible under the section for a person to sell his vote.  The Minister is in doubt as to whether a person who is a member of a dissolved county council can sit again as a member of that council, if it is reconstituted, and vote for the election of the seven who are to constitute the electoral college without being liable to certain penalties which automatically are visited upon him if he is an employee or a contractor as well as a member of the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are three clear difficulties that have arisen under the section.  The Minister admits that at least two of them are possible, and that the third may also be possible.  Nevertheless, he asks us to pass the section.  Why should we do that?  Would it not be much better for the Minister to withdraw the section and come back on the next stage with a section to meet all those difficulties, and then ask the House to pass it with the knowledge that we are not openly and blatantly passing a section which will permit <Col N="2177" /> fraud and scandals of the kind I have described to arise under the section that is before us?  No member of the House can vote for this section as it stands, certainly no member independent of Party discipline.  If we were to vote for this section as it stands, then, on the next stage, the Government might decline to close the gaps that have been pointed out, and at a later stage we could be told if the things that I have referred to as possible happen, that we voted for a section permitting such things to happen.  It does not bring the Government any credit to ask the House to pass an amendment which opens up so many possibilities of fraud and corruption. Surely, the Minister would have no difficulty in doing what I have asked him to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>The way I look at this is that if you want to travel on a road it is easy to do so if you are not impeded by obstructions.  In the case of this section, it places an obstruction in the way.  I suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw it and deal with the matter on the next stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the three points mentioned by Deputy Norton, they are relatively small ones compared to the section as it stands.  First of all, he mentioned the matter of a man selling his vote.  That will not come into this section.  It will be dealt with in another Bill.  The other two points were: (1) that a person might be guilty of an offence since the council of which he was a member was dissolved, and (2) the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, that a man might commit an illegality by attending meetings of the council if he was also an employee or a contractor under the council.  If it is necessary to deal with these two points, then that can be done in one amendment to this long section.</P>

      <P>Surely the Deputy realises that where you provide for a thing of that kind in another Bill, you are not expected to put it into this Bill as well.  It surely ought to be sufficient to provide for what the Deputy complains of in another measure.  I do not want to discuss the Consequential Provisions Bill, but that particular matter will be dealt with there.  Deputy O'Sullivan accuses me of being very accommodating to-day and not so accommodating last night.

I take it for granted that Section 10 in the Consequential Provisions Bill is meant mainly as a sop to Deputy Norton: to justify his phrase &ldquo;The Road Back,&rdquo; because what we are doing under that section is repealing the Act of 1936 abolishing the Seanad.  This is a marvellous piece of gymnastics on the part of the President.  Under that section he is repealing the 1936 Act abolishing the Seanad, save a few unimportant sections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we know that, if the Minister wants his Party to vote for this very unsavoury section, he will get them to do so.  Deputy Norton, Deputy O'Sullivan and other Deputies have pointed out the unsavouriness of the section, but I want to speak on another aspect of it.  I am speaking on the question of its legality.  I have already pointed out the position with regard to the provision for every council of a county or a county borough holding a meeting, and so on.  That implies that the commissioners must hold their meetings.  The Minister says that they must not, because they cannot; but what is the legal position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section (3), they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that they cannot appoint certain persons, because there is only one in it; but does not the section set out that they must hold their meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But does not sub-section (3) provide an exception?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  There is not a single, solitary word about the powers the commissioner has, nor is the word &ldquo;exception&rdquo; once mentioned anywhere. He has the powers here under sub-section (1) of this particular section you are trying to pass.  I am raising that point in addition to the other unsavoury points raised by other Deputies.  Deputy Norton asked the President here yesterday a rather pertinent question.  He asked the President when it was that he thought of this particular type of electorate, and the President did not answer.  It was evident, however, that it was thought of in haste, because, if the President or the Government thought anything of that system they would have introduced it in the case of nominations for the Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are going to have members of dissolved county councils, who may be guilty of all kinds of offences, coming along and being allowed to <Col N="2182" /> take part in the elections for the Seanad in this way, there was no reason whatever why they should not be also eligible in the case of elections for the Presidency.  We have not that in the case of an election for President, but we have it here.  The Minister says that certain things are withheld here, but the section does not say so.  In a preceding sub-section the commissioner has the right and authority to meet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the case of every council of a county or a county borough which is for the time being dissolved under Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925, the electors required by the foregoing provisions of this section to be elected by such councils shall be elected from amongst themselves&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>The Minister certainly has not got a grip on the reason behind either the county council nominations for the President or this matter here, because what was really in the mind of the Minister for Local Government and the mind of the House was that he should not put into the hands of a commissioner the rights of the people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 92:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 21, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Clerk of Dáil Eireann shall, not later than, in the case of the first Seanad election, the 31st day of January, 1938, or, in the case of every subsequent Seanad election, three days after he has received all the returns to the writs for the relevant Dáil election, send to the Seanad returning officer a statement of the names, addresses, and descriptions of the members of Dáil Eireann who are entitled under this Act to be members of the electorate at such Seanad election.</P>
      <P>(2)  So soon as the Seanad returning officer has received from the Clerk of Dáil Eireann the statement in relation to a Seanad election mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section and has ascertained the result of all the elections of electors by councils of counties or county boroughs (including any elections by former members of any such council which is for the time being dissolved) in relation to such Seanad election, the Seanad returning officer shall prepare for such Seanad election an electoral roll containing the names, addresses, and descriptions of all the persons who appear from such statement and results to constitute the electorate for such Seanad election.</P>
      <P>(3)  It shall be lawful for the Seanad returning officer to make such inquiries and take such steps as he shall think proper for ascertaining the correct name, address, and description of every person whose name is required to be entered in an electoral roll, but no inaccuracy in the name, address, or description of any person in an electoral roll shall invalidate such electoral roll.</P>
      <P>(4)  The persons whose names are entered in an electoral roll shall be arranged in such roll in the alphabetical order of their surnames and, in cases of identity of surname, of their other names, and shall be numbered consecutively in that order.</P>
      <P>(5)  Every electoral roll prepared under this section shall be final and conclusive and not open to review by any court, and the persons whose names are set out in any such electoral roll, and no other persons, shall be entitled to vote at the Seanad election to which such electoral roll relates.</P>

      <P>The first sub-section of this new section provides that the Clerk of the Dáil shall send to the Seanad returning officer the names of members of the Dáil who are entitled to be members of the electorate. Then, the returning officer, having also ascertained the result of the elections of electors by county councils and county borough councils, will make the electoral roll.  Sub-section (3) lays down that the returning officer shall make such enquiries in regard to proper names, addresses and so forth as he may think proper.  It lays down also that if a person does by any chance give a wrong address that does <Col N="2187" /> not invalidate the election.  The roll will be then arranged in alphabetical order.  The roll, so arranged, it is also provided, will be final and conclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no indication so far that you are going to amend it.  If the Seanad returning officer will have power to make inquiries with regard to names and addresses, he certainly also should have power to make inquiries with regard to matters that are more important, namely, the right and authority of these people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we intended to bring in an amendment, if practicable, on the next stage dealing with that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of this amendment states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So soon as the Seanad returning officer has received from the Clerk <Col N="2188" /> of Dáil Eireann the statement in relation to a Seanad election mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section and has ascertained the result of all the elections of electors by councils of counties or county boroughs (including any elections by former members of any such council which is for the time being dissolved)...</P>
    <P>Now, I hold that the Minister, according to the terms of his previous section, made no provision for these members of county councils that were for the time being dissolved.  We cannot bring them into existence again without an Act and an election because in the previous section the statement commences: &ldquo;In the case of every council of a county or county borough which is for the time being dissolved&rdquo;.  That applies to a county council elected in 1934.  Members of previous councils are not county councillors.  The only person who can claim to be a county councillor, in such an instance, is the commissioner. Therefore such councillors have no existence and are not given an existence.  They cannot have that existence without a new election or a special Act of Parliament giving them that power.  It cannot be given to them under this section.  The provision made in sub-section (2) of amendment No. 92 reads: &ldquo;including any elections by former members of any such council which was for the time being dissolved&rdquo;. I do not know if it is possible to introduce a short Bill giving these people legal status, that is, members of a county council that was dissolved before 1934.  I hold that under this Bill you cannot legalise the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the wording of sub-section (2), line 6, of this amendment&mdash; this has reference to the point raised by Deputy Gorey&mdash;is consistent with the wording of the previous amendment, sub-section (3), which states: &ldquo;...the electors required by the foregoing provisions of this section to be elected by such council shall be elected from amongst themselves by the surviving persons who were members of such council immediately before it was dissolved&rdquo;?  Now, this amendment sets out that as soon as the <Col N="2189" /> Seanad officer has received from the Clerk of Dáil Eireann the statement &ldquo;...and has ascertained the result of all the elections of electors by councils of counties or county boroughs (including any elections by former members of any such council which is for the time being dissolved)&rdquo;.  Here we have the expression &ldquo;former members of any such council which is for the time being dissolved&rdquo;.  Does that mean any former member of that particular council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That wording is not consistent with the wording of the previous amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not realise that, when we say former members in sub-section (2) of amendment No. 92, it is merely a reference back to sub-section (3) of amendment No. 91?  It is not necessary to give a definition of the members in every reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the previous amendment they were defined as the surviving persons who were members of such council immediately prior to its dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are defined there and we refer back to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better to have a clear definition in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>You seek to do something in this sub-section of the amendment that you have not done in the other amendment.  The question of validity here is on a par with what would happen if previous members of the Dáil claimed the right to come in here and vote.  They have no longer a legal status in the State.  The whole thing is, in fact, laughable.  It is rather tragic in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from that&mdash;and I think that point requires to be rectified&mdash;there is another sub-section of the amendment which appears at the top of page 24, which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every electoral roll prepared under this section shall be final and conclusive <Col N="2190" /> and not open to review by any court and the persons whose names are set out in any such electoral roll, and no other person, shall be entitled to vote at the Seanad election to which such electoral roll relates.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a very drastic provision.  Certain information as to who are entitled to constitute the electoral college is collated by the Seanad returning officer.  He may make such inquiries as he can about members, and if on the part of the local authority there is some conspiracy to permit a certain improper thing to happen, and as a result of that conspiracy a person not entitled to vote managers to have his name included in the seven to be elected&mdash;we have got to remember again that some of these councils have been removed for municipal mismanagement&mdash;and, if in any case, they can succeed in fooling the Seanad returning officer in getting a name on the electoral roll, the insertion of that name on the electoral roll shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to review by any court.  So that, although we may have patent evidence of some illegality having been committed, it is apparently not possible for anybody to have that illegality made the subject of proceedings in any court.  As a matter of fact, it is very doubtful even if the returning officer having put the name on the list can delete it after he discovers that illegality.  I should like to hear the Minister justify that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can recall, in the Electoral Act there is a similar provision. The returning officer must have the final word.  What could you do, suppose there was a delay in some case? Suppose the Supreme Court had to decide whether a name should be on or not, the whole thing might be held up for five or six months.  You must make the returning officer's word the final word.  If he says it is a final and a conclusive list, then it must be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Put in a nutshell, the whole position is that the President and the Government are in a hurry, and must have this thing done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that does not apply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going back to another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should it not be possible, even if it takes time and involves an appeal to the court, to remove from the electoral roll the name of a person who has been improperly included?  Why should we, with our eyes wide open, permit a state of affairs to continue whereby a person who should not be an elector would in fact be permitted to be an elector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider giving some explanation to the House as to the possibility of an election petition being lodged after the election.  If, after prosecuting that election petition before the court, a member is disqualified, according to this Bill, as I read it, he is entitled to vote at a Seanad election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the Deputy's request a bit clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>An election takes place in let us say, the constituency of Bohola, and five members are elected.  An election petition is lodged for any one of the dozen reasons for which an election petition may be lodged.  Before the election petition is decided the members who have been returned cannot sit, as I understand the law, but they are entitled to vote here.  Alternatively, a person may be elected but may subsequently be disqualified for various reasons.  Deputy Costello mentioned one of them, which apparently has gone into abeyance, but there may be others.  Notwithstanding the fact that a person would not be entitled to sit in the Dáil, nevertheless he could vote.  Furthermore it was mentioned here yesterday on this section that any mistake which may occur either in the names, the description, the address or anything else will not invalidate the roll.  It is not necessary, I am sure, to bring to the Minister's mind the fact that a mistake in your income tax form may land you in serious difficulties.  The <Col N="2192" /> penalties are always on the individual, but the State in this case exculpates the officer responsible, and itself incidentally, from any mis-description or other mistake that may arise.  The third point is the point made by Deputy Norton and it is a point of some importance, namely, that apparently there is a court of first instance and no other in this case.  There is a returning officer.  Why is a roll necessary? Was a roll necessary in the case of the election that formerly took place in which members of the Seanad and the Dáil voted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the same sort of register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that there was, there was never a mistake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no cause of complaint, but for a mistake which occurs here and which is apparently anticipated there is no provision.  The strange thing about it is that it may occur in reference either to a member of the Dáil or to a member of the county council.  The county council electors are the children of the Minister and we have no interest in them, but so far as members of the Dáil are concerned we have an interest in them.  As I say, under this section as it is drawn, the Seanad returning officer can make any return he wishes. All he requires to have is Ministerial backing.  You can have a register composed of 40 members, or composed of electors of the Minister's Party.  I am sure that is not the intention.  The Minister is not unaware of the fact that in one important and progressive Catholic country in Europe, so engineered and gerrymandered were the electoral results that a minority Party got into power, waged war in the country, and has ruined a great number of people.  The Seanad returning officer may be an excellent individual.  He may have the confidence not only of the Minister but of all Parties in the House.  We are not dealing with him.  This measure is one that is going to last presumably, if we interpret the Minister correctly.  The Seanad returning officer may be in <Col N="2193" /> future the nominee of a corrupt political Party.  He has absolute control and power to regulate the electoral college for the Seanad in future, and while we have courts which allow for an appeal from decisions made by them&mdash;an appeal from courts at the very bottom probably to the very top &mdash;here you have one individual who cannot be made responsible as long as the Minister is prepared to stand over whatever he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said already, in reply to Deputy Norton I think, in all elections you have an electoral roll which is prepared by some person such as a returning officer.  Even for the Dáil election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a very big difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>There is a difference.  An election petition brought afterwards, I think, cannot question the electorate. It may question other matters.  The same applies here.  Section 27 deals with election petitions.  Questions may be raised with regard to the counting of the votes or something like that, but not with regard to the electoral roll.  As I said to the Deputy when he was speaking, practically the same provisions applied in the election of the old Seanad.  The electoral roll was prepared, and it could not be questioned once it was prepared.  After all, I think it was possible there for an unscrupulous Ministry to appoint a Seanad returning officer who would blatantly if you like leave out members of the Dáil and Seanad, and so have all one side electing the new Seanad.  It is not likely to occur, I suggest.  I know that the President, in dealing with another part of this Bill, has promised to consider how this Seanad returning officer should be selected and appointed so that as far as possible he would be an independent person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, it is not a question of suspecting the <i>bona fides</i> of the Seanad returning officer.  A case may arise where a county council which was first elected in 1928, subsequently abolished, but reconstituted for the purposes of this electoral college&mdash;<Col N="2194" /> remember it was a body previously suppressed for illegalities of one kind or another&mdash;may meet, and with dimmed memories of their qualifications to act as an electorate they may proceed to elect seven members to constitute this new electoral college. Some of those people may not be entitled to vote.  They may suffer from one type or other of the disqualifications which prevent them from being electors even within the meaning of this Bill, or within the meaning of the Corrupt Practices Act if it is now or subsequently made to apply to them. The returning officer may not know that, and consequently may put the names of those persons on the electoral roll.  It is possible, I suggest, under this section that the returning officer may prepare a roll on say Monday and declare on Tuesday that the roll has been prepared.  The section says that the persons whose names are set out in any such electoral roll and no other person shall be entitled to vote at the Seaned election to which such electoral roll relates.  The returning officer may discover on Friday that there are one or two people on that roll whose names should not appear on it.  Having first declared the existence of the roll, and incorporated those names on the roll, is he entitled to revise the roll even when it is brought to his notice that certain persons' names are improperly entered there?  Is that possible for the returning officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  I do not think the returning officer can revise it once he has signed the final roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So that if he prepares it on Monday, exhibits it or makes its existence known on Tuesday, and has it gazetted on Wednesday, and then abundant evidence is brought in on Thursday and every other day for the subsequent week that A, B, C and D are, in fact, disqualified from being electors, the returning officer is to say to whoever produces that information: &ldquo;It cannot be helped; I cannot possibly interfere now with the electoral roll.&rdquo;  That type of thing might not be very serious in a Dáil election, where the number of electors is close <Col N="2195" /> to 2,000,000, and where one or ten votes would not affect an issue very much; but it is of considerable importance in an electoral college of this type, which is restricted and which is elected in a particular way.  A situation of that kind should obviously be guarded against.  I wonder what defence the Minister can make for permitting a Seanad election to be held, and, with our eyes wide open, permitting non-qualified people to act on a restricted franchise selected in this peculiar way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I would like to meet a point like that as far as I possibly could.  If I were to visualise it, I think what would happen is that the returning officer would take all the care he possibly could to see that the names were correct.  I am sure everybody will admit that.  I do not think the returning officer would make his final and conclusive roll until he was satisfied that he had it in every way correct.  Probably he would not make it until it was required.  I do not think the situation would arise that was pictured by Deputy Norton, about the returning officer preparing the roll and then people pointing out that certain electors were disqualified.</P>

      <P>The Minister was probably at an election at some time or other and he voted.  If it so happens that a name is not recorded accurately in the register, the Minister, I am sure, will understand the position.  For instance, there are various names which are subject to a particular peculiarity. If you take the name &ldquo;Brown&rdquo; it can be spelled in two ways.  Similarly, the name &ldquo;Smith&rdquo;<Col N="2196" /> can be spelled in two ways.  If you go into a polling booth, and the name is not correctly returned&mdash;for instance, if the Christian name is put down as &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Thomasini,&rdquo; or any other peculiar difference of that sort&mdash;the presiding officer will inform you that that name is not on the register.  You can swear you are the person there returned, and you will get a vote.  Is that the case here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a conflict between two sub-sections.  If, as Deputy Cosgrave said, a person is entered as &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; on the electoral roll, and it appears that the name &ldquo;Brown&rdquo; is spelled differently elsewhere, it would appear under sub-section (5) that he could not exercise the vote, but under sub-section (3), from what the Minister says, he could.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are even more remarkable cases than that.  So far as this is concerned, not only have you to fulfil all the technicalities of the law as it is drawn, but you have to run the risk of the compositor.  As far as I can read this, a man perfectly entitled to vote is prevented from doing so merely because his name is not properly recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not be interpreting this sub-section aright, but it is <Col N="2197" /> meant to cover such cases.  In this particular case you have a Seanad returning officer dealing with something like 400 names and it is almost inconceivable that he would not have the correct names and addresses of everybody.

There is to be a preliminary register, but a certain difficulty arises in that people may have trouble in ascertaining if they are entitled to be entered as <Col N="2198" /> electors.  There is no preliminary canter in this case.  You are told there is to be a race, but you are not told the time to start and you have no opportunity of knowing if your horse is at the post.</P>

      <P>I have considerable objection to amendment No. 93.  A lot of discussion has circled around the position of this person who is to be called the Seanad returning officer. A certain amount of adverse criticism was directed to him by Deputy McGilligan and by Deputy Norton and it was intimated that something would have to be done to clear him from the coils of the Minister, whoever he might be.  In answer to that, I think that the President and the Minister for Agriculture indicated that they were making an honest endeavour to arrive at something in the nature of a decent conclusion.  They stated that they were trying to concoct some kind of personage who would not be subject to Ministerial control.  I think that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was quoted as an example.  It was intimated that the Government would make an honest endeavour to clear this officer of Ministerial control.  In amendment No. 93, it is suggested that, even in mere detail, he must have the consent of the Minister.  This big, magnaminous person who is supposed to be a mean between a body corporate and an individual, who is supposed to be <Col N="2201" /> omnipotent, has now, for the purpose of dealing with such a common or garden thing as two sheets of foolscap, to ask the Minister's consent as to whether he is to utilise one or two columns.  I think that that is simply ludicrous and is striking at the root of the promise the President gave.  If this person is to be all-powerfull, the suggestion underlying the words, &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, is definitely contrary to the assertions by the President and the Minister for Agriculture.  I think this example provides evidence that there is something behind this proposal and that really this magnanimous, omnipotent person to be known as the Seanad returning officer will be still under the thumb of the Minister.  I do not know if that is the intention.  It is suggested in that small matter when the consent of the Minister has to be obtained as to whether he will utilise one or two columns of a couple of sheets of foolscap.  That is depriving him of the function of even a small office boy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 109:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, before Section 25, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The numbers of members of Seanad Eireann to be elected from each of the panels shall be as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  five members shall be elected from the cultural and educational panel, of whom four shall be persons nominated to that panel by nominating bodies and one shall be a person nominated to that panel by members of Dáil Eireann;</P>
      <P>(b)  eleven members shall be elected from the agricultural panel, of whom five shall be persons nominated to that panel by nominating bodies and six shall be persons nominated to that panel by members of Dáil Eireann;</P>
      <P>(c)  eleven members shall be elected from the labour panel, of whom five shall be persons nominated to that panel by nominating bodies and six shall be persons nominated to that panel by members of Dáil Eireann;</P>
      <P>(d)  nine members shall be elected from the industrial and commercial panel, of whom four shall be persons nominated to that panel by nominating bodies and five shall be persons nominated to that panel by members of Dáil Eireann;</P>
      <P>(e)  seven members shall be elected from the administrative panel, of whom three shall be persons nominated to that panel by nominating bodies and four shall be persons nominated to that panel by either members of Dáil Eireann or <i>ex-officio</i> nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the number of persons nominated by nominating bodies to a panel is less than the number <Col N="2209" /> of members of Seanad Eireann required by the foregoing sub-section of this section to be elected from persons so nominated to such panel, the full number of members of Seanad Eireann required by the said sub-section to be elected from such panel shall be made up from the persons nominated to such panel by members of Dáil Eireann or, in the case of the administrative panel, from persons nominated to that panel either by members of Dáil Eireann or <i>ex-officio</i> nominations.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the number of persons nominated by members of Dáil Eireann to a panel (other than the administrative panel) is less than the number of members of Seanad Eireann required by the first sub-section of this section to be elected from persons so nominated to such panel, the full number of members of Seanad Eireann required by the said sub-section to be elected from such panel shall be made up from the persons nominated to such panel by nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever the number of persons nominated by members of Dáil Eireann to the administrative panel together with the number of persons nominated to that panel by <i>ex-officio</i> nominations is less than the number of members of Seanad Eireann required by the first sub-section of this section to be elected from persons so nominated to the said panel, the full number of members of Seanad Eireann required by the said sub-section to be elected from such panel shall be made up from the persons nominated to the said panel by nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>This sets out the number of members to be elected to each panel.  As already outlined to the Dáil, five are to be elected from the cultural and educational panel, four of these to be nominated by outside bodies and one by the Dáil members; 11 to be elected from the agricultural panel, six of whom shall come from the nominees of Dáil members and five from outside; 11 from the Labour panel with the same division; nine from the industrial and commercial panel, four of whom shall be nominated to the panel <Col N="2210" /> by nominating bodies and five from the nominees of Dáil members; and seven from the administrative panel, of whom three shall be nominated by nominating bodies and four by Dáil members.  The amendment provides in the next three sub-sections that if there are not sufficient nominations from outside bodies, the deficiency can be made from the Dáil nominees and <i>vice versa.</i></P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) (a) refers to five members elected from the cultural and educational panel, of whom four shall be nominated by nominating bodies and one by members of Dáil Eireann.  I take it that there are really 11 involved there, six of whom shall be nominated by the universities. Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, so far as that particular group is concerned, is that the Dáil is to have the election of only one out of 11, which means, in effect, that you are presenting to the Government of the day another Senator, in addition to the 11 the President already has power to nominate. The Government of the day normally has a majority in the House and, therefore, can elect that one Senator.  I should like to hear some reason advanced as to why the proportions should vary so much in subparagraph (a) as compared with any of the other groups, because the position, in effect, is that of the 11 to be elected, the Dáil is allowed to elect only one, and that, in turn, means that you are presenting the Government of the day with another Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means that the majority Party is almost certain, if it votes as a body, of getting that one Senator.  There is some force in that contention, but the reason the numbers are put as they are is that, first of all, you have the universities, which I take as, roughly, coming into that cultural panel.  The electorate is very large in the sense that it is composed of all the graduates.  They may give you a professional man, a business man, or any other type whatsoever, and although the fact that they are <Col N="2211" /> graduates will indicate that they are in a special way associated with cultural matters, you would feel it advisable, over and above that, to give bodies such as the learned professions who have organisations of their own a fair chance of nomination.  It was suggested by Deputy McGilligan that here we had a panel where we could leave the whole of the election on the outside, and the idea of giving them as large a number as possible was a recognition of that fact.  The proportion was given in that way because we want to try to get 21, and the six and five we have in the case of the 11 was regarded, in existing circumstances, as a good apportionment, and if you keep that in, you must get the rest from somewhere, so that, in respect of the numbers being allocated, that seems to be a good allocation.</P>
      <P>The particular point the Deputy has raised did not occur to me, I confess.  I think Deputy Dockrell has some amendments dealing with the allocation of numbers.  He wants to change the number in the industrial panel and to balance it up by subtracting from the administrative panel.  I will look into it and shall bear in mind what the Deputy has said, to see whether I could not do something.  The only panel on which there is a possibility of doing anything is the administrative panel.  By looking at that panel I might so arrange that we could get the total of 21 we want.</P>

      <P>What is the meaning of these words in sub-section (2) of Section 109 &ldquo;shall be made up from members of Dáil Eireann&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite satisfied with that, for the reason that I think the provision made here is not in the right place.  It is a provision that should be really met in the case of the nominations.  If the nominating bodies wanted to make sure of getting their nominees elected without any supervision, they had only to be short in the panel and they were certain that the number that was short would get in.  I do not like that, and I will bring in an amendment to try to get into this a provision that is necessary.  There is no way of penalising a body.  You give them a statutory privilege and if they&mdash; do not avail of it you cannot penalise them.  You must make some arrangement so that the whole thing will not fall to the ground, if they fail.  The idea behind it is that if, in the case of other nominations, there is not a sufficient number to be nominated, not merely to give the exact number to have something in addition, so that there would be a genuine choice for the electorate.  You could not add the nominations from Dáil Eireann.  We assume that the nominations will be in excess of the number required.  If both are short, which is unlikely, we would have to meet that situation, and the idea is to treat them as casual vacancies. We will want another Bill, in addition to this one, for casual vacancies that are not provided for here.  The drafting department thought it better not to complicate this Bill by dealing with casual vacancies.  This is the only Bill which is urgent.  If we are to deal with casual vacancies that can be dealt with in the other Bill.  The Deputy need not worry about this, as there will be another opportunity to deal with it in the amended form.</P>

Take the agricultural panel, on which you might have a concentration of votes, so that if the votes were divided between all the Schedules seven might be the quota.  They might so concentrate on that that 15 might be necessary for a man to be elected, while on the next panel, one or two first preferences might get a man elected.  That means that the Party that can control the votes and that can machine the people will get the seats.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that the method taken will be a double check.  I do not know how the papers would be arranged when putting down the numbers.  According as the right number for each panel is <Col N="2215" /> built up, then all the others who have been nominated for that panel go.  All sorts of things that would not happen ordinarily will happen with this long list that you are going to have.  You will have people who get a large number of votes being eliminated because there is no further place for them, and people who get a comparatively small number of votes being elected in their own particular panel because of the fact that there is room for them in that panel.</P>

      <P>If we could, I confess that I would rather have the panel system, but then it would limit the smaller Parties, and groups would have a much smaller chance.  It was really in the hope of trying to give the smaller groups and Parties reasonable representation in the voting that we adopted the one system.  It is the one thing that makes it possible to eliminate what was perhaps an objectionable feature in the Bill as introduced, that you wanted 25 members to nominate. That was one method of restricting the numbers and dealing with the panels.  With regard to the numbers, I have already promised Deputy Morrissey that I will look into that question of one.  If there is to be any balancing, the only place I can see it is in the case of the administrative panel.  We want here 21 and 22.  As regards labour, industry and commerce and agriculture, I think that division is right and proper, and in the circumstances I would not like to alter it.  I may be able to get what we want. Two would be disadvantageous to the bigger Party.  I know that Deputies, and particularly Deputy O'Sullivan, will not believe me when I say that I am not interested fundamentally in the state of Parties in this particular matter&mdash;I mean in what would result &mdash;because I do think that, with the limited powers of the Seanad, there will be a tendency to criticise a Bill <Col N="2216" /> from the point of view of trying to improve it, and not merely to obstruct or anything of that sort.  Even though giving two would mean that it would be almost certain that you would get one from each of the bigger groups, still you would want to have a very big majority for the Party to get two. The one was not intentional.  I am not promising to change it, but I undertake to look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Constitution (Consequential Provisions) Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies are aware, on the 29th of this month the present Constitution will have been repealed and the legislative, executive and judicial functions of the State will begin to be operated under the new Constitution.  Article 50 of the Constitution provides fully for the continuance of all laws at present in force, so far as they are not inconsistent with the present Constitution.  It is necessary, however, to have some adaptation of existing enactments so as to ensure that the change in the constitutional position will take effect as smoothly as possible.</P>
      <P>In future, the legislative, executive and judicial authorities of the State will be those established by or functioning under the new Constitution, not those established by or functioning under the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.  The Central Fund and the Exchequer will be the Central Fund and Exchequer of Ireland and no longer the Central Funa and Exchequer of Saorstát Eireann.  The object of this Bill is to link up the new Governmental authorities and the new Central Fund and Exchequer with those at present existing and to make or provide for the making of such adaptations as may be necessary for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A somewhat similar situation arose on the setting up of the Free State <Col N="2219" /> in 1922 and at that time an Adaptation of Enactments Act was passed to deal with the situation.  Section 11 of that Act of 1922 provided for a general adaptation of references to Government Departments, and Section 12 gave power to the Executive Council to make further general or specific adaptations of statutes. Similarly, Section 4 of the Bill now before the House provides for the general adaptation of references to officials and authorities, and Section 5 gives power to the Government to make special adaptations and modifications. I do not think that it is necessary for me at this stage to go beyond the general explanation I have given.  Those are the main points of the Bill and its object is merely to bridge over the position and, as I have said, to provide for its smoother working.  Any points that may arise in regard to the detailed provisions of the Bill can be dealt with more appropriately in the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical Bill, as I think the Minister will acknowledge&mdash;not quite as technical, perhaps, as the Bill sponsored by the President the other day.  I wonder is the Minister serious in suggesting that the House will be in a position to indulge or to take part in any useful discussion of this Bill on the Committee Stage without a fuller explanation of the Bill than the Minister has given the House.  It will be difficult to approach this Bill without any more help than we have got from the Minister.  There are a number of questions that I should like to raise.  First of all, we have the objectionable phrase in the Bill &ldquo;The Constitution of Ireland lately enacted by the people.&rdquo;  We can deal with that in Committee, of course. Then, in reading one portion of this Bill, one is under the impression that the unity of Ireland has been achieved, but then you come to another portion of the Bill, as the Minister knows, which tells us that nothing of the kind has been achieved, and you are left precisely as you were; and as between &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Irish Free <Col N="2220" /> State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eire&rdquo;, what meaning is to be attached to these words at any particular instance is not quite clear.  As I say, the mockery of the title &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is clearly indicated not merely in the Constitution itself, where I think that what was done was quite harmful, but here it is indicated in, I think, sub-section (2) of Section 2.</P>
      <P>I am really now wanting information from the Minister so as to be in a better position to discuss this Bill on Committee Stage as the Minister says he is anxious to have us do.  Perhaps the Minister will make clear to us what is meant by Section 4, sub-section (1) (b); but coming to sub-section (2) there seems to be an immense power, or what looks like power given into the hands, not of the Dáil or the Government, but into the hands of one man, namely, the Premier or Taoiseach.  I wonder whether it is intended that he should have that particular power mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 4?  The courts, apparently, do not come in at all and no appeal to the courts is possible from one of these decisions by the Taoiseach.  Then, with regard to how this and the subsequent section are to work or how these things are to be done, in one section an order is to be made by the Taoiseach, and in the next section by the Government. Is there any necessity to publish that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let me take a concrete case which, perhaps, the Minister can answer.  Take the case of a transferred civil servant, transferred from the British Service to the service of Saorstát Eireann. What is his position now?  What is his position with regard to his rights under Article 10 of the Treaty?  We were told that these rights would be guaranteed and preserved, but as far as I can see there is no provision for the transfer of such an officer to the service of Éire.  There is a transfer of rights from the British service to the service of Saorstát Eireann, but I am not sure, if this is carried, when he ceases to be so and becomes a servant of Éire.  The Minister had not the misfortune to be here when we were discussing the Seanad Bill.  If he had been here, perhaps he would have explained Section 10 to us, because we were induced to pass an amendment to the Seanad Bill on the ground that it cleared up any difficulties we had, and when we asked for an explanation, we were told to wait until we came to the particular Bill we are now discussing. Now that we are at this Bill, I should be glad to hear from the Minister how it clears up our difficulties about the application of the Corrupt Practices Act.  As the Minister had not the ill-fortune, if I might say so, to be here while the other Bill was being piloted through the House in the extraordinary way in which it was piloted, I want to tell him what the position was.  We were told that if we had not this particular Section 10, the Corrupt Practices Act would not apply to the electoral college of the new Seanad.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how that section makes applicable to the new electoral college the Corrupt Practices Act, which, without that particular section, would not be applicable to the new electoral college. No explanation was given at that time.  On that occasion, I incidentally called attention to the unconscious humour on the part of the President in putting in this particular <Col N="2222" /> Section 10.  I have no doubt that it is a further proof of his consistency, namely, that he repeals his abolishing Act.  He more or less puts himself in sackcloth and ashes in this Bill, not in the Seanad Bill.  He says that the repealing Act of 1936 is now itself repealed.  For the ordinary man that would seem a retracing of his footsteps, but I understand that, from the President's point of view, it is only proof that he is marching still further in the same direction.  The only other point I have to raise is on Section 13, which states that, except in capital cases, the Government may remit, modify or defer any punishment imposed by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  What are &ldquo;capital&rdquo; cases?</P>

I should like to ask if the Minister is satisfied that ordinary commercial transactions are covered?</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Briscoe's point, the Government succeeds to all assets and they have all the liabilities, just the same as in the other provisions.  As to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan regarding the Corrupt Practices Act, that was repealed and we are reviving it by this Section 10.</P>

      <P>The Corrupt Practices (Prevention) Act was repealed. Under this we are reviving it.  It may seem a roundabout way.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister to say the Corrupt Practices Act.  A lot of people would be very disappointed if they did not know that.  It is news to me that the Act has been repealed since 1936.</P>

      <P>That only arises as regards the Seanad.  That is being revived in this, and the Deputy need hardly have any doubt about it.  With regard to the civil servants transferred from the British service, they are provided for in Article 56, sub-section (4) of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>That matter will be gone into and cleared up before the Committee Stage.  If the Deputy wants an assurance, I will make it quite definite.  The other matter referred to by the Deputy about the adaptations or amendments which might be made, and the method of publication, that seems to have been an oversight.  I mentioned it to the draftsman, and that will be provided for in Committee.  I do not know what the publication might be, whether it should be laid on the Table of the Dáil or otherwise, but in any case such a provision should be made.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage to be taken on Wednesday next.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.40 p.m. until Tuesday, December 14th, at 3 p.m.</P>
