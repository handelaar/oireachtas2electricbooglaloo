      <P>As the Deputy was informed on 3rd March, 1937, I called the board's attention to the need for repairing the boundary wall and providing efficient internal fences to eight cottages at Ballyhughes, Gort, County Galway.  The board's engineer reported on 23rd April that he had arranged with the contractor for the St. Colman's Terrace plots to build a small boundary wall on the frontage of the Ballyhughes plots and do a little general repair work.  He added that the plots were fenced by the Gort District Council years ago.  The board agreed to allow £20 for repair to boundary wall and £12 for repair to dividing fences and applied for approval of this expenditure.  On 11th May we requested a specification for this work. The specification was not furnished until 17th August last, when the cost was estimated to be £54 4s. 0d.  As the work appears necessary I have approved the expenditure, subject to the board being satisfied as to their liability for the carrying out of the work.  The matter will be further considered by the board on the 23rd instant.</P>

      <P>Subject to the statutory conditions and statutory disqualifications laid down in Sections 15 and 16 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended by Sections 3 and 9 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1935, unemployment assistance is paid without interruption to every person who is continuously unemployed.  In the case of most recipients of unemployment assistance, however, their unemployment is punctuated by frequent spells of employment, and the continuity of their unemployment is thus interrupted. Since there is only one pay day each week, it may happen that a person whose unemployment has been discontinuous, in the sense indicated, cannot be paid assistance on the first pay day following the termination of his employment, but in such a case payment is made on the next pay day of any arrears that have accured.</P>

      <P>The rate of wages for labourers employed on the Douglas River scheme was fixed at 26/- per week, which works out at the rate of 6½d. per hour, being the rate recently paid to workers on the neighbouring Goul scheme in the same county.

      <P>Any matter I raise always is to the point.  This Bill makes provision for a variety of things in connection with the Presidential election and the Money Resolution is to provide the money in connection with the expenses of putting the Bill into operation.  The point I wish to raise now was referred to by me at the end of the debate on the Second Reading. In Section 21, I think it is, the Minister will find that there is power there for the candidates to appoint agents, as is the practice at the ordinary Parliamentary elections.  On the last occasion I pointed out to the Vice-President that, if the Government wished that a man of note in this country, unconnected, say, with political Parties, should go up for election, there should be some machinery, other than the present method that is employed in Parliamentary elections, to cope with, say, personation.  It is absurd to expect that any ordinary citizen of this State, no matter how eminent, would be able to provide agents for a nation-wide or a Statewide election.  I presume that, in connection with the Presidential election, there will be at least as many booths as there were in the case of the last Parliamentary election.  They may not absolutely coincide&mdash;I do not know whether the Bill makes any provision for that; I do not think it does&mdash;but it is, I think the Vice-President will admit, altogether beyond the power of an individual who may think, or whose supporters may think, that he <Col N="422" /> has a good claim to be considered in connection with this high position, to provide agents to prevent personation. Even where you have a large number of candidates and a circumscribed area of election, such as a county or half a county, the Vice-President knows the extraordinary difficulty of preventing personation.  If there is personation on a large scale, as can easily happen unless effective steps are taken to prevent it, it makes the election of President ridiculous.  The result of an election held under these circumstances can claim in no sense to be the verdict of the people.</P>
      <P>When we had a State election before in connection with the election to the Seanad&mdash;we tried that on one occasion: with the full register&mdash;I think the general experience was that it was extremely difficult to cope with that particular abuse.  Now you are going in the case of this important election to leave it entirely to the devices of the candidate.  There is only one way to check personation, unless the State itself steps in and attends to that particular business of devising machinery to prevent personation, namely, that political Parties will do it.  I understood it was the intention of the Government as far as possible to remove this election from the realm of Party politics.  If they refuse to make proper provision for the prevention of personation, then they are insisting, as a practical issue, that this will be merely a struggle between Parties.  The only bodies who can then provide these agents&mdash;and they may find it difficult very often&mdash;will be the organised political Parties.  Remember, any Party whatsoever is capable of providing agents much more effectively than an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion the Vice-President said it was the duty of the Guards to take the initiative in preventing personation. I wonder whether that is actually a duty incumbent on the Guards?  I have never seen them act on it.  I have been told again and again in connection with elections that all the Guards are supposed to do is to deal with cases of personation brought to their particular notice, but it is the <Col N="423" /> business either of the returning officer or the personation agents to challenge those guilty, or whom they suspect to be guilty, of personation and then call the attention of the Guards to the matter.  The Vice-President will easily see that if the functions of the Guards begin and stop there, you have no effective control of personation in the absence of a full complement of personation agents.  I put it, therefore, to the Vice-President that provision should be made in this Bill or in the Money Resolution for expenses of that kind. We are told that this is the most honourable office in the State, that it is desirable to get men who will do honour to the position, who will not be too closely identified with Party politics, but unless effective steps are taken to see that there is a fair election, then the Government are handing it over completely into the hands of Party machines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Bill was before the House on Second Reading, I drew the attention of the Minister to Section 20, the section immediately preceding that just referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  The Minister promised to look into the matter, but I do not see any amendment down to it.  We are providing money in this Resolution for the carrying out of this election. Section 20 expresses a fear on the part of the Minister that the expenses in connection with the election may be excessive, and he inserts in sub-section (2) of the section what, on the face of it, is supposed to be a kind of corrective. That is, if the Minister for Finance wishes, he may bring the accounts of the returning officer before the Circuit Court judge who sits in that county and have them referred to the county registrar for examination.  On the face of it, that method appears too childish. It is no check whatever.  If we want to have a check, let us have a proper check.  In most cases, in fact in every county after some time, the position of sheriff, which has become redundant, will become merged in the office of county registrar, who will, therefore, be the returning officer.  The supposed corrective which the House is asked to <Col N="424" /> insert is, therefore, that if the Minister for Finance suspects that the expenses are too high, he is going to have the accounts referred to the Circuit Court judge who, in turn, will refer them to the returning officer for fixation.  That is not sensible.  I think when we are handling State moneys, when we are providing expenses for this purpose, if we feel that there is any need for security in this respect, we ought to insist on having a proper check on the figures and we should not insert a provision which provides no check at all.  If we do not want to have a check, we need take no steps of this kind, but if we want a check, let us insert some provision that is sensible.  The present provision is not sensible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, speaking for his Party, presumably, has shown a very great change of face in regard to the question of appointing personation agents. In the case of the election to the Seanad, the election to which he referred just now, the Government of the day, constituted then of the members of Deputy O'Sullivan's Party, took the step of definitely putting it into the Act that there should be no personation agents and decided that no law should be passed to enable candidates to appoint personation agents. I wonder what is the meaning of the change of face?  It is rather remarkable. At that time, at any rate no complaint could be made that those who were opposed to the then Government, and who are now Deputy O'Sullivan's political opponents here, were responsible for personation because they took no hand, act, or part in the election.  If there was personation it must have been done by the friends and followers of Deputy O'Sullivan himself.  The whole country will remember that, in general, not 25 per cent. of the electors of the country voted in that election, although in one famous constituency in some polling booths over 100 per cent. of the people on the register polled.  Can Deputy O'Sullivan explain that, and had that any connection with the statutory regulation which was made that no personation agent should be appointed? <Col N="425" /> We do not stand over nor do I think that any Deputy in this House&mdash;certainly any Minister&mdash;would consciously do anything that would promote or help to encourage personation. I believe that to be so now; it was not always so.  I think everybody in the House will agree that there is not anything like the personation attempted or practised nowadays that used to be practised.  I think that is true, from my experience. The number of charges in the courts after elections is evidence of the truth of what I say.  Personation is uncommon nowadays.  There are cases of it, but they are rare, either at general elections or by-elections.</P>

      <P>Yes.  They can challenge anybody whom they have reason to suspect is personating, and they do that.  They did it to my personal knowledge, under my own observation.  I do not see what other machinery would be available in an election of this kind.  I cannot see what arrangements could be made other than having the Guards in the booths to do their duty.  I have thought over the matter, and consulted with those who have experience in it, but other than the machinery provided at present by the law I cannot think of any more suitable, more efficient, arrangement.  Perhaps it is because Deputy O'Sullivan objects to the Guards doing it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is that in reality he still adheres to the policy <Col N="426" /> of his Party laid down in 1923 that there should not be anybody to stop personation.  The police are independent officers, and whatever views individuals may have of them they do their duty.  They do their duty at elections as well as at other times and I think it is the best machinery available.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Brennan, that machinery which is set out there for examination of the accounts is the same machinery that has always applied, and no case has ever arisen where there has not been adequate examination and adequate security for the proper discharge of their financial duties by the returning officers.  In the case of county registrars, they are civil servants, and we have a double hold over them to secure the proper discharge of their financial obligations. First of all, you have the Ministry of Finance, which overlooks their accounts and examines them very closely, and I do not think that any taxing officer who ever lived would give them more efficient scrutiny than they would get from the Department of Finance.  Then, as they are public moneys, you have the Comptroller and Auditor-General as the second check. I do not think the Deputy need have any doubt in his mind that if there is any suspicion whatsoever, or whether there is any suspicion or not, the accounts of the county registrars will be closely scrutinised and examined by not alone one authority but two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assures us that he has given thought to this matter.  I must say that I cannot see the result of any thought so far as his contribution here is concerned. He quoted certain examples in the 1923 Election, but in practice I say he is deliberately following that <Col N="427" /> example.  He said that there was personation in that 1923 Election, and, judging from the context of his statement, it was because there were no personating agents present.  I do the Minister the compliment of assuming that there was some connection between his different remarks.  If the Minister is displeased with my connecting his remarks, I will withdraw it, but I take it for granted, judging from the context of his statement as a whole, that he did suggest that the polling of over 100 per cent. in certain booths was due to the absence of personating agents.  He said there was not much personation in the recent election.  But there were personating agents representing every candidate&mdash;not merely a Guard&mdash;and I wonder does the Vice-President think that the presence of the Guard alone would be sufficient?  As a rule, I have not known the Guards actively to interfere and take the initiative in challenging.  There may have been cases of certain such obvious abuses as that of a person voting a dozen times, when the Guard did interfere, but in the ordinary cases of personation, it is my experience, at all events, and that of most of those to whom I have spoken on the matter, that the Guard does not take the initiative.  I should be glad if it were pointed out to them that they ought to take the initiative, and that it is their duty to prevent personating.  But what are you going to have in this election?  You will have an eminent person going forward, without a Party machine behind him.  He will have no personating agent, or very few.  The Minister must know the difficulty, in the height of a political campaign, for even organised Parties to get personating agents at every booth.  Now he is asking an individual to do it.  In fact, the story he told about a certain constituency, in which he says over 100 per cent. voted, is the ideal which he is in practice aiming at.  All I want is effective steps to see that there are people in the booth effectively to challenge personation.  The Minister has not dealt with the point.</P>

      <P>There is a very distinct change in the approach to the relationship between the presidential returning officer and the Clerk of the Dáil as compared with the position of that officer and a member of the Oireachtas.  The Vice-President thinks it desirable to provide here that the Presidential Returning Officer shall furnish a form of nomination paper to the member of the Oireachtas, but then the Bill goes on to say that he may, if he so thinks proper, furnish a supply of forms to the Clerk of the Dáil. What is the reason for the difference in the phraseology?  If it is thought desirable that the returning officer must give a form to the member of the Oireachtas, why should he not similarly be compelled to provide forms for the Clerk of the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister thinks it is desirable <Col N="431" /> to impose on the returning officer a statutory authority to make these forms available to the Clerk of the Dáil, then the best way is to put the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; into the section.  Otherwise, the position will be that the returning officer may, if he so chooses, supply forms, or he may decline to supply them.  The best way to ensure that he will supply them is to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I do not think the Minister has given any convincing reason against this amendment.  If it is desirable that these forms should be made available to the Clerk of the Dáil, then the best way is to put the statutory responsibility on the returning officer.</P>

      <P>Would the Ceann Comhairle give a reason for ruling out amendment No. 5, because, as I understood the situation, the law sets out what the power of a commissioner is in a county council?  The Constitution does not set it out, and my submission is that the Constitution is not putting any restriction on how the Oireachtas will lay down the law as to what constitutes a county council.  Presumably, if this amendment No. 5 were to be ruled out of order, if it were decided to group four county councils into one in years to come, or to make any other alteration, it might be held that it was unconstitutional and could not be done. In this case, where it is proposed to alter the law permitting the commissioner to exercise the rights given in the Constitution to county councils as such, it might be held that that would not be in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of amendment No. 4 is not to give the commissioners <Col N="434" /> the wide powers which it is sought to give them in connection with this Bill.  I am not at all challenging the right, nor is Deputy Brennan challenging the right, of county councils or borough councils to make nominations; but we are challenging the right of a commissioner appointed for a specific purpose to interfere in the affairs of a Presidential election.  I submit that when Article 12 of the Constitution was being drafted, there was no indication that such a situation would have arisen.  Indeed, that was made clear on the last day here, when the Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not seem to know what the precise legal position of the commissioner was vis-a-vis this Presidential election.  I submit, Sir, that it was a very rigid ruling to say that an amendment of this kind is out of order, because the amendment does not challenges the right of the county council to make nominations.  It only challenges the right of the person appointed to function on behalf of a county council, in certain limited ways, to interfere in the affairs of Presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that if this amendment were accepted it would be in the power of the Oireachtas to define the duties of commissioners. Ruling out this amendment suggests that it will not be in their power to define these duties.  I suggest that if for a time the commissioner must have the functions of county councillors this is not going to mean that he is to have these functions in connection with Presidential elections under the Constitution.  It is a suggested amendment of the law and this is the place to suggest an amendment of the law.  We cannot bring in an amending Local Government Bill at this particular time.  The only method of implementing the Constitution just now is by way of bringing in this amendment here.  It is not changing the Constitution, but it is limiting the powers of the commissioner.  The more ordinary procedure would be by the method of an amending Bill to the Local Government code and to lay down there what are the powers and <Col N="435" /> what are not the powers of the commissioners. But it is impossible to do that at the moment, and this now is the only course open to the Oireachtas so far as this Presidential election is concerned. I would respectfully ask the Ceann Comhairle not to adhere to what is such a rigid ruling, because I gathered on the last day that the sense of the House was that the commissioner should not have this particular power.  I do not know that the Minister who is in charge of this Bill had really any objection then to that point of view.  I really think he had not and that he was sympathetic towards it.</P>

      <P>There is one particular point to which I should like to draw attention.  It is laid down in the Constitution that 20 members of the Oireachtas may nominate the President, but if consideration is not given to this Bill it may mean that four commissioners may exercise powers similar to the powers exercised by 20 members of the Oireachtas, including the members of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>It was observed by Deputy Norton that when Article 12 of the Constitution was under consideration the difficulty relating to the powers of commissioners was not adverted to.  It has been stated by Deputy O'Sullivan that he does not seek to amend the local government law by this Bill; it would not be legitimate to do so.  As to the point made by Deputy Norton that certain matters were not adverted to, it is quite possible that matters relating to other phases of legislation may arise similarly. Is it suggested that as regards all statutes that are affected in any of the Bills introduced to implement the Constitution, the law in respect of these should be amended in such implementing Bills?  I do not think it is within the scope of this measure, the sole purpose of which is to implement some provisions of the Constitution, to amend the Local Government code or to seek to define or limit the powers of the commissioners.  If a one-clause Bill were introduced to achieve the purpose <Col N="436" /> aimed at in the Deputy's amendment it would be a very different matter.  It would thus be done expressly and apart from this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this point to you, Sir&mdash;this Bill will become law before the amending Bill to which you have referred can become law.  When the Oireachtas passes an Act giving such powers, there is naturally a reluctance to withdraw the powers by another Bill. However, that particular procedure may be open to a certain amount of objection.  The position would be that we would have endowed the commissioners with certain powers and that we would then suddenly withdraw these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the provisions of the Constitution and, therefore, I submit that we are fully entitled to amend them and that any amendment or any provision that is necessary to secure what the House thinks a proper method of conducting the Presidential election is in order because this is a Bill to implement the Constitution.  I take it it ought to take priority over any other Bills.  If the House is of opinion that this is not a proper method of amending the Constitution, I suggest that it is within the competence of the House to put into this Bill provisions that will amend the Constitution in the way that the House wants it amended and not in the way it does not want it amended.  I did not hear any attack yet on the provisions of this amendment and, on the last day here, I took it for granted that the House, if it had the power was not to be debarred from using it; that the House if it wished to amend the Constitution could do so by certain sections dealing with the Constitution in this way.  I submit that nothing should stand in the way of that being fully done and that if, incidentally, we have in this way to cut across other Acts, that is the normal thing to do because we are merely doing what we are bound to do by the Constitution. This House passed a Constitution.  It must proceed to the implementing of it and other Acts cannot hold up the manner in which that work is to be <Col N="437" /> done by the Dáil if the Dáil thinks it should be done in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should make some contribution to this debate with a view to clearing up the position which is likely to arise under the section.  It is clear that if two commissioners exercise jurisdiction in place of two county councils they will be able to nominate a candidate for the Presidency. These commissioners may be two civil servants responsible to the Minister.  That is a situation which, apparently, we are to allow to go through in all its nakedness in this Bill without any serious effort to remedy it.  Commissioners have certain functions in regard to the normal activities of county and borough councils and, in this Bill, we ought not to allow them such a meandering power as to go right into a Presidential election and nominate a candidate so as to prevent an election being uncontested even if every Party in the State desires that it should be non-contested. That situation was not adverted to when the Constitution was being discussed and I think the Minister should make some effort to deal with the position which is likely to arise if this Bill goes through in its present form. Otherwise, there is only one course for members who do not want this kind of farce to go through to adopt&mdash;that is, to vote against the section and knock out this novel provision whereby county councils have the right to nominate a candidate for the Presidency even though their powers are exercised by commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that 20 members of this House represent about 140,000 voters, on the basis of 7,000 for each member. That is provided for in another Act. If the Minister thinks that 140,000 votes should be required to nominate a Senator in this way, he ought to be very chary about allowing commissioners the same authority.  If we cannot get this provision corrected, we ought to wipe out the section altogether and provide some substitute method. It is farcical to allow a couple of commissioners <Col N="438" /> the same right which is accorded to 140,000 voters.</P>

      <P>It is certainly not my desire that any commissioner or commissioners should be in a position to interfere in a Presidential election because they happen to be in administrative control of certain counties. That is not the wish of the Government nor is it my wish and, apparently, it is not the wish of the House.  Before the Second Reading of this Bill, and since then, I have considered the matter and I have asked various law officers to consider it.  I have also had conveyed to me the views of the Ceann Comhairle.  When we were on the Second Reading, I was put a number of questions.  I had my own views&mdash; which, I think, were in accord with the views expressed here to-night&mdash;on the question as to whether commissioners should have this power or not but, because of the differences I had found amongst the lawyers, I did not say very much.  I knew that there would be other opportunities.  I had in mind that I could produce an amendment on Committee Stage.  I had an amendment drafted but, when the views of the Ceann Comhairle were conveyed to me, I had to drop my amendment.  I shall discuss the matter again with the Ceann Comhairle and, if he sees fit to accept an amendment, I should be prepared to put it down. I should be very happy to amend the section if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other way of dealing with the position&mdash;that is, to amend the local government law, which I am quite prepared to do.  It was never intended that commissioners should have this power and I do not think that, even if the power were given, any reasonable or sensible man would attempt to use it.  However, that is beside the question.  It is better&mdash;I think it is the view of the House generally&mdash;that the power should not be there if it can be avoided.  If it is not found possible, after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle, to bring in an amendment which would meet his views on the question of constitutionality, I promise the House that, before Christmas if possible, I shall bring in a Bill&mdash;as nearly a one-clause Bill as possible&mdash;so to amend the law of local <Col N="439" /> government that commissioners will not have power to take part in Presidential elections.</P>

It is a pity that he did not think of introducing it in sufficient time for circulation.  Yesterday was rather short notice to give the House of an important amendment, after consulting all these warring lawyers.  We have, however, the promise of the Minister so far as the main issue is concerned.  We are deliberately passing a provision which nobody wants.

I should be going outside my province were I to indicate to what extent I agree with Deputies in that respect.  To alter and amend the provisions of other Acts in implementing the provisions of the Constitution is not, to my mind, correct procedure. If it is desired to amend the local government code, as suggested by the Minister, it is quite feasible.  I have not seen the amendment to which the Minister refers.

Is that a possibility? Is it possible that the Minister may be told, when he seeks to amend the Local Government Act, that not only must he do it there, but he must come back to the House and do it in this Bill?

      <P>There is another point with regard to this section.  Sub-section (7) states:</P>
      <P>Where the Presidential Returning Officer receives from the council of a county or a county borough two or more nomination papers, regular on their face and relating to the same election, all such nomination papers shall be invalid and shall be disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister a possibility which might occur of a valid nomination paper being sent by a county council to a returning officer and subsequently a practical joker, or a person desirous of having that nomination paper declared invalid, going to the trouble of having another nomination paper for another individual signed and sent in.  In that case, even though it were subsequently discovered that the paper was faked, the returning officer, as the section is drawn, would be bound to declare both nomination papers invalid.  We had here many years ago a description of quite a number of incidents that happened in the world when very important personages were taken in by practical jokers, and in this case, if such a practice were indulged in by anyone, I can see no means, as the clause is drawn, of allowing the valid nomination paper to stand.  I presume that the reason for the insertion of this clause was that a county council is not entitled to rescind its decision to sign a nomination paper on behalf of a candidate, but as a loop hole for a county council, if it desires to interfere it can pass a resolution putting up another candidate and then both fall.  While steps may be taken to allow for a change of mind, I think that where a county council has made up its mind and taken the necessary action, it ought not to be at the mercy of some evilly disposed person or a person with a bent for practical <Col N="443" /> joking whereby its decision with respect to a nomination may be destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that if what Deputy Cosgrave has suggested may happen&mdash;and some things of the kind have happened in the past, as he knows and I know&mdash;it would not be possible for a person wishing to send in a faked paper so to complete the nomination paper that, with all the other things necessary, it would bear the seal of the county council. Section 9 (3) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every such nomination paper ...sealed with the seal of such county council and delivered or sent by post to the presidential returning officer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think there is a safeguard there against a fake nomination but there might be two nomination papers sent by a county council.  That is the possibility, that perhaps at the first meeting there was not a majority of the members present, although properly notified, and that another meeting was called and a second nomination paper properly filled up and sealed.  In that case what could the returning officer do?  He will have power later, in conjuction with the judicial assessor, to make all the inquiries necessary to satisfy himself that the nomination is valid.  Into every matter that he thinks proper it is open to him to inquire, and to examine the candidate or the agent upon it.  If there are two nomination papers, and if both of them on their face are valid, I cannot see what the presidential returning officer can do with these two papers but to reject both.</P>

      <P>There is a little word for which the Minister expressed a great liking some time ago, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Perhaps if he inserted &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; at the end of sub-section (7) it would not be so disagreeable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite subscribe to what the Minister said about the seal of a borough council or a county <Col N="444" /> council, but it will be within recollection that within the past ten years in Great Britain a gentleman entered into voluntary possession of the seal of a county council for the issue of stock, and that huge quantities of stock were issued.  That is not an easy thing to do.  But it was done. It is possible nowadays, if a person could make one seal that he could make two.  That might happen.  What I am at here is, that where there is a valid nomination paper from a county council, and authorised by law, that nomination ought not be, by any machinery or by implication, declared invalid.</P>

      <P>If there are two valid papers from a county council, what is the presidential returning officer to do?  It is within the bounds of possibility, in the way I suggest, that in a county council there might be two different sets of men, and that within a fortnight the council might come to two different decisions and validly nominate two persons.  What is the presidential returning officer to do then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not meet the case if the words in sub-section (7), line 3, &ldquo;on their face&rdquo; were deleted?  If the sub-section read:</P>
      <P>Where the presidential returning officer receives from the council of a county or a county borough two or more nomination papers regular...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>it would then become a question as to whether the second paper was in fact regular.  If it was regular it would operate to invalidate the first paper. Where on investigation it transpired that, although the second paper was on the face of it regular, but was in fact irregular, the first paper would stand. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to secure.  We all agree that a county council could on a &ldquo;snap&rdquo; division nominate one person, while the entire county council at a subsequent meeting might wish to undo that.  It is <Col N="445" /> a good thing that there should be machinery whereby they could do so. It would be highly undesirable to allow a practical joker or a forgery to destroy the nomination of a county council, and the course I suggest to the Minister would provide for that contingency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister envisaged a case where there are two papers, apparently valid, and he then asked what was the returning officer to do.  I thought we would be told what the returning officer would do.  I gather, if there are two nomination papers, that on their face are valid, the returning officer is precluded almost from making investigation.  He must decide. While his investigation might lead him to say that one was a forgery, and the other not, still there is no remedy. Surely that is absurd.</P>

      <P>There could not very well be, as Deputy Dillon suggested, a snap division, because there must be seven days' notice of motion given to the members of the county council, but members who might not attend in sufficient numbers in the first instance, on seeing who had been nominated, might later desire to have a special meeting of the county council called, at which a full attendance might reverse that decision and have another ballot paper.  Both papers on their face are valid containing all the machinery necessary, signatures and seals.</P>

      <P>An interesting point arises in this connection, Sir, because the usual procedure is that the Chair does say that he rules out a particular amendment on the grounds that it is out of order for the following reasons, and so on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Sir, the Ceann Comhairle did communicate with me but the communication itself was not very clear.  However I should like to know how this amendment is outside the scope of the Bill.  After all, the Constitution presented us with these Presidential elections naked, as you might say, and we are entitled to clothe them with something.  Nobody anticipated that we would be so precluded from discussing the ways and means of getting a President or anybody else elected as we now appear to be.  If this were in conflict with the Constitution or in conflict with the Bill, or if it imposed unnecessary restrictions upon anybody, there would be something to be said for ruling it out, but I think the House is entitled to know how that ruling has been made and how the Ceann Comhairle or anybody else has arrived at the decision that that amendment is outside the scope of the Bill.  It is simply an attempt to prevent a person, who had been President of this country and who was impeached and ceased to be President, from renominating himself and imposing upon this country a very costly contest.  Surely the House is entitled at least to do the sensible thing in these matters and to endeavour to save the country from such a situation as that.  I am sorry that the Ceann Comhairle is not in the Chair at the moment, but I should like to know how he has decided that this is in conflict either with the Bill or the Constitution.</P>

      <P>That is a new point which would raise a very wide question. If that were the ruling of the Chair, we would have to press very strongly to have the matter reviewed. I do not care to argue this hypothetically, but if such a ruling were made it would then appear that the Chair took to itself the function of determining whether legislation of this House was in accord with the Constitution. Of course, it was clearly envisaged when the State was established, and at all times since, that the constitutionality of any Act should be determined by the High Court, specially constituted for the purpose.  Therefore, I do not think the Chair would adhere to the view that the amendment should be rejected and discussion on it forbidden, because it appears to the Chair that, in the event of that amendment being inserted, the Act when passed would be declared unconstitutional. That would go quite beyond the province of the rules of order, and <Col N="454" /> create a very dangerous precedent indeed, restricting freedom of discussion in this House.</P>

Section 12 says that at 12 o'clock on that day he is to proceed, at a place which will be named and will, presumably be in Dublin, to do certain things.

That has been remedied and the Court of Criminal Appeal can now say that, although there was a technical slip in the indictment, if substantial justice has been done the conviction shall stand.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words from the word &ldquo;during,&rdquo; line 29, to the end of sub-section (2), and substitute the words &ldquo;by informing the councils or county borough councils responsible for his nomination or the members of the Oireachtas who nominated him not later than three days after the said <Col N="462" /> candidate has been declared to have been validly nominated, and such candidate shall also serve notice in writing on the returning officer that he has so withdrawn within the said three days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We think, Sir, it is necessary that some time should be given after nominations in which you might have withdrawals.  There does not seem to be any sense in compelling a man who has been nominated to stick to his nomination.  If he desires to withdraw it he ought to be given an opportunity to do so.  For instance, a man might very well have agreed to his nomination, but, possibly two days afterwards, when publication of all the names was made, he saw that he had not an earthly chance, and I think it only right that he should be given a chance to withdraw.  That is the real purpose of this amendment, and I should like if the Minister would accept it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is not insisting on it, I would suggest to the Minister that it ought to be deleted. Suppose a man wants to withdraw. Suppose he has been nominated by four councils.  In order to withdraw, under the Deputy's draft proposal, he should address a letter to the Presidential returning officer and to the four councils.  Under the draft proposal, if he addressed the Presidential returning officer and three of the councils, omitting the fourth, his withdrawal would be invalid.  Therefore, I would suggest that his obligation should be to address his withdrawal to the Presidential returning officer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in introducing the amendment, said that a situation might arise in which a candidate found himself up against such formidable competition that he would abandon all hopes.  Another case might arise.  All Parties agree that it would be desirable in these Presidential elections if an agreed candidate could be found who would have the common support of the whole State. A situation might arise where four candidates were put up, one of whom <Col N="464" /> stood out as acceptable to all sides. There ought to be time for negotiation to try and induce the other three candidates, in the public interest, to withdraw, to avoid contest and have a unanimous election.  With only two days, and three candidates to approach, the matter might be very difficult. One might say &ldquo;I will withdraw if the other two will also do so,&rdquo; and by the time the whole three were approached four or five days might have elapsed.  I admit that argument might be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It might be used to argue for a week's extension, but one has to be as reasonable as one can. The Deputy has said three days.  I am prepared to agree to three days. It certainly is an argument against insisting on informing the county councils.</P>

What Deputy Dillon says is quite correct as to the likelihood of the situation being eased perhaps, and agreement got from one candidate to withdraw if there was sufficient time. Might not the time work the other way?  Might there not also be people endeavouring to insist on a man going forward?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that the Minister would reflect on this for himself. <Col N="465" /> I can conceive a situation arising where four candidates were put forward.  When the provincial and national Press came to be persued in the course of the following week, a kind of general public sentiment would express itself that one candidate is the best man.  That would have a powerful effect on the other candidates. They might say. &ldquo;It is obvious that the whole country is swinging towards one man, and we will make a better show for ourselves if we get out and support him.&rdquo;  That takes time, and unless there is some special reason for haste, I would incline to seven days in order to give the entire provincial Press an opportunity of making public opinion felt.  At the end of seven days, if they wanted to go into the contest they would know what the public opinion was.  As we grow older in politics in this country, public opinion will probably manifest itself strongly towards the avoidance of complicated contests.  I would ask the Minister to turn the matter over in his mind, and if he can see his way to giving seven days, I would prefer seven days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this danger, that if you do not admit the Press you may have tendentious allegations made by the representatives of one candidate or another that there was an irregularity committed in favour of one particular candidate.  That candidate comes forward and loudly protests that there was no irregularity.  The presiding officer is restricted to a formal repudiation of such an allegation, and it is a case of one man's word against another's.  If the Press are present, and report accurately the proceedings as they saw them, it rather lifts the whole business out of the realm of accusation and counter-accusation, and other things which might arise if the Press were not there.</P>

On this Section 20 I might point out that the sub-section casts a certain amount of doubt upon the integrity of the returning officers. Now, I do not want it to go forth that I was finding any fault whatever as regards the integrity or honesty of the <Col N="470" /> returning officers.

      <P>(3) Wherever in any case a local agent, from any cause, is unable or unwilling to act, a candidate may request the local returning officer to appoint a member of the Gárda Síochána to act either in place of such local agent or until such local agent takes up his duties and on being so requested such local returning officer shall appoint a member of the Gárda Síochána in place of such local agent.</P>
      <P>I think we have had so much discussion on the matter of personation during the earlier stages of this Bill that there is little need for me to draw the Minister's attention to the matter just now.  I do not know whether what I suggest in this amendment is possible in the form in which the amendment is worded.  But I suggest that something should be done to ensure, if personating agents are not there, that somebody will be appointed to look after the work.  I am sure nobody wants people to vote &ldquo;early and often&rdquo; except Deputy Tom Kelly. Some machinery should be set up and put into operation that would prevent personation taking place.</P>

It is not additional presiding officers or clerks that are required, but extra Gárdaí who would be able to prevent people not entitled to vote, voting. What is needed are Gárdaí who would have been stationed for some time in the area and who would know the people.  Personally I would like to see personating agents turned out of the booths altogether, and let the Gárdaí deal with personation.  It would be much more satisfactory.

      <P>(Senior): Would it be worth while to put a uniformed Gárda <Col N="472" /> at every table and so make some effort to stop personation?  There are people in this House who believe it can be stopped by getting the Gárdaí to deal with personation.  Personally I do not think you can ever get a true return in Ireland until the election machinery is so changed that before a man is allowed to vote he must produce to the presiding officer definite evidence of identification.  I believe that personation could be brought to an end if the voter had to come along with his photograph in the same way as in the case of a passport, and if the presiding officer were furnished beforehand with the signature of the voter.  The officer could, if he thought fit, ask the voter to sign his name there and then at the table, and that could be compared with the signature that had been previously handed in.  Otherwise I do not think personation will ever be stopped.  I am aware that some members of this House have stated that personation is not really wrong-doing. I know that a great deal of it went on during the last election.  If it had not gone on there are people in this House who would not be here now.  I personally think, as things stand at present, that the Guards will be the chief hope in preventing it; but unless the House adopts the idea that the person must prove his right to get a vote by being made to sign his name at the table, it will be impossible to entirely stop personation.</P>

I never have seen a Gárdaí challenging personation.  If they did, the present procedure is cumbersome.  It should be in the power of the Gárdaí to take down a list of the people who, they believe, have personated, and they could be proceeded against afterwards. Under the present arrangements that is impossible.  There is one <Col N="474" /> man in the booth, let us say, and he challenges and arrests a person who is attempting personation.  If he leaves the booth with his prisoner, is there not then an open door for everybody to personate?</P>

      <P>On the section, the Minister will notice that sub-section (2) reproduces a provision which occurs in the ordinary electoral laws requiring that every ballot paper shall have a number printed on the back and shall have attached a counterfoil with the same number printed on the face. After every general election, the Minister will have noticed that correspondence appears in the papers regarding this matter.  Somebody says that this constitutes a violation of the secrecy of the ballot and asks if it is not possible that his vote can be tracked down.  The difficulty of doing that would be immense, but, theoretically, it is possible.  The effect that that can have in rural Ireland is considerable. An unscrupulous person can threaten a voter in rural parts of the country that the way he voted will be discovered, and that, if he voted in the wrong way, then his old age pension or his housing grant will be taken from him or he will be victimised in some other way.  Many cases of that kind have come to my notice.  I <Col N="475" /> have told these people, as I have no doubt the Minister would tell them, that, in practice, there is no possibility of anybody discovering how they voted.  But it does give rise to anxiety in the minds of many people.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what necessity there is for numbering the paper. If there is no good reason why it should be done, why not abandon the practice altogether?</P>

Riot and violence might obtain at 11 o'clock in the morning, and a person might be prevented from going to the poll.  The returning officer's attention might be directed to the conditions, and he might obtain adequate force to suppress the riot, so that everybody would have an opportunity of polling.

The Minister said he thought it would, and stated that in his experience he was satisfied it would.  We are now asked to vote money in order to pay the expenses of this commission to do a job which we all know it is unable to do; that is, to inquire into and to ascertain from time to time the prices of various commodities and to determine whether reasonable prices were being asked or not.  I want to demonstrate to the House that it is impossible for the commission to do so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the whole resources of the Department, set himself the task of doing that, and set out to ascertain so simple a fact as the price of bran.  Mind you, this commission will only have the support of its own officials&mdash;a very restricted number of persons&mdash;while the Minister had the support of the entire Department of Industry and Commerce, and set out to ascertain the price of bran.</P>

The Minister's reply was that it would control prices, and that he was providing machinery to get all requisite information effectively to do so.  I am saying that it cannot do so.  It has a certain limited personnel.  I am going to show the House that the Minister, with the unlimited personnel of the entire Department of Industry and Commerce could not ascertain the price of one commodity, much less ascertain the prices of all commodities, and that as the commission has a very restricted personnel it makes the expenditure of this money wholly nugatory.

The contention is that certain Government machinery under the Minister cannot do a certain thing.  He is now setting up other machinery, as he has failed up to the present to do it. Deputy Dillon is suggesting that there is no possibility of this machinery justifying the expenditure which will be incurred, seeing that much more elaborate machinery in the hands of the Minister has failed in the case of one commodity.  I submit that it is perfectly relevant to argue from that that the House ought not to pass a Money Resolution of this kind, because it is futile to expect this, that a smaller body can succeed where a much more elaborate instrument failed.  In <Col N="485" /> that case surely it is relevant to this Money Resolution to say so.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion, when we were discussing at length the price of one simple commodity, the price of bran, the Minister said he had foreseen before he came to the House that he would be questioned about the price of bran.  Foreseeing that, he made full inquiry.  It was not a case of being taken suddenly unawares, or relying on his memory, but foreseeing that he was going to be questioned, he turned prominent officials of the State on to the task of getting into touch with every centre in England, and made most exhaustive investigations in Ireland, so as to be fully fortified, and, as a result of the investigations, he discovered the price of bran in various centres in Great Britain fluctuated from £7 10s. to £7 15s., and the price of pollard approximately the same.  He investigated prices in Saorstát Eireann, and was informed that the price of bran in Ireland was £6 10s. per ton.  I want the House most carefully to note what happened and to remember that the entire resources of the Minister for Industry and Commerce were invoked, and yet their collective leg was pulled by one miller who made the unfortunate Minister get up and make a public fool of himself. On the day in question the Minister assured the House that the price was £6 10s. ex-mill in this country.  I had in my hand the current quotation for bran from Irish millers which was fixed by the millers' ring and it was £7 10s. per ton ex-mill.  I produce the current price list of the Irish mills.  I did not quote it carriage paid.  I quoted the price, ex-mill.  I produce the current price list of another milling company, the National Flour Mills, Ltd., Victoria Quay, Cork:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;6th October, 1937.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our prices for flour offals this day are as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;National Choice&rsquo; (Blended Bakers'), 51/-; &lsquo;National Super-Strength&rsquo; (Strong Bakers'), 52/6.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> They then give the prices of retail flour and quote white bran at £8 10s. per ton, mixed bran, £8 a ton; white pollard, £8 15s. a ton, and mixed pollard, £8 10s. a ton.  All prices are ex-mill Cork, due nett in one month, subject to discounts of 4d. in the £ for payment within seven days, 3d. in the £ within 14 days, and 2d. in the £ within 21 days.  The letter proceeds: &ldquo;Your esteemed orders will receive prompt attention.&rdquo;  The Minister, of course, is not familiar with conditions obtaining in rural Ireland. He is a man who has lived all his life in the City of Dublin, and, as I said in this House on another occasion, he would not know one end of a cow from another.  He allowed himself to be fooled by a miller, who told him that he was prepared to deliver red bran at £6 10s. a ton ex-mill.</P>
    <P>There is an infinitesimal percentage, perhaps 7 per cent., of the total bran consumed in this country sold in North County Dublin by two mills in the city as red bran.  All the rest of the red bran in this country is sold as mixed bran.  It is put through white bran and sold by some mills as mixed bran, but by most mills as plain bran.  The Victoria Quay Mills, the National Flour Mills, Ltd., charge £8 10s. a ton for white bran, and for mixed bran they charge £8 ex-mill.</P>

The price at Portarlington is £7 10s., ex-mill, for bran&mdash;just bran&mdash;and nobody can say what proportion of red bran is in that, and what proportion of white bran is in it.  But that is not all.  I will quote not only the millers' quotations, but I am now going to quote figures taken from the Minister's own publication. In the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> the prices are set out for white bran, red bran and pollard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's contention, in the course of his speech, was that the prices of these offals had been consistently lower in the Irish Free State than they were in Great Britain. Is not that right?  We must note most carefully that these monthly prices here are, I think, retail prices in quantities from several centres in the Saorstát, and from them we must subtract about 10/- a ton for freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. I say that there is no comparison between the average retail prices in the towns of the Saorstát and the ex-factory prices in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister accept the 10/- a ton for freight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the price in Cork is the same as in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that we want to allow 10/- a ton for freight, and 3d. or 6d. a cwt. for profit.  That will reduce the price I have given by about 1/-. When we do that we find that the price of red bran in this country was approximately 7/- ex-mill, according to the Minister's figures published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> in June, 1937. The price in Great Britain for the same bran in June, 1937, was 6/10½, 1½d. less than the price obtaining in Saorstát Eireann.  The point that I desire particularly to emphasise is this: that the Minister, in the course of his argument here, stated not that the price of bran was £6 10s. Od. ex-mill in Dublin but he stated the following at column 271, vol. 69, No. 3 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: I knew that Deputy Dillon would contradict that, so I <Col N="489" /> took the trouble this morning to get the officers of my Department to telephone to all the principal centres in Great Britain and in this country in order to find out the price of bran to-day.  The price of red bran to-day is £6 10s. Od. per ton&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;That is the price at which I was offered it this morning.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not reading a continuous sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Cosgrave: If you could get it.  I sent to four places myself for a small quantity and I could not get it.</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: The price is £6 10s. Od. per ton.  That is the price at which I was offered it this morning. The price in London is £7 5s. 0d. per ton; Liverpool, £7 10s. 0d.; Cardiff, £7 12s. 6d.  The price of red pollard in Dublin is £7 5s. 0d. per ton; in London it is £8 5s. 0d.; Liverpool, £8 7s. 6d., and in Cardiff, £8 12s. 6d.  These are the prices to-day.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: And the Irish miller's price to-day is £8 per ton and the worst of it is the Irish miller has not got it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then passed from the subject of bran, but observe that the Minister says that he telephoned to all the principal centres in Ireland to ascertain the price of bran, and the fruit of his inquiry was that he was satisfied that the price of bran consumed throughout rural Ireland was £6 10s. 0d. a ton.  If he approached all the centres, and, with all the resources of his Department at his disposal, accepted that as the true state of affairs, then he allowed his leg to be pulled in the most unmerciful way, because anybody who knew anything about the trade would have told him that, outside a very restricted area in North County Dublin, red bran is not consumed by the Irish feeder at all. Very few people will buy it at all, and in fact you find that the big national flour mills in Cork do not offer it; they offer a mixed bran and they offer <Col N="490" /> a white bran, and all the other mills just offer bran which, according to my belief, is mixed bran containing red and white.  The net result of it all is that, in fact, the price of bran, as consumed by the rural community in feeding to their live stock, ranges between £7 10s. in the Midlands up to £8 10s. per ton ex-mill, according to the style and quality of the bran, but the price which the Minister was persuaded to offer to this House as the true price for bran was £6 10s. If that is the best we can hope to get as a result of Ministerial or Departmental inquiries into prices of commodities, then I say that it is waste of time to set up a commission&mdash;a commission with a far smaller staff than that of the one already existing&mdash; to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I may say, Sir, that all I have said with regard to bran applies with equal force to pollard; and it is typical of the attitude of any body of men who are trying to exploit the consuming community that it is in their interest to prevaricate and to mislead, so far as they can, any body or any authority which desires to restrict them in making the largest profits they desire to make.  Deputy Dowdall explained the position the other day.  The attitude of these people, said Deputy Dowdall in effect, was: &ldquo;When you get a tariff you should try to make the most out of it that you can, and, if you do not do so, you are a fool.&rdquo; Naturally, when the Minister tries to cross-hackle them with a view to forcing them to take less profits in bran or pollard or anything else, they will immediately resort to any expedient to fool and mislead the Minister, and if they can induce him to get up in this House and attach his name to the statement that the price of bran is £6 10s. per ton, then they know that, by doing so, they purchase immunity from any further interference because it becomes the Minister's personal concern to persuade the public that the price of bran is not excessive, that he has investigated the matter, and that he is satisfied that the price is quite all right.</P>
    <P>Once that has happened, they know that they can then go on and collect, as they are collecting at the present <Col N="491" /> moment, from the consumers of this country, from £7 10s. to £8 10s., and the Minister gets up in this House and says that the price is £6 10s.&mdash;that that is the truth, and that so long as it is the truth it is all right.  I can tell the Minister that 90 per cent. or 95 per cent. of those who buy bran in this country are paying from £7 10s. to £8 10s., but the Minister says that the price is £6 10s. and that that is a reasonable price.  I have no doubt that the commission, when it is set up, will come out with similar reports; but every member of the agricultural community in this country knows that, no matter what the Minister or the Prices Commission say, they have to pay from £7 10s. to £8 10s.  That is what matters to the average small farmer in this country&mdash;not what the Minister says is true, but what the small farmer finds to be true when he goes to spend the money which he has for spending.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, Sir, that the money we are going to give the Prices Commission in order to enable them to carry on the farce which has been going on for the past five years will be frittered away, and that the reports we will get from the commission will resemble for veracity the nonsense that was talked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few days ago about so simple a commodity as bran.  In so far as that is so, I believe that every penny voted and every penny spent under this Financial Resolution will be so much money thrown away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has spent so much time, Sir, getting around this matter, that it would be wise, perhaps, to bring him back to the period that he is so anxious to bring in again. Deputy Dillon's whole idea in those attacks here, day after day and week after week, on all Irish industries, has only one object, and one object only, namely, to close down the industries and get back to the happy days when everything we ate and everything we used in this country had to be produced by the foreigner.  I have been looking back and trying to get a period that would be on a par with the present <Col N="492" /> period in so far as the price of imported wheat is concerned.  That would be the period of 1925 and 1926.  Imported wheat was then in or around its present price of 30/- per barrel.  We found at that period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understood Deputy Dillon's argument to be that we were setting up machinery which would be ineffective for the purposes for which the machinery was being set up, and therefore voting money for machinery that would be ineffective.  He instanced what he alleged was the ineffectiveness of the present machinery that was set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce, which had a larger staff and wider ramifications than the machinery which is now proposed to be set up, and he proceeded to discuss the Money Resolution on that basis.  Now, the prices of imported wheat and other articles at an earlier period does not arise on that Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that those who know this country know that the price of bran has a very definite relation to the price of wheat, and I have endeavoured to get to the direct period in which the price of wheat would compare with the price to-day, and to find what price bran was when imported at the period as compared with the alleged profiteering price at present, in connection with which Deputy Dillon has spent two hours here in vilifying the millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the effectiveness of the machinery that is proposed to be set up, and Deputy Dillon, in connection with the actual price of the commodity concerned, was discussing the effectiveness <Col N="493" /> of the machine and whether we should spend money on a machine which he alleged to be ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I intend proving that it would be effective.  That machine&mdash;even the partial machine that has been in operation up to the present&mdash;has brought about this result: that the price of imported flour at the period of which I speak, when imported wheat was the same price as at present, was from 52/- to 53/- as compared with 51/- at present; and that of imported bran, about which Deputy Dillon apparently is so anxious, we imported, in 1926, 254, 703 cwts. and we paid £115,757, or roughly 9/2 per cwt. or £9 odd per ton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument, Sir, is going to show that the partial machine that has been set up at present to control Irish industries and to control prices has resulted in the price of bran, instead of being what it was when it was being imported from the foreigner and when we had no control&mdash;that is, £9 odd per ton&mdash;is now, even using Deputy Dillon's own argument, only from £7 10s. 0d. to £8 10s. 0d.  That is an improvement, and if the Department succeeded in bringing the price down that much under the old machinery they set up, then the new machinery will succeed in bringing the price down further, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps, and it is better at any rate than Deputy Dillon's anxiety that, no matter what we pay to the foreigner it is all right, but if a commodity is made or produced in Ireland, then there must be something wrong with it, just as there is something wrong with Deputy Dillon <Col N="494" /> himself&mdash;something of the same kind, but I suppose you cannot expect anything else out of anti-Irish Irishmen. I did not come in to delay the House, only to place these few figures before them and let them judge for themselves. I gave the price of wheat in 1925 and 1926&mdash;30/-, the same as to-day. I gave the price of imported flour in 1926 as compared with to-day and the price of imported bran in 1926 as compared with our home product to-day.  Deputy Dillon can compare these for himself and if he has any sympathy for the small farmers he talked about, he can thank God that for the last three or four years there was an Irish Government not alone to produce these things at home, but to reduce the price comparatively for the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being very familiar with parliamentary practice, I suffered from the delusion coming in here that this particular discussion was on a question of finance&mdash;in fact, a Money Resolution.  I further suffered from the delusion that this Control of Prices Bill would be, in the parlance of the man in the street, what we would term a bread-and-butter Bill. But I have been very much disappointed, particularly by Deputy Dillon.  On the last occasion this particular Bill was debated we were treated to a lot of cross-talk between Deputy Dillon and the Minister for Industry and Commerce concerning the price of commodities such as bran, bakers' flour, and so forth, with which I suggest, the majority of the people, generally speaking, are not very much concerned.  We were, in fact, treated to a visit to the Himalayas, Czechoslovakia, and even to parts of Spain. In fact, Deputy Dillon definitely disappointed me to-day, because I fully expected him to finish his tour around Europe by giving a demonstration of how he had a fan dance in Spain with some Spanish senorita.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce endeavouring, if I may say so, to pull the wool over some of our eyes by doing something in the nature of the threecard trick by this substituting of the <Col N="495" /><i>Irish Grocer</i>, a well-known journal, for the <i>Trade Journal</i>, or some other paper.  We spent a considerable time on all this, and I suggest that we have got nowhere.</P>
    <P>As representing the only Party concerned with the working classes in this country, I suggest that we have listened to too much of this tommy-rot. We all agree that the cost of living has gone up.  The Minister agrees with that.  I agree that he dealt with Deputy Dillon's attacks very effectively. But it cannot be denied that the cost of living has gone up.  We now have legislation introduced to deal with that, and I consider that, instead of indulging in a discussion as to what is the price of bran or whether the Minister rang up England, Scotland and Wales to find out the price of flour, we should end this matter and get down definitely to the Bill and consider whether the machinery in the Bill is effective enough to deal with the atrocious profiteering in this country. I suggest that all this conversation should be stopped, and that we should definitely get down to deciding how we are going to prevent that profiteering and control prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it is obvious from Deputy McGowan's speech that he is suffering from more delusions than he confessed, there was some point in his opening remarks.  In my opinion, the discussion on the motion should be confined to the finance of the Bill.  But, if Deputy Dillon achieved nothing else in that way, he has succeeded in establishing a practice in this House as a result of which we have a re-hash of the Second Reading debate on every Bill on the finance motion in connection with it.  In my opinion, Deputy Dillon's speech was entirely out of order, but the Chair ruled that it was in order, and I have to accept the Chair's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am intervening now merely to prevent anyone being misled by the misleading remarks which Deputy Dillon made.  I do not know whether he gets his inspiration from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> or whether the <i>Irish Independent</i> gets its inspiration from him.  In relation to the price of bran <Col N="496" /> they both adopted the same tactics. The price of bran is of some importance, because not merely is it an article purchased in considerable quantity by farmers as a feeding stuff, but it has a very direct relation to the price of flour.  If bran is dear, flour is cheap, and if bran is cheap, flour is dear.  It is an important consideration to know whether the price of bran is dear or cheap when one is seeking an explanation of the price of flour, and the price of flour has a relation to the price of bread.</P>
    <P>I gave certain figures for the price of bran and the prices prevailing for red bran and red pollard on the 7th October, the date I was last speaking on the motion.  These figures were correct.  The <i>Irish Independent,</i> of course, was perturbed by the revelation of the fact that the prevailing ex-factory prices for red bran and pollard in Dublin were similar to those in other centres in Great Britain, and set out to discredit the figures.  Their tactics were somewhat similar to those of Deputy Dillon.  They got some retail trader in a Midland town to write up a letter to the effect that he had to pay more for red bran or red pollard delivered at his store.  They did not trouble to explain the difference between the delivered price and the ex-factory price.  Even when the particular miller from whom that bran was purchased wrote to the <i>Irish Independent</i> to explain the difference, they avoided giving him anything like the same publicity that they gave the original allegation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is trying to adopt the same tactics.  I do not know what purpose he has in mind.  I do not know how his particular point of view in the matter of prices is advanced by what he alleged.  There may be a difference of opinion on this, but it is desirable to make an attempt to put him right.  I choose the price of red bran for the purpose of my comparison, not because red bran is widely used here&mdash;I understand there is some foolish objection to its use amongst the farmers of the country&mdash;but because it was necessary to get some commodity the price of which could be compared with a similar commodity in Great Britain, and only red bran is <Col N="497" /> being purchased there.  No white bran is purchased in London, and if a comparison with England is to be made it must be in reference to red bran and pollard.  The Deputy quoted the price of white bran.  It is a higher price in Dublin.  The price of white bran on the date I refer to was £7 10s. ex-mill in Dublin.  Red bran was £6 10s. ex-mill in Dublin.  The Cork price was £1 higher per ton.</P>

      <P>I am not going to offer an explanation at the moment. I am merely stating that that is the case.  It is ordinarily so, I understand. There may be some good reason for it, and I presume there is.  But Deputy Dillon attempted to discredit my figures by quoting the Cork price, attempting rather stupidly and unskilfully a little bit of leg-pulling.  The prices I gave for red bran at London, Liverpool and Cardiff are quite correct. They were the prices prevailing on the 7th October.  So also were the prices I gave ex-mill Dublin.  These prices can be investigated by anybody who makes inquiries at the Dublin mills or at the other centres.  The national average retail price in all the towns of the Saorstát had nothing whatever to do with it.  The Deputy knows that quite well.</P>

    <P>I am not attempting to justify the price of bran.  I am not concerned with justifying the price of bran.  I merely stated it here because it had been mentioned in connection with a query addressed to me as to why the price of flour should be higher here than in London.  I do not pretend to be able to give people an explanation of why the price should be higher here but there are certain known reasons.  One of the known reasons is that all these corn offals fetch a lower price here than in England. They fetch a lower price because we are producing higher quantities than heretofore.  I think Deputy Dillon can remember when he was getting agitated last year at the prospect of these flour mills closing down because they were stocked to the roof with all these offals.  He and members of the Labour Party were quite <Col N="498" /> agitated at the prospect of a complete stoppage of flour milling here because of the inability of the mills to get rid of the corn offals which had accumulated in the stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I say we are manufacturing more bran and the price of bran is determined by what the millers can get for it.  The higher the price they get for bran, the lower the price they charge for flour.  Anybody who knows anything about the condition of the flour milling industry and who has even taken the trouble to read the various reports circulated to Deputies from time to time knows that.  I did not attempt to justify the price of bran or pollard here as against the price in Great Britain.  I was stating the facts, and the facts are incontestable. I move the motion and the price of bran has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has everything to do with it.  I do not blame Deputy McGowan for misunderstanding the issue.  He has spent most of his life in the suburbs of Dublin, but after he has been in this House for some time, I have no doubt that he will learn the facts of the situation.  Those who come from the country know that bran is a very important matter for the average small farmer in the country.  I reiterate that the Minister allowed himself, with the assistance of those upon whom he relied for his information, to be deceived into representing to the House and to the country that, as the responsible Minister, he was satisfied that the price charged for bran was £6 10s. ex-mill.  His leg was pulled.  He was made a fool of; and if they can fool <Col N="499" /> him, they will be able to fool any Prices Commission he sets up.  I know, Deputy Corry Knows, and every farmer in this House knows that the price paid by the farmer for white bran or mixed bran&mdash;and the bulk of bran is white and red bran mixed&mdash;was from £7 10s. to £8 10s. ex mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>£7 10s. is the price of white bran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of white bran in Cork is £6. 10s.  The price of mixed bran is £8 10s.  The price which farmers pay bears no relation to £6 10s. ex mill.  They are paying a retail price based on from £7 10s. to £8 10s. ex mill.  If the Minister has been fooled into any other belief, I say the Prices Commission will be similarly fooled.  In so far as that is true, the money which Deputy McGowan proposes to vote for the establishment of a Prices Commission will be wasted. His own leader stated a fortnight ago that the money which was voted over five years ago had been wasted.  The Deputy waxed eloquent here to day. Far be it from me to extend any discourtesy to a new-comer in this matter. Later on we may have occasion to cross words more vindictively, but I wish to reiterate that the Minister was misled in this business, and as he has been misled, so will the Prices Commission be misled, and by the very same people who misled him.</P>

      <P>On this section, I think it would be desirable that the Dáil should determine definitely a matter that arose in connection with the last Prices Commission.  Are interested parties entitled to be heard before the commission by counsel?  There was an occasion during the lifetime of the outgoing Prices Commission when an interested party elected to appear by <Col N="500" /> counsel.  The proceedings became somewhat acrimonious, and counsel was told that he had no locus standi and was asked to leave.  In any case, he was given to understand that he had no locus standi.  Is it the desire of the Minister that interested parties should appear before the commission by counsel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For myself, I would be strongly opposed to the practice developing of interested parties appearing before the commission by counsel.  The purpose of the commission is to get at the facts, to get at them by whatever means which, within the limits of their powers, are open to them&mdash;by question, by cross-examination, and so forth&mdash;and the intervention of counsel between witnesses and the members of the commission would only impair the efficiency of the commission in that matter.  So far as the Bill is concerned, we are leaving it as the Act provided &mdash;that the Prices Commission can determine their own procedure; but if they should ask my advice at any time as to whether they should encourage the practice of representation by counsel at sittings of the commission, I would agree strongly against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>My views are opposed to those of the Minister in this matter. It is all very well, if you are dealing with a highly experienced company chairman, or somebody who is in the habit of giving evidence or standing before a tribunal; but this tribunal is entitled to summon any shopkeeper before it, and to question him as to the price of a particular product. There are a number of rural factories the proprietors of which might be brought before the commission.  A countryman might be asked to stand up and answer a fusillade of questions from all directions.  I think it is very unfair to ask such a person to appear without some kind of assistance.  Will he be allowed even to bring a solicitor with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, there is no restriction on persons who are asked to come as witnesses, bringing whatever clerical staff or other assistance they may require with them.  In <Col N="501" /> certain cases the commission may object to that course but in the ordinary course of events, the sole purpose of the commission is to get all the information they can.  Therefore, anything that may assist a witness in giving information would be welcomed by the commission but the purpose of counsel, particularly in the case to which the Deputy refers, is different. They are briefed.  They are not experts.  They know no more in the ordinary way about the matter before the commission than the ordinary man in the street.  They only know what they are told, and people in that position are no use to the commission. What the commission require before them is not the legal representatives of particular firms but the accountants of those firms.  It is from the accountants, and not from the lawyers, they will get the information they want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not relate to complaints to the commission. It relates to complaints concerning individual purchases, made to the Controller of Prices by an individual who has gone into a shop and purchased a pound of sugar, a pair of boots, or anything else, and, believing that he or she was over-charged, wants the matter investigated by the Controller of Prices or an inspector acting under the Controller.  The Prices Commission <Col N="503" /> does not come into the picture at this stage at all.</P>
      <P>Under the existing Act there is a formal procedure which has to be followed by persons desiring to make a complaint.  They have to make a complaint in writing and in the prescribed form.  It is my belief that the formality associated with the making of the complaint has deterred quite a number of people from availing of the machinery which is there to have their grievances examined, and I think it is good policy to make the procedure for lodging a complaint as informal as possible.  I see no reason why a person who feels that he or she has been overcharged for some commodity should not be allowed to lodge a complaint forthwith by telephone if he or she so desires, or alternatively to drop a postcard asking an inspector to call. The less formality there is about it the better.  In any event, we are proposing now to give the controller power to have an investigation made where the inspector in any event thinks it necessary, so that it will still be possible to act upon informal complaints. That is the reason why we cut out the provision concerning the making of complaints in writing in the prescribed form.  We are anxious to make the procedure informal, in the belief that people will thereby more readily avail of the machinery which is there for their protection.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that this might open up the way for frivolous complaints?  Of course I desire that there should be every means for dealing with overcharging or profiteering, but there should be some check upon frivolous complaints. Any person, by making a telephone call, can immediately set the machinery going, and that person can then possibly disappear out of the picture because there is nothing in writing to make him come and face up to his charge against an individual seller or shopkeeper.  I should like the Minister to give that matter a certain amount of consideration, so that he may find a means of being able to deal with frivolous complaints, or complaints by a buyer who may have some <Col N="504" /> desire to wound a particular trader or individual shopkeeper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the Deputy's representations are two-fold. First of all, the Controller need not act on a complaint which he regards as frivolous.  Secondly, if in the course of investigation it is found that a person gave false or misleading information, that person becomes guilty of an offence and can be penalised under the Act.  In the ordinary event, the Controller will have little difficulty in determining between genuine and frivolous complaints.  He will have reliable information as to the prevailing prices of most commodities of common consumption, and complaint about a price equal to or below what he knows to be the prevailing price charged will presumably not be investigated by him at all.  It is only where the facts seem to indicate that an offence has occurred that he will take proceedings, but he is given power under the Bill to require a person making a complaint to supply whatever information is necessary for the conduct of the investigation, and there is also power taken to punish a person who gives information which he knows to be wrong.</P>

      <P>I know that a man may be punished for putting in information which is wrong, but nevertheless he can put in a frivolous complaint against a merchant, particularly if he has any ill-feeling, against the merchant, and I should like to sound a note of warning.  There seems to be an attitude growing up in this country that any man who earns his living is a sort of public enemy.  He has to be beset by inspectors, and every kind of supervision, or he will do wrong.  The fact that you earn your own living in this country is becoming <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the fact that you are a potential criminal.  If you are on the dole, or looking for outdoor relief, or looking for relief works, that is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that you are an honest man, but if you happen to be rowing your own canoe and asking nobody for help it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that you are a rogue, so you have to be inspected by the factory <Col N="505" /> inspector, by the Board of Trade inspector, by the prices inspector, and by several other inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very possibly, all necessary. I have no doubt the Deputy has never encountered them.  But the next time the Deputy sits down to spend a pleasant evening preparing his legal work, and considers how he would get his work done if he had to suffer a necessary inspection every half-hour he was doing his work in accordance with the law, I think he will scratch his head.  I quite agree that abuses must be checked, but I urge most strongly that the time is rapidly coming when we ought seriously to consider whether we should facilitate too much the incursions of these hordes and legions of inspectors that are raging around this country. If you have four inspectors calling on you in one day and you have to meet and satisfy each of them in accordance with the statute, by the end of the day you are in a pretty ragged condition. But if, having satisfied the inspector, you have visits from Guards concerned about the enforcement of five or six restrictive laws&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to put some slight check on the thousand and first inspector who is going to be launched out on the inoffensive commercial community in this country and the only check that is asked is that before you let loose this further bloodhound you ought to set down in writing the reason you want him to come in and take a piece out of the merchant's leg.  The Minister suggests that if he imposes the obligation on anybody of writing, nobody will have the industry to do it, but if a person can pick up a telephone and say &ldquo;Send somebody in to ginger up such-and-such a fellow,&rdquo; then the controller will get all the complaints he wants.  I think he will get more complaints than he ought to get, complaints which will induce him to send inspectors into perfectly respectable <Col N="506" /> merchants at a rate far more than he ought to.</P>
      <P>We have had reference made here to valid and invalid complaints.  It is a really difficult thing for the Controller to distinguish between them.  If a man says &ldquo;I was charged so much for a pound of sugar in O'Connell Street and in Ear!  Street it is a ½d. less,&rdquo; that establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of overcharging and the Controller is bound to investigate.  If such a situation as that arises, and if a person feels about it, he ought to have the courage to write it on a post card. If he is a public-spirited person he will not hesitate to write it on a post card; but if he is a purely frivolous person, in something of a bad temper, a person who is not anxious to check up on his prices and find out whether there is not some simple explanation, then he will go to the telephone and set the machinery in motion.  It may seem a small matter, but it may mean a great deal to a number of merchants.</P>

I stated already that the experience over 12 years has been that it is useless to rely on the public spirit of the citizens to write in for the purpose of starting investigations into prices.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And so will this one? Therfore, we should make it as easy as possible for the citizen to approach the Controller and give the Controller and the commission power to act on their own initiative.  That is what we are proposing to do.  The amendment makes more formal the manner of the approach and I do not think we should do that.  There is no question of penalising the trader unless, on investigation, it is found that there is an excessive price charged.  Up to that stage there is no injury inflicted on the trader concerned.  It may mean that here and there a trader will have his prices investigated without due cause. But I do not think that is going to do them any harm.  It will prevent them increasing prices without due cause at a later stage.</P>

The Minister was in business in this city before he became a politician, and I wonder has he ever had the experience of Government inspectors coming in, squaring up, sticking out their jaws and saying: &ldquo;Come on, tell us all we want to know; we are from the Department of Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;  Suppose the trader puts it to the inspector: &ldquo;What is it you want to know?&rdquo; the reply invariably will be: &ldquo;I do not know.  I <Col N="508" /> am an inspector.  I am here to tell you what the law is, and not why it is the law.&rdquo;  If you suggest: &ldquo;I doubt if you ought to be here, or if this comes within your purview,&rdquo; the inspector will say: &ldquo;I do not know; I was sent here, and I am going to stay here until I get what I want.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(2)  Whenever a price certificate for the time being in force in relation to a commodity has been served on any person who carries on any business by way of trade or gain, and such person is satisfied that the price fixed by the Controller is not a fair price for such commodity, such person may send a representation in a form to be prescribed to the commission for an investigation into the price of such commodity, and thereupon the commission shall hold such an investigation, and, pending the result thereof, the said price certificate shall not take effect.</P>
      <P>I was impressed with what the Minister said on the two previous amendments which I put down and I am rather inclined to agree with him in this way, that it is very hard to get the public to come forward, and I rather make him a present of that if he thinks there is some point in it, and I think there probably is. He mentioned that this matter would not come before the commission.</P>

      <P>I would like to say to the Minister that there seems to <Col N="510" /> be a needless amount of circumlocution in connection with this Bill.  We have three sets of Orders which have been made&mdash;Prices Order, Restriction on Profits Order, and Price Certificate. You have a commission and Controller. Apparently the commission is functioning on the Prices Order and the Prices Restriction on Profits Order, and the Controller is functioning on the Prices Certificate.  There may be and there is a certain amount of overlapping. I see this provision, for instance: &ldquo;The Controller may, with the consent of the commission, make a certificate (in this Act referred to as the Price Certificate).&rdquo;  I do not know what the relations between the Controller and the commission are going to be but I think that it is very desirable that they should be very intimate and that the Controller should be part of the commission and that the commission should be more or less part of the controller, if it could be described in that way in the case of a body dealing with an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reasons for urging these points are that prices are highly technical subjects.  If you get a Controller who merely draws his remuneration and sits in a chair, nothing will be done.  If he gets out and tries to do his very best, sooner or later he will do a certain number of things which he ought not to do.  I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with him, but a Controller who can give an intelligent and expert opinion on what retail prices ought to be for the whole country would probably want to have the assistance of all the judges there are at present.  I would be inclined to suggest that such a man has not yet been born.  He is bound to make mistakes and, in saying that, I am perfectly certain that nobody would be more ready than the Minister to admit that that is possible, either through inaccuracy or because a telephone message might have been wrongly recorded, or because something else like that might have happened.  The purpose of my amendment is that there shall be a review of the Controller's opinion.  I should <Col N="511" /> think that if a commission is not well up on prices, it will not be very long before the education of that commission is improved.  I think that the fact that there was to be a review by a commission of the prices fixed by the Controller would be eminently desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made quite clear what the relations between the Controller and the commission are going to be.  I would like to suggest that the Controller could serve a very useful apprenticeship on listening to the Prices Order and the Prices Restrictions on profits investigations by the commission and that the commission, if necessary, could be called on to review decisions by the Controller. There is one other matter to which I would like to refer and it is at the root of this Bill.  The Minister is talking about prices and the public are thinking about prices.  Now these two are not the same thing.  Having regard to that, you must take into account the quality of the articles supplied.  It is nonsense to talk about prices, prices, prices, and absolutely neglect quality.  The Minister may have in his mind: &ldquo;Oh, well, it will needlessly complicate matters if the slippery retailer is allowed to plead that this quality is somewhat different from somebody else's quality.&rdquo;  But there is no disguising the fact that the public are looking for value.  What is the use of fixing prices when, say, for the sake of argument, an Irish-produced article is to be so much if the quality is halved or quartered?  Is that an infringement?  It certainly is profiteering.  Is that a subject for investigation by the commission?  The question of the quality of the article must be taken into account because that is the way in which the public looks at it&mdash;price and quality.  People have only got a certain amount of money, they have to study their purse. There are other people who can spend what they like on an article and they are looking for the quality that will suit them.  You have, broadly speaking, that position.  I had a case brought to my notice recently.  It was the matter of an Irish-made article. <Col N="512" /> The price was, broadly speaking, what it ought to be in the international market.  My complainant's contention was that this Irish-made article gave one-quarter of the service of the international article.  I contend that that is a charge of 400 per cent. on the consumer.  The Minister must take a fact like that into account.  I see the Ceann-Comhairle looking at me, and I do not know whether the idea is that the point I am dealing with is not within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank you for your expression of opinion, Sir, but I certainly think that unless the Minister is going to take value into account and that is the broadest and simplest way of looking at the matter&mdash;this Control of Prices Bill will be just as useless as the previous Acts that the Minister has been complaining about.  I do not know what the Minister has to say to the amendment standing in my name but I would like to press the Minister first of all that he should explain to us how intimately the Controller and the commission were going to be connected or coupled together, and, secondly, that he would consider last, but not least, the question of value.</P>

      <P>Section 39 deals with the position which arises when a complaint has been made and investigated and the Controller has come to the conclusion that the complaint is well-founded, and that the overcharge was made by some trader for some commodity to the person who made the complaint.  I take it that the Deputy's purpose in the amendment is to provide that from the decision of the Controller there will be an appeal by the trader concerned to the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the Deputy's amendment is not necessary because, if he turns to the words of the section which he himself quoted, he will find that, before the Controller acts, he has to get the consent of the commission. The Controller acts by <Col N="513" /> making a price certificate and, before he does that, he has to get the consent of the commission.  Of course, it would be inappropriate and wrong to provide subsequently for the trader an appeal to the commission which had consented to the making of the certificate.  In any event, it would be unnecessary.  The Deputy has, I think, misunderstood the machinery of this part of the Bill. The Regulation of Profit Orders have nothing whatever to do with this part of the Bill.  To use the Deputy's own words, &ldquo;the retail price for a commodity throughout the whole country&rdquo; is not affected by anything that may be done under this part of the Bill.  This part of the Bill deals only with the complaints of individuals&mdash;complaints relating to the sale of some single commodity on a single occasion by a particular and named trader.  In such circumstances the Controller comes in to investigate.  It is the Controller decides whether an investigation is to take place and arranges for it.  If he comes to the conclusion that an overcharge has, in fact, been made and that action should be taken, he has, before he takes action, to get the consent of the commission.  I submit that the Deputy's amendment is not necessary.  The commission consent and the Controller makes his price certificate.  That price certificate is, in itself, no real safeguard against any general tendency to overcharge for the particular commodity named in the certificate.  It is directed to the trader against whom the offence has been proved, and relates only to the price to be charged by that trader.  Of course, the penalty upon the trader is greater than would appear, particularly if the Controller considers that the circumstances are such as to justify him in publishing the fact that such a certificate has been made.  It is the effect of the publicity rather than the actual effect of the certificate which will deter traders who may be charging excessive prices from continuing to do so after the Controller has had investigation made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the general question of the relation of prices to value.  It is precisely because of the difficulty of controlling prices by <Col N="514" /> making maximum price Orders where the articles are of variable value that this amending Bill is considered necessary. I referred already to the difficulty, for example, of controlling the price of flour.  The only reason it is not possible to control the price of flour by making a maximum price Order is because of the infinite variations possible in the quality of flour that might be offered for sale.  As some Deputies will remember, we spent a considerable time away back in 1929 trying to get some chemical definition which would enable one quality of flour to be distinguished from another.  That was in connection with the Economic Committee set up by the House in that year. We had to abandon the attempt.  We were assured by the foremost chemists in the country whom we called into consultation that there was no known test by which it would be possible for the ordinary person to distinguish one quality of flour from another. Therefore, that method of fixing flour prices is not operating.  The same thing occurs in connection with the whole range of commodities in respect of which variation in quality cannot be easily detected.  It is to deal with such circumstances that we are widening the powers of the commission and giving them authority to control prices by regulating, not the actual selling price of a commodity, but the margin of profit which a manufacturer or wholesaler or trader may take.  If that cannot be done, then they can advise that some modification of customs duty or import restriction should be put in operation.  These alternative methods of dealing with a situation in which excessive prices are being charged have to be resorted to precisely because of the difficulty to which the Deputy has referred.  That difficulty was always there and I frequently expressed the opinion that the term &ldquo;price&rdquo; has no significance unless related to quality.  It was always visualised that the procedure of controlling price by fixing a maximum could not be easily adopted in the case of a number of articles.  When we introduced the 1932 Act, the view held was that it was only in a few <Col N="515" /> cases and as a last resort that a maximum price would, in fact, be enforced.  We felt that the publicity attending the inquiry, the publication of the report and the publication of the finding of the commission that excessive prices were being charged would be sufficient to get manufacturers and traders to reduce prices to a reasonable level.  That was sufficient in all cases in our experience except one.  In that one case, it was possible to act by way of fixing a maximum price.  That was the case of bread.  All that, I submit, has no direct relation to this section.  This section deals only with the powers of the Controller in relation to some individual sale, and the Deputy's amendment to provide for an appeal from the Controller's decision to the commission is unnecessary.  It would achieve no purpose, because the section provides that, before he acts, the Controller must have got the consent of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has appreciated the point I made or, alternatively, whether I fully understand the procedure which will take place.  My idea was that a consumer, &ldquo;A.&rdquo; would possibly ring up the Controller and make a complaint about the price that a retailer, &ldquo;B,&rdquo; was charging for a commodity.  That is the start of the case.  The Controller will make some sort of preliminary investigations, and then he will make an order which will be nominally with the authority of the commission but which will really mean that the commission initialled some sort of report or statement which he made about the case.  I do not want to make a State trial out of every complaint.  In eight or nine cases out of ten, the Controller will probably be in the right.  But there may be alternative submissions by the retailer in reply to the Controller's price certificate. I want the submissions which the trader makes to be reviewed if they are thought sufficiently important. That is the decision which I want to get at.  The Minister knows that one story is very good until you hear the other.  If there is an alternative <Col N="516" /> submission to the order of the Controller, I want that submission reviewed by the body which is in association with him.  It is a very complicated and difficult subject, and that is what I am seeking.</P>

      <P>We have had that question considered here in relation to a large number of measures, and it has become now the standard practice to insert in measures of this kind a sub-section such as sub-section (6) deeming a notice to be served when it is in fact sent by registered post to the address of the person concerned.  I think we have to stick to that, because of the difficulty which has often been experienced of dealing with the legal technicality of what constitutes service.  As the Deputy is no doubt <Col N="517" /> aware, people have frequently succeeded in evading the consequences of their acts by some legal quibble of that kind.  I think we have to stick to this practice.  I do not believe that any case has arisen under any Act of real hardship, although we have had it discussed here upon a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>All the Agricultural Acts, all these various measures which were enacted for the control of the production of eggs, butter, milk and so on, the Cereals Acts for which the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible and quite a very large number of such measures, provide for something happening when documents are served upon individuals.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  For the information of Deputies who have recently become members of the House, I should explain that the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, gives the Executive Council power to impose certain customs duties by Order, but it provides also that these Orders shall cease to have statutory effect on the expiration of eight months from the date on which they are made, unless confirmed by an Act of this kind. This Bill is for the purpose of confirming the Orders which are set out in the Schedule to it.  If Deputies wish to discuss any particular Order, I think they can do so more appropriately <Col N="518" /> on the Committee Stage than on the present Stage.  Any question they may desire to ask with regard to them can be more easily answered then.  It is, I think, the normal practice of the House to discuss the Orders scheduled in Committee rather than on the Second Reading.  The Bill is, therefore, at this stage more a formality than anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is one of minor importance only.  Its main object is to facilitate the production of wheaten flour of the quality desired by biscuit manufacturers. Under existing legislation, every mill holding a licence to mill wheat is alloted a quota of wheat to be milled during the period of time prescribed in the Act as the cereal year, which begins on 1st September and ends 31st August.  Millers milling quantities of wheat in excess of their quotas become indebted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for sums of money increasing on an ascending scale according to the degree of over-milling, and all millers are required to mill the national percentage of home-grown wheat fixed from time to time by the Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed by biscuit manufacturers that suitable flour for their purpose can only be produced from special classes of wheat and that the wheat at present being produced in the Saorstát is not suitable.  The effect of the present Bill, when enacted, will be that any wheat used by millers for the production of flour intended for use in the manufacture of biscuits will not count against the quota of the relevant mill, either for the purpose of calculating over-milling, or for calculating the quantity of home-grown wheat which that miller must grind under existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> This is an attempt by us to encourage the manufacture of biscuit flour here.  Up to the present it has always been recognised that biscuit flour was in a different position to the ordinary flour, and consequently licences for its importation were issued.  In fact, the only flour imported into this country in recent years has been flour for biscuit manufacture. It is hoped, in consequence of the granting of these facilities, that millers will be encouraged to undertake the milling of the special type of flour which biscuit manufacturers use.  There is another section in the Bill which is of very minor importance. Sub-section (1) of 30 of the Act of 1933 provided that in the case of over-milling a debt was incurred to the Minister, which was recoverable as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.  Section 9 of the Agricultural Produce Act of 1934 amended that section.  The main intention of the amendment was to increase penalties for over-milling.  The provision as regards the recovery of sums due was omitted by an oversight, and it is deemed advisable to reinsert it. Advantage was taken of the introduction of this Bill to remedy the oversight.</P>

Béidir gur mhaith leo scur dá ndeoin féin ar chúiseanna príobháideacha, nó béidir go scuirfí iad ar mhaithe leis an Stát, no de dheascaibh laige cuirp <Col N="522" /> no aigne.  Tá soláthar á dhéanamh leis an Scéim, do gach cás acu san.</P>
    <P>I gcás oifigeach a scuirfidh dá ndeoin féin, bainfidh an Scéim le Céim Captaein no le Céimeanna níos ísle ná san, ach i gcás Céimeanna níos aoirde ná san, ní bhainfidh sé ach amháin leo san, dar deonadh coimisiúin roimh an gcéad lá de Dheireadh Foghmhair, míle naoi gcéad a ceathair fichead (1924).  Sna cásanna san uile, má mbeidh seirbhís de bhreis ar chúig bliana ag oifigeach gan seirbhís dhá bhlian déag do bheith aige, gheobhaidh sé aisce de mhéid is có-ionann le págh triocha (30) lá in aghaidh gach bliana dá sheirbhís inphinsin.  Má bheidh seirbhís dhá bhlian déag ag an oifigeach gan seirbhís fiche blian do bheith aige, gheobhaidh sé Pinsean, agus más pósta dhó, tabharfar Aisce dhó i dteannta an phinsin.  Is do réir mar adubhrathas cheana a déanfar amach méid na hAisce, ach is in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse tar éis seirbhís chúig mblian sa chéim le linn scurtha, a bheidh an Pinsean, mar leanas:&mdash;Lefteanantaí, sé púint (£6); Captaeiní, ocht bpúint (£8); Ceannphuirt, deich bpúint (£10); Maoir, dhá phúnt déag (£12); Coronail, ceithre púint déag (£14); Geinearáil, sé púint déag (£16).</P>
    <P>Sa dara h-áit, má scuirfear oifigeach go h-éigeanta ar mhaithe leis an Stát, gan seirbhís chúig mblian do bheith aige, ní bhfaghaidh sé Pinsean ná Aisce.  Má bheidh seirbhís de bhreis ar chúig bliana ag an oifigeach gan seirbhís dhá bhlian déag do bheith aige, gheobhaidh sé Aisce Sheirbhíse de mhéid is có-ionann le págh cúig lá is dachad (45) in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse; agus, má bheidh seirbhís dha bhlian déag aige, gan seirbhís fiche blian do bheith aige, gheobhaidh sé Pinsean, agus, más pósta dhó, tabhar far Aisce dhó i dteannta an Phinsin. Is do réir mar adubhrathas cheana a déanfar amach Aisce oifigigh phósta agus déanfar amach an Pinsean do réir an méid blian seirbhíse inphinsin achtúla maraon le blianta bhreise nách mó ná cúig bliana.  Seo iad na rátaí Pinsin is iníochta in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse:&mdash;Lefteanantaí, naoi, bpúint (£9); Captaeiní, deich bpúint (£10); Ceannphuirt, dhá phúnt déag (£12); Maoir, Ceithre púint déag (£14); Coronail, sé púint déag (£16); <Col N="523" /> Geinearáil, naoi bpúint déag (£19).</P>
    <P>Sa tríomhadh h-áit, má scuirfidh cifigeach de dheascaidh laige cuirp no aigne agus gan seirbhís deich mblian do bheith aige, gheobhaidh sé Aisce Sheirbhíse de mhéid is có-ionann le pagh cúig lá is dachad (45) in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse, ach, tar éis seirbhís deich mblian do bheith aige, beidh sé i dteideal an Phinsin chéadna (gan blianta breise d'áireamh) agus na hAisce chéadna, más pósta dhó, a gheobhadh sé dá scuirtí go h-éigeanta é.</P>
    <P>An Scéim Phinsean agus Aiscí a leagtar amach mar seo, baineann sí le hOifigigh an Airm go coitianta, ach deineadh soláthar speisialta d'oifigigh ag a bhfuil ceapacháin ghairmiúla is teicniúla áirithe.  Fé sna forálacha so, beidh a rogha de dhá nidh acu.  Féadfaid rogha dhéanamh de'n Scéim atá leagtha amach chun Pinsean agus Aiscí do sholáthar, i dteannta fiche fé'n gcéad (20 per cent.) sa mbreis i gcás Ceapachán Leighis agus Dlí, no deich fén gcéad (10 per cent.) sa mbreis i gcás Ceapachán teicniúl eile, ar a n-áireofar an tAer-Chór, an Cór Innealtóirí, an Scoil Cheoil, etc.  Mar mhalairt, ní bhfaghaid Aisce ar bith, ach más rogha leo é, gheobhaid dhá dtrain dá bpágh bliantúil ar dháta a scurtha, no an seascadú (1-60th) cuid dá bpágh bliantúil in aghaidh gach bliana de sheirbhís inphinsin, pé méid acu san is lugha.</P>
    <P>Fé'n Scéim seo, féadfar Pinsin do dheonad do Bhaintrigh agus do Chlainn Oifigeach Marbh.  Má gheobhaidh Oifigeach bás le linn dó bheith ag fóghnamh sna Fórsaí, gan seirbhís dhá bhlian déag do bheith aige; íocfar le n-a bhaintrigh no le n-a chlainn aisce de mhéid is có-ionann le págh triocha lá in aghaidh gach bliana dá sheirbhís; ach má bheidh seirbhís dhá bhlian déag ar a luighead aige, íocfar Pinsin le n-a Bhaintrigh agus le n-a Chlainn.  Má gheobhaidh Oifigeach bás tar éis a scurtha as na Fórsaí agus gur go h-éigeanta do scuirfear é toisc cúiseanna seachas mí-iompar no neamh-éifeachtúlacht, íocfar an pinsean céadna ach dhá bhliain déag ar a luighead de sheirbhís inphinsin do bheith aige; ach má gheobhaidh sé bás tar éis dó scur dá dheoin féin, ní <Col N="524" /> mór dó fiche bliain de sheirbhís imphinsin do bheith aige.  Atharóchaidh na rátaí Pinsin is iníoctha le Baintrigh do réir chéime an oifigigh mhairbh&mdash;íocfar cúig púint is dachad (£45) sa bhliain le Baintrigh Leftenaint agus céad púnt (£100) sa bhliain le Baintrigh Gheinearáil.</P>
    <P>II. Céimnigh Eile.&mdash;Is simplidhe go mór na forálacha bhaineann le hOifigigh Nea-Choimisiúnta agus le Saighdiúirí.  Fé réir na bhforálacha san, deonfar Pinsin in aghaidh seirbhíse bliain is fiche, agus deanfar Aiscí in aghaidh seirbhíse is lugha ná bliain is fiche.  Ach i gcás saighdiúirí scaoilfear toisc easláinte no aoise, fédfar pinsean cionúireach do dheonadh dhóibh ach seirbhís chúig mblian déag do bheith acu, no aisce mhéaduite má bheid gan seirbhís chúig mblian déag do bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Atharóchaidh na rátaí Pinsin do réir chéime, ar n-a n-íoc, mar leanas, tar éis bliain is fiche de sheirbhís inphinsin:&mdash;Dhá scilling sa ló do Shaighdiúir Singil.  Leath-Choróin sa ló do Cheannaire.  Dhá scilling is naoi bpingne sa ló do Sháirsint.  Trí scillinge sa ló do Cheathrú-Sháirsint Complachta.  Trí scillinge is trí pingne sa ló do Sháirsint Complachta.  Trí scillinge is raol sa ló do Cheathrú-Sháirsint Complachta.  Ceithre scillinge sa ló do Mhaor-Sháirsint.</P>

    <P>III.  An tSeirbhís Bhanaltrais.&mdash;An soláthar a deintear do Bhanaltraí is cosúil é leis an soláthar d'Oifigigh Sheirbhíse Speisialta.  Fén Scéim seo beidh na Banaltraí le n-a mbaineann sí, i dteideal pé méid acu so leanas is lugha, sé sin le rádh:&mdash;an seascadú (1-60th) cuid dá sochar oifige bliantúil in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse; nó dhá dtrian dá sochar oifige bliantúil,</P>

    <P>Má scuirfid no má scaoilfear iad agus seirbhís acu is lugha ná an tseirbhís do luadhadh anois díreach, beid i dteideal Aisce is có-ionann le págh mí in aghaidh gach bliana seirbhíse.</P>
    <P>Ní fuirist costas na Scéime do mheas.  Maidir leis na hOifigigh agus na Banaltraí a scuirfidh sa ghnáth-slí, ní cuirfear an Scéim i bhfeidhm go ceann fiche blian ó'n mbliain, míle naoi gcéad a dhó is fiche (1922) no míle naoi gcéad a trí is fiche (1923) anuas; agus i gcás Céimnigh Eile, ní cuirfear i bhfeidhm í go dtí míle naoi gcéad a trí is dachad (1943).</P>

Meastar ná raghaidh costas na Scéime thar cúig mhíle púnt (£5,000) i rith na bliana airgeadais seo, pé scéal é, agus, uime sin, déanfar Meastachán Breise do'n méid sin do thabhairt isteach i dtráth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister showed no consideration for an atrociously ignorant person like myself who, unfortunately, is not familiar with the Irish language.  I have no objection whatsoever to the use of that language, but the Minister is as conscious of the fact as I am that the majority of the members of this House are not sufficiently conversant with the Irish language to follow the details of a comprehensive regulation such as this when given in a language that they do not understand.  I admit that that is unfortunate and undesirable, but I admit, too, that there is a necessity for the Minister as well as for myself to face facts, whether they are pleasant or unpleasant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the statement which has just been read was an explanation, a defence or an apologia for this production, but, out of respect for the Minister, and assuming that he <Col N="526" /> has a sense of fair play, I will take it for the moment that it was an apologia. If it was not, inside this document there is a grave injustice being done to sections of the Army that deserve nothing but the best from the Minister, or anybody who sits in his seat.  Now, I think every member of Dáil Eireann must pay particular attention to any legislation or regulation affecting the pay or pension of the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Army&mdash;more so than any other service, because in the whole of this State they are the only service that are of necessity entirely gagged, entirely helpless, prevented by order and regulation from communicating with or approaching any Deputy of Dáil Eireann&mdash;and I agree with that regulation&mdash;prevented also by regulation from exploiting or explaining in the public Press any grievances which they may have&mdash;and I also agree with such a regulation&mdash;prevented from having any journal of their own in which to express their grievances or to present a case when an injustice may be done to them.  We have all to recognise that, because of the necessities of having a disciplined service remote and removed from the atmosphere of propaganda, far removed from the atmosphere of politics, it is desirable that members of the Defence Forces should not be allowed to communicate by lobbying Deputies of Dáil Eireann, by writing their case so as to bring it under the notice of Deputies of Dáil Eireann, or by writing to the public Press so as to stir up public interest when an injustice is being done.</P>
    <P>All those regulations are there, and because those regulations exist there is a very great and weighty responsibility on every individual Deputy here, when Army matters come before Dáil Eireann, to see that the full significance of every line and paragraph is understood and that the reactions and repercussions of everything that is brought before us in connection with the Army should be thoroughly grasped by every Deputy.  Now, the Minister has not been very helpful in that respect, but I would submit to every member of the Dáil that, when we are dealing with a pension for any individual or for any service in the State, <Col N="527" /> whether it is the civil servants or teachers, or police or members of the Defence Forces, there must be some definite relation between pension and pay, or rather between pay and pension, and that that is the kernel and the acid test of every pension scheme in every country in the whole world&mdash;the relation between pay and pension or the connection between pay and pension&mdash;and that, if there is any grave departure from such connection and you hang that departure on, let us say, the rank element or the grade element, such a departure from well-established precedent can only be justified if the person proposing to take such a course is prepared to demonstrate that no injustice is being done by such a course and by such a departure from precedent.</P>
    <P>The back-bone of this particular pension scheme is that a man is pensioned on the rank and service element. Now, there would be no objection whatsoever to such a course if all people holding equal rank got equal pay, or even approximately similar pay; but even speaking from a memory that is rather rusty, I could take a rank in the Army, the rank of captain, and I could mention nine different rates of pay in the rank of captain, varying by as much as 100 per cent; varying from rates of £300 up to rates of £740.  That is, in one rank, the pay varies between £300 odd and £700 odd.  If the pay of one rank varies or swings so much between one extreme and the other, is the Minister or any impartial Deputy in this House prepared to say that it is just, reasonable and equitable to give a flat rate pension for the whole lot, irrespective of pay, or even anything approaching a flat rate pension?  There is a feature thrown into this regulation &mdash;which I will deal with later&mdash;that has all the evidence of being a little conscience money thrown into rectify a glaring injustice.  Are there any Deputies in any Party who, where there is a pension scheme, let us say, for labourers, would grade all labourers, tradesmen and others, into one common group and pension them all, not according to the rates of pay drawn by the highest ranks, but by the lowest <Col N="528" /> ranks?  As I have pointed out, for the rank of captain there was a variation swinging between £300 odd a year and £700 odd a year in pay.  Is it reasonable or justifiable to suggest anything like a uniform rate of pension when the same Department of State considers that the rates of pay should vary by as much as £400 a year?  If you have got to accept that there is that great swing in the pay attributable to any rank, then I submit that the rank and service element is all wrong, and is unjust to the people of a rank drawing the higher pay, and I submit that you might as well have proposed a pensions scheme based on Army numbers, without paying any consideration to the expert type of service or to the highly paid work that was done by one particular group as against another particular group.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, in the Army &mdash;and we must have&mdash;a position where certain groups of officers hold very low rank but where their professional qualification is recognised by giving very high pay to that particular rank. It may be the soundest scheme of all where you have an Army with progressively reducing ranks, such as you have in this Army of ours.  If we pin ourselves absolutely and for all time to linking pension with rank, where are you going to finish if that progressive downward trend of rank continues? Remember, it was only a few years ago since the highest rank in the Army was full general, the next rank lieutenant-general, and the next rank major-general; then colonel and so on down the line.  The two upper ranks are gone and you are within reasonable distance of arriving at the day when the highest rank in the Army will be that of colonel.  Apply that to services within the Army.  Herefore services within the Army had as their commanding officer a major-general; then their commanding officer was a colonel; next their commanding officer was a major.  If the rank of the top of the service is major, obviously you must telescope all the ranks from him downwards.</P>
    <P>In the special services of the Army commanded by a major, such as the Army Medical Service, the legal service <Col N="529" /> and the other special services, you have only to deal with three ranks between the bottom commissioned rank and the highest commissioned rank&mdash; captain, commandant, and major.  An officer of the lowest rank obviously has to get very high pay, because he qualified as a professional man before ever he got his commission.  In this particular scheme that we have here these men are pensioned, not on the basis of their pay, but on the basis of their rank.  Irrespective of how high the pay is for a particular officer, he will be pensioned according to the number of &ldquo;pips&rdquo; on his shoulder.  I cannot see any justification for such a scheme. But if the Army is wedded to the necessity for a pension scheme being based on the rank and service element, justice can still be done within the framework of such a scheme, and without upsetting the framework of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I take the case of the Army Medical Service, because I am more familiar with it; but any argument I use in connection with the Army Medical Service applies equally to the Army legal officers, to a great extent to the Army engineers, and, I believe, to officers in the Army Flying Corps, because they all draw a different rate of pay although they have a similar rank to others.  The pension here proposed is a pension at a flat rate, plus 20 per cent. added by way of conscience money.  I will briefly go through the rates of pay for three grades of officers and, for want of a better term, refer to an officer who does not belong to a special service as a regimental officer.  I am taking the higher rate of pay and the higher rate of pension in each case.  The pay of a regimental captain is £328 per annum.  The pay, at the higher rate again, of a medical officer with the rank of captain is £730 per annum&mdash; 100 per cent. difference between the higher rate of pay of a medical captain and a regimental captain.  The rate of pay of a regimental commandant is £438 per annum and of a medical commandant £857 per annum, approximately 100 per cent. difference in the two rates.  The pay of a regimental major is £511 per annum and <Col N="530" /> of a major in the medical service £1,100 per annum&mdash;100 per cent. difference, again, between the rates.</P>
    <P>With 100 per cent. difference in the rates of pay, I ask Deputies is it reasonable to say: &ldquo;We will meet that departure from the rank principle by giving 20 per cent. added pension to those who have 100 per cent. higher pay.&rdquo;  What is the idea of pay and pension in any service except there be a definite linking between pay and pension?  If there are two officers in the Army, with 21 years' service, whose rate of pay and length of service are equal, why should one get a pension twice as great as the other? When they were in the Army you must presume from the rates of pay that these men were considered by all the Departments concerned&mdash;Defence and Finance&mdash;to be of equal financial value.  But when these men's day is done as active people, one man is to be thrown out on half the rate of pension, and that is the man who spent years of his life and hundreds of pounds qualifying for the job before he joined the Army, who went in as a qualified man and an expert at his job.  This man is to get only half the rate the other gets.</P>
    <P>What I am saying in connection with officers in the medical service as against regimental officers applies with equal force to non-commissioned officers and the unfortunate privates in the Army Medical Corps.  The situation amongst the non-commissioned officers and privates in the Army Medical Corps is similar to that of officers&mdash;there is no room for promotion, no prospect of promotion.  If a man has to be induced or enticed to become a first-class man at his work there is no room for promotion&mdash;you cannot recognise the ability and knowledge by promotion.  In the Army Medical Service that particular situation is met by what is called certificate pay.  A private soldier who passes a first examination in first-aid and nursing and shows an expert knowledge of first-aid and nursing gets 9d. per day extra pay.  The more advanced soldier who goes in for a further examination and gets his second certificate in first-aid and nursing <Col N="531" /> gets a second extra pay of 9d. per day.  The higher class of soldier can specialise in some particular branch of hospital work, and if he passes a very stiff examination he will get a third certificate carrying another 9d. per day.  So that the privates in the Army Medical Service can draw 2/3 per day extra pay&mdash;their extra pay, in fact, is as much as the basic pay. pay.</P>
    <P>Was any attention paid to those individuals, hardworking loyal soldiers, when those regulations were being drafted or is it because they are only stretcher-bearers and the Army has used them up, that, when their time is up, no consideration is to be given them, no pension for the pay they drew all through the years because of special knowledge, and pay that was reflected in special benefit to the Army arising out of that knowledge?  No Deputy or no man of principle can stand over the application of that scheme to specialist officers in the Army.</P>

      <P>It is introduced now to a great extent because the political Opposition in the Dáil demanded it, and because the people introducing it were guaranteed in advance the assistance of Deputies here in putting it through.  I do not want to be switched off my line of thought by referring to the past but I would ask any Deputy opposite, if an Army pension scheme were introduced ten years ago, no matter what the terms contained in it, would it not have been opposed, root <Col N="532" /> and branch?  The scheme in its main application to the greater part of the Army is a reasonable scheme and, in fact, an equitable scheme, but in its application to the specialist services it is most unjust.  I am sorry that there was no opportunity given to anyone to call the Minister's attention to this before it was introduced here in the Dáil, where it can only be met by negative action and opposition.</P>
      <P>I was a party to urging the inadvisability of having Army matters treated in the Dáil as a ping-pong ball between Parties.  I urged the advisability of a deputation of the Irish Medical Union seeing the Minister in private so as to avoid any discussion here.  It was because the Minister unwisely refused to discuss it with a deputation representing Irish doctors that we were left with no alternative but the undesirable one of making it an issue here in the Dáil.  I would rather it were otherwise and I did my best to have it otherwise.  I regret it was not otherwise.  I think when the Minister refused to talk over these matters with professional leaders behind the scenes and away from the atmosphere of controversy here, he was making a very grave mistake. However, the fact remains that the Minister's proposals, as contained herein, are that where there is a difference of 100 per cent. in the pay of officers holding similar rank for the purposes of pension, that situation should be met by the addition of 20 per cent. to the pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a medical service. He has a commanding officer of that service, and I should like to ask if the Minister got any advice with regard to the peculiar position of that service. Was the Director of the Army Medical Service consulted?  I do not say that, if he were, his advice should necessarily be accepted, but was this scheme decided upon without asking for the opinion of that officer?  If it was, it appears to me to be a very sinister departure from all established precedent, a departure in a very unwise direction, because I do not see why a man should be paid as commanding officer of a corps and that man's advice shut out when it comes to a question of formulating financial provisions <Col N="533" /> most intimately affecting that corps. We have the suggestion of 20 per cent. Is there any Deputy who thinks that that meets the case?  We have no provision for the non-commissioned officer or the private soldier who is getting a special rate because of his membership of the medical corps.  That certificate pay of 2/3 per day is as much the pay of that poor soldier as the basis couple of bob.  Is there any justification for throwing him out on a pension based on only half the pay he drew as a soldier?</P>
    <P>I concede this much to the Minister, that he would not be responsible for those proposals if he had been made aware of their effect.  The reason that those proposals are there is because, unfortunately, he did not get the advice of those who were familiar with details that are naturally obscure and remote from a man in the position of the Minister.  I do not believe for one moment that he would come into the House and propose that any soldier should be pensioned on the basis only of half his pay, or that any two officers, whose pay differs by as much as 200 per cent., should be pensioned on a flat rate plus 20 per cent.  Now, the Minister may have been advised by further uneasy prickings of the conscience on the part of those who drafted those proposals to try to meet the situation in another way, which sounds all right until you look into it. There is a counter-proposal made to meet the position of a peculiar specialist service such as the medical service, namely, that if they do not like these rates of pension, they may have pensions based on 1-60th of the annual pay for each year served. Doubtless, precedents from other services were quoted to show that that was the normal rate.  In the first place, I should like to point out that it is quite an abnormal rate, that I do not know of any service beyond certain branches of the poor law service &mdash;in which a man can serve until he is ninety years of age or older&mdash;where the pension rate is 1-60th of the annual pay for each year of service.</P>
    <P>In the sister service, the Civic Guard, the pension rates are 1-60th of the year's pay for each year served up <Col N="534" /> to 20 years, and after that 1-30th of the year's pay for each year served, so that after 30 years' service a man would have 40-60ths, that is to say, two-thirds, of his pay as pension. That is very far from a flat rate of 1-60th of a year's pay for each year served.  In the asylum service, a doctor on retirement is given 1-50th of a year's pay, with allowances, for each year served, and, there, there is no suggestion of early demobilisation.  In the Army Medical Service, we all know that the highest commissioned rank, with the exception of four officers, is captain.</P>
    <P>The average age of these men on joining the service was 30 years.  How long would it take a man to get a half-pay pension?  Thirty years.  You might picture generals of the age of 60 ambling around the barracks, but could any of you picture an army with captains about the age of 60 tottering around the barracks?  Junior ranks and senior years go very badly together, and are unknown in any army.</P>
    <P>It would be unheard of to have a captain at the age of 60.  Captain is the highest rank that can be attained by any officer in that service, except four. The offer of 1/60th of a year's pay for each year's service means nothing. Those men will be out by 55.  The highest rate of pension they can get is 25/60ths after a life of service. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until to-morrow.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Standard of Living.&mdash;Abolition of Duties on Food Stuffs (Motion).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties, and like impositions on food stuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When this motion in the names of Deputies McGilligan and Morrissey was moved on the last day that the Dáil met, I expressed the opinion that the proposer or seconder of it should have attempted to demonstrate, by reference to known facts, first, that the standard of living of the community had been lowered; secondly, that if so, it was due to Government action; and, thirdly, that the proposal embodied in the motion would operate to raise the standard of living.  Neither the proposer nor the seconder of the motion attempted to demonstrate anything of the kind, and accordingly I thought it necessary to give the Dáil all the available statistical information relating to economic activites and social matters for the purpose of demonstrating that since 1934 there had been, not a lowering of the standard of living of the community, but, if anything, a raising of the standard of living.  From the facts which I gave&mdash;facts which are available to all Deputies&mdash;I argued that it was a reasonable deduction that, during that period, at least the average standard of living&mdash;that is to say, the standard of living of the average person&mdash;had improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I want to emphasise that the only conclusion which can be drawn from the facts which I gave is one relating to the standard of living of the average person.  Now, it is a well-known trick in debate to try to disprove or discredit a conclusion of that kind by relating it to facts within the experience of individuals or of particular classes, and I notice that a number of newspaper writers who thought fit to comment upon my remarks attempted that trick.  It is perfectly true, of course, that during that period the standard of living of some classes improved more than that of others, and for some there was no improvement at all.  People with fixed <Col N="536" /> incomes are, of course, adversely and immediately affected by any rise in the price of commodities.  The unemployed, people with no incomes, are equally adversely affected, but the experience of individual classes or of particular sections of the community does not offset or destroy the general conclusion to be drawn from the available information, and that is that the average standard of living has risen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey asks why I confine my investigations to the years from 1934.  I notice that Deputy McGilligan has tabled a number of Parliamentary questions for written answer, asking in relation to the years prior to 1931 the same information as I gave to the Dáil in relation to the years from 1934.  That information was supplied to Deputy McGilligan, and will be available to all Deputies in the report of the Dáil Debates which will be published on Friday.  I invite every Deputy in this House who is really concerned to study the problem raised by this motion on a basis of facts to pay particular attention to that information, and not to be satisfied with that only&mdash;because Deputy McGilligan asked his questions with a view to using the information in this debate, and consequently did not ask for information he did not want&mdash;but to go to the Statistical Abstract which is published by my Department, and get the much fuller and much more comprehensive information relating to those matters which is available in that publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any comparison between the year 1931 and the year 1936 would be of doubtful value unless it were accompanied by an adequate explanation of any change in conditions produced by legislation or otherwise which occured in the meantime.  In any event, the significant thing for those who wish to study this problem is not the actual position in a particular year, but the trend of events over a number of years; and if Deputies study the statistical information concerning the years in respect of which Deputy McGilligan is curious&mdash;the three years prior to 1931&mdash;and all the information relating to all those years available in the Statistical Abstract, they will see at once as the outstanding and startling <Col N="537" /> fact that those years were years of consistent decline.  During those years the consumption of commodities decreased, commercial activity fell off, the numbers of employed were lessened and unemployment increased. Deputy Morrissey looks surprised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say to Deputy Morrissey what I said on the last occasion that I am going to give him no fact without telling him the source of it, and he can check its accuracy for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consult a few housekeepers.  They would tell him more than all his statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consult the housekeepers in due course.  Those facts which I am giving to Deputies are all available in the Statistical Abstract. In the year 1931 the consumption of beer was less than in the year 1936, but, more important than that, the consumption in 1931 was less than in 1930, and in 1930 it was less than in 1929.  The figures are as follows:&mdash; 1929, 728, 342 standard barrels; in 1930, 689,194; and in 1931, 555,574.  The consumption of spirits in 1931 was higher than in 1936.  I give that fact to Deputies for what use they want to make of it.  It is about the only straw they can get to support their motion.  In my opinion, the significant fact is that the consumption of sprits in 1931 was less than in 1930, and in 1930 less than in 1929.  The consumption of tobacco in 1931 was less than in 1936.  The figure are: 1931, monthly average consumption, 710,300 lbs., and in 1936, 754,000 lbs.  The number of new motor cars registered in 1931 was about half the number registered in 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for 1931 were 371 and for 1936 the figures were 676.  Again, the significant fact is not that there has been that increase since this Government came into office, but that in 1931 the figures were less than <Col N="538" /> in 1930, in which year the number of registered cars was 445.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for the year before are not available.  Post Office Savings Bank deposits, less withdrawals, were considerably higher in 1936 than in 1931.  Here is another fact that Deputies may take some consolation from.  Savings Certificates sales, less repayments, were higher. It is true that in the intervening period there has been a transfer of preference from Savings Certificates to the Post Office Savings Bank, due to the obvious fact that the rate of interest upon the sales of Savings Certificates has been reduced.</P>

      <P>I submit that the essential fact is not what the amount deposited or saved in a particular year was as against another year, but what the total savings of the people who avail of these services were in these periods.  This time, I am quoting from the quarterly statistical bulletin of the Currency Commission.  The total amount standing to the credit of depositors in 1931 was £3,703,000&mdash;that was in the Post Office Saving Bank&mdash; and in 1936 it was £7,470,000.  The amount of Savings Certificates outstanding in 1931 was £6,352,000 and in 1937 it was £7,868,000&mdash;on June 30th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will somebody add those figures; perhaps the Deputy cannot add.  So much for the first set of figures I gave.  Now, with regard to commercial activity, I mentioned on the last day that the best source of information as to the volume of our commercial activity is the value of the cheques, notes and bills cleared through the ordinary commercial banks.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly average clearance of cheques, notes and bills through the Dublin banks in 1931 was £4,880,000 and in 1936 the figure was £5,570,000.  Another figure I gave as an indication of commercial activity was the traffic receipts on railways&mdash; railway traffic receipts.  Again, I want Deputies to remember that if they go to the sources of information which I have indicated they will find in relation to the years prior to 1931 that there was a steady decline in commercial activities of all kinds as against the steady increase in commercial <Col N="540" /> activity recorded for the past three years.  Railway traffic receipts declined steadily and seriously from 1929 to 1931.</P>

      <P>Railway traffic receipts declined from 1929 to 1931.  If any comparison is to be made between traffic receipts during that period and the last three years, consideration must be given to the effect of the <Col N="541" /> transport legislation enacted in 1933 and to the subsequent closing down of a number of railway lines in this country, and also in particular to the transfer of traffic from the railways to the roads.  The monthly average number of passengers carried upon road transport services in 1931 was 4,898,000 and in 1936 it was 7,830,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. You have just heard the Minister making an observation.  I will now quote, in submitting the point of order, from Column 226 of Volume 69, No. 2:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These figures are available by reason of the fact that traffic was diverted from the roads to the railways... The average number of passengers carried by road transport in 1934 was 7,780,000.  I will leave out 1935, because the figures that year were influenced by the Dublin Tramways strike, which lasted three or four months.  In 1936 the average number of passengers carried by road transport was 7,830,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has dropped 50,000 passengers to-night&mdash;that is the only difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>In any case, all this will help in the process of building up Deputy Dillon's education.  Deputies opposite do not want these facts. They have been masquerading in the country in a dishonest campaign against this Government and that is the reason for all these indignant protests. Let me now deal with another aspect of the situation, the issue of unemployment insurance stamps&mdash;and these figures relate to men only.  In 1929 the monthly average number of <Col N="542" /> sheets of stamps issued was 2,475.  By 1930 that had fallen to 2,276, and by 1931 it had fallen to 2,178.  Then this Government came into office and the decline stopped, and in 1936 the number had increased to 2,898.  Similar figures can be given in respect of women and youths.  The average number of unemployment insurance claims current on the last Monday of each month in 1931 was 17,952.  In this case there had been a steady increase on the previous two years.  The figure for 1936 was 16,040.  I am not giving the same information that I gave the last day.  The weekly expenditure for unemployment insurance benefit for 1931 was £10,780.  In 1936, the figure was £9,690.  The number of persons upon home assistance in 1931 was the same as in the previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because less people claimed it.  So much for Deputy Morrissey's question and the obvious line of defence which Deputy McGilligan was preparing.  Whether we compare the circumstances now with those existing in the immediately preceding years, or compare the circumstances, say, for those three years, with the three years before the change of Government, we can find no evidence whatever to support the contention that the standard of living of the people of this country has been decreasing.  I then went on to examine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, he admits it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the second line of defence which those speaking on the motion before us put up.  They said that the Minister cannot deny that the cost of living has risen.  I do, because the cost of living has not risen in this country any more than in a number of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ignores the index figure of the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we had from a number of newspaper writers the adoption of the same trick to which I have referred&mdash;the attempt to make a relationship between that and a general conclusion from the prices of a number of commodities.  It is quite true that the prices of some commodities have risen more than others, but that fact does not destroy or weaken in any way the main conclusion to be drawn from the facts that the rise in the cost of living here since 1934 was proportionately no greater than in any other country.  It is quite true that the fall in the cost of living which took place here before 1934 was more severe than in other countries because, not merely did we get the effect of world conditions but we also had the reaction of the special measures adopted against ourselves by the British Government in relation to the economic war.  Even if Opposition Deputies could have shown that the cost of living had risen here it would not indicate any greater measure of recovery than that to which other nations had been able to point.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the third question with which I did not deal the last time, namely that the change of Government policy&mdash;a change which this motion advocates&mdash;would, in fact, raise the standard of living.  That is obviously the question on which Deputies must be satisfied before they vote for this motion.  Before Deputies vote for this and before we make a change of policy, let us be satisfied that we are going to improve the circumstances which now exist.  If it be shown that the circumstances will not be improved, then the case for the motion falls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have confused the standard of living with the cost of living.  We could have in this country a lower cost-of-living index and at the same time a much lower average standard of living.  A reduction in the price of commodities, particularly for a community like ours, one half of whom get their livelihood from the land, might mean a very serious diminution of the standard of living of those people employed in agriculture and the average standard of living for the whole country.  On the other hand, a rise in the price of foodstuffs, <Col N="544" /> even greater than we have known, might well operate to raise the average standard of living by raising the standard of living of those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the standard of living and deplores the lowering of the standard of living even though the speeches related only to the cost of living.  And we are asked to reverse the policy of the Government and to abolish all &ldquo;taxes, levies, duties and the like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life&rdquo;, on the ground that that would raise the standard of living.  In the motion we are asked to do that.  The speeches of Deputies ask us to do that because, as they allege, these levies and duties are affecting the cost of living.  The standard of living of our community would be increased if the national income were increased.  That was the contention.  I believe that the national income might increase for the benefit of certain classes in the community without affecting other classes.</P>
    <P>The question we have to ask ourselves is whether the adoption of this motion, abolishing forthwith all these taxes, levies, duties and like impositions would increase production here and raise the price of exports, because there is no other way by which the national income could be raised.

      <P>This Government is charged with the responsibility of looking after the affairs of this country and they will not be prevented from doing their duty.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; is able to show a corresponding increase in industrial production.  Between the years 1929 and 1936 only four other countries in the whole world showed an increase in industrial production.  These were Russia, Japan, Sweden and Great Britain, but no country except Russia was able to show such a substantial increase as ours.  World production declined by 14.8 per cent., according to the figures in the issue of the <i>Statist</i> of the 25th September.  Our expansion, therefore was not favoured in any way by world circumstances. The actual increase in the value of industrial production of the 25 industries that are included in our limited census of production for the period between 1929 and 1936 was £23,000,000.  The increase in employment was 32,000, and in wages £2,500,000.  The wages paid to them increased by £2¼ millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If, instead of these 25 industries, we turn to all industries assisted by Government measures&mdash; tariffs, levies and duties&mdash;the increase <Col N="547" /> in employment in these industries in March of this year as compared with the period before the tariffs were imposed was 49,400.  A reversal to the 1931 position&mdash;the adoption of the policy contained in this motion, for which Deputy Byrne and others on the opposite side are going to vote&mdash;would mean not merely an immediate financial crisis but an immediate employment crisis, because 49,400 persons would immediately lose the remunerative occupations they now have.  That is what Deputies opposite are asking. It is in respect of that that Deputy Byrne is protesting we are not going quick enough.  How is that reversal going to raise the standard of living? How will it affect the cost of living of those who will lose their employment? I know that many Deputies are going to run away from this motion when it comes to a question of voting for it. But that is what is down in the motion.  The main Opposition Party move a motion the effect of which would be to destroy these industries and put 50,000 people out of work. Let that be recorded of them.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to agriculture.  As a result of those taxes, levies, duties and the like to which the motion refers and which we are asked to abolish, the imports of bacon were reduced from £1,289,000 in 1931 to nothing.  On the last occasion, I mentioned a figure of £400,000.  That was wrong.  The imports were 400,000 cwts. but the value of the imports was £1,289,000.  We reduced the imports of butter from £176,000 to nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that question in a minute.  I am going to make my own speech and not the speech Deputy Cosgrave wants me to make.  In the category of foodstuffs of animal origin, a valuable additional market was made available to the Irish farmer since 1931, amounting to over £2,000,000.  In the cereals group, the <Col N="548" /> increased production of wheat represents a new market for the Irish farmer value for about £2,000,000.  The value of the new market created by the sugar beet development amounts to over £1,000,000.  The total import of foodstuffs since 1931 has been reduced by £7,000,000.  If we adopted the policy contained in this motion and if we knocked off all these duties, levies and taxes forthwith&mdash;that is what the motion asks&mdash;there would be an immediate reduction of agricultural output by £7,000,000.  Is that going to raise the standard of living of the farmers?</P>

      <P>The adoption of the policy contained in the motion would involve a decrease in industrial production, a decrease in agricultural production, less employment, more unemployment, reduction of the national income, and a consequent lowering of the average standard of living of our people.  Is that too high a price to pay for a lowering of the cost of commodities?  I think it is, and the policy of this Government is based on acceptance of that assumption. The Party opposite stand for <Col N="549" /> low prices at any cost&mdash;and that is not an Irish bull.  They want cheap goods in the shop windows even if the people have no money with which to buy them.  That is their objective.  That is what they are aiming at in this motion. They did not ask themselves whether the adoption of the motion would help them in that objective.  The necessaries of life to which the motion refers are food, clothing, fuel and shelter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as food is concerned, I can say in respect of beef, mutton, milk, pork and potatoes that the national average retail prices now prevailing are lower than they were in 1931, and, consequently, these prices would not be affected in the least by the adoption of this motion.  I wonder if Deputies opposite are really sincere in complaining about the prices being charged for these commodities.  If we were to get a vote of the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party in which they would express their real opinion as to whether Governmental action should be directed towards increasing or decreasing the prices of these commodities, I venture to say we would get a majority in favour of increasing them.  Do Deputies opposite think that the price of eggs is too high? The current market price in the Saorstát is 1/1½ per dozen.  Do they think that the farmers should get less for their eggs?  That is what they complain of in the motion&mdash;that the price is too high.  Does Deputy Finlay or Deputy Fagan think that the price of cattle is too high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Dillon says that the price of eggs is not high enough.  Does Deputy Gorey complain that the price of pigs is too high? Does Deputy Bennett complain that the price of milk is too high?  They do not mean a word of this motion.  They put that down for the purpose of getting a knock at the Government, but they have no serious intention of carrying out that policy if they ever <Col N="550" /> get into the position to do anything of the sort.  These commodities can be left out of account, because it is clear that the price of them would not be affected by the policy contained in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of bacon between September, 1936, and September, 1937, increased by 7 per cent.  An increase took place here also&mdash;an increase largely, if not entirely, due to the increased price given for pigs to the farmers.  The average price paid for pigs in the Saorstát markets on the 19th September, 1936, was 57/6 per cwt.  On the 19th September, 1937, the price was 67/9 per cwt.&mdash;an increase of 10/3.  Do any of the Deputies opposite say that that price is too high?  Is that the price of which they are complaining, or do they allege that the bacon curers are profiteering?  Let them ask Deputy Gorey or Deputy Dillon about that.  They are both directors of bacon factories.  What about butter? Deputies have been following the controversy between the Minister for Agriculture and the Creamery Managers' Association.  The Creamery Managers' Association want to increase the price of butter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Now you want to put the cost of living up.  Let us turn to the case of sugar.  The retail price of sugar in 1936 was the same as it was in 1931, but Deputies opposite who are interested in these matters will have noticed that all the sugar exporting countries recently met at a conference in London and arrived at an agreement to increase the export price of sugar to what they regard as an economic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What was that price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That agreement has not functioned very satisfactorily up to the present, but inevitably it will be tightened up and made effective in due course.  If this motion were adopted, what would we have?  We would have all these sugar factories closed down, and Deputy Morrissey could then go down to Thurles and explain to the workers in Thurles that the shutting down of that factory was going to raise their standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister trying to intimidate me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And other Deputies could go and explain to the beet growers how the abolition of beet growing and free imports of foreign sugar were going to raise their standard of living.  I should like to see them at <Col N="552" /> it.  If we adopt the policy in this motion, we close our beet factories, we stop beet growing, we increase unemployment and, at the end of it, get a rising price for sugar.</P>
      <P>With regard to tea, I will admit at once that it is not very easy to make a comparison between the retail price of tea in any one period against another because there is such a variety of blends and quality, but I invite Deputies to inspect the table of figures given in reply to a Parliamentary question by Deputy Norton to-day.  From it they will find that the average import price of tea in July, 1931, was 1/6.9 and in July, 1937, 1/4.7.  In any event, the price of tea would not be affected by this motion.  We have had a lot of talk about the price of flour.  Deputies opposite have, in fact, based their case almost entirely on the price of flour.  It is quite true that flour prices would be reduced if the policy of free imports was resumed, but I think we can deal with the flour situation without resorting to that device.  I am not satisfied with the price of flour.  I do not allege, as Deputies opposite have, that there is widespread profiteering, but I do think it possible to reorganise the industry in order to effect a lower price which will still be profitable to the producers. Deputy Dillon says that the solution is competition.  Competition is one solution, but it is not the only, and I do not think it is the best solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison, at a meeting of his own private parliament in Kilkenny, the week before last, spoke about some plot he has discovered, some nefarious plot of the Government to increase the number of port mills to the detriment of the mills in Kilkenny, and of how the Labour Party had stepped into the breach and defeated the plot Either Deputy Pattison's imagination is very good or my memory is very bad, because I have no recollection of it.  I assume from his remarks that their solution of the flour milling position is not increased competition, and they are right in that, because undue competition means only insecurity in their employment for the workers and consequently a diminution in their annual earnings.  I say that the flour milling situation can be dealt with otherwise <Col N="553" /> than by the policy proposed in this motion, and we propose to do it.  We got a solution from Deputy Davin, too, a solution which has various attractive features, although I believe Deputy Davin was making sure he would have a good get-away from the responsibility of having made the proposal if by any chance it were adopted.  We can deal with the situation, however, but if the case for this motion is based on flour, and flour only, I say that it falls, because we can deal with the position in respect of flour without at the same time destroying the millions of pounds of capital which have been invested in the flour milling industry or abandoning the wheat scheme which is so profitable and so useful to the farmers of this country.  Do you stand for the termination of the wheat scheme? Why were you so anxious at the last general election to explain to the electors that if you got into office you were, of course, going to carry it on? Because you had not the courage to tell the electorate what you really stood for.</P>

There was no such increase here.  Coal is, of course, not subject to duty, and consequently its price would not be influenced by this motion.</P>

      <P>All our coal imports come from Great Britain now, as they did prior to 1931, but they come with this difference, that prior to 1931 British coal was exported to Ireland at an average price considerably in excess of the average price of British coal exported to other countries.  Time <Col N="554" /> and again when we were in opposition, we protested to the Government then in office against that state of affairs being allowed to continue but they took no action.  Now, however, as a result of the negotiations we entered into at the beginning of this year, for the first time the average price of British coal exported here in this year is lower than the average price of British coal exported generally to other countries.  I do not claim that the British have given us anything in that matter other than what we are entitled to.</P>

      <P>With regard to clothing, Saorstát Eireann factories for the manufacture of clothing and boots are numerous and very well equipped.  I think some Deputies&mdash;Deputy Pattison was one&mdash;are inclined to complain that they are too numerous, and that competition has become excessive, with the result that employment is becoming periodic.  They are, however, as I have said, all new factories equipped with the most modern machinery, and although in some cases their labour costs are considerably higher than in Great Britain, they have off-setting advantages.  As compared with Great Britain, therefore, there has been no increase in the price of clothing and boots and shoes over and above what might reasonably be expected from the rising prices of raw materials.  I am, however, prepared to concede this to Deputies, that if we remove all these taxes, duties and other restrictions, we shall be able to get clothing, boots and like articles from Japan and similar countries at much lower prices than those at which we could produce them here or those at which they can be produced in Great Britain.  I know that that is their policy.  They want to see Japanese clothing, Danish butter, Argentine beef and American bacon for sale in our markets here, even though it means all the evil consequences to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think any fair minded person will agree that I have given a fair estimate in respect of all the articles which might be held to be necessaries of life.  What he stated as the proposed policy in respect of some of them would be to effect a reduction in prices, in respect of many would have no effect upon prices and, in respect of a few, would actually raise prices.  It would involve the immediate destruction of national assets that have been built up with great difficulty, would be the cause of widespread unemployment, and would cause immediate destitution in many homes.  Is it worth that cost? That is the question Deputies opposite must answer.  They must put to themselves this question: Are they prepared to face up to the consequences of their own policy?  When seeking the votes of the electors they advocated a very different course of action from that which this motion suggests. They were very careful to explain then, that if they got a majority the industrial programme would not be interfered with; the wheat scheme would not be interrupted; the price of milk to the creameries would be increased, and the price of other <Col N="557" /> articles produced by farmers would be raised.  But the first motion they brought before the Dáil was one to destroy and to reverse our industrial policy, to reduce prices of all articles in the production of which farmers are interested; and from this until the next election they are going to explain that away, but will not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>We have problems to deal with here, problems of price as well as other things, and I think we can deal with these problems without abandoning the national plan, of which the people have approved.  If any indication of public approval were necessary, it is the fact that the Party opposite at the recent election endeavoured to frame their policy as closely as they dared to the policy of the Government.  If excessive prices are being charged for some articles, we can deal with that. We can secure efficiency and economy in production, and we can eliminate waste and undue profit-making without destroying what is now the whole basis of our prosperity.  This idea of a reversion to the policy of free trade has been advocated on many occasions here, but no Deputy has ever attempted to paint a picture of what a reversal to free trade would mean to this country.  If there are any people on earth who know what free trade means, we are that people.  We have seen it in operation for over a century, and during that time we have seen our country depopulated, our natural resources undeveloped, and our industries neglected.  Yet that is the policy the Party opposite wish to get back to.  The policy of the Government is the removal of all the social and economic evils that were widespread when we came into office. No one, much less myself, is going to claim that all that can be done, or even all that might be done, has been done.  A great deal remains yet to be achieved, but a great deal has been done, and, more than anything else, we have equipped the nation with the resources wherewith to do so.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House proposes a policy of despair. <Col N="558" /> There is nothing in the circumstances of this country to justify a policy of despair.  There is every ground for optimism.  When Deputies vote on this motion I trust they will kill and bury for ever this free trade idea, because it is only when we get in this House general acceptance of the fact that the policy in operation is going to continue, that we may get some common action in order to deal with many of the pressing problems before us.  If we are going to solve these problems, it is by thinking as one Party.  I appeal to some members of the Party opposite, who are really sincere, to get away from the idea of Party manoeuvring, appealing to public ignorance and to public prejudices, in order to score points against the Government, and to come forward with concrete suggestions that can be debated and acted upon by the majority of the people's representatives. If we can get that done, the first step is to kill this idea of a free trade policy for ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a pretty brazen-faced performance.  Mind you, it is interesting to know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is being found out by his own people, because Deputies will have noticed that at the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, or should I describe it as &ldquo;the recent Fianna Fáil riot,&rdquo; that took place in this city he was not put up; he was not trotted out.  The riot went on without him.  It went on without him because his own colleagues know how unacceptable the kind of fraudulent misrepresentation to which we have listened to-night is to delegates who come from the country, and who know of their own experience of the sufferings of the people, for which that gentleman's policy is largely responsible. The Minister for Industry and Commerce used figures that deceive. Anyone who has ever had experience of figures and statistics knows how easily they can be twisted and turned for the purpose of fooling people who are not in the habit of handling them. I must say that it always irritates me a little when I am told that the country is prosperous because the number of motor cars is increasing.  The small <Col N="559" /> farmers in the congested districts who move pigs to market in motor cars are few and far between, and if the tariff-mongers in Dublin are increasing their motor cars, and getting two limousines where a horse-trap did in the past, that does not carry much comfort to the unfortunate people whom they are plundering down the country.</P>
      <P>If you take the total registration of motor cars as a kind of guide to the increasing prosperity of the transport trade, and of the type of persons who ordinarily use motor cars, and compare the figures, you will find that even in that restricted sphere the Minister's figures have been deliberately twisted to deceive this House, and to bolster up his own case, because in August, 1927, taking cars of all classes, there were 45,757 registrations and in August, 1931, four years later, 57,452. That was an increase in the last four years of Cumann na nGaedheal of about 12,000 cars.  In August, 1935, the total registration showed 57,598 or a total increase during the four years of the Fianna Fáil administration of 146 cars. If that is evidence, the wealth of the people increased 120 times as much during the last four years of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government as it did during the four years of Fianna Fáil administration, because there was an increase of 12,000 cars in use by the people during the last four years Cumann na nGaedheal was in office and an increase of merely 146 cars during the first four years when Fianna Fáil was in office.  I do not attach any importance to the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Transport Act was meant to save the railway companies.  The Minister to-night said: &ldquo;Look at the railway receipts, and compare them.  Are they not evidence of increasing prosperity?&rdquo;  I ask the Minister: &ldquo;Did he read a speech of Mr. Morton, General Manager of <Col N="560" /> the Great Southern Railways, at the last meeting of that company?  It suits the Minister to talk about the increase in railway receipts, but when Deputy Davin asks for the restoration of cuts in railway wages Mr. Morton gets up at the last meeting of the company and says: &ldquo;It is not for me to criticise what the people did in 1932.  They chose the way of sacrifice, and the reduction in the receipts of the railway company is our part of that sacrifice,&rdquo; and having deliberately chosen it, we must face it for what it is.  His lamenation is that the railway receipts are going down, and that the railway company is going down with them.  Now, who is right? Is the general manager of the railway company, or is the Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
      <P>The Minister waxes eloquent on the subject of bacon.  He says: what would happen if we had a free market in bacon?  I will tell you.  The consumer in this country would not be paying 4d. per lb. on every lb. of bacon he eats in order to provide cheap Irish bacon for the British consumer. So that if you take off all your levies and taxes you will increase the price of pork here to-morrow by at least 15/- per cwt., and on the same day you will bring down the price of bacon by 2d. or 3d. per lb.  Nobody knows that better than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister chose to refer to the fact that the late Deputy Hogan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, was the Minister responsible for putting the first tariff on bacon.  I remember that the late Minister made that the occasion of one of the most extraordinary speeches ever made in this House. Speaking from the benches opposite he said: &ldquo;I am introducing this tariff in order to satisfy the cods in this country.  It is a cod of a tariff; it will do no good.  On the contrary, it will injure the industry, but there are types of fools in this world, and the only way in which you can teach them sense is by giving them a little experience of their own folly.  I cannot teach fools by argument the criminal folly it is to put this tariff on bacon, but I will teach them by experience.&rdquo; And he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> Taking a leaf from that great man's book, I say that we should maintain the wheat scheme in operation in this country, referred to by the Minister, until every farmer in Ireland is praying God for its conclusion.  I can tell you that there are lots of farmers at the present time looking out through their windows at their green fields of wheat in November, and blessing the Minister that told them to grow more wheat.  There are lots of farmers in this country who are trying to sell their wheat to the millers now and who find that their yield is four and a half barrels to the statute acre, and they are blessing the Minister who told them to grow more wheat.  There are lots of farmers in this country looking out on their land on which nothing grew at all this year except thistles and scutch, and blessing the Minister who told them to grow more wheat, but the Minister took damn good care not to grow any wheat himself.  There are fools in this country who believe that the salvation of the agricultural community depends on the growing of wheat, such as some of the sages sitting on the back benches opposite.  The only way to drive a nail into their heads is to drive it in with the hammer of experience.  There is no use trying to penetrate their intelligence with argument.  There is no conceivable method of making individuals, such as you find represented in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, learn anything but in the bitter school of experience. I recognise that it is a hard thing that the whole population of the country should have to learn the bitter lesson in the same bitter way, but at the same time it is a good thing.  It is worth it if you can teach them the lesson once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister waxes eloquent on the subject of employment.  There is a vast mass of figures connected with that.  Before I deal with them perhaps I should say that everybody knows why the Minister repeated his speech here to-night.  Everyone knows that the <i>Irish Press</i> got instructions about 4 o'clock this afternoon that the Minister was going to talk and that they were to send down two good shorthand men to report him fully <Col N="562" /> because the report of the speech would be useful for to-morrow's issue.</P>
    <P>In to-morrow's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> you will see, &ldquo;Slashing and remarkable statement by our brilliant young Minister for Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; and of how he enthralled the House by his amazing exposé of Government policy.  Of course, it was all in last week's paper and it will be all in to-morrow's paper, with a leading article the morning following, and even some poor dupes down the country will be impressed.</P>
    <P>I do not care to mention the name of a person who is not here to speak for herself, but a member of the Kildare Board of Health was so intoxicated by a statement of the Minister's that she said at a recent meeting of the board: &ldquo;In a short time here in the county of Kildare we will not want home assistance at all.&rdquo;  She said that employment was increasing, that everyone was waxing fat and that no one would want unemployment assistance. What are the facts about the County Kildare?  I think the Minister has managed to establish several factories there.  He started one, the glorious sausage factory in Naas, and while it lasted it smelt beautifully. Even though it disappeared, others have been established in that county. I imagine that the Minister would take the County Kildare as a county in which the industrial and agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil was pretty well tried out and in full operation. Let us examine the effect of Fianna Fáil policy on Kildare.</P>

      <P>But what are the facts about Kildare?  I want to give the exact figures published by the Minister's own Department with regard to employment in the County Kildare, comparing the year 1931 with the year 1936.  In the year 1931 males, members of families working in County Kildare in agricultural employment, numbered 339, and in 1936 the number was 300, a reduction of 39 persons.  Of permanently employed there was a reduction of six, temporary a reduction of nine&mdash; that is, of males under 18 years and over 14.  As regards males between 18 and over, in the case of members of families, there was a reduction of 289, that is from 5,204 to 4,915.  Permanent males of 18 and over, not member of farmers' families, there was a reduction of 46, from 3,810 to 3,764.  Of temporarily employed there was a considerable increase from 1,726 to 2,358. If you allow for the temporary employment, the increase over the whole county was 243 persons in agricultural employment, comparing the year 1931 with 1936; but observe that in every grade of permanent employment of men there is a decrease in the County Kildare.  The only increase was in the case of the temporarily employed, of men working broken time.</P>

      <P>They would want to get it because the rate of wages paid in the County Kildare in 1931 was 26/-, while in 1936 it was 20/-.  It has gone up to 24/- now, I suppose, since the Agricultural Wages Act was passed, but, in fact, the permanent workers in agriculture are 2/- a week worse off to-day than they were in 1931.  The Minister was explaining to us that in 1931 we were experiencing a fearful slump in which the cost of living was deeply depressed by the universal slump all over the world and that it was lower than it now is.  The cost of living in 1931 was lower than it now is, but the wages of agricultural labourers in Kildare were higher than they now are. <Col N="564" /> The cost of living there is now substantially higher than it was in 1931, and the wages of the agricultural labourers are substantially lower, but the Minister says that there is no decrease in the standard of living, and that the people are better off than they were before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he is.  In any case, however, that disposes of the situation as it obtains in Kildare.  I want to make this submission to the House, however, and I think it is the really important aspect of this situation. We all know that the cost of living has gone up.  We all know that the people are suffering intensely. There is not a single Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party who lives in rural Ireland who does not know that as well as I do.  Certainly the Deputies in Donegal know it peculiarly well, because the people in West Donegal have suffered acutely from the rise in the price of flour, of Indian meal and of bacon.  It is idle to waste time discussing the question as to whether, in fact, that rise in the cost of living has taken place or not.  We all know that it has.  Apart from that, however, I want to make a submission to the House from quite another angle, and a much graver angle.  I want to submit to this House that the rise in the cost of living is not in itself a primary evil at all.  I think it is a symptom of a developing situation, and my submission is that the steep rise in the cost of living and the simultaneous evacuation of the country by tens of thousands of emigrants are two classical signs of incipient national bankruptey, and I want to take this occasion to outline that matter most fully.  I want to outline that matter most fully, for this reason: that when that disaster is upon us, each one of us will have to ask ourselves the question whether we are entitled to refer to it at length at all, because when the disaster of national disintegration comes upon us a word may destroy the whole situation and may precipitate the exodus of capital from this country which would finally launch us into complete and irretrievable national bankruptcy.  That situation has not yet been reached, and it is our duty, <Col N="565" /> before it has been reached and while the question can be ventilated without doing harm to the national credit, to ventilate it now.  I quite see that, to a certain extent, one is fated to be a Cassandra in this matter, because certain Deputies in this House, of course, will say: &ldquo;We cannot believe that.  We cannot see it.  We do not understand it, and what we do not understand we will not believe.&rdquo; Some people, however, may understand it, and therefore may help to bring pressure on the Ministry to take the essential steps to prevent that disaster coming upon us.  I say that this country is travelling the same road as Newfoundland has travelled.</P>

      <P>I did.  I said exactly the same thing in 1934, and Deputy Kelly is now learning that what I told him in 1934 was true&mdash;that what I told him in 1934 he believes in 1937. It is not the first thing that I taught Deputy Kelly and I will teach him a lot more in due time.  We are going the same road as Newfoundland went. In 1934 if I told Deputy Kelly that there was going to be an immense emigration of young Irish people from this country to Great Britain, would he have believed it?  Of course not. He would have said &ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo;  He would have said that the population of this country was going up and that industry was absorbing the increasing population.  He would have told us all about the increasing prosperity in this country.  I told Deputy Kelly in 1934 that this country was going the same road as Newfoundland; that your population is falling, in fact, although you do not know it, and in addition to that you are going to have a great tide of emigration from this country. That is what I told Deputy Kelly in 1934, and he laughed both loud and long and talked about the Jeremiahs going around this country and sabotaging the country, and he asked what would be done to people who talked like that in Russia or certain other European countries.</P>

      <P>Yes, you might try it yet, but you might not get away with it.  In Newfoundland, the Government of that State permitted a body of men, very similar to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to destroy and undermine the fishing industry of Newfoundland. The fishing industry was to Newfoundland what the agricultural industry is to this country, and it was destroyed in the sacred name of national self-sufficiency.  The Government of Newfoundland said that they must have industries that they never had before and, in order to do that, they had to raise tariffs.  They had to raise the cost of living and they were so busy about the raising of tariffs and the raising of the cost of living that they let the fishing industry down, just as we were so busy increasing the cost of living by tariffs and levies and so on and in the nationalisation of raw materials that the agricultural industry is being destroyed just as the fishing industry was destroyed in Newfoundland. What happened in Newfoundland? In Newfoundland they went on with that policy, denouncing as a traitor anyone who opposed it, and at the end of four or five years, or perhaps six, they went bust.  They could not pay their way.  The people were starving and in Newfoundland they could not emigrate because they had no place to which to emigrate. The result was that they stayed at home and starved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people are in a different position in that respect.  Our people can go to Great Britain and get good jobs there, and it is that fact that has saved us to the extent that we have been saved.  It is appalling that we should have to be saved by emigration, but there is no doubt that if that emigration had not taken place we would be confronted with an acute crisis in this country now.  Not having that safety value of emigration, Newfoundland was brought up against the situation severely and they asked the British Government to send out three Treasury officials to help them to solve their difficulties.  They dissolved their Parliament, dissolved their Government, and handed the whole government of Newfoundland over to three <Col N="567" /> British Treasury officials who are now running the country.  These Treasury officials, no doubt, will get them back on their feet and, when that is done, no doubt Newfoundland will start off again.  It must be remembered, however, that Newfoundland was a British Colony, and that it was in no way inconsistent for that country to turn to their mother country, Great Britain, and ask for a hand, and they got that hand.  We cannot do that.  We have been fighting for 700 years in this country to prove that we ourselves are a mother country as old as Great Britain, and that we are a damn sight better able to run this country than Britain was or is or ever will be.  If we run on the rocks, therefore, we cannot send over to Britain to ask them to send us their Treasury officials to dig us out of our difficulties; but what we are doing, and what we should be profoundly ashamed of doing, is that we are sending our people to Great Britain in tens of thoussands and asking the British people to keep them for us because we are not able to keep them ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If they cannot get jobs there, they would be on the dole here, but, whether they come back or not, going they certainly are, and it is something that we ought greatly to deplore as a great reflection on the Government that has created a situation that makes it necessary for these people to go.  I submit to the House that that is all part of a general picture which forecasts perfectly clearly <Col N="568" /> that this country is slithering down the slope.  The ordinary conditions of international trade are: that Labour and Capital are immobile&mdash;they do not ordinarily move out of their native country&mdash;but that goods are essentially mobile, and international trade proceeds on that assumption.  But in this country the axioms of international trade are exactly reversed. Here labour is extremely mobile.  It will go to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will go anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. Capital in this country is also extremely mobile.  Any Irish capitalist will ordinarily invest his money in British securities just as readily as he will invest in Irish securities.  People in continental countries, such as YugoSlavia, Czecho-Slovakia and Roumania do not ordinarily invest their money in external securities; they invest them in home securities of which they have personal knowledge.  These people do not ordinarily emigrate quite casually, because if they did, they would not be able to talk the language of the country to which they went as emigrants. Our people emigrate freely to Great Britain; our capital is liable to move over to Great Britain without any difficulty whatever.  But our goods, the products of industry in this country, can never be sold outside under existing conditions, because, just as they are doing in France, we here are forcing up the cost of production because we desire to have industry for internal consumption.  But, very properly, if we put on a high tariff to protect an industrialist, we say to the industrialist: &ldquo;You must give a fair share of your profits to the men who work for you.&rdquo;  That is a very good plan, but it clearly means that the industrial goods we produce will not readily move across our own borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, our agricultural products cannot move across, because we have involved ourselves in an economic war on the assumption that there were alternative markets.  A few years have shown that there were no alternative markets.  Then we found, too late, that we closed down the only market available for our agricultural products. So that here we are in the most vulnerable <Col N="569" /> position in which we could possibly find ourselves.  Capital and labour, the two things indispensable to future production and national wealth, are as mobile as quicksilver. Goods which ought to be building up national wealth and creating reserves for the future are stagnant on our hands.  Nothing could be worse.  Our population is falling.  I do not think the Minister will contest that.  For years we were told that the population was rising and that the increase of population was being absorbed by the new industrial policy of the Minister. Now we discover that in the decade between 1926 and 1936, instead of an increase, there was a depreciable decrease in the population, and the Registrar-General, in his report published on 27th September, 1937, shows that the population fell by a further 21,000 in the year ended June, 1937, and it shows every sign of continuing to fall.  Then the cost of living, we all agree, is rising.</P>
    <P>Now let us examine our trade, which is most extraordinary.  Our adverse trade balance for the year up to August, 1937, was £20,000,000, which represents 88.7 per cent. of our total domestic exports.  Our domestic exports in that year were about £24,000,000 and on that export trade of £24,000,000 we had an adverse trade balance of £20,000,000.  Deputies will remember when the Minister for Industry and Commerce used to tell the House that an adverse trade balance of £14,000,000 on a total trade of £100,000,000 spelt national bankruptcy. Now we have an adverse trade balance of £20,000,000 on a total trade of about £60,000,000.  In the four years 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, the total adverse trade balance was £75,000,000.  We bought and paid for £75,000,000 worth more goods than we sold in four years.  Our total domestic exports in that period were £80,000,000. So that we imported £155,000,000 worth of goods in these four years, and we exported, to pay for them, £80,000,000 worth.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Deputies absorb the appalling significance of these figures.  Deputies will say, <Col N="570" />&ldquo;Well, they are being paid for somehow or other.&rdquo;  How are they being paid for?  They are being paid for by the dissipation of our capital assets. There is a little blue book published every quarter by the Currency Commission. If you look at the Joint Stock Banks' general statement there, you will find set out&mdash;you have not got the October one yet, because it is held up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the whole story.  You are going to get a nasty shock when you get the October one. There is a little blue book, such as the Minister holds, which sets out, under the Joint Stock Banks' joint report, two figures, and when you allow those figures to operate upon one another, you ascertain the net sterling assets held by the Joint Stock Banks of this country.  The net sterling assets held by the Joint Stock Banks of this country correspond as closely as possible to the gold stock of the Bank of England or the Bank of France.  When we have an adverse trade balance and have to pay out to England, or foreign countries, for more goods than we have exported, we begin to sell these stocks and to use the proceeds of the sale to pay the money we owe.</P>

      <P>The records of the advisory committee are not compiled under the main headings of the Deputy's question, and it is not, therefore, practicable to furnish the information required.  Owing to the large number of applications under the 1934 Act, and also owing to the extreme pressure of work in all branches dealing with Army pensions and military service pensions, it is not desirable to divert the staff from their ordinary work to compile such records. In answer to the latter portion of the <Col N="414" /> Deputy's question, I wish to state that every effort has been made to speed up the completion of the work on pensions, and that within the last few months the staff in the referee's office was increased.</P>
