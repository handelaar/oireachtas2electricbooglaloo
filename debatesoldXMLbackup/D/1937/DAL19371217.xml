      <P>That deletion was suggested yesterday.

      <P>In connection with that, there might be some difficulty in determining what &ldquo;circulating throughout the State&rdquo; exactly meant.  If, for instance, a few copies were in one part of the country only, would it be claimed to be circulating throughout the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill do now pass.  As the House knows, this Bill has had a considerable amount of consideration.  The main purpose behind the scheme, as I indicated on an earlier stage, was to try, as far as it was possible in the existing circumstances, to work towards a Seanad which would be of a vocational or functional character.  It may be said that in its present form it is far away from having that particular character; but it indicates the direction in which we are to travel, and I do not believe that in the existing circumstances we could do more.  The fundamental difficulty is, of course, that we are not at the moment organised precisely in a functional way which would enable us to constitute a Second House on the basis <Col N="2766" /> of representation from, say, functional councils.  A Second House of that particular character would undoubtedly be different from the Constitution of the Dáil, and would probably bring to the consideration of legislation a new point of view.</P>
      <P>Bills coming from the Dáil could, in such a House, be critically examined from the point of view of the effect of legislation on the various activities, the different activities, of a functional character of our people; but, as we have not the necessary material in which to build up a Second House of that character now, the point was to go in that direction as far as we could.</P>
      <P>Schemes were submitted which appeared to go farther in that direction than this Bill goes, but, in our opinion anyhow, these schemes were not at the present moment practicable and would not, in fact, enable us to move as rapidly towards the desired end as the scheme that we have finally in this Bill.  I said on more than one occasion that it was really a compromise, a half-way house.  It takes note of the fact that the people are not sufficiently organised in the functional direction to give us a completely functional House.  It offers an inducement to move in that direction and there is the assurance that the House will not fail simply because of the fact that the outside bodies are not existing in the form in which we would really require them, to have what I might call a perfect or a really satisfactory functional House.  The scheme, by allowing for Dáil nominations, by allowing a part of the House to be nominated by the Dáil, makes certain that we will not fail during the period in which we hope the functional organisation will advance, and provision is made in the Constitution so that if there is an advancement in that direction we can substitute, instead of the members that can be chosen from the existing panels, direct election from functional councils and bodies organised in that way, if and when they do come into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Half the House coming from Dáil nominations without <Col N="2767" /> a functional direction in regard to the nominations will secure that we have a body which will give to the Second House people of the experience that we require.  The Dáil ought to be able to pick out from the community people with that knowledge and that particular experience.  Then there is an inducement to such functional bodies as do exist to take an active interest in the Second House.  They are assured of getting at least 21 of the 43 members who are to be elected to the Second House; they are assured that 21 of the 43 will secure seats in that House; they are assured at the outset that the nominees which they put forward will be elected to the Second House.</P>
      <P>Of course, when we have been talking of a functional Second House, we have always made it quite clear that it is not simply experts that we want there, but rather that they ought to be men who are interested in the community as a whole, interested in public affairs generally, but that over and above that they will have some specialised knowledge which will be of particular value. When we are trying to pick people for the Second House we should aim not merely at experts, people particularly qualified in their own professions or occupations, but those who are generally people of affairs and who, in addition to the ordinary knowledge of affairs which they would have, would possess over and above that some special qualifications and some special knowledge.  We can have such a Seanad if we set out to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do hope that in the nominations that will come from this House the spirit behind the Bill will be kept in mind and that the nominations will be of such a character as to give us in the Second House people who understand public business and who will be able to bring special knowledge to bear on the criticism of legislation that may be passed here.  As far as the outside bodies are concerned, in their nominations my hope is that they will approach the matter in the same spirit as I have suggested we should do it here.  It is to be hoped that in choosing their nominees to go up for election they will select people who <Col N="2768" /> will have that general knowledge which is essential, together with a general interest in public affairs, and over and above that I think they should give us people, wherever it is possible to select them, with such a variety of special knowledge as well as general experience as will enable us to make of the Second House a part of the Legislature which will be effective and valuable, and, by being effective and valuable, will secure the confidence of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to speak at any great length on the measure at this stage.  It has been discussed in detail, and the general principle has been debated a number of times.  I think it is the best we can do at the present time.  I hope that as time goes on and as opportunity for making it more and more of a functional nature presents itself, that it will be improved in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to intervene?  There is one matter that has given Deputies on this side of the House some concern. It has relation to the question of the former members of the dissolved councils.  It was suggested yesterday that the President, by a transposition of certain words in the section, could make clearer the definition of what the former members were.  There is no amendment submitted in connection with that matter, and I should like to know if the President has considered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been considered. A number of matters like that have been considered.  When an amendment has not appeared it does not follow that the matter has not received consideration.  Consideration has led to this, that the words in the brackets to which the Deputy made reference are in the proper place from the draftsman's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that Deputy Benson will see the reasonableness of that.  Everyone, I am sure, will admit how anxious the President is to accommodate the Opposition. The sheaf of amendments that <Col N="2769" /> he has submitted in order to meet our views and the efforts he has made all along to meet our views is ample proof of the way in which the President is prepared to be reasonable so far as suggestions from this side of the House are concerned.  For these two tremendous changes that he has made in this Bill we are truly thankful.</P>
      <P>May I express the hope that this will be the ultimate stage of the Bill? But one never can tell.  After all, we are to meet on the 12th January, and we could even be hastily called together again before that date for another stage of the Bill.  When the President sponsors a Bill, and when he is acting as Leader of the House, the Lord only knows what the procedure is going to be.</P>

      <P>I recognise that the Ceann Comhairle desires to facilitate the business of the House.  I am not criticising the Ceann Comhairle at all.  If we are seeing this Bill for the last time, we can say that we are very lucky.  Unfortunately, we cannot see the results of this Bill for the last time.  I listened with a certain amount of interest to what the President has just said, and I was glad that he was able to say it all with a serious face.  He expressed the hope &mdash;a pious hope, because he does not expect it to be fulfilled&mdash;I mentioned before that pious hopes are things which people do not expect to be fulfilled&mdash;that the spirit behind the Bill would be kept in mind.  I have expressed the hope&mdash;altogether vainly&mdash; that the spirit alleged by the President to be behind the Bill would be kept in mind for five minutes after discussing the essentials.  Again and again the President had opportunities to give effect to what he considers to be the spirit behind the Bill, but nobody has gone more out of his way to violate that spirit than the President. Not once has he taken any account of the principles that he alleged to be contained in this Bill. He has violated them as much as any <Col N="2770" /> man possibly could.  He has gone in the opposite direction to every fundamental principle he laid down, and now, with that piety which so well becomes him, he expresses, at the last moment, the hope that the spirit behind the Bill will be honoured by the Dáil.  He turns to the Opposition and hopes that the spirit behind the Bill will be honoured by them, as he assumes he has honoured it.  Let us hope they will honour it a great deal more.</P>
      <P>The President modestly describes this step as a &ldquo;small step.&rdquo;  After all, as his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could tell him, it will be about 25 years before we take the next step.  I call it not a step but a stagger, at the very most, in the direction in which he is going. What is the good of pretending that this is a contribution to a vocational Seanad?  The President says he cannot get a vocational Seanad at the moment by the machinery at his disposal. In the same breath he acknowledges that these altogether unsatisfactory vocational bodies can, in practice, elect half of the 43 Senators.  Is not that so&mdash;in practice?  If they like they can put up 40 members.  They can choose 40 persons suitable to be Senators, and, of these, over 20 must be elected.  The 20 who may or may not be rejected may be as suitable as the 20 elected.  If that body can select and reject 21, they can do so with the 43.  When that was put before him, the President said that it was not so, that it was absurd.  In other words, that merely amounts to &ldquo;I am not accepting your view.  It is not that I am not accepting it because it is absurd but it is absurd because I am not accepting it.&rdquo;  The President, who has indulged in metaphysics, knows what a very serious heresy that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret very much that the opportunity was not used to obtain a suitable Seanad.  We have had a unique Bill.  We had an opportunity&mdash;unique or otherwise&mdash;and it was not utilised. It was deliberately thrown aside by the President.  He could have got his vocational Seanad.  He preferred not to get it.  We had a lot of expressions from him as to the type of <Col N="2771" /> House he would have if occupations and industries were organised more fully than they are at present.  He would get a Seanad, in these circumstances, that would be different from the Dáil in its outlook but would not be in conflict with it.  We would have had a Seanad different in composition from the Dáil, a Seanad that would be able to bring to bear on Bills a different point of view.  You could get all that by utilising the present machinery.  The little stagger the President has made shows that it could be done.  Why has he not done it?  He prefers to do the opposite of what he pretends.  He has deliberately thrown us back on a purely Party Seanad.  What is the good of his shaking his head when now&mdash;at the twelfth hour&mdash;he recognises the composition of the county councils?  He recognises a thing of which he was quite innocent the other day&mdash;that county councils were elected on a purely Party ticket.  He put the election of the Seanad entirely into the hands of bodies organised on purely Party lines.</P>
    <P>What are the two bodies concerned? There is the Dáil.  I suggest that, so far as the bulk of the Dáil is concerned, it is organised on Party lines. I am quite aware that if the President felt it would help his argument, he would deny that, but it is as true of the county councils as it is of the Dáil. Therefore, you deliberately put the election of the Seanad into the hands of bodies elected and organised on purely Party lines, without taking into account at all the fact I have already stressed, that since the establishment of this State the President's Party have determined that that should be the fate of the county councils.  What is the good of professing that you want a Seanad which will not be a mere replica of the Dáil when your whole legislation is aimed at securing the opposite?  The President shakes his head.  If it is not aimed at securing that, then the President is a most unfortunate man, because the instruments he forges are calculated to do precisely the opposite of what he professes to do.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Keep them guessing&rdquo; was the motto.  Here is a Bill bad in itself because it deliberately refuses to acknowledge the principles for which the President said he stood, and which has steadily deteriorated in the course of the numerous stages through which it has gone.  Every chance the President got of dealing with his original measure has ended by making it worse&mdash;except the opportunity offered this morning.  We have had two marvellous concessions this morning and they, let us hope, will improve the measure almost beyond recognition.</P>
      <P>That has been the fate of the Bill. The President came into this Dáil with a definite scheme, after full consideration for 12 months and as a result of the constitutional mumblings that took place inside him, and then the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along and, in a week, imposes on him an entirely different scheme, but a worse scheme, if possible.  I am sorry he gave way to that pressure. You are going to get an entirely political Seanad, and you deliberately set out to do that, although you profess the opposite.  As far as possible, he said, at the moment we could not do more.  You can do more.  If these bodies are good enough to choose 40 men, out of whom 21 must be elected, they are good enough to select the 43. There were many opportunities of confuting that during the Committee Stage.  I do not really know what to call the different stages of this Bill. Yet we are to advance towards better organisation, but I gather that the more of these organisations we have, the worse we shall be, because it will throw more work on the returning officer, because his business will be, no matter how many of these we have, to keep the number nominating as small as possible.  Therefore, if this is an inducement, it is an inducement in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President's gesture has explained <Col N="2773" /> it accurately&mdash;here now and there to-morrow.  The President has done it splendidly&mdash;you think you are here and then you think you are there, and eventually you find yourself back here.  That is the President's idea of negotiating&mdash;two parties starting, as he eloquently expresses it in the gesture he has just made, here; they come to this point and say &ldquo;At least we have agreement now,&rdquo; and then they find that the President is back there.  Some schemes, he said, appeared to go further.  They did, but they were not practicable, he said. They are quite as practicable as this scheme, and as far as there is any acknowledgment of the vocational principle in this, it is a proof of the practicability of the schemes which the President did not even consider.  I admit that he could have considered them, because he had considered the matter for 12 months and had come to the conclusion that it was impossible, but he has given no reasons for that conclusion.</P>
    <P>We have compromise.  I wish the President was not so fond of half-way houses.  They are bad places as a rule. He suggests that there is an inducement to move in a certain direction, but there is no such thing.  There is the contrary.  I have said already that there were three things which the President professed he wanted to accomplish.  The first was a vocational Seanad, and he has done the opposite so far as he could.  The second was a Seanad not elected on purely Party lines and not under purely Party machinery.  He has got the most perfect scheme for doing the opposite; he has given us a scheme for election completely under the Party machine, and the more effective that machine is, the more successful it will be in elections of this kind.  The third was his desire that there should not be a hang-over and that when a new Government came into power it should not find a Seanad in existence which would be hostile to it.  We had great expressions as to the necessity for that and great stress laid on it, and for that reason we are presented with the great inconvenience&mdash;as it very often is&mdash;of having the Seanad going out with the Dáil <Col N="2774" /> and the necessity, therefore, of compressing the Seanad election into a small period.  Why was that?  The President explained it fully.  He said that the Seanad had a certain function. That function should be to bring a different mind to bear upon legislation going up to it from this House and not to obstruct this House.  That is the view the President had.  Therefore, he said to himself, if the Seanad goes over from one period to the other, a Seanad which is of a different complexion from the new Government coming into power, that Seanad may act as an obstructive body and, therefore, let the Seanad go out with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In that case, you will have a new Seanad which, so far as its election is concerned, in the original Bill, at all events, would more or less represent the complexion of the Dáil in its general views, and which would not be inclined on the whole to obstruct, but for fear it should be so inclined, there will be 11 nominations by the Taoiseach.  Even that principle has been abandoned.  The majority of the electorate does not necessarily change with the dissolution of the Dáil.  Two hundred and ten out of the 350 remain on.  They, having been elected at a different time, possibly two years previously, may be entirely out of sympathy with the majority, with the result that you are here again doing something contrary to your expressed wish.  But is not that the fate of the Bill all along&mdash;professions of principle on one hand and violation of them in practice on the other? We have honoured the principle of a vocational Seanad merely in expression and not in action.  The non-political principle, in the sense of the Seanad not being under Party control, is gone in as effective a way as we could make it go, and the principle of safety for a new in-coming Government is gone.  These are the three things on which the President laid stress, and if he had deliberately set out to violate these principles, he could not have done it better.  We may express the one hope that other people will take the President's principles more seriously than he takes them himself.  We are implementing <Col N="2775" /> the Constitution.  We have done it several times and on every possible occasion, we have, in practice, violated the whole spirit of it.  There are many things in that Constitution to which I object, but it is quite characteristic that the people who set out to violate it first, and to trample on all that that Constitution was held to enshrine, are the President and his Party.</P>
    <P>We are presented with a Seanad and it is either take it or leave it.  There is no possibility that I see of getting the Seanad which the President could have got.  He has spoken all along of vocational Seanads.  He has managed to deceive a number of people into believing that that is his aim.  His aim is nothing of the kind, so far as we can judge him, not by his professions, but by his acts.  We have been in favour of a Second House, and we thought it possible to get a Second House.  We were not particularly interested in the First House, but we did hope that the foundation of a vocational Seanad might be laid.  We made any amount of concessions, and we put forward schemes.  They were not considered, but we would not mind that if there was the slightest pledge for the future that this Bill is an advance in the direction in which the President says it is an advance.</P>

      <P>I stated when discussing this Bill on the Second Reading that it has reference mainly to urban areas, principally to Dublin City, Dublin area and Cork, and that the amount of money in the way of grants paid out over other areas is relatively small.  Deputies in different parts of the House, particularly Deputies belonging to the Opposition, have stressed the fact on every occasion that one of these Bills was before the House, that we were putting enormous financial obligations on the country.  That was the tone of Deputy Mulcahy's whole speech last year, that we were placing commitments on the country without any regard to what would be the position in the future.  I examined this whole housing question again in view of having introduced a new Bill to get additional money and, having had conversations with builders, I found there was a way by which we could, possibly, save, without doing any serious damage to the prospect of having a continuation of the housing progress that we had tried to push forward in recent years.  My information is that the £45 grant, so far as builders in Dublin are concerned, is not a serious thing to them when considering a scheme of housing.  Of course they do not like to lose the £45 grant, but the information I got from some of them was that if they were satisfied the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act would be implemented with sufficient money, they would be prepared to forego the £45 grant.  It occurred to me that money spent in that way, if it was not of serious importance to the builders in urging and encouraging them to build more houses, could be more usefully spent on slum clearances and, by saving in that direction, and perhaps using the money to greater effect by giving greater encouragement to others, I proposed that the Executive Council should drop the £45 grant.  I understand it is not a serious encouragement to the building trade and, therefore, even for the limited period suggested by the Deputy, I do not feel like accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2779" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the Minister did not correctly interpret Deputy Mulcahy's speech on this matter.  What Deputy Mulcahy had in mind, probably, was the accumulating dead weight debt that was arising out of the housing policy.  Possibly his view was that the taxpayer of to-day should not be shifting that burden on to the taxpayer of ten, 15, 20 or 30 years hence, who would have to pay a proportion of the costs incurred without getting any of the benefits which are being derived at the moment.  The taxpayer of to-day has this advantage, that whatever he has to contribute towards the price of a house in respect of slum clearances, etc., is offset by the advantage of the circulation of huge sums of money.  He gets the advantage of the extra employment and of the extra business and so on, but, in the future, when the work is completed, the taxpayer will have to bear all the burdens without having any of the advantages.  The proposal in the amendment in respect of the £45 is not in contradiction to that.  The contention made from this side of the House is, that this is the cheapest possible method of providing housing accommodation.  It is quite possible that in the case of a house valued for £360, something like two-thirds of the cost of the house, and of the service of the debt will fall upon the State&mdash;£240.</P>
      <P>More than five houses can be constructed costing the State an immediate £45.  Our contention is that the provision of those five houses will, to some extent, ease the problem which faces local authorities in dealing with the provision of houses for the working classes, because there are people who would be able to purchase, or take on lease, one of those houses in respect of which the £45 will have been paid. It has taken years to get speculative builders into this particular sphere of building activity.  Our contention is that it is unwise, at a time when the number of houses still required to be built is considerable, that any phase of building activity should be retarded, and for that reason we are supporting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made <Col N="2780" /> some statement which, while containing a certain amount of truth, yet give a false idea of the real position. Deputy Cosgrave has referred to the talk about expenditure, and to the criticism of expenditure made from this side of the House.  We certainly regard the provision of houses as a very desirable form of expenditure.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill two days ago, I am particularly interested in the position of Dublin. While I say that, I do not want it to be taken that I do not wish well to the rest of the country.  But the position is that the population of Dublin is increasing, while the opposite is true of the rest of the country.  Hence, I would like to make a few remarks about the housing problem as it affects Dublin and district.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, will admit that there is a very grave housing problem in Dublin.  It is possibly one of the greatest problems that confronts us at the moment.  What has caused that problem?  Dublin is an old city and a walled city.  Some people blame the Danes for our housing problem.  If that reason consoles them, they are welcome to it so far as I am concerned; but we have inherited this problem, and we have got to solve it.  In our opinion the ideas of the Government in approaching this problem are far too narrow.  That is the first point I want to put before the Minister.  If, in his opinion, any wrong statements are made from this side of the House on this question, I hope he will take the opportunity of contradicting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very complicated problem. There are many sides to it, and it can be approached in a variety of ways. I think it is a pity that in the last couple of years we have not had some debates on the housing problem.  A couple of years ago I twitted the Minister on that, but we have not had any since.  If we had such debates they would help to educate us on this problem. For one thing, they would help to prevent the Minister contradicting himself.  It would be a great advance if we could find out whether the Government have any logical ordered idea of the way that the housing problem in Dublin should be tackled.  I said before that the building industry, <Col N="2781" /> if it was to contribute its share to the problem, would require to know some years ahead what was expected of it. I observe that the Minister made this statement in the Dáil two days ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsequently it was decided to restrict the floor area of houses in urban areas that would be eligible for grants to 800 square feet.  Up to then a house of 1,200 square feet in floor area was eligible for a subsidy. It was hoped that the reduction in area would induce speculative builders to engage in the production of houses suitable to the requirements of the average working-class family, and thus to some extent relieve the demand on the local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is sheer nonsense, and I will tell the House why.  The Minister seems to think that the speculative builders have a sort of double dose of original sin, and that they have set out to combat the supply of houses for the working classes.  The trouble is that they have got to cater for a certain small portion of the community who can pay for their houses.  If the working classes could pay for houses the speculative builders would put them up for them, and in a couple of years there would be no housing problem. That is the point.  It is not the speculative builder's sin that he puts up a house that is slightly bigger than the house that is required for the housing of the working classes: it is because he finds there is a market for that type of house.</P>
    <P>The next point is that when one of those, houses is put up it results in the moving of a family out of a house in Dublin, and leaves the problem of the housing of the working classes temporarily less acute.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that, supposing 10,000 houses of this type were put up in a single year and that a very big portion of the City of Dublin was vacated, would not that solve the housing problem temporarily for a certain number of years?  That is why you have got 3,000 houses unfit for human habitation, that they cannot be pulled down because you cannot put people under canvas.  The problem <Col N="2782" /> is that there are not enough houses available, due to the fact that people have crowded into Dublin, and that building is only going on at a certain rate.</P>
    <P>The next contradiction that I would like to bring to the Minister's notice is to be found in his own statement made the other evening, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Dockrell raised the question of the £45 grant in urban areas. It does not come as a surprise to the House, I am sure, that that £45 grant should cease, because it was mentioned here on the last two occasions on which I spoke in introducing the annual Housing Bill.  Certainly on the last occasion I made a pretty specific pronouncement that the intention was not to continue the £45 grant after the expiration of the period covered by that last Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister considers that that is a responsible statement and that we ought to take him at his word, but apparently he has only made up his mind to that in the last few days, because on the 17th November the following question was addressed to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his Department have ceased to issue certificates A under the Housing Acts to builders, and whether he is aware that this proceeding is likely to stop the provision of houses under the Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to that question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The issue of certificates has been temporarily discontinued pending the annual determination of the number of cases where certificates have been issued and works are not being proceeded with.  I am not aware of any grounds for the statement in the latter part of the question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The latter part of the question referred to the possible stoppage of the production of houses.  Apparently, therefore, on the 17th November, the Minister thought that these grants had merely been temporarily discontinued. Now, to-day, he tells us that they have been discontinued.  I should like the <Col N="2783" /> Minister to look at what the effect of that is.  He told us that builders had informed him that they did not want the £45 grant if they could get the Acquisition of Houses (Small Dwellings) Act implemented under the corporation. The truth about that matter is that a £45 grant is no use to a person who has not got the money to buy a house.  The Minister has translated that into saying that the £45 grant is no use, but that is a very different statement.  What is the position as regards the Corporation (Small Dwellings) Act?  I think that £250,000 was made available in January, 1936.  Now, that has been gobbled up&mdash;that is the only word I can use to describe it&mdash;and practically anybody now can go into the corporation and put up a scheme and, unless somebody has fallen out or there is some invalidity in their suggestion, they cannot get on with that.</P>
    <P>There is another class of person to whom the £45 grant is a very serious matter.  As I have said before&mdash;and I should like the Minister to correct my ignorance if I am wrong in saying this &mdash;the problem of housing in Dublin must be taken as a whole.  I say that there are three main sources of supply, and each one of them is serving just as useful a purpose as the other.  I have referred to the provision of houses by the corporation for the working classes.  Now, it is very desirable that that should be gone on with just as quickly as possible, and, if it can be got on with any quicker, I should be very pleased to see it.  At the same time, the corporation are doing an enormous work and I think they will find it difficult to increase their production. As I said before, if they are able to increase their production I shall be very pleased to see it.  Now, you have got another source of supply, and that is the person who is going to be helped by the corporation to buy a small dwelling.  As I have said, that is being gobbled up.</P>

      <P>I am only saying that I think it has been gobbled, and if I am wrong I shall be very pleased to hear it.  Now, to get back to the third source of supply, namely, the house for which this £45 grant is to be made available.  The Minister made great play with the £700,000 that was being made available.  I do not know how many shillings out of that are going to be made available for the finishing up of the subsidy to the builders that has originally been started and that the Minister has in his original Bill. Here is the position with regard to that: I have informed the Minister that the speculative builders who cater for this £45 grant have not got more than a few months' work ahead.  In fact, it is a nice question whether they even have that much ahead, because, as the Minister is no doubt aware, there was a very extensive strike in the building industry in Dublin this year.  The speculative builders saw that coming and what they did was to finish up houses that were capable of being finished and they did not start any others; so that really the position is that Dublin, due to this particular trouble in the building industry, has been done out of about 600 houses this year that, in the ordinary course of things, would have been provided by the speculative builders.  That has nothing to do with the dwellings of the working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put before the Minister some of the arithmetic in connection with this £45 grant.  As I said, Dublin really has been done out of 600 houses which, at £45 per house, would have cost the Exchequer £27,000.  That seems a very big sum.  But what is the position?  That would have made houses available for people who, when they cannot get that class of house, will enter into competition for a corporation house&mdash;the &ldquo;also-rans&rdquo; is all you can call them.  The class of persons who would be catered for by these houses would be foremen, senior clerks, etc.  Can they find the deposits necessary now?  That £27,000 which the Exchequer would have to pay would have gone to the relief of housing in Dublin.  What is the position with regard to the class of house that would <Col N="2786" /> have been put up under that scheme? People who are going to buy these houses now find themselves faced, as a result of the strike, with a 10 per cent. increase in wages, as well as an increase of over 20 per cent. in materials, due to world causes.  A house of 800 square feet&mdash;that is the £45 house we are talking about&mdash;would have sold pre-strike at about £650, the deposit being from £100 to £120.  The new price now will be about £750, and a deposit of from £130 to £160.  If the grant is taken away, the new price will be £800, and the deposit from £175 to £210.  Is that a position in which people who are going to buy that class of house do not care whether they get the £45 or not? That is arrant nonsense.</P>
    <P>That class of house is being put up, as I said, for foremen, senior clerks, etc., people who are just outside the working classes.  In fact, I suppose they would possibly class themselves as the working classes.  How can they find such deposits?  There are no building societies here, and the Government have not given any help in that direction. These people, as I said, will join in the race for corporation houses.  In other words, there will be from 600 to 1,000 more competitors for corporation houses.  What will the corporation have to pay for these houses?  If we take 800 houses at £450 a house, that amounts to £360,000.  Interest and sinking fund at 6½ per cent. comes to £23,400 per annum.  Two-thirds of that amounts to £15,600 per annum for 35 years.  And that is to save a single capital expenditure of £27,000.  This is a scheme which the Minister says does not help the corporation housing schemes and that the people do not want.  I say that they do want it, and I invite the Minister to say I am wrong in that statement.</P>

      <P>The whole housing problem in Dublin is interlocked.  It is possible that this is not as desirable as building 600 or 800 houses for the working classes but it would help to solve the problem.  I will not go into the question of the employment it gives, but how does the Minister expect people who are providing that class of house to go on from day to day?  They ought to be cutting the foundations at present, now that the labour trouble is over, for some hundreds of houses.  These houses ought to be gone on with in the fine weather and finished in the autumn.  I spoke previously about the builder who had to find an estate on which to put those houses.  It is a gradual process.  The Minister has left these people from day to day and hour to hour in such a position so that they do not know where they are.  On November 17th these grants were temporarily suspended and now apparently they are done away with, and we are told that they do not matter.  I should like to urge on the Minister that these grants do provide a solution for the housing problem in Dublin, that he has saved that money on the houses that were not put up this year, and that in justice to these people and as a help in the solution of the problem he ought to accept Deputy Brennan's amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Deputies will remember that on the Second Stage of the previous amending Bill&mdash;the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1933&mdash;I stated that I was satisfied that in urban areas assistance could be withdrawn or at any rate considerably modified as regards the size of houses which should qualify for subsidy.  I have given the question careful consideration, and, in view of the persisting housing demand and the volume of applications, I have thought it best to meet the situation by restricting the floor area of the houses to 800 square feet.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another phrase which I have asked for.  Aside from that, Deputy Dockrell stressed the fact that the withdrawal of the £45 means the collapse of the building of houses by the type of builder who has been interested in that grant up to this, in building the 800 square feet house or the 1,250 square feet house. As I have said&mdash;I said it a couple of days ago when we had the same debate and a similar speech from Deputy Dockrell, I said it this morning, and I am going to repeat it now&mdash;I have been told by builders that the £45 grant was not a very big consideration to them in making their plans for their housing schemes.  They insisted, in deputations to me and in talks which <Col N="2789" /> I had with private persons amongst the builders, that if they were assured that money would be made available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, they would forego the £45.  That has been stated, and Deputy Dockrell cannot deny that.  If that is so, why spend the £45?  The better policy is to see that money will be made available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell also seeks to prove me guilty of misrepresentation.  He points out that in November, in answer to a certain question, I gave a reply which misled the builders.  I have not the text of the question in front of me now, but as far as I recollect it dealt with grants under the present Act, and referred to complaints around the country that the grants were being withheld or withdrawn.  Our purpose was&mdash;seeing that we were coming to the end of our year and the end of our tether, as far as money was concerned &mdash;to examine the situation, so far as people were concerned to whom grants had been allotted a year or ten months before and who had not used these grants.  We had to make an examination of cases in which people had been allotted grants a year before and had not, as it was represented to us, taken any steps to use them.</P>

      <P>I cannot enter into that now, but a sum of £15,659 was withdrawn in urban areas.  Notice was given to these people that the grants would be withdrawn, and in any case in which any of them said to us: &ldquo;We have not started yet, but we will start in a month or two,&rdquo; we would not withdraw the grant.  We were pressed <Col N="2790" /> by people who were making application for money.  This Bill had not come before the House to get the additional £700,000, and the sending out of letters to people to whom allocations had been made, telling them that they must go ahead or that the grant would be withdrawn, caused the idea to be circulated that the grants were being withdrawn.  It was in reference to that that the question was put down, and that the answer was given.  Grants were withdrawn from 329 persons in urban areas.  Some of them had grants allocated to them for two years, and had done nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing for that.  It has been the practice in every one of these Bills to hold over about 100 cases from last year's Act, in which the people were not able to complete the houses within the year, and to make provision for them in the new Bill. The Deputy knows as well as I do, but he wants to misrepresent the situation, that there has not been a single person <Col N="2791" /> who lost a grant in Dublin because of the fact that he was not able to complete the house within a month or two of the end of the year.  We try to meet them if they are any way reasonable at all in pushing on the work.  If the law does not allow payment to be made under the 1937 Act, we will make provision in the 1938 Bill to pay these people their grant, even though they have not strictly complied with the law as far as the previous Act was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dockrell that the Dublin housing problem is a very big problem.  The Dublin area presents us with the biggest problem we have, and I would not consciously do anything to prevent additional houses being built.  Anything I could do to promote the building of additional houses, the houses that are most urgently required, I would gladly do, and anything I am proposing is based on the information I have got that the £45 grant alone would not urge a builder to put up one additional house. It is not sufficiently attractive to urge him to put up one additional house. There are other things that are more important.  If the purse is to have a bottom in it, if it is limited, and if we must provide a certain sum of money for building houses of the class most urgently required, if there is any choice to be made, I would give any money I have to slum clearances.  What Deputy Brennan proposes would take a very considerable sum of money out of the £700,000 proposed to be made available under this Bill.  If Deputy Brennan's proposition were adopted, on the basis of the 1936-37 figures it would cost £160,000, and that would be more than we could afford to spend for that purpose.  I do not think there is anything else I can do.  I am not anxious &mdash;in fact, on the contrary, I would be upset if I thought I were doing it&mdash;to take the building trade unawares in this matter, or fail to give them due notice.  If Deputy Dockrell is strongly of opinion, and if those for whom he speaks are strongly of opinion, that I have, in suggesting the taking away of the £45 grant, given them short notice, and that they feel that they would be penalised, especially having the strike period in view, I would be prepared to <Col N="2792" /> accept Deputy Dockrell's next amendment and extend the period for six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see Deputy Dockrell's difference with the Minister, it is one of misunderstanding.  As I understood Deputy Dockrell's case, it is that if you can get more houses by doing this why restrict it?  The Minister says that the problem here is one of £160,000.  The country expects from the Minister and from the House, as a matter of fact from all of us, every assistance that can be given and all the wisdom that can be accumulated in this House to solve this problem.  It is now reduced to one of money.  Deputy Dockrell's case I think was not so much in regard to misrepresentation as that every avenue through which the housing problem can be approached should be explored.  This matter of getting speculative builders to build a type of a house other than a house for the working classes is a good thing, and tends towards the solution of the housing problem.  As he says, those men cannot build houses unless they have got customers to buy them, and he gave figures.  I really think that, even if it is a question of £160,000, the Minister should not close any avenue which would lead to the production of houses.  I think there is a lot in Deputy Dockrell's case that if houses of any kind are built the people who move into them will be making room for others in the houses which they leave.  It may not be the best type of house, but it would get them out of the horrible conditions under which they are living at the moment.  That is what he aims at.</P>

    <P>As far as I understand him, he aims at mobilising all the available forces to solve this problem.  He is not quarrelling so much about the misrepresentation.  There was undoubtedly trouble about the floor area.  This matter of chopping and changing the floor area is a bad thing in my opinion.  The Government&mdash; whether this or any other Government &mdash;should have a definite plan with regard to size, and there should be no chopping or changing.  We had a case where a man started to build a house I think about 15 or 18 months ago.  Last year's Bill changed the <Col N="2793" /> floor space.  He had begun to build the house, and by the time sanction was given the floor space was changed. In my opinion there should not be that chopping and changing.  There should be a scheme which would be adopted by this House and applied by every Government.  Then anybody who wanted to build a house would know what he was undertaking to do, and would know that there was not going to be a change.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be wise in not withdrawing this £45 grant if for example within the next 12 months 600 houses could be produced as a result of it.  Deputy Dockrell has given figures.  The cost of the scheme would be £27,000.  The alternative scheme would amount to an annual charge of £15,000.  I think any business man having those two propositions before him would adopt Deputy Dockrell's scheme as against the other one.  It does not hold up the other scheme.  What he put forward does not hold up anything.  It is opening up another avenue, and I think any avenue which assists in solving this problem is a good one.  I do not think the Minister need be aggrieved about misrepresentation.  I had no consultation with Deputy Dockrell on this matter, but as a matter of fact the question did arise in regard to a certain house in which I myself was interested.  That is by the way.  I expect there is nothing serious involved in it.  I think we ought to decide on one thing, that the size of the house will be a stationary thing.  When people start to build houses they ought to know that what is law to-day is going to be law to-morrow, and is going to be law ten years hence. That is an important thing.  While it is not strictly relevant to this section, I think that this sum of £700,000 leads nowhere; having already spent large sums, I think an annual amount of £700,000 should be considered reasonable enough if we are really attempting to get to the root of the problem at all.  I would urge that Deputy Dockrell's proposition should be adopted with regard to the maintenance of this £45 grant.  I would ask the Minister to adopt this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister certainly has not furnished us with anything which would lead us to believe that that is true.  If we are to believe what we hear, for some of the builders £45 may represent their entire profit, if you like, on the transaction. If it has in any way helped to build houses in urban areas, the £45 grant has been absolutely the cheapest contribution we could make towards the supplying of those houses.  If, for instance, in an urban area the provision of the £45 grant in this way could get a certain number of houses built, it relieves the urban authority of the obligation of borrowing, and of its consequent obligations.  There is another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister. It states here &ldquo;before the 1st day of January, 1937.&rdquo;  I propose taking out those words.  Is the Minister satisfied that it was possible for all the people who did apply for grants to start before that particular date?  It is quite possible that on account of the strike which was here in the city, and because of other matters affecting them down the country, such as rising prices and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, I wonder is the Minister satisfied that if provision is made under that Act that it is a greater inducement to builders than the £45 grant?  If it is, why is it?  Is it that they are able to charge a greater price for the house?  Is it affecting someone in some other way?  Are the reactions bad for somebody else? I do not think the Minister has made a good case for the withdrawal of the £45 grant.  I still think it was good business, and, on the Minister's own showing, if it meant the drawing of £160,000, that in itself shows that the grant has been availed of to such an extent that there must be an extraordinary number of houses built and that it was a great inducement.  I do not think a case has been made against the amendment, and I intend to press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to imagine, from the demeanour of the Minister, that he is really arguing against his own better judgment.  I rather imagine the Minister's real feeling is that this grant of £45 should be continued.  He has displayed no enthusiasm for the discontinuance of the grant, and I really imagine that, in different circumstances, the Minister would probably say that in his opinion the continuance of the grant was much more desirable than its discontinuance. The Minister says that certain builders told him that the £45 grant was not an important item in the economics of house building so long as money was available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I can hardly imagine that builders went to the Minister merely to tell him that alone.  I fancy they wanted something else done, and that was probably stated by way of reply to the Minister when he was pointing out to them the benefits of the grant.  I imagine the builders were looking for something else the day they made that statement to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, foolishly, and the Minister is now capitalising their <Col N="2797" /> foolishness.  From the way the Minister said it,.  I think the remark was made in reply to a statement from the Minister that the State was giving them the benefit of the grant.  Wanting something else, I fancy it was then the builders said that the £45 grant was not very much use.  One can imagine that they were looking for something more and, being anxious to counter the case made by the Minister, they made that statement.  Contrary to what the Minister has declared was the statement made to me.  I saw a deputation of builders during the last few days and certain persons connected with the building trade unions, and they expressed considerable apprehension as to the effect of this section on future house building in urban areas and particularly in the city.</P>
      <P>The builders and the trade union representatives, looking at the matter from different standpoints, pointed out to me that there is already a considerable amount of unemployment in the building trade and, with the rising cost of building, the position will tend to get worse by reason of the operation of two factors under this Bill.  One is the withdrawal of the £45 grant from the central authority, and the second is the discontinuance of the remission of two-thirds rates over a period of seven years.  Both taken together certainly do constitute a withdrawal of advantages which were formerly available and which acted as an incentive to house building.  Whatever the builders may have said to the Minister, the position is that the builders and the building trade unions are gravely concerned about the effect of this measure; they believe it will have injurious effects on house building in the cities and urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear, at all events, that the State never accepted the viewpoint of the builders that the grant of £45 was of no use to them so long as the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act was available for the advance of money. That Act has been available for a number of years, notwithstanding that the State continued to give grants, not merely of £45, but at one stage of £70. Although he knew that money was <Col N="2798" /> available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, the Minister came here and asked us to pass various housing measures and went to the extent even of giving grants to private builders and utility societies of as much as £70.  If the Minister thought it wise to urge then the making of grants of such an amount at a time when the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act was available, I think it is the clearest possible evidence that the Minister did not then accept the builders' viewpoint that money under the Act was not in itself a sufficient inducement to accelerate housing activities.</P>
    <P>I think the effect of this amending Bill will be to withdraw certain benefits which have been made available to those engaged in the erection of houses.  Whether or not we like the method, the fact remains that the grant of £45 is a very definite incentive to proceed with the erection of houses. The remission of rates is also a very definite incentive and at a time, particularly in urban areas, when there is such a shortage of houses, and particularly when, as in this city, there is a slum problem of gigantic dimensions to be dealt with, anything that has the effect of slowing down the building of houses will be injurious to the State in the long run.  The Minister may say it is the corporation's job to deal with the slum problem.  It is true in the main that the task will fall on the corporation, but anybody who helps to put up an additional house and thereby relieve the housing shortage, to some extent makes a contribution towards providing houses for the people and in some degree makes a contribution towards lessening the evils which inevitably flow from a very serious slum problem.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister would be well advised to continue the grant of £45 as a means of giving an impetus to the erection of houses in the urban areas.  The housing problem in urban areas is far from being solved.  It is particularly acute in this city, notwithstanding the efforts made in recent years to deal with it, and the withdrawal of the £45 grant at this stage would, I think, have injurious effects, <Col N="2799" /> That is the view of builders and the building trade unions, whose unemployment registers are the best barometer of the condition of the housing trade at the present moment. If housing costs were tending to reduce instead of increase, one might understand the withdrawal of the grant, but it is generally acknowledged that there has been a substantial increase in housing costs within the last two years.  The withdrawal of the grant in such circumstances will have even much more serious effects than its withdrawal in normal circumstances would have.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the first amendment in order to enable the grant to be continued for a further period of over two years.  At least something of that kind will enable those engaged in house building to plan their activities ahead, with the knowledge that the grant will be available for that period.  It might, in fact, act as a special incentive to builders to proceed speedily with the erection of houses between now and April, 1940, in the knowledge that after that date the grant might not be available.  The termination of the grant in April next or, as suggested in Deputy Dockrell's amendment, in October will not make any effective contribution between now and then to the housing problem.  That would be especially the case if the grant were to stop in April next.  Even if it were to stop in October next, the effect of the extension would not be nearly as valuable as Deputy Dockrell thinks it would be because, in order to obtain a grant between now and October, 1938, it would be necessary for the house to have been commenced before the 1st January, 1937.  A house commenced after the 31st January, 1937&mdash; even a house commenced this evening or to-morrow morning&mdash;would not participate in this grant even though it were extended to 1938.  The Minister might as well accept an amendment extending it to 1948, once the first restriction, that it must have been commenced before 1st January, 1937, remains.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any value in the amendment, it must permit of the <Col N="2800" /> grant being made in respect of houses started after 1st January, 1937, and not before that date.  I hope that even at this stage, the Minister will indicate his acceptance of the first amendment and the position could be reviewed before the time for termination of the grant arrives.  The sudden stoppage of the £45 grant&mdash;because that is what it means&mdash;notwithstanding the Minister's acceptance of Deputy Dockrell's amendment, will have a very injurious effect on the building trade in urban areas and a particularly injurious effect on house building activities in these areas.  The Minister should not spoil an otherwise good housing programme by dropping this grant at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why Deputy Norton keeps on talking about the effect of the withdrawal of this grant on housing in urban areas when he knows very well that only two urban areas are really concerned.  The grant has been a failure so far as urban areas generally are concerned.  Only the two big cities have ever availed of it.  Practically speaking, the average town, even the town of substantial size, has been quite unaffected by this grant.  That fact surely supports the Minister in his contention that the withdrawal of the grant will not be a serious thing from the point of view of the encouragement of building.  Both Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Norton said that this question was interlocked with the slum problem but neither of them cited any facts which would enable us to say how far it is interlocked with the slum problem. From my information, it is only interlocked to a very small degree. Deputy Dockrell was, I think, speaking largely on theory when he said that each new house which enabled a family to be accommodated had the effect of relieving, to some extent, the slum problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so to the extent of about 5 per cent.  Everybody knows that the great bulk of these houses are being occupied by people who are entering upon housekeeping for the first time and that the effect <Col N="2801" /> on the slum problem is infinitesimal. In my opinion, the Minister is quite right, since a limited sum only can be devoted to housing, in saying that all the money that is available should be devoted to stimulating the direct attack on the slum problem and that, so far as this grant has been of indirect benefit, it has not had the effect that money devoted to a direct attack on the slum problem would have had.  The Minister is, I think, correct in his contention and we should show our approval of his desire to increase the tempo of the attack on the slum problem by supporting his proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is anything in Deputy Moore's argument that in only two urban areas has advantage been taken of this £45 grant seeing that, in answer to Deputy Brennan, the Minister stated that, if his amendment were put into operation, it would cost about £160,000.  If by putting Deputy Brennan's amendment in operation, to make the grant available for houses completed by 1940, only two urban areas would be benefited, I do not see how the cost could amount to £160,000.  I do not think that the Minister has convinced himself that he should withdraw this £45 grant.  The only argument he has put before us is that the builders say they can do better under the Small Dwellings Act. If the Minister looks at the accounts of some of the bigger towns, he will find that there is a considerable debt under the Small Dwellings Act.  It would, I think, be a good thing if, by giving this £45 grant, that debt could be reduced in those areas. Where the Small Dwellings Act is operating, the debt on the local authorities is going up day by day and the Minister should encourage the reduction of that debt by continuing to make available this £45 grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that £15,000 had been withdrawn from people who did not build.  I should like to know from the Minister if that sum was withdrawn solely from urban areas or if it includes rural areas.  If portion of the £15,000 is accounted for by rural <Col N="2802" /> areas, will the Minister say if a second application from those people will be considered?  I know, and the Minister knows, why a great many people did not build both in urban and in rural areas.  During the past one and a half or two years, there has been a sharp advance in the price of building materials.  It was thought that such an advance would not continue, with the result that people put off building. I should like if the Minister would say whether this £15,000 has been withdrawn solely from the urban districts.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to consider again Deputy Brennan's amendment, which is a very reasonable one.  It is certainly an encouragement to people to build, seeing that its cost under Deputy Brennan's amendment would be about £160,000. That shows that advantage must have been taken of it.  In order to induce people to build and to lighten the responsibilities of local authorities, the amendment by Deputy Brennan should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few misunderstandings I want to clear up, but, first, I have to thank the Minister for his decision to accept my amendment.  It was my intention that houses should be started at any time, provided they were completed by October, and if Deputy Norton is correct in what he says, I should like his request to be acceded to.  I have never suggested that the Minister's Department was acting harshly in the matter of these grants.  The Minister and his Department have always taken the line of wanting to see houses put up and the money spent, and of accommodating people within the four corners of the Act as well as they could, and if I have made any suggestion that they were being unduly harsh, I want to withdraw it.  A number of people seem to make statements <Col N="2803" /> which are not, in my opinion, at issue in this question.  The Minister says that he wants the money kept for the housing of the working classes. That is very desirable, but it relates to one type of house and so far as Dublin is concerned&mdash;I still continue in my parochial view and consider Dublin and district&mdash;the money is raised by the Corporation and the amount of money which the Government make available has nothing to do with the money raised by the Corporation for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point on which I am at issue with the Deputies on the opposite side.  Deputy Moore seemed to suggest that, in some extraordinary way, only about five per cent. of these houses contributed towards a solution of the slum problem.  He mentioned the case of a couple getting married. Let us take that case.  They are potential competitors for a Corporation house and if they are not, some other dwelling is made available for people who are moving up, and the answer to that argument is that there are still 3,000 houses not condemned which ought to be condemned.  My argument is that if there were many thousands of these houses provided, the population in Dublin could be stepped up and those houses done away with.  I think Deputy Norton's psychology was excellent in respect of what took place at the interview. There is no doubt that there is a limited demand for houses under this section, that is, for people who can put down a certain sum of money which is strictly limited, and, by getting an advance of the balance somewhere else, purchase these houses, but there is an inexhaustible demand for the hire purchase of houses, if I might so describe it, under which a very small sum is put down and the rest provided by somebody else.  How that could be brought about has been exercising the building trade in recent years.  I think the Minister was approached and I should not be at all surprised if Deputy Norton's view of what took place were true.  I am not in possession of accurate knowledge, but I imagine the Minister was pressed to give some facilities which <Col N="2804" /> would enormously increase the demand for these houses and that when he said there was a £45 grant, the reply was: &ldquo;What is the use of a £45 grant, if a man has no money to buy a house?&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister has sufficiently appreciated that the building industry cannot be started and stopped in a few weeks or a few months.  It requires slow development over a long period and a builder ought to be able to make his plans for some years ahead.  I am very much obliged to the Minister for accepting my amendment and I hope he will also adopt Deputy Norton's suggestion, if it is not embodied in my amendment.  I further hope that he will favourably consider Deputy Brennan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on very many occasions inside and outside this House, has stated that the most pressing problem confronting the people, and particularly the people of the urban areas, and still more particularly, the people of Dublin, is this problem of housing and the slums. I think the Minister must agree that if those of us who have any civic sense have come to the conclusion that sacrifices must be made, if necessary, by this State and by our people in order to provide housing, the removal of any inducement to build is a retrograde step.  The Minister has said that the builders' view of the matter is that the £45 grant is of no importance and that it is not a serious inducement at all.  I think that point has been very lucidly dealt with by Deputy Norton and Deputy Dockrell. I think that, on the face of it, it is ridiculous to suggest that a £45 grant is not an inducement, and a substantial inducement, to anybody about to engage in the building of a house or considering the purchase of a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore's suggestion that the grants under this scheme were not availed of to any great extent, except in the larger urban centres, is not a serious contribution to a consideration of this matter, because we all know that it is precisely in these larger areas that the slum problem and the housing problem exist in their most acute form, and if the grants have been availed of largely in the <Col N="2805" /> big centres, it is, in itself, evidence that the grants are of importance to people engaged in building and to the community generally who are looking for houses.  I also subscribe to the view expressed by other Deputies that the building of a house of any description in Dublin City, or in any urban area where there is an acute housing problem, is a contribution to the slum problem.  Deputy Moore, I think, when referring to the kind of houses affected by this grant, said they were in the main provided for people setting up house for the first time.  Even if that is true, it does not take away from the argument that the provision of such houses is a contribution to the slum problem, because if people are setting up house for the first time, presumably they are in a position to pay a relatively substantial rent and will look for the best possible accommodation available.  It will help people in the slums, because the others will be building up somewhat better accommodation that these people might be moved into.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sound to suggest that the building of houses, for what might be called the upper strata of the working classes, is not a contribution to the housing of the lower strata.  Every house built is a contribution towards the solution of the housing problem, and I think it is definitely a retrograde step to remove any of these inducements.  Reference has been made to increasing the tempo of house building.  How is that going to be done?  I could understand if it was suggested the £45 grant was not a sufficiently big inducement, and that we should give some other and bigger inducement. What other kind of inducement is being substituted for the £45 which it is proposed to take away?  The £45 grant comes to an end, and the seven years' remission of rates also, unless the Minister, at a later stage, indicates his willingness to accept another amendment dealing with that question. If we are going to remove this active personal inducement to people to build, we cannot, at the same time, say that we are going in the right direction <Col N="2806" /> towards increasing the tempo of house building.</P>

      <P>I spoke so often on this question that I do not know if I have anything to add.  The reply to Deputy Norton is that definitely, specifically, and without reference to anything else, the statement was made to me by people who made a lot of money out of houses in recent years. It was made by builders who made a lot of money out of building houses in recent years.  They stated that the £45 grant was not a very big inducement to them to continue building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before Section 4, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  This section shall apply and have effect in reference to every house in an urban area erected after the first day of April, 1937, the floor area of which is not less than 500 square feet nor more than 800 square feet: Provided such house shall contain not less than four rooms.</P>
      <P>(2)  In respect of any house to which this section applies the local authority having power to levy rates shall in every of the first seven local financial years after the valuation for rating purposes remit two-thirds of the rates leviable by the local authority in respect of that house in any such year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2809" /> (3)  The expression &ldquo;floor area&rdquo; in this section has the same meaning as in the First Schedule to the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill this question of the discontinuance of rate exemption for a period of seven years was adverted to by a number of Deputies.  The Minister said that he would look into the matter and see what could be done with regard to a further extension.  He indicated that he did not know whether it would be possible to secure an extension under this Bill, or whether it would require an amendment of the Local Government Act.  Perhaps the Minister would say if he proposes to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to accept it, and for more than one reason.  The first is that I could not accept an amendment extending the provision for the remission of rates for seven years under this Bill, and, secondly, because the Deputy's amendment is an all-embracing one.  It embraces every house built in the country, even by local authorities.  On that basis it could not be accepted.  I want to say to the Deputy that the Local Government Act of 1925 must come up for consideration probably within the next couple of months.  I cannot make any promise except to say that personally I am sympathetic to the idea of continuing the provision for seven years.  Under the Local Government Act it is only allowed for five years.  I cannot, of course, say what the Government's attitude on the matter will be when the amendment of that Act comes up for consideration within the next couple of months, and, without previous discussion with the Government, I could not make any promise.  The amendment as it stands cannot be accepted. This Bill does not take away the right to the remission of rates for new houses, because for a period of five years they still have that.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 10 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from the words &ldquo;of a house&rdquo; to and including the words &ldquo;of this Act&rdquo; and the substitution of the words &ldquo;which shall not exceed 1,250 feet floor area and shall have been completed on or before the 1st day of April, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I am not going to repeat the arguments that I put forward earlier in connection with this measure.  I would like to say that the purchaser of a 1,250-foot floor-area house is not the criminal that he is being represented to be.  In my opinion he is making his contribution to the housing problem, a feeling which I think is shared by a great many people in this city and country.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3), in page 3, to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall not make under this section a grant in respect of works executed on a house to which this section applies where it is shown to his satisfaction that throughout such execution rates of wages have not been paid or conditions of labour observed at least as advantageous to the persons employed on such execution as the appropriate rates of wages or conditions of labour generally recognised by trade unions at the commencement of such works.</P>
      <P>My anxiety, Sir, in introducing this amendment, is for the purpose of trying to prevent a recurrence of what has happened in the past.  It became notorious that a number of builders in this city did not pay the standard rate of wages, and secured the grants although it had been exposed at a later stage that proper conditions of employment were not being observed by such people.  On many occasions, employees got their wages envelope and, as I said before in this House, the amount of money, as stated on the outside of the envelope, was not contained inside the envelope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On very many occasions, when men insisted upon their rights of receiving the standard rate of pay, they were immediately rewarded by dismissal on some pretence or another, with the <Col N="2812" /> result that other men, who had come into the city, accepted the lower rate of pay and pretended that they were receiving the standard rate.  My purpose in introducing this amendment is to have some machinery that would operate in the future to prevent that kind of thing occurring, and to introduce such machinery as will secure the punishment of an employer who is responsible for the robbery of the employee.</P>

      <P>(c) The Minister may require such person as a condition of his receiving a grant to enter into any undertaking which seems proper to the Minister in respect of the rates of wages to be paid or the conditions of labour to be observed in the execution of such works.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment of my own.  It is supplementary to the amendment proposed by Deputy Lawlor and which I have accepted.  As set out, it gives the Minister power to require a person, as a condition of his receiving a grant, to enter into any undertaking which seems proper to the Minister in respect of the rates of wages to be paid or the conditions of labour to be observed in the execution of such works.  I think it is necessary, if we are to have any control over these grants and over the persons to whom these grants will be paid, to be able to insist on their paying the trade union rate of wages and to see that proper conditions of employment are observed.  I think it is necessary that we should have something of this kind to bind them with, so that in case they are found afterwards not to be paying the trade union rate of wages or observing the conditions of labour, we will have something with which to go after them later on in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make in that connection. I think that the amendment meets the case, but there is another angle to it, which, I think, will arise in connection with the amendment of the section itself.  The amendment suggested by the Minister would take its place in sub-section (7), and would then become paragraph (c) of sub-section (7).  Sub-section (7) says that where the Minister makes a grant under this section to any person in respect of works executed on a house, the following provisions shall apply and have effect&mdash;and then it sets out the provisions. It sets them out as paragraphs (a) and (b), and now, by this amendment paragraph (c) will be added&mdash;the trades union clause, so to speak.  In that connection I would refer the Minister back to paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 5, where it states that two types of personages may make a grant.  One type of personage is the Minister, who, it says, may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make a grant; and the other is an urban authority. It says that an urban authority may also make to such person a grant in respect of such works.  I take it that I am correct in saying that two types of people may make a grant.  Sub-section (7), however, says that, where the Minister makes a grant under this section to any persons in respect of works executed on a house, the following provisions shall apply, and so on. I suggest that that does not catch the grant made by an urban authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>But I suggest that that trades union clause is definitely not of any use when a builder may get a grant of, say, £40 from the Minister for putting on, let us say, the roof of a house, because he can say: &ldquo;I am giving trade union wages for the putting on of the roof, but in regard to the other money that I got from the urban authority, I need not do so and I shall pay any wages I like.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister could very easily ensure that that would not take <Col N="2814" /> place by making it a dual arrangement here in sub-section (7).</P>

      <P>We could not do it.  We do not own or control the grants of the local authorities.  Take the case of the Dublin Corporation. They always insist that a fair wages clause and trade union conditions should be included in any works they have given.  They would have the right to insist on proper conditions being observed and the standard rate paid, and I imagine that, under present conditions they would not give any grant without ensuring that the usual conditions would be observed.  The general policy of the Government is to try to apply fair wages clauses, but this makes it specific and we can go after the individuals concerned for the moneys we have granted to them if they do not fulfil the proper conditions.</P>

    <P>(a) The Minister may require such person as a condition of receiving a grant to enter into any undertaking which seems proper to the Minister in respect of the maximum rent to be charged by such person for such house or for any separate dwelling forming part of such house after the execution of such works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When that was inserted, was it ever considered in the light of the Increase of Rent Act?  I think the Minister will agree that, if there is any terrible imposition on this country, it is the Increase of Rent Act at the present moment, and that it has got so complicated now that it has become a nightmare to every lawyer and tenant throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, an unremunerative nightmare.  However, I suggest that this is definitely cutting across certain provisions in the Increase of Rent Act.  As the Minister knows, when a house is controlled by the Increase of Rent Act, the landlord is entitled to make certain statutory increases, and one of the increases he is entitled to make is to increase his rent by a certain percentage of the total amount expended on repairs.  If he spends £50 on a house throughout the years, he is only allowed to increase the rent by a certain percentage.  That is all he is allowed to do by statute.  I contend that if this provision goes through it is going to lead to extraordinary ramifications and is going to increase the present confusion created by the Increase of Rent Act.  I think that this definitely should be construed in the light of the Increase of Rent Act, because otherwise we will have a lot of unnecessary litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGowan's point on that.  To my mind, if a grant is given in respect of the reconditioning or repair of a <Col N="2816" /> house, Deputy McGowan is right when he states that a certain percentage of the amount expended can be added on to the normal rent and that would then be the standard rent.  But I cannot see clearly what the effect of the sub-section will be.  Under the Rent Restriction Act, if the standard rent of a house was 4/6 along with the expenditure on repairs, and the Minister made a grant and as a condition decided that the person getting a grant could not charge more than 6/- per week rent for the house, would the position then be that under this Bill a person will be legally entitled to charge 6/-, whereas according to the Rent Restriction Act the standard rent would be 4/6?  The Minister should carefully consider this point, because anybody with any experience of the Rent Restriction Act knows that there is trouble and difficulty enough in straightening proceedings under that Act without having a sub-section of this sort which is so vague that it is not possible for anyone to see clearly what the effect will be. The Minister should consider what the position will be and not add another source of litigation to the already troublesome Rent Restriction Act.</P>

      <P>This section will enable the Minister to obtain an undertaking from the owner of the dwelling as to the maximum rent to be charged.  If the undertaking is given, then you can understand the legal position.  If the undertaking is not given, then the local authority and the housing department of the Government can reconsider whether they will give the grant or not.  What we have in mind is that the maximum rent should be the rent paid by the former tenant before the expenditure on reconstruction, plus, say, 4 per cent. on the outlay.</P>

      <P>There will be a discussion between the local authority, the Government and the owner as to the rent to be charged, but the Rent Restriction Act has been considered and will be considered in this connection. There will have to be an arrangement made and an undertaking given as to the rent.  I am satisfied that the local authority and the Government Department concerned have some knowledge, at any rate, of the Rent Restriction Act, and that they would see to it that one would not conflict with the other.</P>

      <P>I can understand where there would not be a conflict, but I should like to put this point.  If it happens that the rent under the condition made is more than the legal rent under the Rent Restriction Act, and the landlord charges 6/- he can charge that under his agreement with the Minister&mdash;what is the position of the tenant?  The tenant may pay 6/- for a month or two and then decide to go for his legal rights under the Rent Restriction Act.</P>

      <P>It appears to a layman that this particular amendment is superfluous&mdash;that everybody will go back to their legal and lawful rights, and that any undertaking given to the Minister will not override those rights. If the Minister gets an undertaking from people, and they get a grant on that undertaking, is there anything to prevent them later on from going for their legal rights according to the Rent Restriction Act?  Apparently there is not.  You come back to the one thing, and this appears to be superfluous.  They cannot go beyond a certain amount under the Rent Restriction Act.  The Minister apparently does not want to put them either above or below that.  They are going to go for their legal rights, and the whole thing seems to be superfluous.</P>

      <P>No.  You cannot contract outside the Increase of Rent Act. That is established.  I do not wish to be an obstructionist, but I think it will give rise to a lot of trouble later on.  Under the Increase of Rent Act you are only entitled to raise the rent to a certain amount, and in that is included certain compensation for the amount spent on repairs during a certain number of years.  If you insert something now altering the whole thing, and if you include a provision that the Increase of Rent Act shall not apply to a house of this kind, it would perhaps ease the matter.  The Minister knows that a person may be in occupation of a house eight or nine years and suddenly find out that he is paying rent that is in excess of the legal rent.  If he takes action against the landlord he may recover something like £100 or more.  If that were in this, he could say: &ldquo;I did that under an agreement with the Minister because I got a grant from him.&rdquo; If the Minister included in this now that if a grant is paid under this section the Increase of Rent Act shall not apply, that definitely would get out of the predicament which perhaps will arise with a certain amount of <Col N="2819" /> grist to the mills of the lawyers, which of course is no harm.</P>

      <Col N="2820" /> Section 8 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following sub-section at the end of the said section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4) The Minister may, as a condition of his making a grant to any person or public utility society in respect of the erection of a house to which in his opinion this section applies require such person or public utility society (as the case may be) to enter into any undertaking which seems proper to the Minister as to the rates of wages to be paid or the conditions of labour to be observed in such erection.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before Section 7, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the Minister has, whether before or after the passing of this Act, paid to any person or public utility society under Section 5 of the Principal Act or this Act, any grant or instalment of a grant and as a condition to his receiving such grant such person or public utility society (as the case may be) has given any undertaking to the Minister and such undertaking has not been complied with the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Such person or public utility society (as the case may be) shall be liable to repay to the Minister the amount of such grant.</P>
      <P>(2)  Such amount may be recovered from such person or public utility society (as the case may be) as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The court in which such amount is so recovered shall on the application of the Minister declare such amount to be a charge on the house in respect of which such grant was made, and thereupon the Minister shall for the purpose of enforcing such charge have all the same powers and remedies as if the Minister was a mortgagee by deed having powers of <Col N="2821" /> sale and lease, accepting surrenders of leases and of appointing a receiver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The implications of the amendment appear to me extraordinary. It provides that if a certain undertaking has not been complied with, the Minister shall adopt certain steps set out in the amendment. The way in which he is going to enforce the carrying out of these undertakings is set out as follows: &ldquo;Such amount may be recovered from such person or public utility society (as the case may be) as a civil debt.&rdquo; Now, here is where the Minister looks for his security: &ldquo;The court in which such amount is so recovered shall, on the application of the Minister, declare such amount to be a charge on the house in respect of which such grant is made.&rdquo;  Have we not many builders building houses and selling them before they are built?  In fact, very often the house is not the property of the contractor or the builder against whom the judgment is given.  How is the Minister going to provide for that? Would it not be a very serious matter if a builder built a house and, after getting the grant, sold the house to somebody else and the Minister subsequently got a charge levied against the house?  Does the Minister think that is fair?  It has been the custom for people to build houses or to reconstruct them for sale.  If the Minister wants some security for the undertaking given to him, he should get a security other than a person who is entirely innocent of the whole proceeding and who should not have his house mortgaged in this way.  I should like to know what are the Minister's views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has expressed my view as to what is intended in the amendment.  There have been cases, not many, where utility societies have got grants on the grounds that they were building houses for letting and shortly afterwards, perhaps a year or so afterwards, they sold these houses.  They did not keep to their undertaking.  We think it reasonable <Col N="2822" /> to apply this section to them in regard to wages and conditions of labour.  A difficulty may arise with regard to making it retrospective but I think it would be, at any rate, wise to provide that for the future in regard to the new houses that are being built, these provisions should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's contention that everybody in this country who requires a house should be conversant with that particular section? Ninety-nine per cent. of the people who will be buying houses will not know that there is any such condition to be fulfilled.  The people are expected to know the law but they are entitled to some safeguard in the matter.  If the Minister is going to carry out that provision, he should put in some safeguard which will compel the builder to disclose certain things to a purchaser. After all, this does not put any time limit to the period during which an objection can be made against a building.  For instance, a builder may not have carried out the conditions with regard to wages or some other conditions, but this Bill does not lay down that an objection must be made while the house is being erected. It might be a year or two afterwards that certain complaints are made against the builder.</P>
      <P>In that case the Minister would be letting some absolutely innocent person in for a penalty.  He should allow some way out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  Let us suppose that a man is purchasing a house and the solicitor acting for the purchaser says: &ldquo;Well, before I conclude the purchase of this house, I had better ask the Local Government Department if they have got anything against the builder.&rdquo;  Supposing they were asked to furnish a certificate that they had nothing against the builder, would they be prepared to furnish that certificate, or can they afterwards go back on their own certificate?  To my mind, this means attaching other people's property for a debt they never incurred and with which they had no connection. I think the Minister should stand or fall on the assets of the people against whom he has a claim.  I think <Col N="2823" /> he should not seek to enforce it against a perfectly innocent victim.  It is going to have the most extraordinary repercussions.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the position in which a house purchaser, who buys through a building society or an insurance society, would be put if this amendment is carried.  It will be inserted in all the leases.  It will, in my opinion, seriously affect these people, and it will prevent a large number of people, who usually purchase their houses through insurance societies, from getting any advances. The solicitors for these insurance societies will ask for a clear certificate first.  These societies advance, say, four-fifths of the purchase price to the person buying the house, and if the Minister carries forward this claim without any limitation, the societies now engaged in that business, who help some hundreds of people in the City of Dublin to own their own houses, may decide to withdraw from house purchase business altogether.  I would ask the Minister to consider the views of outside bodies or solicitors representing bodies who advance money. This is a sort of second or third mortgage. Does the Minister wish to make this a first or a second claim on the house?  Some of those houses are valued to the very last point in order to give the purchaser every opportunity. I am looking at this from the point of view of a solicitor representing a society that would advance money, and it may seriously affect the purchase of houses under this system.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this, at any rate for the time being, in order to consider that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the amendment, but I see certain dangers.  In the event of a purchase, the solicitor acting for the purchaser would not, by means of an ordinary search in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry, be able to have cognizance of this particular mortgage, and consequently the person who purchased would be subsequently saddled with a debt which he himself did not incur.  I agree with the <Col N="2824" /> amendment, but I would make this suggestion.  Would the Minister consider now, by way of machinery, that when grants are being given to utility societies he would issue a certificate stating that all his provisions and all his requirements had been complied with?</P>
      <P>Some document of that kind, which would be filed in the Land Registry or registered in the Registry of Deeds, would make the amendment extremely workable.  Perhaps that might be established by way of machinery. When the Department is satisfied, they might issue a certificate which could be registered in the Registry of Deeds or filed in the Land Registry. Then the ordinary purchaser, by paying a few shillings, would be able to make a search and discover all the encumbrances.  I think the amendment is a good one, but I foresee that there might be a certain difficulty.  I think that suggestion would be a way out of the difficulty.</P>

I do not think it is at all fair that either landlords or tenants should be put into the position that something is being done in this Bill which confers, at any rate, a right which they believe they can stand over in law, while they may subsequently find that they are falling back on another Act of Parliament which is already in existence and that their right under this Act is not there at all.

Imagine the position of a landlord who, as I said before, is empowered by the Minister's condition to charge a rent of 6/- a week.  The tenant pays that rent for a period of, let us say, six years.  Subsequently, on seeing a decision in the courts, he discovers that the landlord was not entitled to charge that rent of 6/- that the standard rent was 3/- or 3/6 or 4/-.  He then sues the landlord and recovers the excess payments over a period of six years.  I think the Minister should at least consider that matter and not leave us with an ambiguity which the courts must decide. I seriously suggest that the <Col N="2826" /> Minister cannot say there is nothing in the point.  If there is nothing in it, it ought to be very easily demolished. I think it is entirely unfair to the people of this country, who will be in the relative position of landlord and tenant hereafter, that something is going to be done in this Act which will put them in the position that they will not know where they stand either as regards this Act or the Increase of Rent Act.</P>

There is enough trouble arising under the Increase of Rent Act at the present moment, and if this complication is put in the Lord knows where it is going to end.  Would the Minister not consider, say, excluding this from the application of the Increase of Rent Act?  If he put in a small addendum that when a house is the subject-matter of a grant the Increase of Rent Act shall not apply, I think it would get out of the difficulty.  Otherwise, I can see myself changing my car from a Morris to a Rolls Royce in a short time, and I will thank the Minister very much for being able to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is speaking on the assumption that the officials of the Government who will have control of these grants and make the regulations under which they will be given, and the officials of the local authorities who make those grants, know nothing about the Rent Restrictions Act; that they will ignore it and never think about it.  The amendment has been drafted having taken the Rent Restrictions Act into consideration. We are aware that it is there. We know that there will be certain relations between the Rent Restrictions Act and the rents that may be charged under that section.  It will be provided in regulations that the new rents will have to bear relation to the legal rights of any tenants whose rents may be altered under the new Act.</P>

      <P>We are going to adjourn over Christmas.  I remember somewhat distant days on which, when there was a motion of this kind for the adjournment, those who are now on the Government Benches used to protest and say that, with the problems facing the country, it was wrong that the House should adjourn.  I cannot take up that line.  I should not be honest in taking it up, considering the conduct of the Government and the way they have conducted the business of the House since the election. They have not brought forward any measure of great importance tending to promote the welfare of the people since the general election.  So far as important Government business is concerned, that is, business affecting the daily lives of the people, the House might as well not have sat.  That is the Government contribution, so far as the welfare of this State is concerned, since they were elected last July.  Not merely that, but though there was again and again opportunity to discuss many things in which the country is interested, many problems that do vitally affect the people, the Government deliberately prevented this House from discussing them.  Therefore, I cannot take up what used to be the time-honoured pretence of an objection to the motion that the House should adjourn for longer than a week or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody who has the welfare of the State at heart, anybody who is interested in the wellbeing of the people, can look forward with any great pleasure to the coming Christmas.  Our export trade is still in the same muddle, is still in the same most unsatisfactory state into which the Government deliberately plunged it some five years ago.  Ministers may <Col N="2829" /> now pretend that they were not responsible, but surely the memories of Deputies are not so short that they cannot recollect when they boasted here and elsewhere of the fact that in this particular war they had fired the first shot?  The President made it clear that, so far as the effect of that war was concerned, it was only going to hurry on the policy he had at heart. How could he then regard the chaos into which he was plunging the economic life of the country as anything else except a blessing, something, in his own words in College Green, that was calculated to bring to an earlier fruition the ideals he had for this country?</P>
    <P>That was the situation then.  The situation has not improved essentially since then.  Everywhere we look, what is the picture?  Agriculture is depressed, not a single branch of it in a sound condition.  The cattle trade, one of our main sources of revenue, has been almost destroyed&mdash;deliberately at one period the Government set out to destroy it.  They set out with that as their policy.  Look at the dairying industry and see the muddle it is in.  Is there a single person in town or country who understands what the policy of the Government is so far as the dairying industry is concerned? As regards the pig industry, all I can say about that is that the muddle there is almost equal to what it is in the dairying industry.  Poultry and eggs show a lamentable decline.  I do not think even the Minister for Industry and Commerce with his new breed of hens could save that industry now.  All the important branches of agriculture are in as bad a condition as they could be.</P>
    <P>Any slight improvement recently means simply that you have given to a man who was actually, in the full sense of the word, starving, a little assistance, a little food to keep alive. That is all there is of so-called improvement. The condition of our main branches of industry still remain essentially unhealthy, unsound, such that the nation cannot long stand. Where are we as regards that great tillage policy that was to be the compensation for the wilful destruction of all these things&mdash;one of the reasons <Col N="2830" /> that made us hail the economic war as a blessing in disguise, that great instrument that was to bring about in 18 months the results that the President suggested otherwise would require 17 years?  You have had that policy in force for 18 months, and more than 18 months, and are we any nearer that policy of economic salvation which was then preached than we were when this trouble was started?  Every day the country has to bear, not merely the present strain, but the strain of the losses of the last three or four years. People think that because there might be a slight improvement in certain branches that it means a general improvement. It does not, because that is only the bringing up of people from an exceedingly low condition to one that would have been slightly less low had not the weight of the past losses to be borne by them.</P>
    <P>As regards your wheat policy, is the Minister for Agriculture satisfied with the experience of the past 12 months? There was a decline easy to understand in the acreage under wheat, and obviously there was a decline in the quality. Is that to be the substitute for the destruction of the wealth of this country that the Government deliberately engaged in?  Will the Minister for Agriculture treat these hard facts of the economic situation of our farmers with the same light-heartedness as the President always treats cogent arguments?  Will he simply ignore them?  I fancy the stronger they are the more he will ignore them. The cost of living is going up, not because there is a demand for our goods from outside, and, therefore, a bigger market for them.  If that happened, there would be ample compensation for the rise in the cost of living, but we have no such compensation. The cost of living is going up and keeping pace, not with an increase of our wealth, not with an increase of our trade, but with the decrease of our wealth and the continued destruction of our trade.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere, in industry, what have you but chaos?  Factories are started every day without any plan or system. Does anybody pretend that there is a plan or could be a plan?  Factories fairly recently established are already <Col N="2831" /> working part time.  That is called an industrial policy!  No wonder the Minister for Industry and Commerce sometimes casts an eye on another Department&mdash;Agriculture.  I know that an industrialist did express the view that it was a pity the Government did not appoint Deputy Lemass as Minister for Agriculture.  He justified that view by saying that as the Government were deliberately setting out to destroy agriculture, it did not matter whom they appointed Minister. At least, if Deputy Lemass had been appointed Minister for Agriculture, only agriculture would have been destroyed and industry would have had some chance.</P>
    <P>We have a position in which our principal industry&mdash;still our basic industry&mdash;is in a deplorable condition and is deliberately kept in that condition; we have the cost of living increasing without any corresponding increase in our national wealth, and we have chaos in our industrial system as a result of the complete lack of plan or system on the part of the Minister responsible.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is beginning to acknowledge that.  He is beginning to say things that it would have been treason for us&mdash;a &ldquo;sabotaging of our industrial policy&rdquo;&mdash;to say some time ago.  That was the charge made a couple of years ago when these things were pointed out from these benches but they become as holy writ when spoken from the opposite side by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In addition, there is industrial unrest. Can any Deputy tell me what strikes have been on, what strikes are on and what strikes will be on in the City of Dublin as a result of the intolerable situation mainly brought about by Government policy?  It has been pointed out on every side, except the Fianna Fáil side, that you are looking for industrial unrest when you increase the cost of living and do not, at the same time, increase wages.  We have a ruined agriculture, chaotic industry, industrial unrest, and emigration.  It is all very well for a Minister to go down to his constituency and bemoan the flight of the people from the land. It is all very well for the Minister for <Col N="2832" /> Agriculture to suggest, as a method of keeping them on the land, the provision of light reading.  That is not a serious way to treat a serious problem any more than was the suggestion as to the light beer we were to get from Clare.  The President has good reason to laugh.  We have not seen the light beer.  Very few of us have had an opportunity of drinking it in the large quantities the President recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty about the cider-apples, as Deputy Gorey showed.  However, the President might hit upon that.  It would be a change of policy and the farmers would be safe.  The beer remedy was dropped very quickly but it was not a bit more absurd than many of the other suggestions or remedies put forward by the President.</P>
      <P>When we brought up the question of emigration here, we were scoffed at by Ministers.  There was no such thing, they said, yet everybody knew there was.  Ministers think that by denying what everybody else knows to be plain, desperate facts, they can cover up a situation.  You have had increasing emigration and a net loss of population by emigration.  It is quite true that the number of people on the live register of unemployed may be down.  That is because the living workers have gone to England.  They found there, as was said in the British House of Commons, the unskilled work they could not get in this country.  Our factories were to provide skilled workers but our people have had to emigrate and get unskilled work in England while the Government complacently sits down and does nothing.  It will not even face the facts.  It will not even admit that there is a problem to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Government bring forward certain tests of good government such as increased employment. Where is the increased employment, when you take the emigration and unemployment figures together?  There is, we are told, a higher standard of living.  These were great things for the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2833" /> to mouth about at Geneva, but, here in Ireland, he cannot speak so convincingly about them, because he is faced by a people that is realising&mdash; and every day realising more&mdash;what the policy of the Government means so far as employment, meeting the needs of the people, and improved standards of living are concerned.  A nice record for the Government to show&mdash;agriculture ruined, industry in chaos, industrial unrest and increasing emigration of our young people to Great Britain!  A glorious record, and one of which the President may well be proud!  If he so desires, I am sure he will find reasons for being proud of it, and will prove that a policy with these results is a really sane and sound policy&mdash;the only policy that is worth carrying out.  The Government's fantastic policies in regard to butter and bacon have not alone practically driven the people affected out of their senses, but have driven them out of production. What is the explanation of the decline in the pig population?  Interference&mdash;incompetent interference&mdash;on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>We are approaching Christmas.  It is only a couple of years since a person highly placed in the Government&mdash; very highly placed, though not as highly placed as the President&mdash;told a friend of mine that there was a settlement coming, and that it would be a good settlement.  We were told the same last year&mdash;I do not say from quite the same authority.  I expect the same rumours will go about now. A settlement must come some time, and, therefore, the prophecy about a settlement will come true some time. It is impossible to think that this thing can go on year after year as a sore poisoning the whole life of the country.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the Government, in spite of that, will be forced by the actual conditions that prevail in this country to make such a settlement. Every month and every year that a settlement has been postponed, and will be postponed, means the infliction of severe losses on this country. What does the Government care about that need?  First of all, they took up a complete <i>non-possumus</i> attitude. In some matters the Government say <Col N="2834" /> they cannot compromise; they look upon compromise as certain surrender. That is an extraordinary confession of inferiority complex.  But when they had brought the country to the last gasp, then they were forced to make the Coal-Cattle Pact: they were forced to break with the policy that they held to be fundamental and supreme.  These pacts were expedients, palliatives that helped for the time being, that merely kept the patient alive.  Now, after a couple of years of Coal-Cattle Pacts they are realising&mdash;I hope the Government has realised&mdash;that the country can no longer be satisfied with them, that something very different, something much more far-reaching than any Coal-Cattle Pacts, is what it requires, and that no pride on the part of Parties or individuals should stand in the way of such a measure of that kind as the country finds necessary.</P>
    <P>Opportunity after opportunity thrown away!  It was only the other day in the House of Commons that the British Premier pointed out what the Ottawa agreements meant to those in the Dominions that participated in them.  There was an increase of over 40 per cent. in the trade of every one of them as a result of these agreements. Our foreign trade went down over 40 per cent. as a result of our non-participation and as a result of the President scotching the agreement that was come to there.  No wonder you have agriculture in the state it is. No wonder you have industrial unrest, no wonder you have chaos everywhere, and no wonder people are beginning to realise that there is neither leading nor light in the Government.  There was this economic policy, this economic war, this other round with England, that the President once blazoned forth in the country.  Of course everyone misunderstood him.  I have heard the real explanation of what the innocent man meant by &ldquo;another round with England.&rdquo;  Here is an extract from a Republican organ, the <i>Kerry Champion</i>, of 27th February, 1932.  I want really to whitewash the President, to show that what everyone thought he meant was not what he meant, that he was quite innocent&mdash;Pickwickian, in fact:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2835" />&ldquo;During Mr. de Valera's last visit to Tralee I have been told that when he was staying at Dan Browne's he gave some account of that much-used propaganda: &lsquo;Going another round with England.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to the innocence of the man.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem that Mr. de Valera has never seen a boxing match and does not know what a boxing ring is like.  The ring he had in mind was the one at Blackrock College where the college sports are run every year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He was a fairly good athlete, and the mile and half-mile were his favourite events.  It would seem that the mile at Blackrock is run on a circular 220 yards track, and on one occasion when he competed one of the other competitors made the pace so hot that all the others except himself and the pace-maker dropped out before the end of the seventh lap.  At that stage de Valera felt done in...</P>
    <P>Like the country does at present.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He was about to give up when he reasoned that the one in front might be as much played out as himself. He continued, and the pace-maker dropped 30 yards from the post.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Poor man, he collapsed like England.</P>

      <P>Mr. de Valera staggered.  He is keen on staggering to-day.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;De Valera staggered past him, fell two yards from the line, and was able to get up and crawl past the winning line.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This race seems to have a marked impression on him in after-life...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is still staggering and gasping, and his ideal, according to himself, is that the country is gasping and gasping for the last few years.  That is the explanation he gave to his friends in Tralee.  Everyone will understand the innocence of the phrase.  Like many before it, another famous slogan of the President was given a twist.  Whether it is going to collapse or not, he has brought the country to the last gasp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2836" /> Remember we all heard it preached through the country that England could not do without our cattle, that the English people would starve without them, and that they would be brought to their knees.  In fact, the war was won almost before the first shot was fired, so far gone was that conclusion.  I am afraid the ordinary farmer does not feel that it is, and that it is not England is brought to her knees, but that we are brought to the last gasp.  Therefore, I am sure the time will come when even the pride, the wilfulness and the obstinacy of the Government will have to give way, whether they like it or not, and that, despite all the opportunities they have missed, they will be forced, if still in office, to settle this matter.  Every year that passes makes us weaker as a result of the policy of the Government and of the two Ministries I mentioned, Agriculture and Industry and Commerce.  Every year makes us weaker and makes our position as bargainers worse.</P>
    <P>There were certain things, undoubtedly, before the electorate at the last election, matters in which anybody who took part on any side in the election campaign must be aware the people were extremely interested in, the cost of living, the economic war, and emigration.  These are matters on which, undoubtedly, there was a pronouncement against Government policy by a majority of those who cast their votes.  What has been done in any of these matters by the Government in the five and a half months they have been in office since the election?  Absolutely nothing. They have not advanced a solution to any of these questions.  They have not made any of these things press less heavily on the people in the towns or in the country.  I heard in various towns with which I am familiar that there is a scarcity of purchasing power at present, especially in certain shops that sell clothes and things of that sort.  No wonder Ministers are beginning to whine, to find fault, and to object to opposition which they gave the House no opportunity of exercising. No wonder they are doing that, when they are really up against a <Col N="2837" /> situation that they have themselves brought about in this country.  Their policy, if I may follow the agricultural bent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has come home to roost, and with quite as lamentable results as the breed of poultry he is promoting.  There is emigration, a flight from the land and flight from the country, even by Government supporters in many cases, of young men and young women to unskilled work in England, because there is work enough neither for the skilled nor unskilled in this country.  There is confusion and chaos practically everywhere. No wonder the Government, from the President down, are feeling the bleak wind that now blows upon them.  They know perfectly well that whatever prestige they had last June has been largely dissipated now by their incapacity and by their failure to deal with the very things the people were interested in.  They did manage to scramble through the last election. They pretended, and we all remember the pretences, that they were delighted with the results and quite satisfied.  Why is it necessary, then, for Minister after Minister to address statements to the people that they are not satisfied with these things?</P>
    <P>All we have for remedies of the situation are light literature, crowing hens and the abolition of proportional representation.  These are the only contributions to our national policy by the Government.  It is quite true that a new Constitution comes into force on the 29th December.  This is a happy country in which to introduce such a Constitution and I am sure it will be a great help to the people who are suffering from the policy of the Government.  It is a Constitution, according to which we are, to ourselves, apparently, a Republic and to all outsiders we are a part of the British Dominions.  That is what it means and it follows the unfortunate precedent which the President himself set in 1921, namely, that it does not matter what we are; we will regard ourselves as independent. Apparently, he is now satisfied that the rest of the world may regard us <Col N="2838" /> as portion of the Commonwealth of Nations, but we will regard ourselves more or less, less or more, a Republic, and that will save the farmer and bring order into the chaotic condition of our industries.  In these happy circumstances, the Dáil wishes the people of Ireland a happy Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for the last half-hour to Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks, and there are a few points in connection with his statement on which I wish to speak before dealing with the matters with which I want to deal myself.  I noticed that during the 30 minutes he spoke, he concentrated at least ten minutes on a more or less personal attack on the President.  If we were so insane as to believe all that we have heard from him, it is not in this House we would be, but inside a mental home somewhere.  I think the Government deserve congratulations from all sections of this House and from all sections of the community for the progress it has made in its national, social, industrial and economic policies.  I think it is also to be congratulated, and the people of the country do congratulate it, on the peaceful conditions which have prevailed in this State for the past year or more.  During the past year the first consideration of the Government has been to cater, as usual, for the poor people in the community and to add to the long list of social services already established and put into force. We had improvements in those social services during the year, including an improvement in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  The Government's housing scheme, which is undoubtedly designed chiefly for the benefit of those who are not in a position to build houses wholly from their own resources, has progressed greatly since the Government came into office and particularly in the last 12 months. Even in the constituency which did me the honour of electing me among its representatives, housing, and particularly housing for the working classes, has progressed in the last year, but there are still certain towns and villages that are more or less left out in the cold at the moment.  That, however, is not the fault of the Government, <Col N="2839" /> but of the local board, which is run and controlled by the Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has tried to persuade himself, the House and the country that agriculture and industry in this country are in a terrible muddle.  He must think that members of this House have very short memories. It is not many weeks ago since the Minister for Agriculture proved to Deputy O'Sullivan and the members of the Opposition, and at the expense of some of the Opposition, that every agricultural product sold at present, with the exception of cattle, is sold at a higher price than in 1931, before Fianna Fáil came into office.  Deputy O'Sullivan has alluded to the very bad state of the dairying industry, but he and everybody else knows well that the Government saved the dairying industry from ruin.</P>

They wanted it a month or two ago when the price in the world's market suddenly went up.  They wanted a free market then, but in 12 months' time, if the price goes down again, they will be asking for a protected market.</P>

    <P>Allusion has also been made to the bacon industry.  Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="2840" /> tried to make capital out of the low pig population in the country at the moment.  As a farmer, and speaking as a farmer, I can well remember the time when a large pig population caused the farmers of this country enormous losses.  Is it not better that a farmer should produce, let us say, 20 fat pigs at a profit than 100 pigs at a loss, and that was the position when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office: it was a position which that Government closed its eyes to, and one which the Fianna Fáil Government, by its wise policy of protection, has changed, and thereby stabilised the industry.  The same applies to poultry and eggs.  As regards wheat and beet, we have heard fictitious tales told in this House of wheat crops that never ripened and of yields of three, four and five bushels to the acre.  The people who told them knew well that their statements were far removed from the facts.  They knew that what they said was not true. I calculate, and I think I calculate rightly, that when the results of this year's crops are published it will be found that the yield will be up to the average&mdash;somewhere in or about one ton to the acre, taking the good with the bad.</P>
    <P>The wheat-growing policy of the Government has been welcomed by a large number of farmers in the constituency that I represent.  It has resulted in putting money into the pockets of the farmers, and it was about time that the farmers and those who live on the farm&mdash;the farm labourer&mdash;got a place in the sun, a price for their products and got paid for their labour.  That is the policy that has been adopted by this Government. They have encouraged certain lines in agriculture in order to help the farmer to maintain himself and his family, and the people working for him, in decent conditions.</P>

In the constituency of North Cork, which I represent, the Cumann na nGaedheal farmers threatened their employees if they <Col N="2841" /> voted for Fianna Fáil at the first election that they would reduce their wages, and they did.  Some of them made a further reduction in the men's wages in 1933, but thanks to the Fianna Fáil Government some of that reduction was restored in 1937.</P>

The trouble about the beet is that the farmers who grow it would like if the price was a bit higher.  I hope the price will go higher, because the farmer and those working for him are entitled to a fair price for their products and their labour.</P>

      <P>He can interrupt as much as he likes.  I am not one who changes his mind, to try to persuade a man that black is white or white is black.  I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. The Government have helped the agricultural community in various other ways: by grants for the reclamation of land, by minor relief schemes, drainage, the making of accommodation roads and land division.  The division of land has been carried out by this Government in the teeth of the opposition offered by the people on the other side.  The only fault I have to find with it is that the land cannot be divided more quickly, although the speed is at least ten times greater than it was when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office.  The same applies to afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on what they are doing to develop our native resources.  We have heard a lot about industry.  The Deputies on the Opposition Benches tell us that it is in a chaotic state.  Take the constituency of North Cork which is not a highly industrialised area.  Here are some figures that I can stand over. <Col N="2842" /> In 1931 the total number employed in the hosiery industry in that constituency was 107.  Now the number is 210, an increase of 103.  In the new cheese factory put up at Mitchelstown there are 120 hands employed, thanks to the policy of Fianna Fáil.  In the milling industry&mdash;and this is a very generous estimate&mdash;161 persons were employed in 1931.  Now there are 222 employed, an increase of 61.  In the combined bacon and ham industry 35 persons were employed in 1931, and now 131, an increase of 96.</P>
    <P>We were lucky enough to get a sugar factory in our part of the country.  At the time that we did get it the members of the Opposition started a ramp and a campaign, going around telling the farmers of the district not to grow beet.  They said: &ldquo;If you grow beet you will be helping to keep Fianna Fáil in office; you will be helping to keep de Valera in office.&rdquo;  That was the kind of stuff they used, but what did we find?  That after the first 12 months the very people who had joined in that ramp against the growing of beet were those who were most eagerly looking for acreage at the time that we were trying to get a decent price from the company, and in that way spiked our guns, so to say. That is how those great friends of agriculture helped their fellow farmers. In the sugar factory there are 180 permanent hands employed at the moment and 14 loading agents.  During the campaign period there are 500 extra hands employed, and if you take it that they only do three months' work, it will average 125 for the whole year, making a total of 319.  As far as industry in North Cork is concerned&mdash; and I am only dealing with my own constituency&mdash;the total number employed in industry before Fianna Fáil came into office, in the industries I have named, was 303 persons, whereas the number now employed is 1,001, an increase of 698.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the industries there, and whatever may be said about the number of people who emigrated, a far greater number emigrated during the time when Cumann <Col N="2843" /> na nGaedheal was in office.  I am giving facts.  I am not dealing in fictions, and I am not trying to persuade myself, like Deputies opposite, that this is the case, or that is the case, knowing very well that it is not the case.  That is the position, as I see it.  I believe that any Parliament is not of any use or of much use unless you have a good, sound Opposition with a constructive policy, and I do not think that an Opposition that acts in some matters in the same way as the Opposition in this House are acting could be of much use to the country or to the Parliament as a whole.</P>
      <P>This is a time when all the other States of Europe are out for a policy of self-sufficiency and are organising all their national resources.  We know &mdash;and the whole world knows it also&mdash; that at any moment Europe and the whole world may be plunged back into the position in which we were from 1914 to 1918.  Is it not our duty, then &mdash;our duty to our people&mdash;to safeguard our people against what might happen in times like that?  Is it not the duty both of the Government and the Opposition to help in every way possible in such circumstances, but you certainly are not helping your people when you turn around and try to convince the people and the rest of the world that they are very badly off, when they are not as badly off as you say, or even anything like as badly off as you say, and when you know that very well yourselves.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Opposition seems to be that they want to show the rest of the world that there is an incompetent Government in charge here. That should not be the attitude of an Opposition in regard to matters of broad national policy.  Such an attitude might be all very well in certain respects, but in dealing with States it is not the proper attitude to adopt. We have been told by the Opposition that they could settle all this matter, well, why do they not go across the water and ask their friends there to settle the matter?  All I can say is, that if they do, they will come back again and the Irish people will send them across once more for a happy Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene, Sir, in this debate and I would not intervene were it not for what Deputy Meaney said with regard to pigs and bacon.  The Deputy is inclined to paint a glorious picture&mdash;it was typical of his whole speech&mdash;of the position of the pig industry at the moment.  The facts, however, are not those imagined by the Deputy.  According to official figures, there are 10,000 sows less to-day in the country, as on the 1st June last, than there were 12 months previously, and that means an actual shortage of about 120,000 pigs this year.  That, added to the 77 of a shortage the year before, means that the resulting shortage is a cause for grave apprehension and consideration and it gives a clear indication of the state of the country.  If evidence were needed to corroborate that, I need only produce the quota that has been given to the factory with which I am connected for the month of September. The average quota for the last few years would work out in the neighbourhood of 1,000, or perhaps a little more, per week.  This amount of 2,733 for a month, comprising a period of 31 days, works out at 600, and all the reports and all the informed opinion we can get on the subject point to a still further decrease.  There is no way of getting over these figures.  They are the official figures.  On the one hand, we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce issuing figures that we must take as accurate, and, on the other hand, we have the Pigs Marketing Board issuing figures that we must take as accurate.  There is no disputing these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a previous debate here, causes were suggested as to why the pig population in this country had decreased. One of the reasons put forward was that the producer was not getting enough for his pigs, and another reason put forward was that, possibly, feeding stuffs were too dear and also were of the type that would not give a proper return for the expenditure incurred.  On the other hand, on enquiry during the last three months or so, it has been found that there was a much graver cause than either of these, and that is that the pig producers are not able to buy the feeding <Col N="2845" /> stuffs in the shops and are not able to get credit in the shops or anywhere else to purchase the materials with which to feed their pigs.  That is the real cause of the shortage, and I suggest that that is much more alarming than the fact that a certain admixture scheme was not giving an adequate return or that the Pigs Marketing Board had not been paying enough for pigs.  The actual fact is that the people cannot produce the pigs and cannot get credit anywhere.  That is very alarming, but it is typical of the whole position and typical of what is happening all over the country.</P>
    <P>Certain figures were quoted here by me in the course of the debate on the cost of living, and certain figures were given by the Minister for Agriculture. Although the Minister for Agriculture has found out since some facts in connection with these statements, no opportunity has been taken to contradict these statements or to put the matter right.  The fact is that the Minister for Agriculture did not get his figures at Dublin Castle; he got them at Lord Edward Street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy challenge the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>And he got them for the year ending the 1st December each year, whereas our figures were for the year ended 1st April.  Our figures were figures that had been duly audited and sent in by the auditor.  The point is that the Minister was correct for his particular portion of the year, and I was equally correct for my portion of the year.  I have the detailed figures if the Minister or anybody else wants to examine them, showing exactly all the figures, and they will prove that everything I said was exactly true, except with regard to our quota of pigs.  I certainly made a mistake there, and I admit it, but all the rest is correct.  The statement as to the profits we were making then was correct, and the statement of the profits we are making now, for 1936-37, is also correct.  However, what I really rose to draw attention to is this question of the decrease or decline in the pig population, which is the keynote of the position of the people at <Col N="2846" /> the present time.  They have been driven into a position in which they cannot feed pigs and cannot get credit anywhere to enable them to purchase the materials for the feeding of the pigs.  The result will be that pigs will disappear out of the country in the next few years because the producers cannot feed them or get any credit anywhere. The creameries have refused credit, and the shopkeepers all over the country have refused credit.  If the people on the opposite side would only open their eyes to the position they would realise what is going to be the inevitable result, but in my opinion they do not care a damn.  They tell us a lot about what they are doing for the people and about how everybody must get a rise in the world and so on, but it is my opinion that they do not give a damn how the rest of the people suffer so long as they have the right end of it.</P>

So far as I can see, no serious attempt has been made to deal with its actual terms or to point out to the House exactly what the motion requires to have done. If we are to understand the plain language of this motion it deplores the lowering of the standard of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the whole policy of the Government has been directly challenged, and the speeches made by the Deputies who have spoken this afternoon and those who have addressed this House on this particular question in the past seemed to indicate <Col N="2847" /> that the real motive is to throw down a direct challenge to the Government's whole industrial policy.  References have been made to the duties and impositions on foreign foodstuffs and commodities of various kinds, and the necessaries of life and so on.  I will take a few examples in regard to the necessaries of life and foodstuffs.  We have sugar, butter, bacon, flour and meat.  We all know that we can import sugar into this country at a lower price than it could be produced here, but will anybody contend that we derive no compensating advantage from the production of this or any similar item of our food supplies at home?  Is it of no concern that something like 50,000 farmers receive something in the nature of £800,000 for the production of beet, or that 2,000 seasonal and permanent workers find employment in the beet sugar factories? Speaking generally, is it seriously contended that we should remove the tariff on foreign sugar with its consequent loss to the 50,000 farmers growing beet and to the workers employed in the beet factories? Apart altogether from the necessity of providing ourselves with these necessary items in our food supplies and safeguarding ourselves against war or any other disturbance that might result in the cutting off of supplies, I think that the policy is a wise one.  Even if the cost of this commodity is greater than it would be if we allowed free imports I think that, weighing one thing with another, the increased amount of money put in circulation justifies the adoption of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing can be said in regard to all the other items.  Deputies who represent the dairying counties will be certainly aware of the fact that were it not for the assistance which the Government gave to that industry during the last five years it would have been wiped out long ago.  I represent a dairying constituency and I know a fair share about it.  No dairy farmer, I am sure, would support any suggestion that would have for its object the withdrawal of Government support from the dairying industry. We must remember that the butter-producing <Col N="2848" /> industry constitutes the foundation of the whole agricultural economy of these counties and, to a lesser extent, it constitutes the foundation of the whole agricultural economy of this country.</P>
    <P>In the same way, if the Government assistance is to be withdrawn from bacon producing, we are going to revert to the position that we had in 1931, when we imported bacon to the value of £1,420,195 from all corners of the globe.  I have here a short list of the foodstuffs imported into this country in 1931.  Dairy produce, butter, cream, cheese and milk were imported to the value of £350,738.  We imported poultry and poultry products to the value of £97,276.  We imported oats to the value of £227,333.  We imported feeding stuffs and food for animal consumption to the value of £294,048. We imported sugar to the value of £789,902.  In all, we imported something like £12,000,000 worth of produce which we could have produced here ourselves.  It was an absurd situation to be importing food into a food-producing country.  Next to these in importance are clothing, boots and shoes, hosiery, soaps, cotton goods, etc.  All these require a protective policy in order that they may be produced here at home, and that is one of the things that has been challenged.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of protective tariffs has been challenged, and at a time when, as Deputy Meaney pointed out, every country in the world is engaged in the adoption of a similar policy.  I will just quote one example. We have a country like CzechoSlovakia, one of the most progressive Central European countries to-day, where six times the export price of sugar is being charged to the consumer, with the difference devoted to an export subsidy.  That is just an example of what has been done in other countries.  I do not say that the position in many of these countries should be regarded as parallel with our own, but nevertheless, so far as these things are concerned, we can learn a lot from these countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the industrial concerns which have been established here it is the opinion of experienced manufacturers and people who have had <Col N="2849" /> experience of industrial activity, that many of these industries will require further time to reach full development. An industry cannot reach full development overnight in the matter of organisation and getting a proper footing in the markets, and so on. What is more important than anything else as regards industrial development is that those engaged in it, whether investors, employers or employees, should have a reasonable hope of continuity of industrial policy, and I think it is the duty of all political Parties in this country to subscribe to that guarantee of continuity of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As to the attitude of the Fine Gael Party, if it is indicated by the statements they make here from time to time, particularly within recent months, I think we are entitled to assume that, if they are ever again given the responsibility of government, they will immediately reverse the present industrial policy and revert to the pre-1932 position.</P>
    <P>If that is not their policy, and if they feel that they have a genuine grievance with regard to any part of the industrial policy pursued at the present time, why not indicate the particular items over which they have a grievance in regard to duties, levies and taxes?  Why not indicate the particular things on which they feel these duties are not justifying themselves and ask for their removal, or why not point to any particular industry, or number of industries, which they consider are not justifying their existence? If they consider that undue profits are being taken out of industry, why not suggest a method by which these abuses can be met or remedied?</P>
    <P>We have had a motion debated here for the last three or four weeks, but the speeches and suggestions made surely cannot provide a solution to the problems which they have in mind.  In my opinion the adoption of any of the suggestions that we heard from the Opposition&mdash;if the Government were to accept the viewpoint, for instance, of Deputy Professor O'Sullivan&mdash;would mean that we would be guilty of a gross breach of faith with all those who have engaged in industrial <Col N="2850" /> development in this country, employers and employees, and particularly the young who have taken up careers in these industries and whose careers are now at stake.  If the Opposition spokesmen were listened to, and if there was to be a reversal of the present policy it would have another effect.  It would destroy all public confidence and would have the effect, in the future, of exposing our manufactured goods, and all our agricultural produce, once again to what I can only call the cold winds of Japanese and other foreign competition of the same kind.  The whole attitude of the Opposition spokesmen, as expressed in the statements I have heard from them from time to time, is simply what I can only call presuming on the absolute ignorance of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take advantage of the privilege afforded Deputies on the motion for the adjournment to raise the position of the unemployed in my own constituency.  For the 15 years that I have been in this House I have never had to go back to my constituency at Christmas until this year with the sad news that the men who are there waiting for employment were refused such employment by the Government who had promised to give them employment or subsistence.  I am glad that the President is here, and I should like to draw his attention and the attention of his Ministers to the serious position that exists in some of the towns.  We shall take the position in Bray, where a small grant has been allocated for a fortnight's or three weeks' work.  What are the conditions attached to that grant?  That three days a week are to be given to 100 men, while 200 men, who are just as eligible for employment as the first 100 who have got employment, are denied anything but the dole approaching Christmas.  The urban council appealed against that and asked that a deputation should be received on the matter, but that deputation would not be received. That deputation wished to put before the Department the serious position of the unemployed in Bray coming up to Christmas.  Owing to their financial state the council were unable out of <Col N="2851" /> their own resources to give any assistance to the men who want work for the Christmas period.  The urban council put up a plea that the Department should allow the grant that had been allocated to be expended so that 200 men could have a week's work at the Christmas period.  They would be quite satisfied with that arrangement. The unemployed men were all agreeable to that arrangement so that the remaining 200 might get some employment, but they were refused any concession whatever from the Government. An order was sent down to the public bodies that the first 20 or 30 men unemployed must get three days' work.</P>
      <P>Then we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointing out that there must be a larger number of men employed than the Labour Party admits and he seeks to prove that by quoting the returns from the sale of insurance stamps.  What are the facts? The Department refuses permission to public bodies to give any more than three days' work in the week to these men.  The result is that if a man works three days his card is stamped and another stamp has to be put on when he works a similar period the next week.  In that way the Minister for Industry and Commerce is able to show, from the returns for the sale of stamps, that a larger number of people are engaged on relief work than is actually the case.  As I say, in the town of Bray there are 300 men unemployed but the council is allowed to employ only 100 on this Christmas relief work.  In the town of Wicklow there are 150 registered as unemployed in respect of unemployment assistance. Orders received from the Department are to the effect that only 50 men are to be employed while the other 100 men are left to depend on home assistance and unemployment assistance for this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is the first year during my 15 years in this House in which the Government has refused to allow public bodies out of the grants allocated for work during the Christmas period to give a full week's work to these men.  This is the first time that the Government has sent down an <Col N="2852" /> ultimatum to the public bodies in County Wicklow to provide only three days' work for these men.  In other years the county council provided £3,000 for the relief of unemployment but this year we are not allowed to do so.  We are not in the privileged position of the Deputy from North Cork.  We have no industries in County Wicklow. We had two coming to it but they were sent to other parts of the country and certain members of the Government were responsible for that. We have no beet factory and I think the Minister for Agriculture will agree that the farming community in County Wicklow are not making much profit out of wheat.  As far as oats is concerned, I think the Minister will agree that the majority of the farmers in the county have their oats in the barn and that they are unable to get even 9/- per barrel at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am not out to remove tariffs.  I agree that you must protect Irish industry and I am prepared to say that it is better that we should pay something extra for the goods produced in our own country rather than import foreign goods.  I am not, however, prepared to allow anybody to draw a red herring across the track of this discussion by suggesting that Labour demands are interfering with the industrial concerns of this country. They are not.  I for one would not interfere with tariffs on industrial products if I find that the Government are really in earnest in trying to do something for the large number of men who are deprived of their right to earn a livelihood at the present time.  We may talk about the rotation scheme. I have always opposed it.  Three days a week are bad enough, but now coming up to Christmas there is this order from the Department that only one-third of the men are to be employed. What will be the position of those men?  Have not the unemployed, through their organisations, threatened to march to the county homes even on Christmas Day as a protest against the way they are treated?</P>
    <P>What can the public bodies do?  I know that in County Wicklow the home assistance has been increased up to £15,000 a year to try to meet the <Col N="2853" /> serious position that is facing us.  We are not even in the fortunate position of having industries.  The farmers are not even in the position of being able to send beet to the factories.  We are then solely dependent on agriculture and a few small industries which we had before either the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or the Fianna Fáil Government came into power. We have a large number of unemployed looking for work.  The public bodies are prepared to put up, and have put up, certain schemes to the Government. I am satisfied that those schemes, if the Government would agree to them, would give useful returns during the Christmas fortnight at least.  The public bodies were prepared to make sacrifices so that the schemes which have always been in operation during the past 15 years would be in operation this year, and there would be a fair return for the money spent.  I am not going to say that you will get 100 per cent. value from work on relief schemes during the Christmas period, but I maintain that we have always got a good return for the amount we allocated during the Christmas period for the relief of unemployment through work on quarries, the repairing of roads and so on.  This year the Government will not allow the public bodies to do that.  It sent an order to the county councils not to allow them to give work in the quarries and so on to the men who are unemployed. What is the position?  Those men are looking for extra home assistance. We were told that the first duty of the Government was to be to look after the unemployed, and the first order they made this year was to prevent the unemployed from getting a week's work to enable their families to have a dinner during the Christmas period.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I hope the Executive Council will take that matter up.  I hope they will cancel that order and have a further order sent out.  The public bodies are prepared to arrange that a week's work or as many days' work as possible will be given to the unemployed men who are deserving of it during the holy festival.  Surely to God it is not the intention of the <Col N="2854" /> Government to deprive any of the unemployed men of having some little comfort in their homes during the Christmas period?  I make a special appeal to the Executive Council for the constituency I represent.  We are not in the flourishing position of other constituencies.  We are not out to attack the Government and say it was due to the tariffs.  We are out only to say that we could have industries if the Government had more sympathy for us.  I think they got more votes in other counties and that is why the factories are sent to those other areas. Of course, there is another occasion to remind the Government of that.  I do ask the Government to rectify the mistake they have made and allow the urban council to absorb as many men as they possibly can during this period, and not to say that only the 50 lucky men who were employed through the labour exchange are to be retained until the particular scheme is finished. When I go back to my constituency I will have done my duty in drawing the Government's attention to the facts. I would be the first to sympathise with the unemployed men in my constituency when I know that they are treated unjustly, and I say this to the Government&mdash;they can take it whatever way they like&mdash;that they will have to put up with the responsibility for what may happen in County Wicklow during the next fortnight as a result of the way in which the unemployed have been treated during the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>I think it has been definitely proved to the Government, and after five years of office I think they must agree, that there was never more poverty in this country.  It has been stated and proved certainly by Deputy Everett.  Deputy Meaney put up a very good case; he put up the case of the increased employment in North Cork.  I suppose the matter of that increased employment and better conditions in North Cork will be answered by some North Cork Deputy. But Deputy Meaney mentioned what the Government had done for widows and orphans.  My answer to that is that were it not for the Fianna Fáil Government in this country we would not have so many widows.</P>

      <P>The next thing that happened in order to complete Fianna Fáil independence in this country was that we lost 42 per cent. of our export trade to a country with which we are supposed to be at war.  Deputy Meaney tells us that in years gone by we imported so much bacon into this country.  Did we not as late as last May import Irish pigs from Northern Ireland&mdash;you might say it was from Great Britain&mdash;the produce of the young sows of the Free State that were exported by the bacon curers into Northern Ireland a few years ago?  Did we not import live pigs into the Free State and export them to Britain with a 40 per cent. tariff on them?</P>
      <P>We would like to hear some straight talk in a debate like this, in which we have got to deal with the position of the people.  I mentioned a matter in the Dáil on two occasions, and up to the present I have not observed that any notice has been taken of it.  It has reference to the children in the West of Ireland who are attending national schools along the western seaboard. My point is that the only meal that they get during the day, ever since Fianna Fáil came into office, is the school meal.  We have also seen on the western seaboard where the parish priest of a particular parish had to appeal to an association in Dublin to give assistance in order to provide clothes for the children.  That has not been contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me turn to the great beet, wheat and peat racket that is proceeding in this country.  If you take peat, a lot of legislation has been passed in regard to it during the last four or five years, and there is a fair amount of that legislation that we never saw coming into operation.  The introduction and the passing of that legislation must have cost a considerable <Col N="2857" /> amount of money, and I should like to know why it has not been made operative.  Is it that the Government can only see the faults that lie in that legislation immediately after it is passed?  What has been done in connection with the peat legislation?  At one time we were told that in order to buy so many cwts. of coal one had to purchase a certain quantity of turf also.  What has happened to that? Have we ever had any account of all the money expended on the peat industry? I would not mind expending money on an industry of that kind if there was something to balance that, or if the people were to derive some benefit from it.  Has any such benefit been derived?  Take the drainage of the bogs as an example.  In many places they are being drained into rivers and there is no intention of draining those rivers, with the result that the draining of the bogs will not be any benefit whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Take the case of beet.  I am glad Deputy Meaney changed his mind within the last few days in regard to this subject.  I have already raised a question in connection with the beet-growers, and I referred to the poor prices they were getting.  My argument was that the price should be increased, and to achieve that object something should be taken from the profits of the Sugar Company.  Deputy Meaney says there is great employment given in the cultivation of beet, and Deputy Colbert also referred to the employment.  Why should they talk in such a manner when the average yield this year was eight tons to the acre and the freight on that beet was up to 11/2 per ton in some parts of my constituency?  What it amounts to is that the farmer gets between £10 and £11 per acre for what it costs him £13 to produce.  We are told that that represents prosperity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney referred to afforestation and talked of the headway the Government have been making.  We recollect the promises that were made in 1932.  The Fianna Fáil plan was produced here, and we heard all about the thousands of acres that were to be planted every year.  What is the position in the West of Ireland?  Two <Col N="2858" /> so-called experts went down to Connemara. I do not know what length of time they remained there, but I know they went through 25,000 acres, and all they could recommend for planting was 285 acres.  So much for the plan about afforestation.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is to start a shoddy factory here.  I have often dwelt on the natural resources of our country, and I cannot let this occasion pass without bringing to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the way the Galway Woollen Mills have been treated.  The mills are situated in the centre of a county that produces one-sixth of the sheep population of the Irish Free State.  The mills to-day are practically facing bankruptcy, largely because of the Government's policy.  Every other mill is helped by the Government, and foreigners come over here to take away as profits the earnings of our people.</P>
    <P>Irish capital is invested in the Galway Woollen Mills, and those fine mills are left practically idle.  The mill directors learned that the Minister is anxious to start a shoddy factory in this country.  They approached the Minister and told him they were prepared to carry out his instructions. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Minister, &ldquo;your mills cannot manufacture shoddy, and the answer is that your mill will not be allowed to exist in this country.&rdquo; There is a mill in the centre of the best sheep-producing county, and the Minister is not prepared to facilitate it in any way.  Is that the way Irish people who invest their money in Irish industry are going to be treated?  I would appeal to the Minister before he brings in an outside firm to manufacture shoddy to examine what the Galway Woollen Mills can do in that direction.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point that I wish to refer to.  I forgot to mention it when the Housing Bill was under consideration.  We have what is called a housing board set up by this Government. I think one member of that board is paid £1,000 a year and two others have £500 each.  I would like to know if that board is still in <Col N="2859" /> existence, and, if so, what are they doing to solve the housing problem? In what way are they a help to the Local Government Department or the local authorities in the matter of housing?</P>

The subject notified to the Chair by the main Opposition for debate on the adjournment is &ldquo;general, financial and economic policy of the Government.&rdquo; I submit to the Deputy that the points he desires to raise would require notice, and might better be put as a Parliamentary Question.  The Deputy will realise that it is impossible for a Minister, possibly a Minister not responsible in the matter, to answer such questions without notice.  If a Deputy gets down to particular cases, it would be difficult for a Minister to deal with them offhand without his brief.</P>

Again, if there is such a board in existence, we might be told what it is costing the country and what duties are the members carrying out.  That is all I wish to remind the Government about.  I certainly think Deputy Everett has made a good case to show the poverty that is existing in this country.  He has shown how the rotational scheme has worked and that under it a man can get only three days' employment in one week.  That should not be the case in a country where you are supposed to have such a large number of industries working and where you have the Government telling of the numbers of people they are putting into employment.  We have been told of the large numbers who are being put into employment and that the wages they are receiving are sufficient to live on, but it has been proved quite clearly that such is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer to a few points on this motion.  The first point is in connection with unemployment assistance.  We have a rather peculiar grievance in Cork &mdash; probably it is an anomaly under the Act &mdash; whereby people who have been taken from slum areas in the city and housed by the corporation outside the borough boundary cannot, if they become unemployed, receive the rate of assistance which they had when unemployed in the city.  The grievance is quite apparent to anybody who understands the situation when people are shifted from slum areas to places immediately outside the city.  To all intents and purposes, they are part and parcel of the city population.  So far as their economic circumstances permit, they still take part in the city life.  Owing to this anomaly, they are deprived not alone of the rate of assistance to which they were entitled while unemployed in the city but they are not allowed &mdash; and this is an important matter &mdash; by the rules of the labour exchange, to come under the city schemes for relief of unemployment. They have to turn their attention to the country.  These men have never worked in the country.  When they could get work, they worked in the city.  They have been part and parcel of the city life and they were compelled, owing to circumstances over which they had no control, to move to these places outside the city for better health and better accommodation when the slum areas were being cleared.  The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Cork Corporation, and the Minister has got a resolution from the corporation asking that this state of affairs be remedied.  I suggest to the Minister that, under the new Unemployment Assistance Act, there will be an opportunity for remedying this anomaly whereby people who have been compelled to go outside the city &mdash; I do not know if there is any other case of a similar kind in the State &mdash; will be allowed to continue on the unemployment rate paid in the city.  That is the first point I want to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to <Col N="2861" /> the fact that the rates of unemployment assistance are abominably low&mdash; so low that they are almost a disgrace to any civilised State.  We have one shilling a week allowed for the support and sustenance of a child &mdash; to provide a child with the 21 meals which a child or adult is supposed to get during a week.  I often wonder if the Government is really facing up to its responsibilities with regard to the unemployed. They have these abnormally low scales in operation, and their only system of relieving unemployment seems to be that of the rotational schemes.  These rotational schemes are totally inadequate.  As Deputy Everett has pointed out, they do not absorb the unemployed in any particular district.  The men who are unemployed are recruited in such fashion that everybody gets a little but nobody gets what you would call a decent amount to sustain himself or his family. We had a very striking case of that kind during the week.  Cork Harbour Board have a scheme for relief of unemployment, partly financed by the board and partly by the State.  The Harbour Board asked that for the coming week &mdash; Christmas week &mdash; the men who were on the scheme should be kept on for five days.  We had before us at that meeting a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary, who had the hardihood to tell us that the work under the rotational system was efficient and that the output under it, when properly supervised, was satisfactory. He said that &ldquo;results as technically and financially efficient are being attained under it as under any other possible system employing the same labour.&rdquo;  I do not think that anybody would say that that is in accordance with fact.  Take the case of any ordinary business man.  Would he adopt that system in any business for the sake of efficiency?  If you employ that test alone, you will find that that statement is not in accord with fact.  The Harbour Board asked that these five days should be allotted to the men who were on for the week and that request was turned down. Again, I do not know what the reason is.  Certain reasons were put up.  I have been over with the Public Works Department and they put up certain <Col N="2862" /> reasons which I do not consider satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that there does not appear to be a real attempt to carry out the Government promises made in 1932.  It is not a long way to throw our minds back &mdash; to 1932.  Not alone were we promised that unemployment would be relieved, but we were told that it would be abolished and that we would have so many posts to give away that we should have to send for some of our people across the water.  The present rotational schemes and the attempt made by means of unemployment assistance to relieve unemployment are a contradiction of these promises.  They do not harmonise with the idea of abolishing unemployment.  Not alone is it evident from what I have said with regard to rotational schemes and rates of unemployment assistance that the Government are not facing up to their responsibilities in these matters, but, if we turn to other aspects of Government policy, we shall be inclined to say that the Government is definitely of the opinion that low wages and bad living conditions should be the idea of life in this country.  We have had a wage of 24/- a week fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.  I have already referred to the shilling a week allowed for a child by way of unemployment assistance. I may go further and point to the scandalous way in which the national teachers have been treated, not alone by this Government but by the previous Government.  We are told that the national school is the poor man's university, but the Government have very little regard or respect for the professors in these universities when they are treated as the national teachers have been treated.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, the teachers of this country are being driven back, both by the way their salaries have been slashed and by the cost of living in the country, to a position similar to that in which Lloyd George, before the War, said that the salaries of national teachers in this country were a disgrace to the British Empire.  I do not know whether we are in the Empire or not at present, but I say that the salaries of national teachers here are much worse than those which <Col N="2863" /> obtain in the other portion of the country, Northern Ireland.  They are about 17 per cent. worse.  We hear from time to time various orators pointing out all the bad and wrong things done in Northern Ireland, but they can boast in Northern Ireland of treating their teachers much better than we do here.  May I be allowed to refer for a moment to the position of teachers' salaries previous to 1920 in this country?</P>

      <P>The question before the House is general economic policy.

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not allowed to refer to the fact that teachers' salaries here, as a result of Government policy, compare very unfavourably with those in Great Britain and Northern Ireland? What I want to refer to particularly is that under this Government, which had experience of a previous Government which did its part in cutting teachers' salaries, we had, in March, 1933, the putting into operation of the Temporary Economies Act which cut teachers' salaries from 1 to 8 per cent.  That cut was made permanent in the next year when we had the salaries cut from 6 to 9 per cent. and a Government saving effected of £290,000.  I want to point out the unfair discrimination made against the teachers on those two occasions.  On the first occasion the Government, by its Temporary Economies Act, took an amount from the teachers which was not a fair proportion compared with what was taken from other Government servants.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon, but the Deputy forgets that the House discussed a regulation dealing with national teachers' pensions and it was part of that pension scheme that the teachers' scale should be reduced.  It has nothing to do with the economic war or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I not refer to the fact that the economic policy of the Government is responsible for the cuts in teachers' salaries, and not alone is it responsible for those cuts, but it is responsible for the demand of the national teachers for the restoration of the cuts sustained since 1934 being denied and strenuously opposed by the Government as part of its economic policy?  If the economic policy of the Government is that the general standard of living should be reduced, that idea will, I am sure, not find favour with the people.  If we in this country cannot attain a standard of reasonable comfort, I think the economic policy, the financial policy and all the other ideas of the Government will fall to the ground.  I am quite safe, I think, in saying that the people expect to have teachers who will be well paid, contented in their jobs, and will give a decent return for the salaries they receive.  Under present conditions, we have a state of affairs being brought about in which we have a body of teachers, discontented and dissatisfied and being gradually driven back to a position in which their economic circumstances are such that they will not have sufficient to pay their way and to live as people who have responsibilities to the community should live. I want to stress the point that it is evident to me, and to those who think with me, that unless and until there is <Col N="2865" /> an appreciation by the Government of the human element, and less regard for machine-like rules imposed by Government Departments and carried out as if they were the laws of the Medes and Persians by these Departments, all these policies must fall.</P>
      <P>In the letter from the Parliamentary Secretary, we have the statement: &ldquo;The work and costings of the schemes now being carried out for the Harbour Board will be inspected from this office during the progress and after the completion of the work.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his staff that they might also include an inspection of some of the unfortunate people who have to work on these schemes and an inspection of their way of living, of their homes, and of their families, and they will then have an appreciation of what we are trying to put before the House.</P>

    <P>I did not intend to take any part in this debate, but there are a few things which Deputy Brodrick said which I <Col N="2866" /> do not think I should let pass without commenting on them.  He said that children going to school in the West got only one meal and that that meal was the meal supplied by the public authority.  That statement is absolutely untrue.  I do not know of even a chance case in any place, and I am very well acquainted with every part of the Connemara Gaeltacht, at all events.  Another thing Deputy Brodrick has done a disservice to by his remarks is the Galway Woollen Mills. I take it that his intention was a good one, and that he wanted to draw the attention of the Government to the desirability of helping the Galway Woollen Mills by giving them a monopoly of the shoddy trade.  But the Deputy did that in a way calculated to create the impression that the Government had done everything it could to hamper the Galway Woollen Mills.  He might have pointed out that these mills were shut down for a long period, until this Government came into office.  In so far as the Deputy was drawing the attention of the Government so as to assist the Galway Woollen Mills, I am all with him, and I would add my voice and ask the Government to consider the question of giving Galway Woollen Mills a monopoly which I think they ought to get in this respect.</P>

      <P>When an angry, hungry people were clamouring at the gates of Versailles on an historic occasion, and when Marie Antoinette asked what was wrong, she was told they had no bread.  Her answer was: &ldquo;Why do they not eat cake?&rdquo;  Similarly, when the question was raised in this House as to the hunger and the lowering of the condition of our people, brought about as a result of the Fianna Fáil economic policy, we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there were more motor cars in the country, and that more spirits were being drunk.  That reply is practically on a parallel with the historic reply of Marie Antoinette and brings home to me and to every Deputy from a country constituency the terrible air of unreality that prevails in the Dáil. There is no relation to the real facts <Col N="2867" /> of life of our common people.  Just like some of the debates we heard from the Government Benches, there is no realisation of the real condition of things, or of the circumstances under which these people have to live, when there is talk about motor cars and spirits.  I wonder how many motor cars there are in the Island of Cape Clear, and how many cinemas, or how much spirits were drunk in Muintir Mháire and Mushera.  These are the people we are legislating for, the common people, and we should bear them in mind.  It was said that Roman civilisation and the Roman Empire perished to the cry of &ldquo;Bread and circuses.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>In other words, the realities of life were lost in the clamour for amusement and in the fight for doles and sops.  That is what is happening in this country to-day.  It strikes me that with the cry of doles and cinemas, bright lights and unemployment, Fianna Fáil is hastening to its doom. The whole policy of this Government, which we have now under review, is one that has made our poor people poorer.  It has done them a greater disservice, because it has taken away their nobility, their independence of spirit and character, and has made them a people clamouring for doles. In the constituency I represent there are about 10,000 small farmers whose total poor law valuation does not exceed £4 each.  It is the circumstances in which these people live, and the economic conditions of this country that we should have regard to.  We heard very extraordinary statements from the Ministerial Benches.  We had a speech a few nights ago from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands; it was a doleful and sorrowful tale. He was a really like a man who did not believe in the policy he was asked to speak about and there was a sort of apology in the mournful tone of his voice, which said: &ldquo;I came to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.&rdquo; I think the Minister for Finance in one of his Budget speeches said that the consumption of spirits was on the increase because we had certain visitors coming to this country from the arid <Col N="2868" /> desert of protection.  In other words, the tourist trade was responsible for an increase in the consumption of spirits.  Seeing that we brought 84,000 people to this country as tourists, the increase in the consumption of spirits was possibly traceable to persons who came here to rejoice and to be happy amongst us.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, increased consumption of spirits may be due to some of the banquets held to celebrate the great progress and prosperity of the new industries, some of the Lucullan banquets at which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to speak, surrounded by his friends, a small number of whom have waxed rich on Fianna Fáil policy, persons who are rolling in fat, whose hands are literally dripping with the fat of tariffs.  If there is increased consumption of spirits it may be traceable to some of these causes.  The time is too short to go into the manifold manifestations of the poverty-stricken conditions of the lower classes of the people that was brought about by Fianna Fáil policy.  One speaker to-day, and some speakers a few nights ago, dwelt on a few important things, and as these form the primary necessities of life I ask pardon if I pay more than usual attention to them.  In the first place, the most elementary thing &mdash;the staff of life&mdash;is bread.  It is an extraordinary thing that, as this country is not able to grow all the wheat it requires, the cost of the 4lb. loaf to-day should be 1/-.  It is a long time, and the circumstances are very strange indeed, since the price of bread attained that level.  Across the water it costs only 9½d.  Flour is, on an average, 12/- to 13/- cheaper in England than it is here.</P>
    <P>That refers both to baker's flour and domestic flour for home baking. In a speech some time ago I drew attention to the fact that the produce of a sack of flour was 90 loaves. Taking the difference in the cost, I worked it out at about 12/- per sack, or nearly 2d. a loaf.  In the aggregate, therefore, our people are paying £1,600,000 per annum more for their bread than they should be paying.  I ask Deputies if, in a poor country like this, that is not a terrible and a <Col N="2869" /> horrible tax!  It is one of the sins, I think, that will cry to heaven for vengeance &mdash; that people should have to pay for bread £1,600,000 per annum more than they should be paying.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in replying to that speech of mine, said that what I had stated would be true if all the flour in this country was turned into baker's bread, but he said that a lot of it was used for home baking.  As a matter of fact, at one time nearly two-thirds was used in home baking; but people do not eat flour, they eat bread, whether the flour is turned into loaves in the home bastable or the baker's oven.  The average output of the sack of flour may, for ordinary purposes, be taken as 90 pairs.  I was not on that occasion indicating the millers for rapacity or for profiteering.  I have made an examination of the figures with some Irish millers, and I know that it actually costs them up to 11/- more than it costs across the water to mill and to produce one sack of baker's flour.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has often said that he is satisfied that there are factors in the production of flour here that make the cost higher than in England, but he has never told us what those factors are.  They have never been disclosed to the members of this House or to the people of the country.  In my opinion there is no reason why flour should be 12/- and up to 13/- per sack dearer here than it is in England, but the fact remains that it is so.</P>
    <P>The millers are satisfied that there are certain factors responsible.  What are they?  In my opinion the factors are not real.  They are unnatural and artificial factors forced and imposed upon the Irish flour millers by the economic policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no rapacity among the millers themselves I have figures here with regard to some other expenses involved in the production of bread.  Take London, where the wages paid are of a pretty high standard.  In London the 4lb. loaf is produced and finished out of the oven in the bake-house at about the same sum as the flour costs the baker here&mdash;that is, the flour before it leaves the mill.  Here <Col N="2870" /> the quantity of flour that it takes to make a loaf costs the Irish baker about 7d. before ever it leaves the mill. In England the baker has the bread manufactured on the trough of his bakehouse for a slight fraction over 5d. I indict the Government for being responsible for the difference in the cost of bread here.  That difference is entirely due to the factors that have been spoken of, factors founded upon the conditions which the economic policy of Fianna Fáil has imposed on our Irish millers.</P>
    <P>The question was thrown at me the other day, why do you not go down to the Cork mills and close them up? The answer is that in the last five years we have put into employment in the flour-milling industry in this country about 700 extra men.  Heretofore we imported about one-third of our flour, and there was actually more employment given in its importation than in the milling of the remaining two-thirds at home.  The prohibition of the import of flour led to the disemployment of great numbers of people at the ports and elsewhere.  The gross result is that we have put 700 extra men into employment in the flour-milling industry.  The value of the gross output of the milling industry in Ireland is in or about £10,000,000. There are only 4,000 people employed in the milling industry here.  Taking every mill that we have in the country, and seeing that our flour is costing us £1,600,000 more than it should, we could afford to put those 4,000 people out of employment, give them £400 a year, and pay nothing extra for our bread on the figures I have quoted. That is an aspect of the milling and baking trade which in my opinion is crying out for retribution.  It will certainly bring down misfortune on the heads of everyone responsible for it.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the sugar factories.  Deputy Meaney told us to-day that we had opposed the establishment of the beet factories.  As a matter of fact I went out of my way on several occasions to boost the new factory at Mallow, because I did believe at the time that there was some advantage in it for our farmers. I knew at the time the price we were paying for imported sugar: that the <Col N="2871" /> countries that were exporting sugar here were paying bounties on their exports, and I thought that if there were any bounties going our own people should get a share of them.  I wonder are the people of this country satisfied to pay from ¾d. to 1d. per lb. more for their sugar?  There is no use in Deputy Meaney telling us what the Government are doing for the farmers. It is not the Government who are doing anything for the farmers, but the poor people who have to pay 3¼d. and 3½d. per lb. for their sugar.</P>

      <P>I think if they have to pay 1d. or 1¾d. a lb. more for sugar that it is an extravagant price for our poor people to have to pay for the sweetening of their tea.  That extra charge must amount to over £1,000,000 a year, so that if you were to take the employees out of the sugar factories, give them a good salary for life, and ask them to do no more work, you could afford to do it out of that sum.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters I would like to deal with, but I have not the time to do so.  I believe in a certain amount of tariffs to help industry and the manufacture of goods that should be made here, but in my opinion it is necessary that the goods we produce should be turned out on a competitive level.  I think that we have extravagant ideas with regard to prohibitions. We have those prohibitions at a time when the productivity of the country is going down and down and taxation is mounting up and up.  Some of the Fianna Fáil advocates tell us of the great help that the home market is to our farmers, although the Minister for Agriculture told us a few nights ago that his job at the present time is to bolster up prices in the British market.  Now, the very people who would destroy that market say that their policy is to try to bolster up prices in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural policy of this Government may be described as a bolstering up one.  The bolstering up <Col N="2872" /> they are doing is of a very feeble kind. The props that they are using are of a weak and temporary nature, and as soon as those props are taken away the whole thing will come tumbling about our ears.  They tell us that they have given us a home market that is worth £11,000,000 a year.  The extraordinary thing is that although prices have gone up, and though we have wheat-growing and beet-growing and other agricultural products being subsidised, the value of the home market for agricultural produce, in the last four or five years, has never exceeded £11,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Why is that?  It is because the people are buying less and because they are consuming less and they have not got the money to pay.  As I have said before, these are matters for serious consideration and it means that the whole produce of the country is going down and down.  This country produced £60,000,000 worth of agricultural produce when there were no subsidies.  To-day, with all the subsidies, tariffs, and so on, the agricultural produce is down to about £43,000,000 or, roughly, down by £20,000,000.  In the meantime, your taxation has gone up enormously. When we were in office, and when the taxation amounted to £22,000,000, we were told by the people over there that the people of this country could not stand another penny of taxation. We were told that if another shilling or a penny of taxation was put on the country would flop.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health at one time, when we were dealing with the matter of a loan, told us that we were facing a bog of bankruptcy; but now the people opposite have raised taxation up to £35,000,000.  We are going into all kinds of extravagance in high places, but we are taking no account of the conditions of the poor people and how they have to live.  We have heard talk about Dublin, which has increased its population to a very great extent in the last few years.  That may be true of Dublin and other cities, but what about the little towns in the country? Practically every small town is almost ruined.  Their weekly markets are gone, their fairs are of no use, the <Col N="2873" /> population of such towns is fleeing and their stores and warehouses are closed. There is no shipping of corn from our ports and no fishing in places such as Baltimore and Kinsale and other places where there was a big fishing industry.</P>
    <P>These things have no effect on the people in this House, evidently.  No. We talk about very big things and about high things &mdash; about creating an Uachtarán and other things such as are proposed to be brought into a country like this.  I do not want to delay the House very long, but in connection with this matter, it struck me that I might quote a few lines I came across the other day, in which a certain socialist writer mentioned the recent Coronation in England.  I paraphrase the lines because I think they are applicable to Ireland at the moment, and I shall now read them to the House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Ireland now great Demos rules O'er scarce three million city fools;</P>
    <P>We have got our Constitution and our Ceremonial Head;</P>
    <P>We have got the gaudy circus, but tell us where is our bread.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Eamonn O'Neill. I am glad to see him here in December, 1937, just as rubicund and as rotund as he was in December, 1936. Because, Sir, the Deputy has had a fearsome experience.  He has been telling us what Marie Antoinette said when she heard about an angry, hungry people.  The Deputy, according to himself, has spent four months amid an angry, hungry people, and he has returned sound and well.  We might almost regard the Deputy as a missionary, escaped from a cannibal island &mdash; that would be, if his story were true.  Deputy O'Neill is a romantic soul; he has been dreaming of a bygone century and of a past age, wooing, possibly, Kathleen Ní Houlihán in the Irish equivalent of the Tuilleries Gardens.  He has been one of the lucky ones, but what about his comrades who have not come back from the country?  Have they been eaten by the mob?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2874" /> I notice that the Deputy is leaving the House.  I am glad that he is leaving, so that he may come into contact with those realities of life about which he has been speaking.  That is just the defect of the Opposition in this debate.  As you pointed out, Sir, the occasion of the adjournment is availed of for general criticism of the Government's policy, and during the ten years and more that I have been in this House I never had to listen to so half-hearted an attack as we heard to-day.  It was opened by Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan who, apparently, was so ashamed of his own performance that he left the House immediately, presumably to hide his face; and from first to last, there has not been a single speech from the Opposition to-day that has touched &mdash; in the words of Deputy Eamonn O'Neill &mdash; the realities of life.  The first remarkable and significant fact in connection with this discussion is that, at the end of June of this year, an appeal was made to the people &mdash; to the whole people &mdash; upon the policy which we are now pursuing and which, up to then, this Government had pursued; and the verdict of the people then was an endorsement of our policy.</P>

It was on a sort of higgledly-piggledly collection of that kind that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were depending from 1922 to 1932, but since 1932 we have stood as a Party that commands the support of the majority of the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>However, as I have said, we want to get back to the realities of life.  We heard a plaintive speech from Deputy Eamonn O'Neill, and I know that there is no person in the House who can use his voice to such advantage on such an occasion, can import such pathos as Deputy O'Neill can into his mellifluous voice.  He told us about the hungry people and about what a loaf of bread costs here as compared with what a loaf of bread cost in, say, London.  Now, nobody will deny that bread does cost more in this country than in London, but if it does cost more, that difference in cost, or that increase in cost is not due primarily to the cost of flour.  It is due to a number of other factors.  It is due to the fact that we pay higher wages: that we have day baking: that in general our people demand and our bakers supply a higher quality of bread than elsewhere, and to other factors of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather remarkable that, in regard to this matter, Deputy Eamonn O'Neill should have endeavoured to ascribe the responsibility for the difference in the cost of bread here and in Great Britain entirely to the difference in the cost of flour.  Of course, Sir, the Deputy might have had a reason for that.  It might not be unconnected with the fact that Deputy Eamonn O'Neill himself, as I understand, knows <Col N="2876" /> a great deal about the bakery business and that, in fact, he runs a bakery himself. It might be that he is rather dissatisfied with the fact that bakers here get higher wages than, say, in Belfast; that the quality of bread which the Irish people demand is somewhat better, and that we have day baking here.  Of course, it would be a very good thing from a number of points of view, when we are looking at this question of bread merely from the point of view of selfish interests&mdash;it would be a good thing, perhaps from that point of view, to stir up public feeling against the bakery business in general and endeavour in that way, by creating a great deal of prejudice against those who are employed in that particular industry, to get the Government to step in and try, if it could, to so regulate matters that the cost of bread or its price might be brought down or, possibly, the profits of the baker increased.</P>

      <P>Let us come back to this question of what the realities of life are &mdash; the realities of life which Deputy O'Neill alleges we have lost sight of in the Dáil.  He said that we had made our people poorer.  Has Deputy O'Neill, or any other member of the Opposition, ever investigated that statement and endeavoured to ascertain what foundation there may be for it?  I am perfectly certain that they have not, because I would say that, if they did, at any rate they would not be so lacking in candour that they <Col N="2877" /> would come here and make the sort of statements we have listened to to-day.</P>
      <P>What is a fair test of the condition of the average man and woman in this country?  I am not going to take motor cars.  I never would have said, as Deputy O'Neill wished to imply, that at some time or another there was a millionaire on Clare Island who spent his life in a motor car.  I am not even going to talk about the increase which has taken place in the deposits of our joint stock banks.  I am going to turn to the poor man's bank, to the savings bank where thrifty people are able to put away their shillings a week, or shillings a month, or maybe a shilling or half-a-crown in six months, as the case may be, and I say that the position of the savings bank deposits is a fair reflection of the conditions of the people and of the trend of the conditions in this State so far as the generality of our people are concerned.</P>

      <P>I was not speaking about Savings Certificates.  I was talking about the deposits in the savings banks, which is quite a different matter.  I knew that the point might be made that there has been over the past few years a better organisation of the thrift movement in this country which exists to induce the people to invest in Savings Certificates. But I am talking about deposits in the savings bank, which are not affected in the same way, where people of their own volition, without any sort of inducement, go in week <Col N="2878" /> after week, or month after month, or every quarter, or every six months, as the case may be, and put in their comparatively small savings.  I do not wish any person to believe that the ordinary individual who has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow is in a position of complete affluence. But I do say that the great majority of them are able to live in a position of frugal comfort and economic security, and that they are in a position to add penny to penny, shilling to shilling, and so build up a substantial nest-egg against any sort of vicissitude with which life may afflict them.</P>
      <P>What is the position?  I cannot find any more recent date which would more truly reflect the position in this country as it was when the Opposition was in power than 31st December, 1931.  On that date the accumulated savings in our savings banks amounted to £3,703,000.  That was the fruit not merely of the savings of ten years as between 1922 and 1932, but that was the fruit of the accumulation which had gone on in preceding years.  It represented the transfer of accounts from the British Post Office Savings Bank as well as the accumulated savings of our own people over the ten years from 1922 to 1932.  What was the position at 31st December last, the last date for which I have figures available?  I hope, if I have still the responsibility for the Department of Finance, in the Budget to set out figures for the year which has just ended.  But at 31st December last year the deposits in our savings bank stood at £7,470,000.  Inside of five years the deposits of our people in the savings banks increased by over 100 per cent.</P>

      <P>The bank deposits of the Irish Free State for the year 1931 amounted to £127,984,000.  At the end of December, 1936, the figure stood at £130,314,000 and, on the 30th June, 1937, at £137,784,000.  There was a percentage increase between 1931 and December, 1936, of 1.8 per cent., and between 1931 and the end of June, 1937, of 2.9 per cent.  Whether we consider people who put their money for safety into joint stock banks or whether we consider people who put their money on deposit in the savings banks, so far as these figures go &mdash; and we sometimes hear it said that money talks &mdash; they, at any rate, afford one clear indication that the people of this country are not getting poorer.</P>
      <P>But there are other realities.  Take the case of home assistance.  The earliest figures I have in my possession at the moment are the figures for 1934, and I think it is quite relevant to quote them because, since 1934, there has been a general election.  In 1934 there were 108,000 people in receipt of home assistance in this country.  In 1935 the number had declined to 86,000, and in 1936 to 80,000.  It is one of the unfortunate realities of this life that there are people, whether because they are invalids or in some way incapable of work and have no relatives to maintain them, for whom we have to provide home assistance, but the number of people upon home assistance in this country is 28,000 less now than it was in 1934.  That is to say, that the condition of our people has improved. We may put it this way, that the condition of our people has improved by at least 25 per cent.; therefore they are 25 per cent. better off, not, as Deputy O'Neill alleged, poorer.</P>

      <P>If it were true that the poor have grown poorer since this Government came into office, it would only be by reason of the fact that there was a general stagnation of trade, that the number of transactions as between buyer and seller had fallen, that our people were purchasing less and selling less.  The value and velocity of trade are reflected in the average weekly figures for bank clearances. What is the position?  In 1934, the average figure for weekly bank clearances was £5,160,000.  In 1935 it was £5,280,000.  In 1936 it was £5,570,000, and the average for this year up to to-day was £5,723,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has just come back from the country.  The people had before them our record over the period from 1932 to 1937. They had the record of the Deputy's Party from 1927 to 1932 and the one fact that emerges, beyond yea or nay, from the result of the election is that, however angry they were, as Deputy O'Neill wished us to believe, however badly they thought of us, they thought very much worse of the principal Party in opposition to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That red herring will not cover the discrepancy of the other figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discrepancy. In 1934 the average weekly bank clearances were £5,160,000 and in 1937 they were £5,723,000.  The figure is much higher now than it was then. In fact, if I might make a rough calculation, <Col N="2881" /> the figure for bank clearances is up by 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>Again, take the figure for the circulation of bank notes and legal tender. That is an important figure because it is a fair indication of the cash transactions which take place from week to week.  We all know that a great volume of payments are made by cheque.  But we do know also that the average farmer when he goes into a village to buy from the merchant, like the average working man in the town when he wants to buy something, pays for it with some sort of currency, either with a coin, a bank note or a legal tender note.  Thus the circulation of bank notes and legal tender notes represents the number of small cash transactions that are made from day to day by people in the circumstances to which I refer.</P>
      <P>Again, what was the position in 1934?  In 1934, the number of bank notes and legal tender notes in circulation represented a value of £13,269,000. In 1935 the value had gone up to £13,811,000 and in 1936 it was £14,344,000.  I have not got the figures for 1937 but I notice to-day that the issue of legal tender notes has reached a new high record.  All that represents an increased turnover, an increased volume of business, increased profits, increased expenditure and increased wages because you cannot spend unless you have money to spend and, so far as the great bulk of our people are concerned, they cannot spend unless they are in employment. No person has ventured to get up to adduce documentary evidence in this House to controvert the statement which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made during the debate upon the private members' motion, down in the names of Deputies Morrissey and McGilligan, that the number in employment in this country had considerably increased since 1931.</P>
      <P>There are other facts as well which go to show that the condition of most of the people of this country has considerably improved since 1931-32.  We have heard a great deal about the high cost of living.  The Opposition, during private members' time, has been discussing a motion in these terms:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2882" /> That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.</P>
    <P>Now what are the facts?  So far as the people of this country are concerned, there is no tax on tea.  We have reduced the tax upon 80 per cent. of the sugar consumed in this country to an infinitesimal figure.  It stands at one-eighth of a penny in the pound.  There is no tax upon wheat, and there is no tax on a number of other commodities.  In fact, the relative position is that whereas during 1931-32 there was collected by the Government then in power from duties on foodstuffs alone no less a sum than £1,701,504, during this year, by means of the remissions which were granted to some extent under previous Budgets but primarily under the Budget for this year, the amount to be collected from foodstuffs has been reduced from that figure of £1,701,504 to an estimated figure of £650,000, that is to say, that during the past 12 months there has been a decrease in the revenue collected of over £1,050,000 as compared with the amount collected by our predecessors when they were in office from the same commodities.  The same is true in regard to other taxes.  We hear about a tax on boots, a tax on clothing, a tax on furniture, and a tax on a host of other articles.  When our predecessors were in office they collected from those articles £1,120,000. In 1936-7 there was collected from the self-same articles £948,940; that is to say, we collected in the year 1936-7 £171,000 less than our predecessors collected from the necessaries of life such as boots, clothing, furniture, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that because of the increasing prosperity of the people the poor are able to consume a much larger proportion of what were formerly regarded as luxury commodities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to study the customs returns the first thing that must strike him is the tremendous increase which has taken place in the tobacco revenue.  In regard to this question of the customs, the Deputy is in the same hazy position as his colleague, Deputy Brooke Brasier, was when he was talking on this matter on Wednesday night last, and when he alleged that we were collecting over £11,000,000 from customs. That figure has never been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone over £10,000,000.  We have collected £10,222,000 in some years, but this year we are budgeting for £9,440,000, practically none of which will come from taxes upon food.  In fact, so far as we are concerned, last year we remitted £360,000 worth of taxation on sugar, £350,000 worth of taxation on tea, and £190,000 worth of taxation on wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to argue the merits of any particular tax upon food, I can tell the Deputy that it is said in the Scriptures, &ldquo;Not by bread alone doth man live.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, therefore, just as iniquitous to tax sugar as it is to tax wheat; but the fact of the matter is that civilised communities cannot get on without some form of indirect taxation.  Of course, we know that the Deputy's leader, Deputy Cosgrave, <Col N="2884" /> has funny ideas about this question of taxation.  I remember when he was sitting here on these benches as the responsible head of the Government in this country, he got up and told us that if the farmer did not take sugar, and did not take tea, and did not smoke, and did not drink, and did not wear boots, and did not wear clothes, he need not pay any tax at all.  In fact, if he were to run around in a state of nature, he would be as happy as Adam in the Garden of Paradise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is true. I should have added that if he did not have furniture in his house, and had no house, he need not pay anything. Not merely need he not pay taxes, but he need not even pay rates. That was the ideal of human comfort which persisted and, apparently, persists still in the Fine Gael Party. When Deputy Cosgrave was translated from this sphere of responsibility to those seats of irresponsibility, he carried that naive idea about taxation over with him, and now, apparently, all his Party subscribe to it.  We are to abandon the whole system of taxation, and, of course, if we abandon the scheme of taxation we have got also to abandon the system of social services which is built up and carried on by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot contend with people who live in that dreamland.  We have got to consider the hard facts of life, and so long as we have to provide for the education of the youth of this country, so long, in short, as we have to provide for those who are out of employment in this country, so long as we have to provide for the preservation of the public peace in this country, so long as we have to meet, even upon the present limited scale, the necessities of defending this country, so long as we have to provide a Civil Service and the whole organisation of the State in this country, we shall always have to put on taxes which will hit every element and every individual in the community.  If a person is in the community, and gets the benefits and advantages of the community, he has <Col N="2885" /> also got to bear the burdens and disabilities, too.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The trimming or cutting of hedges or trees that are prejudicial to roads is necessary, and owners and occupiers of lands adjoining roads that are required to do this work by the road authority may do so up to the 31st March next.  I see no reason to interfere with the discretion of road authorities in the exercise of their statutory powers in this respect.</P>
