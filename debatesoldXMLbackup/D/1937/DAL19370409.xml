      <P>(1)  Go mbeidh sé de chead ag bunathóirí an Bhille Rialtais Aitiúla (Gaillimh), 1934, do bhí ar feitheamh sa tSeanad ar dháta an Achta Bhunreachta (Leasú Uimh. 24), 1936 (Uimh. 18 de 1936), do rith ina dhlí dul ar aghaidh sa Dáil le Bille bheidh ar aon dul i ngach slí leis an mBille do bhí ar feitheamh amhlaidh, gan scrúdú do dhéanamh maidir le cólíonadh na mBuan-Orduithe i dtaobh Gnótha Phríobháidigh;</P>

    <P>(1)  That the promoters of the Local Government (Galway) Bill, 1934, which was pending in the Seanad at the date of the passing into law of Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Act, 1936 (18 of '36), shall be at liberty to proceed in the Dáil with a Bill identical in all respects with the Bill which was so pending, without examination for compliance with the Standing Orders relative to Private Business;</P>
    <P>(2)  that notice of intention to proceed with the Bill shall be given by the promoters by depositing in the Private Bill Office a copy of the Bill together with a certificate signed by the Parliamentary Agent for the promoters annexed thereto stating that the Bill is identical in all respects with the Bill which was so pending in the Seanad;</P>
    <P>(3)  that on the day on which the Dáil shall next sit subsequent to such notice of intention having been given, the Bill shall be set down for an Order referring the Bill to Select Committee in pursuance of Standing Order 66 (Private Business), the Bill being deemed to have been introduced and to have passed its second stage;</P>
    <P>(4)  that no fees shall be charged in respect of any stage of the Bill when fees were already paid in respect of the similar stage in the case of the Bill so pending in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Standing Orders considered the motion which is before the House, standing in my name, and concurred in it.  The Bill referred to in the motion, the Local Government (Galway) Bill, 1934, had been committed to a joint committee prior to the abolition of the Seanad.  The joint committee was not in fact appointed, as the promoters were not <Col N="643" /> ready at the time to proceed with the Bill and no further steps in reference to the Committee Stage of the Bill were taken up to the date of abolition of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The promoters are desirous to proceed now with their Bill, but owing to the abolition of the Seanad it is considered necessary that the Bill should be introduced <i>de novo,</i> but it is suggested that the promoters might be spared the cost of advertising the Bill and the other expenses incidental to compliance with the Standing Orders relative to Private Business, and this motion was accordingly framed with that end in view.  I beg to move the motion.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £8,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thíocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Gnóthaí Coigríche agus Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin (Uimh. 16 de 1924).</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £8,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose for which this sum is required is, I think, indicated clearly <Col N="644" /> upon the face of the Estimate.  It is needed to pay the contribution of Saorstát Eireann towards the expenses of the International Non-Intervention Committee in connection with the scheme of observation of the Spanish frontiers by land and sea, which was agreed upon by the Governments represented on the International Committee for Non-Intervention on the 8th March last. The scheme of supervision will cost a total sum somewhere between £834,000 and £1,000,000 a year.  This sum will be provided by contributions from the various States parties to the agreement.  As explained in the note added to the Estimate, the five principal European Powers concerned will each contribute 20 per cent. of the cost, making 80 per cent. in all, and the remaining 20 per cent. will be paid by the other States on the basis of their contribution to the expenses of the League of Nations. Under this arrangement the contribution of Saorstát Eireann will be 0.8 per cent. of the total expenditure, namely, a maximum of £8,000 per annum.  The international fund created by these Government contributions will be administered on behalf of the participating Governments by a board known as the International Board for Non-Intervention in Spain.  This board consists of the representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, U.S.S.R., Norway, Greece and Poland.  The supervision scheme has not yet come into operation, but the International Committee are making every effort to bring it into operation in the near future.  The delay has been caused, mainly, by the difficulty of recruiting the international staff for the purpose of operating the observation scheme. It is hoped that some nine or ten nationals of Saorstát Eireann will receive appointments as officials of the International Board.</P>

      <P>Before entering into a discussion of the Estimate, Sir, perhaps I might be permitted to ask a question about the Minister's figures, which puzzle me somewhat.  I understand that five Powers are contributing 20 per cent. each, and the <Col N="645" /> rest is being contributed by the 22 other States.  That seems to me to be a remarkable piece of arithmetic.  Five times 20 per cent. does not leave too much over to be contributed by the other States.  I hope that the business of the committee is being managed more effectively than this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  I misread what is printed upon the note to the Estimate.  The Deputy can read it for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, certainly. However, I am afraid the reason I called the attention of the House to that was not to call attention to the Minister's slip, but because I wonder whether it is not indicative of the value of the plan as a whole.  Now, Sir, I think that in the case of an Estimate like this, the House is entitled to have a much fuller explanation as to what the scheme is.  We get no explanation, and I should like to point out to the House, as I consider the explanation given to be totally insufficient in this respect, that we are in Committee Stage, and therefore it is open to the House, when the Minister does give proper information, to discuss that.  At present the House and the country is completely in the dark, so far as these things are concerned.  This, I need not point out to the Minister or to the House, is a very important Estimate. I do not mean exactly as to the amount which is represented here, and I do not want to make any point as to whether our proper share is £6,000 or £8,000.  I gathered from a previous statement of the Minister that the amount is arrived at on our decimal point of 0.8 of the League of Nations contribution, and as the total of this particular scheme is about £1,000,000, 0.8 of that is £8,000.  But that is not a matter we need waste time on.  It is not merely a question of the actual amount we are here voting, but the Vote is extremely important from quite a number of points of view owing to the intense interest that the country takes in this whole question and owing to the vital issues which are at stake for civilisation, for Europe, and for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, Sir, I think that a <Col N="646" /> much more elaborate statement, on what is a perfectly new Vote, is required in this particular instance.  If we are discussing various other Estimates we are generally given some explanation&mdash;not always, I admit.  The Minister for External Affairs who, I am sorry to see, is not here, generally introduces his Estimates without any explanation, but it is customary on the part of other Ministers, I do not necessarily say always to convey information to the House, but at least to make elaborate statements in introducing their Estimates.  I understand that quite recently a large number of Deputies found difficulty, in the matter of the language used, not being masters of the language, in following the explanations of Ministers, but at all events we had an explanation of the policy, of what is involved, of the administration and of how the thing is going to be carried out.  We have that in the case of services for which a Vote recurs year after year, but here we have a Vote coming before us for the first time, and beyond the fact that there is some kind of scheme, that it is international in character, and that it will be carried out by somebody&mdash;all of which we knew before&mdash;we practically have got no information in the Minister's introductory statement to-day.  Now, Sir, I suggest that a discussion of this matter, until we have heard a much fuller statement from the Minister, is reducing the value of this House considerably. I shall not say that it wipes away its value as a deliberative Assembly altogether.  I am aware that the President is rather inclined to think that this House has one particular function&mdash;to put in a Government or to put out a Government&mdash; and that he is inclined to regard any deliberation or discussion on the part of this House as a waste of time.  I will admit that the election of a Government or the expulsion of a Government is one of the most important functions that this House is called upon to perform, but it has various other functions which are very important, and unless we get some chance, unless the Government gives the necessary information to this House to enable it to discuss and to <Col N="647" /> deliberate with a certain amount of understanding of the problem which is contained in these other matters, the House is being reduced to a certain extent to nullity, and if you reduce it to nullity in its proper functions, it will cease to be useful for what the President thinks is its main function, the election of a Government or its dismissal.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are in committee, and I think that before the debate goes on we are entitled to have a much more elaborate statement from the Minister who has charge and who is acting now as deputy for the Minister for External Affairs.  This House has discussed the policy behind this Vote.  It has approved the policy behind this Vote. I might sum up its approval in these particular words&mdash;I do not think I would be altogether wrong&mdash;namely, a policy of non-intervention and also, as we cannot do any better, a large portion of this House believed in a policy of neutrality, not because we are in any sense neutral as to the issues that are at stake in Spain.  Very far from it.  I cannot understand how anybody could be neutral as regards these particular issues, but we are neutral in the sense that we think neutrality in the military sense is the best policy to pursue in the unfortunate circumstances of the moment.  I hold that in discussing this Vote these considerations must be before us.  We must ask ourselves how far the Government is carrying out the wishes of Parliament and the wishes of the country in this particular matter, whether really the Government is neutral.  I might urge that I do not think it is. So far as the issues are concerned, I cannot understand how it could be neutral but so far as our wishes in military matters or diplomatic matters are concerned, I do not see how we can pretend that we are observing neutrality in the present situation so long as we have a representative accredited to the Caballero Government in Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the Vote before the House is the <Col N="648" /> logical and natural consequence of an Act of this Oireachtas, the Spanish Civil War (Non-Intervention) Act.  As stated by the Deputy, the policy of non-intervention is a decided matter. On an Estimate the merits of legislation may not be discussed.  In this case the House is discussing the administration, how far the policy of non-intervention has been carried out. The question of the recognition or the non-recognition of either Government in Spain is not relevant.  That was fully discussed when the Bill was before the House.  A discussion on the various stages of a Bill, particularly a recent measure, should not be reopened on an Estimate.  I might further state that the question of recognition or non-recognition of either Spanish Government has been discussed in this House more than once since that Bill passed.  It would be quite irrelevant to discuss it to-day. Debate is confined to the question of administration, and though this is, as the Deputy states, a new Estimate, it will be conceded that the House, in passing that Bill, agreed as a natural consequence to pay the cost of non-intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the question of non-intervention. I made that quite clear, but I submit I am entitled to discuss how far non-intervention is carried out, how far the scheme, which has not been elaborated, has gone in carrying out the policy of non-intervention.  I am not reopening the question of non-intervention. I want to argue that this proposed committee may be partisan in its activities.  The House, to my great regret&mdash;and I would say to its own shame&mdash;decided not to withdraw our representative.  I am not asking the House to reverse that decision now.  I realise I cannot do so.  I hope I have made myself quite clear on that.  I am not now going to discuss the question as to whether or not we should have a representative accredited to Communist Spain.  I regard that as a matter that has been decided, wrongly, I think, but at least decided by the House.  I am, I submit, entitled to argue that I have no confidence in the <i>bona fides</i> of this <Col N="649" /> committee in the way in which they are administering the scheme.  Leaving this country out of it altogether, so as completely to avoid any suggestion that I am trying to side-step your ruling, suppose I take other countries. I find an extraordinary position taken up by some of these countries.  They have representatives with the Caballero Government in Spain, and yet in all other matters they treat these two Governments in Spain, if I might so call them, as being on the same footing. There is no logic, no reason in that.  If you treat them as being absolutely on the same footing, one being no more a legal Government than the other, one being a Government to which you will not allow supplies to be sent any more than you are determined not to allow supplies to the other, I say it displays a lack of consistency and even worse, a certain bias, that they will deliberately give approval, which they do by having their representatives there, to one Government and not to the other, I say, Sir, that if we follow an example of that kind, as we have decided to do, I am afraid our participation in that conference will not be of much value.  I believe, and I have made it quite clear that I do believe, in a policy of non-intervention.  Through all the previous stages, in which we discussed this question in one way or another, you will remember that I made it quite clear that I did believe in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because I am taking that as a reality, as something decided by the House, because I believe in that policy being fully carried out, that I want a great deal more information than we have got about this Vote.  I think the whole House assented to that policy for one main reason and a large portion of the House joined to that another reason.  They assented because they believed that a policy of intervention, the sending of large numbers of troops and war material to Spain might very easily, in present conditions internationally in Europe, lead to a conflagration, a conflagration that might have disastrous consequences, that almost certainly would have.  It might lead, I may say, to the victory of the very cause which I am anxious to see defeated in Europe.  I do not <Col N="650" /> say that necessarily it would do so, but the risk is too great for any sensible man or any sensible body of men to take.  We can see, therefore, the reasons why we thought measures should be taken to prevent a European catastrophe of that kind, owing to the appalling loss, moral, spiritual and material, that would follow; and also, and still more&mdash;though perhaps this may seem an extraordinary thing to say&mdash;because I believe it might lead to the victory of Bolshevism.  There was another reason which induced a number of Deputies to favour a policy of non-intervention, namely, because some of us, at least in the early stages, adopted the view that intervention then would prevent the defeat of the cause whose defeat we wanted to see in Spain.  I should like not merely to get an assurance, which I have no doubt will be given me glibly enough, but some kind of proof, something on which to found a reasonable expectation, that this policy is likely to be a success.  At various times in the discussions to which you, Sir, have referred, we have put questions to the Ministers as to how the policy was to be enforced&mdash; that is what we are discussing now&mdash; and we never got an answer to those questions.  I myself remember putting a very definite and simple question at a very early stage of the debate, and I am still waiting for the answer.  I think the question was repeated by Deputy McGilligan.  I know no power that this committee has taken to itself which will enable it to prevent a Mexican boat going into Spain.  Is not that the position?  Will the Minister not answer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with whatever the Deputy raises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  We will have an opportunity of discussing that afterwards if necessary.  I know no power at the moment which will prevent a Mexican boat from going into Spain.  I do not know how this committee can prevent it.  I do not know how this committee can search it, or how any man who is a searcher can board that particular vessel.  There may be an agreement between the 27 Powers by which, among themselves, <Col N="651" /> they will allow the right to search, but how that can be made applicable to a Power which is altogether outside the 27 has not been made clear.  The question, then, that I put is as follows; I have never heard it dealt with.  I put it now again to the Minister.  What is to prevent the U.S.S.R., the Soviet Government, from sending supplies to Mexico, and then those supplies being sent back to Spain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take another example.  There was an agreement entered into by the Powers under which they all agreed amongst themselves not to send material or men, or to allow fresh volunteers even, to go into Spain on either side.  The Minister and the House will remember that we passed a Bill making it criminal for anybody to take such an action&mdash;to leave this country, or even to take the first step by going into a railway station for the purpose of leaving this country, to join either of the fighting forces in Spain.  That agreement, as the Minister knows, was made.  Still, rightly or wrongly&mdash;this is what I want to call attention to, because a semi-war atmosphere is being worked up in connection with it&mdash;accusations are made on the one hand that reinforcements are going to General Franco and, on the other hand, that reinforcements and material of all kinds are still being poured into the Red Government of Spain.  As I say, if you listen to the English radio or read the extracts from some of the English Press, you will get the idea into your head that that accusation is merely being made against the Italians, but, of course, that is only because we are being kept ignorant of the charge that is being made on the other side.  It was only a couple of nights ago I heard very definite charges being made from the Italian side, over the radio&mdash;which, as far as I can see, is to a large extent an official business there&mdash;that the agreement was being violated by two countries, by France and by Russia. On the particular night on which I was listening they were dealing with France.  They said that at Marseilles boats were being loaded and material sent to Spain; in the same way men <Col N="652" /> were being sent into Spain from France.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position&mdash;I hope the Minister is in some position, because after all, it is the business of the Government to give us information, or, if they have not got it, to try and get it&mdash;to weigh the value of those charges, but surely anybody who has followed this controversy even to a small extent of late will know the way in which what I might call a pre-war atmosphere is being worked up.  Deliberate propaganda is working it up.  What I do not like is this: the very agreement that was made between the Powers is being used as one of the weapons to spur on a war feeling.  I think, Sir, that the House is entitled to some assurance that this agreement, which was intended to preserve the peace, will not become a method of bringing war nearer.  The Minister refers to a scheme that has been agreed to.  He said that the scheme has not yet come into operation.  Therefore, I cannot ask the Minister how it is working. I cannot ask the Minister that, but at least we can be told what the scheme is.  How does he think it is going to work?</P>
    <P>Let me take the particular instance that I mentioned.  We are told that at Marseilles arms are being loaded, camouflaged as something else: no person at the present moment openly loads arms, or at least none of the Powers that have deliberately promised not to do such a thing. Supposing a boat of that kind sails from Marseilles to one of the ports that are at present under the control of the Red Government in Spain. What is the method of thoroughly examining that particular boat?  Who can board it?  Who can compel the boat to halt?  Supposing it is a German or Italian ship.  If it is not, there are a lot of people in this country who are rather suspicious as to the character of the examination, and as to its thoroughness.  It would be, to a large extent, making yourself your own searcher, almost as though you would expect the Commissioners of Revenue to accept without the slightest examination a declaration of income, simply a lump-sum <Col N="653" /> without any details of any kind. Supposing a right of that kind was handed over to a German or Italian ship; does the Minister think that that is likely to promote the cause of peace?  Is there no danger involved there?</P>
    <P>So far as the actual carrying out of this policy of non-intervention is concerned, I should be much easier in my mind if I felt that there was goodwill behind it; if I did not realise as I fully realise, the extraordinary nature of the propaganda that is going on.  I am particularly interested in the propaganda on one side.  I will confess that.  I have followed that propaganda for years.  I know its efficiency.  It is really remarkable. Nowhere, I think, has its efficiency been demonstrated more clearly than in what it has been able to carry through in connection with the civil war in Spain during the last six months.  On whom have we to rely really for the carrying out of this agreement, and making effective the policy of non-intervention, which, if it could be made effective, probably would be the safest course for Europe, as we have pointed out on more than one occasion? Take France and Russia.  One of them is the chief centre of propaganda. It is a country that, as one can see in the papers I get from there &mdash;and I get some&mdash;has been boasting for years of its preparedness for war. It now comes forward, notwithstanding that, as the great apostle of peace.</P>
    <P>The main cause of disturbance, I am convinced, where European and world affairs are concerned, is the activities of the U.S.S.R. masquerading under the banner of peace.  The first people to start the policy of intervention in Spain are masquerading now under the policy of non-intervention, the people whose action, whose intervention and propaganda to a large extent are responsible for the whole trouble, are now using the same propaganda under the pretence that they want to preserve the peace of Europe and under the pretence that they are in favour of non-intervention. From what I know, and, as I have said, I have given a number of years' study to this particular problem, other <Col N="654" /> protestations made by that Power in favour of peace and in favour of non-intervention only drive home, to my mind, its complete insincerity so far as it is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not going to discuss the present Government in France.  I do not believe in its desire for neutrality.  It is geographically in a remarkably good position to evade these particular rules.  Coming to England, I do not know what the policy of the British Government is on this. I believe in that particular case there are statesmen there, as there are in other countries, who do not realise the seriousness of this particular menace of Communism.  Whether there or elsewhere, you have statesmen of that kind.  I doubt if these statesmen will carry, or will be able to carry, an effective policy of this kind through.  It is not that I believe that the present British Government has any sympathy with Bolshevism or Communism.  I do not believe they have.  It would be absurd to think so.  I am not suggesting for a moment that they are on the same level as the other two Governments I have mentioned, but what I am convinced of, so far as we can judge by their actions, is that they and others have no conception of the seriousness of the menace.  They see the immediate aim that they have before them, the danger of the European outburst, and are genuinely in favour of peace.  They see an international strategic position, and possibly are to a large extent governed by that.</P>
    <P>On what then can we rely for the effective carrying out of this policy? What steps, for instance, have we taken?  We are members of this committee. We are contributing to it. What steps have we taken, or what suggestions have we ever made, or are we still in the position so blandly, almost boastfully, acknowledged by a colleague of the Minister that we are mere &ldquo;yes men&rdquo;?  Our business is not to open our mouths and not to see that the bond that we are entering into is honoured!  Is that our position? Is our position in regard to international conferences to be that of &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; or absentees?  That seems to be the position to which the <Col N="655" /> present Minister for External Affairs is reducing this country.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to know what the scheme is.  The Minister says there is a scheme, and that that scheme is designed, by measures to be taken on land and sea, to prevent intervention. Well, we have not the slightest evidence; we have no information of any kind supplied to us by the Government to indicate whether the scheme is capable of bringing about, or can be considered even as likely to bring, results of that kind.  It is quite obvious, if you have a scheme framed in order to prevent intervention, that that scheme must operate on both land and sea, and that measures must be taken on land and sea to see that non-intervention is carried through.  I suggest that a repetition of such an obvious truth gives us no information. As I have said, what I want is some indication that this scheme is not mere pretence if the pretence itself can work, and very often it can.  If you get a scheme going, even though it is not an effective scheme&mdash;I want to be quite fair and I am ready to admit that if you can fool people with it for a while it may achieve a good purpose and postpone an outbreak&mdash;prevent it perhaps altogether.  It may be that this scheme has nothing more effective than that, and that some people do not expect anything more from it.  Well, if it does that it does something, but again the House is in the unfortunate position of having committed itself to this policy and of not knowing how that policy is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>As I say, I for one have very little confidence in some of the principal Powers that are engaged in putting this scheme into effect.  We are not now discussing whether you can rely on the faith of the Powers.  If you could there would be no necessity for this scheme.  If you could rely on the goodwill of citizens there would be no necessity for a police force.  If you could rely on the uprightness and fairness of all nations there would be no necessity for the League of Nations. If you could rely on the good faith of the different Powers that have committed <Col N="656" /> themselves to the policy of non-intervention, there would be no necessity for this scheme.  Therefore, at the basis of this scheme is fear and, apparently, well-grounded fear that the agreement would not be carried out by the Powers if the Powers could evade it.  Otherwise, why the scheme? We, therefore, must assume, and so far as I am concerned I have not the least doubt that I am correct in assuming, that bad faith is to be feared on the part of some of the Powers, and here is a scheme that will have to combat that bad faith.  Is it capable of doing it?  How can I answer?</P>
    <P>As you, Sir, pointed out, the Government is here introducing an entirely new Estimate.  The Estimate, I admit, is one that follows logically from what was previously done in this House.  I am not quarrelling with the amount of the Estimate, but it is one in respect of which we are certainly entitled to have a great deal more information about than we have got up to the present.  The Minister indicated that the only thing holding up the working of the scheme to the present was the question of getting the various observers and so on.  Now, what <i>is</i> the scheme and can the Minister show me how far it will effect the various things that I have asked him about.</P>
    <P>I am mainly interested in two things. The great bulk of the people of this country are interested in two things, and these are: (1) the avoidance of a European catastrophe, and (2) the defeat of the Communist Government in Spain.  I supported the policy of non-intervention because I thought it was the only method at the moment that I could see open to secure these two great ends.  The House agreed with that particular policy, possibly not from the same motives that actuated me, but they agreed to that policy.  We now want to know whether the machinery that is being set up will give reality to that policy, or whether it may not itself contribute to more bitterness and misunderstandings between the Powers.  I am afraid that this Vote, from the manner in which it is put before the House, was looked upon as a purely formal affair.  I do not know why the Government should <Col N="657" /> be under any such impression.  It is a matter in which the Opposition has shown the keenest interest all along and in which the country is exceedingly interested.  A much fuller explanation is therefore demanded from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan stated that the House is entitled to an explanation of what the scheme is. That explanation was given some time ago when the Merchant Shipping Act was introduced just before Easter.  An outline was given then of the scheme of observation, to the cost of which we are now proposing to contribute. In fact, from the discussion which took place then, it was obvious that the Deputies opposite were fully informed as to the main outlines of this scheme.  The scheme is, of course, one which involves only observation of traffic across the frontiers or in the territorial seas of Spain.  It is not a scheme of control.  That fact was made clear before, but apparently it is necessary to make it clear again. So far as this country is concerned, any scheme of observation of traffic with Spain necessarily involves control of merchant shipping and, as the laws affecting shipping are administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the necessary legislation had to be introduced by me as Minister for that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to give again, if necessary, any information which Deputies may require as to the nature of the scheme or the action which the Government is taking to give effect to its obligations under it; but I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by a long discussion upon the principles upon which the policy of non-intervention is based, or upon which this particular scheme was devised.  I assume that the various nations represented upon this International Committee agreed upon the policy of non-intervention in Spain, whatever secondary consideration may have been in the minds of individual Governments, mainly for the purpose of ensuring that there would be no general war in Europe.  As that was their main purpose they had necessarily to devise a scheme for giving effect to their non-intervention <Col N="658" /> agreement which would not be in itself a source of danger.  It is obvious from Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks that he appreciates that a scheme of control could be devised which would appear on paper to be more effective than the scheme of observation which has in fact been agreed upon, but which would in fact be as dangerous to the peace of Europe as the absence of any agreement at all.</P>
    <P>The different Governments may have different points of view as to the rights and wrongs of the issues now being decided in Spain, but the main concern of them all, and certainly our main concern at the moment, is to ensure that this policy of non-intervention is effectively carried out lest greater evils might befall.  The Deputy referred to the allegations frequently made in the past, and which are still being made, that Governments which are parties to the agreement are breaking the agreement and are, in fact, supplying war material and other assistance to Spain. It is precisely because these allegations were made by the Italians against the French and Russians, and by the French and Russians against the Italians that this scheme of observation was first suggested, and was finally agreed upon by the parties represented on the committee.</P>
    <P>The scheme does not involve anything more than that there shall be set up an international body, adequately financed and with sufficient resources and staff to supervise all movements of persons and goods into Spain, and therefore able to supply information as to whether in fact breaches of the agreement are being committed by any of the parties to it.  The scheme involves, in the first place, that the various parties to it enact legislation making it contrary to their national laws for their citizens to send war material or to assist in sending volunteers to Spain.  Secondly, that any punishment to be inflicted upon persons breaking the agreement will be inflicted by their own courts on the strength of information supplied by this International Board with the assistance of its supervisors.  That particular method does not, on the face of it, <Col N="659" /> appear effective, but I think that a moment's consideration will convince Deputies that it is the most effective method which can be adopted without involving very grave risks of the nature to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred. It is equally clear that unless the various Governments represented on the committee agree to the policy of non-intervention in this agreement in good faith and intend to give effect to it, the scheme itself is not going to succeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked for proof that the policy of non-intervention is likely to succeed, or that this scheme of observation is likely to give effect to the policy of non-intervention.  I cannot give him that proof, but I think we must assume the good faith of the various Governments to the arrangement until the contrary is proved.  In any event, having regard to the very terrible consequences involved, we must try out any method of averting the consequences before deciding that nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>The scheme of observation involves the supervision of the land frontiers of Spain, a supervision which will extend to the railways and to the principal roads and passes.  The Franco-Spanish frontier and the Portuguese-Spanish frontier will be divided into supervision zones, with officers of the International Board in charge of each zone.  Arrangements have also been made for the supervision of cargo ships and that supervision will take place at the point of embarkation. The scheme involves that ships approaching Spanish territory will be required by their national laws to call at certain stated ports contiguous to Spain and there submit to inspection by supervisors of the International Board.  Officers of the board may, in fact, travel upon these ships from these ports to their ports of destination in Spain.  Powers have also been conferred in our case by our law on officers of the naval Powers, the ships of which will be patrolling the Spanish coast, to stop and board our ships and inspect papers.  The arrangements which have been agreed upon appear to be adequate to ensure observation, but no more than observation, <Col N="660" /> of traffic into Spain.  If any of the officers of the International Board report that nationals of this country are breaking our law in that regard, then it will be for the Government here to take action against these nationals.  The same thing applies in respect of nationals of any country.</P>
    <P>The scheme, of course, does not apply to countries not represented on the International Committee.  Ships from these non-participating countries will not be subject to observation by these investigation officers, nor will the goods of these countries passing into Spain be subject to control under this arrangement.  It would, undoubtedly, be better, probably, if the present agreement could be extended to all the others, but apparently that has not been possible. The immediate danger of a conflict arising from the Spanish trouble is in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because of the allegations of bad faith made by a number of parties to it, and the dangers that these allegations give rise to, to the peace of Europe.  It was felt desirable that this officer observation scheme should be set up, so that the making of these allegations would not be the cause of a conflict, and that there would be means by which the <Col N="661" /> truth or otherwise of the allegations could be examined.  The situation is one of considerable danger.  There is no sense in shutting our eyes to that fact, and anything we can do in our small way to minimise that danger should be done.  The existence of the observation scheme may not avert the danger, but at least it is a step in the direction of its reduction.  The contribution which we are called upon to make to ensure its success is a very small one, and altogether out of proportion to the risks we would have to run if this situation in Spain should lead to a general European conflict.</P>

      <P>The matter which the Minister has dealt with this morning is one of no little importance. Despite the fact that our contribution to international action must be small, in comparison with that made by others, if a Foreign Office matter of similar importance in any other State were brought before the sole legislative body in the country by the President of the Board of Trade or the Minister for Commerce I think very adverse comment would be made; but this morning, in this House, we are treated to the spectacle of the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming attended, not by officials of his own Department but attended openly and blatantly by officials of the Department of External Affairs, because the Minister for External Affairs does not think it worth his while to appear before this House for the purpose of recommending this Estimate.  We all remember that the Minister for External Affairs openly boasted that when he wanted to destroy the Seanad he took from his own camp followers so disreputable a collection and put them into the Seanad, that he would have a good excuse for wiping it out of existence.  That is evidence of the system whereby the President endeavoured to bring on the representative Assembly of this State contempt with a view to organising public opinion against them in the country.</P>

      <P>The purpose of mentioning it this morning is to suggest that the President, who is Minister for External Affairs, deliberately absented himself from the House in order to show his contempt for it.  That is my statement, and I say that, in my judgment, it is most improper.  In my judgment, even his own Deputies are entitled to more respect from the President.  In my opinion, he does the cause of democratic government in this country great disservice in suggesting that it is not worth his while to come and give an explanation of policy for which he makes himself personally responsible to his Executive Council as a Minister, and jointly as the Executive Council to the House.  If the House is not entitled to that service from the President of the Executive Council, then the House is entitled to very little respect indeed from the people which it is supposed to govern.  If it cannot govern the President of the Executive Council, then it can have very little hope of governing the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been emphasised to-day that this Estimate flows as an actual consequence from previous legislation, and Deputy O'Sullivan has rightly remarked that the principle of whether there should be intervention or non-intervention <Col N="663" /> has been decided, and that, in fact, it was unanimously decided by this House only for different reasons.  Each part of the House supports non-intervention for different reasons.</P>
    <P>As I see the present situation, I am more convinced now even than I was when non-intervention was first mentioned that we were right in the decision we came to, to adhere strictly to that principle, but when we adhered to it, I think everyone on this side hoped that that principle would be carried out, not only in the letter, but in the spirit.  As I see this administrative Act which we are asked to support to day, we are faced with a situation in which our concern is to restrict the area of strife to the territory of Spain.  At the present time in Spain there does not seem to be any <i>de facto</i> Government for the whole country.  There is, in our judgment, a <i>de jure</i> Government of Spain, but we are perfectly certain that the Valencia Government is not that <i>de jure</i> Government, that it has no warrant of authority to govern either <i>de facto</i> or <i>de jure.</i>  In our desire to partake in and to recommend by whatever moral suasion is at our disposal, the policy of non-intervention to the whole world, I think we ought to make it perfectly clear to the whole world that we recognise the fact that Valencia is neither a <i>de jure</i> nor a <i>de facto</i> Government in Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of this discussion, in order to indicate what the limits of this debate might be, the Chair stated that the recognition or non-recognition of either Government in Spain has no relation to the Vote before the House, which is the granting of £8,000 for carrying out the policy of non-intervention as decided by an Act.  The relative positions of the two Governments in Spain are not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely.  The Minister himself has emphasised the vital necessity of trying to wed to this policy and to this scheme States which have up to now refused to join.  He has recognised the warning which <Col N="664" /> Deputy O'Sullivan gave him of the immense dangers of leaving certain States outside the scheme, because, unless the angelic good faith which the Minister hopes for from European States is a fact, States which desire to act in bad faith and to circumvent this supervision proposal can ship their contraband merchandise to nonparticipating States, and thence ship that merchandise into Spain in definance of this arrangement.  I believe it would make non-intervention and this scheme much more effective if all Governments would recognise the true situation in Spain, and I submit that I am entitled to argue, and I make this submission, that if we, by our example, could get unanimous recognition of the fact that there is no <i>de facto</i> Government in Spain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are the ultimate judge in that matter, Sir, and, I therefore, gather that the only thing that may be discussed is whether this money is to be spent or not, and not whether it is to be spent effectively or ineffectively.  I submit that without doing certain things, the description of which we must defer to another day, this expenditure may very well be ineffective.  I believe that if we did certain things now, and did them resolutely, and without wobbling or wriggling as the President of the Executive Council wriggled yesterday and on divers other occasions, we could get good value for this money by having a united action amongst all nations of the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I, however, desire to add to what I have already said only one thing, Sir, and that is to remind the House that we were told three weeks or a month ago that the guillotine had to be put in force to rush this legislation through the House in order to get the scheme for non-intervention working.  So far as I am aware, there are still some States peacefully legislating on the same lines on which we were required to legislate under the guillotine in one day.  Other States are still brooding over the later stages of an exactly similar Bill and nobody is the least bit put about over it.  I do not suppose it made a very fundamental difference to the ultimate decision this House might have come to in regard to this measure, but I think it reflects gravely on the Executive Council that, by fraudulent misrepresentation of that kind, they are prepared to flog their own acquiescent Deputies into the Lobbies for the purpose of strangling free discussion in this House.</P>

      <P>When the non-intervention <Col N="666" /> policy was agreed to here, the case was put forward from some parts of the House that it was agreed to for the purpose of avoiding a general European war.  It was also argued by others that it was the best possible way of giving freedom to the forces under General Franco to develop their resources and their position, and to make successful the fight they were waging against the closing down and destruction of the Catholic churches and the murder and slaughter of ecclesiastics of the Catholic Church in Spain.  Now we are passing moneys for the purpose of putting this non-intervention machinery into full operation.  We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that, whether expressing the true position in Spain or merely for propaganda purposes, very prominent collectors of information on the Spanish and the European situation generally have pointed out recently that what has happened since the beginning of January in Spain is that the Valencia Government has been carrying on, and carrying on successfully, with increasing Spanish support and less foreign support, and that the Franco Government has been carrying on with decreasing Spanish support and increasing foreign support.  For those people who supported the non-intervention policy on the grounds that that policy was a policy which would ultimately safeguard the position of the traditional Church in Spain, statements of that kind are very disturbing, and when we pass moneys here for more effectively implementing the non-intervention policy, we are entitled to hear some statement from the Government as to what their summary of the actual military position at the present moment in Spain is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, while putting forward the idea that the non-intervention policy is necessary in order to avoid a European war, are also concerned with the effectiveness of the non-intervention policy as helping to enable those who stand for religion in Spain to secure the freedom of their people to have a Government that will not attempt to wipe out religion and that will give freedom to exist to the traditional Church in Spain.  The <Col N="667" /> Government cannot be unaware that publicity has been given to that type of picture of the position in Spain.</P>
    <P>We certainly should expect to hear from them whether that is the position or not.  If it is the position, we should like to know to what extent the policy of non-intervention is going to affect the future situation in Spain.  It is pointed out by people who claim to be well informed that after the 1st January the position in Spain is that the Valencia Government is operating with greater Spanish support and smaller foreign support, and that the Franco Government is operating with smaller Spanish support and greater foreign support.</P>

      <P>I quite agree. I am not questioning that but I think the practice is one that should not grow up, so to speak, automatically. That remark was largely elicited by your intervention.  I should like to ask if the Government has any information or has tried to get any information as to what is happening in Spain and, if so, what kind of information they have.  I mentioned various statements which had been made and allegations put forward by one side and the other.  I was hoping that the Minister could, in his capacity as Acting-Minister for External Affairs, make an official pronouncement on that point.  Has he tried to get any official information?  As Deputy Dillon said, I think it is most regrettable that on an important matter of this kind&mdash;I admit that one member of the Executive Council can <Col N="669" /> take the place of another&mdash;the debate should be made so unreal by the absence of the Minister for External Affairs.  His deputy's speech is proof of that.  It was largely on his side a formal affair.  If I may say so, it showed no personal touch with the subject.  It is most regrettable that the Minister for External Affairs, whose primary responsibility it is, was not here this morning.  I think that Deputy Dillon made a most useful contribution in pointing that out.  I do not say that I am quite as much in the dark now as I was when the Minister got up to speak.  I am not. I gather now that the whole scheme of non-intervention, from the international point of view, boils down to a policy of mere observation.  So far as that observation is concerned, its main purpose is merely to control propaganda. According to the Minister, it has no other useful function.  When I intervened and asked a question, his answer made that clear, if it made nothing else clear&mdash;as you must assume good faith on the part of those who are parties to this agreement. That is the very thing we cannot do. That is the very thing which I and others in the country would be stultifying ourselves in doing.  I assume the very worst faith on the part of some of the Powers.  A policy of non-intervention which is founded on a lie like that will not get us anywhere.  If that is the assumption, then the whole policy is blown sky-high.  It is the business of an international body to do something more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What contribution has the Minister made to this particular scheme? Listening to him, I gathered that my suspicion is correct&mdash;that our Government made no contribution.  We got a scheme and took it because it was our business to take it!  I deny that it was our business to take it.  You have Powers there whose bad faith is not open to question.  We are silent, and simply take what is given to us. We are to have the observation&mdash;for what purpose?  Not to question the good faith of these people.  That is not now the purpose of the spending of £1,000,000, according to the Minister. The purpose is to examine the good faith of the people who question <Col N="670" /> their good faith.  Is not that the position put before us by the Minister&mdash; that the main purpose of observation was to prove the lack of foundation of the charges of intervention that were being made?  I do not think I am misinterpreting the purpose&mdash;that it was not to prove bad faith in the Powers, but to examine the good faith of those who questioned it.  We must assume that, according to the Minister. The main purpose, therefore, is to cut off propaganda as to the charges of intervention made on one side or the other, in spite of the pledged word.  In that way we prevent ill-will once we prove these charges to be unfounded.  That is the point made.  If not, then our purpose is to find out&mdash;assuming that we cannot take good faith as a premise&mdash; whether these people are, in fact, evading their obligations.  Despite what the Minister said in his reply to my interjection, I say that ought to be the main purpose&mdash;not merely countering propaganda.</P>
    <P>I am not denying the importance of countering propaganda, but I have very little faith in this body being able to do it.  If the Minister thinks that this body will be able to cope effectively with the propaganda that is going on, with no respect for truth, he is living in a fools' paradise. Take the neighbouring country, which does undoubtedly seem to have some interest in this&mdash;certainly more than our Government.  We see day after day charges made there in Parliament and out of Parliament on the matter of intervention on the part of several foreign Powers.  I have seen the answer given, and denials that there are no grounds for such charges so far as the Government knows.  And yet the Minister must know the extent to which these charges are still repeated from day to day&mdash;as if no denial had been given. He must know not merely the extent to which they are repeated, but, to use slang, the extent to which they are getting across and to the extent to which they are used across&mdash;Channel. If the Minister does not know that, he is completely out of touch with what is happening and with the <Col N="671" /> developments taking place, and I believe that he is.  The Government is completely out of touch with developments.</P>
    <P>We cannot find out from our representative what information he has to give us on anything.  Surely if we have a representative with the Spanish Government, geographically in France, but accredited to the State of which Caballero is premier or head, he ought at least be able to give us some information, and he ought to know what are the views of the representatives of other Governments there.  Have we, as a Government, tried to get any information on these matters?  If so, why did not the Minister communicate that information and do something more than say: &ldquo;These charges are being made&rdquo;?  I now put two definite questions to the Minister.  Has he any information on this point?  Has the Government sought to get any information on this point?  If so, when?  If they have got it what is the information? If they have not got it, what is the explanation they are not getting it? Has Russia in the spirit as well as in the letter observed her obligations under the non-intervention pact?  Can the Minister for Industry and Commerce enlighten the House on that particular matter?  Can he give the country any information he has on this matter in which the country is profoundly interested?  Can he tell us what steps are being taken elsewhere? The Minister indicated the steps that have been taken here.  We know that already.  What steps are being taken elsewhere?  Have all the 27 countries hastened legislation in the way that we have hastened it?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us as a justification for his presence here that it was his business as Minister for Industry and Commerce to introduce into the House the Control of Merchant Shipping Bill dealing with this matter. That, however, is not an excuse for the President being absent to-day, because we are not dealing now with what we intend to do as regards our shipping.  We are making a contribution to the international body controlling the whole question of non-intervention.  It is not what we <Col N="672" /> shall do or what the Minister will do or what his colleague the President of the Board of Trade elsewhere will do. But it is what the policy of his Party and this Government, and particularly what the policy of the Minister for External Affairs will be.  The fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had thrust upon him the task of introducing a certain Bill, does not get over that.  I must say that anything that the Minister has said&mdash;and I am sorry to have to say it&mdash;has certainly not quieted any fears I have had on this particular matter.  I doubt if it will give very much satisfaction to the large number of people in this country who are profoundly interested in this question.  For very many important reasons they are profoundly interested in this question of non-intervention. I regret that the Minister has not been more communicative with the House or that he does not say that he has no information.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has very properly referred to the propaganda that is going around at the present time.  I find it hard to speak moderately when I realise that the Minister for External Affairs of this State, who has abundant information at his disposal, all the information that the British Foreign Office has, and that our representative accredited to the Communist Government in Spain has, if he wanted to give it to this House, is silent.  He absents himself from the House, and does not say a word.  The propaganda at present is that this non-intervention business is to prevent arms getting to General Franco because General Franco is holding down the Spanish people with foreign guns, foreign mercenaries and foreign aid.  The implication is that the gallant democrats in Valencia are challenged by a junta, a body that attacks the Spanish people by the aid of foreign subsidised military insurgents.  All the evidence that an impartial mind can get by careful research contradicts that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I submit, Sir, that this proposal to prevent intervention in Spain, so far as we intended it in the Saorstát, is a proposal to prevent any outside country interfering in Spain. I say that the Third International in Moscow are deliberately spreading rumours in every part of the world they can reach that the necessity for non-intervention of the kind we are putting in force here to-day arises from the fact that there is in Spain a military junta bringing in foreign aid to crush the Spanish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, but it is the duty of our Minister for External Affairs to appear here to-day and to say on this matter: &ldquo;My information is such and such.&rdquo;  I do not attach any importance to the rumours that foreign aid is going to Franco and none to the other side.  Our purpose is to prevent its going to any side. The Minister for External Affairs is silent.  In the presence of the vicious propaganda to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred, his very silence lends colour to that propaganda.  If the Minister for External Affairs were here I would challenge him to say if propaganda of that kind is circulated from any source to this country.  It is unquestionably difficult to measure one's words when the evil that one is seeking to combat is so elusive, and when you get no help whatever from the only man in the State who is in a position to help.  There has been on this matter no information afforded to this House by the Minister for External Affairs from the point of view of our Government for months past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we ought to have some information here, which would help <Col N="674" /> us to act and do in matters of this kind, other than what we can pick up from the English or French newspapers of what is told to the English Parliament and the French Parliament by their Ministers of External Affairs.  It is admitted that the Burgos Government in Spain have no effective propaganda service.  All the propaganda that is reaching outside Europe, practically, is being carefully organised by the Third Internationale in Moscow.</P>
    <P>I ask your leave, Sir, to make this perfectly clear, that when we start a plan to prevent the dispatch of arms or war materials to Spain, we do it because we hope it will end the conflict, because we hope it will help to end the conflict, in Spain.  We hope that conflict will be ended by a victory for the Burgos Government. We have no reason to believe that the Burgos Government are carrying on with the help exclusively of foreign arms or foreign aid.  We believe they represent the Spanish people and we believe that but for the action of the Third Internationale of Moscow there would have been no foreign intervention in Spain.  We believe there was a mobilisation of the Third Internationale in Spain for at least three years before the civil war began.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Can I say this, then, that in our judgment this supervision for which we are providing money to-day ought to be directed against all parties who attempt to send war material into Spain, and that the primary vigilance ought to be on those who started the civil war there? I suggest that special vigilance ought to be concentrated on the Third Internationale of Moscow, who shipped the first arms to Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that absolutely. I say that if ships are found carrying into Spain exhortations in the form of printed matter to perpetrate outrage or assassination, as I have no doubt there are millions of such documents coming from Moscow, steps ought to be taken to end it, and my urgent submission is that if our Government have not so interpreted the Schedule contained in the Act of the classes of goods to be prevented, that they ought to recognise that in this day and age no more deadly ammunition can be landed than exhortations to crime and assassination, such as has been the stock-in-trade of the Third Internationale <Col N="676" /> in every civil war they precipitated the world over.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is this. Our point of view is that the precautions which this money is to finance, the precautions which the whole policy we are concerned to implement provide for, are rendered necessary by the consistent and unscrupulous system of intervention that is being carried on by Moscow in Spain and that has precipitated the whole situation at present torturing the Spanish nation.  Our feeling is that we readily acknowledge the Government of Burgos have received help from outside Spain.</P>

      <P>Clearly we cannot go into the position in Spain, or what was the start of the civil war in Spain; that is clearly outside the scope of this matter.  This money is being voted to implement the Non-Intervention Act, which endeavours to enable this State to take part in the policy of non-intervention. We are not going to discuss what led up to the outbreak of the civil war in Spain.</P>

If it is suggested that the previous conduct of a man is no guide as to what he is likely to do, I suggest the debate becomes unreal. I cannot see why Deputy Dillon is not perfectly in order in directing, as he has done, special attention to one particular Power as being a special object of observation for us so far as we take any part in this thing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asked to vote this money for the purpose of stopping war material going into Spain. I say you should stop Russia sending war materials to the gang in Valencia, and the moment you do, the necessity for vigilance in preventing arms going to the other side will cease.  Your task of preventing arms and men going from Saorstát Eireann, Portugal <Col N="678" /> or Italy will vanish.  Certainly, some States had no desire, and would not be allowed by the Burgos Government, to embroil themselves in the Spanish civil war, until the Burgos Government found themselves confronted by immense foreign legions, men and war material sent in by Moscow.  I say stop Moscow, which has made Caballero's assault on Spain possible, and there will be no further trouble in stopping arms, men and other war material going into the rest of Spain.  If you could put an end to all foreign intervention in Spain to-morrow morning by a wave of the hand, effectively and genuinely, then the Government of Burgos would prevail within three weeks.  It is the steady system of Communist intervention in Spain that has kept this thing going on so long.  Therefore, I say to our Government, and I say to the Governments who feel with us on that issue which is dominant in Spain: Watch Russia; watch the other Communist countries that are trying to make out of Spain the Communist State of the west of Europe; and if you stop them, then you will have no difficulty in stopping the others because, in my judgment, neither the Government of Burgos nor anyone fighting on their side would want the help of anybody outside Spain to establish decent order and regulated government in that State, were it not for the fact that they found themselves confronted with the massed power of international Communism which was able to prostitute Spain, to enslave its people and to drive Christianity out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the point I want to make and, to my mind, it is absolutely vital that that point should be made from this Parliament.  You have got every word that is said in the French House of Deputies, and practically every word that gets publicity is an argument that the reason we want non-intervention, the reason we want this committee, is to prevent arms going into Spain wherewith General Franco will enslave and oppress the Spanish people.  Every question that is asked in the British House of Commons on the matter is asked by some person <Col N="679" /> who pretends to be a disinterested person and who wants to know: Is it true that General Franco used the arms he got to slaughter the babies of the people of Spain; did he blow up churches, and is he suppressing savagery?</P>
    <P>Again, the innuendo is that arms are being sent in to enable Franco to hold down the Spanish people.  I do not believe there is a single creature in this House who does not, in spirit and heart, agree with me, and I am making the case, not so much to convince Deputies here, as to express from this House what I believe to be the views of us all.  The beauty of the Communist propagandist is that he has no sense of humour at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My respectful submission, Sir, is that, while he certainly is not responsible for its being done&mdash; nor would be responsible&mdash;I say that, by his failure to come here and speak out boldly, he makes it possible to be done.  I want him to raise his voice to-day so that nobody, however skilful, can misrepresent what we are doing as part of Communist propaganda.  I want to make it clear that in our view, if this policy becomes effective, then the Government of Burgos will control Spain in three weeks, because 90 per cent. of the Spanish people want it to do so, and the reason we are working so hard for effective non-intervention is because we believe that the arms going into Spain are going in from <Col N="681" /> Moscow to enable Caballero to hold down the Spanish people, and we want to stop that.  That seems to me to be a perfectly net point.  I want to call evidence to show that we are right in that, and that we believe the effect of this thing will be to strip Caballero of arms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and rightly so.  We want to prevent arms going in to Caballero to enable him to hold down the Spanish people.  We believe that is the purpose of this money, and, to make it effective, it must be spent to prevent the sending of arms into Spain from Moscow.  There will be no necessity to prevent arms going to General Franco if you only spend enough of it to prevent Moscow sending arms or money to Caballero.  I say that Caballero is holding down the Spanish people by means of the arms he is getting from Moscow, and in proof of that I quote the statistics given by the First Lord of the Admiralty in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, in which he says that 17,000 refugees have been taken out of Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the internal affairs of Spain.  The Deputy is defending one presumed Government in Spain, and that is intervention in the internal affairs of Spain.  We are discussing how this money is to be expended in non-intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I felt that I was being very relevant in saying, categorically and exactly, how I wanted £9 out of every £10 to be actually spent on doing a certain particular job, the preventing of weapons going from Moscow to Caballero.  I was prepared to point the route, to mark the spot, and to see how each particular 1/- should be spent.  Has anybody in this House been more relevant before?  I was able to give my reasons why I thought that was necessary, because I believe that those were the arms that were foreign arms, insomuch as they were being used by a treacherous Spaniard to oppress the Spanish people.  I think I have been <Col N="682" /> more relevant than anybody in the House to-day.  I point to the stuff, to the man, to the ship, to the day, where I want this money to be spent, and I say that all that arises from the fact that one part of Spain is oppressed, in evidence of which I call to your attention that the British Fleet had to take 17,000 refugees out of Spain, all of which were taken out of the part of Spain where Caballero is in control, and not a single one of which was taken out of the part of Spain where General Franco is in control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that that is evidence that the people living in that part of Spain that is under the Burgos Government, whether they agree with the political philosophy of General Franco or not, are at least living under a civilised Government and are not having to fly from the country.  This, I say, is proof that there is a true Government of Spain there, and not a foreign-controlled Government, and that is evidence that here you have not got the foreign arms and foreign control whereas, in the other part of the country, where there are foreign arms and foreign control, you have oppression, victimisation and persecution of the people, imprisonment and torture&mdash;all of which, I say, is indicative of a system representative of the Third Internationale of Moscow, and I say that it is the Third Internationale that is sending in these arms and help to a man who would not last three weeks without that help.  That is why we are in favour of non-intervention. That is why we are prepared to give the Minister the moneys that he wants to supervise shipments going into Spain, not to protect the Spanish people from any arms going into Franco but because we believe that this trouble would not have occurred if there had not been going on for years the importation of arms and ammunition in vast quantities from Moscow.  Stop that and the problem of non-intervention will be solved.  You will need neither a ship nor an inspector to enforce non-intervention. The Spanish people will settle it for themselves.  Until you stop the intervention of Moscow in Spain, measures of this kind will be necessary, <Col N="683" /> and unless it is stopped, a day will dawn when Moscow will manifest itself not alone in Spain but in France and Germany, in Belgium, Great Britain and in Ireland.  I want you to nip that in the bud now by throttling Moscow at the gates of Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I want to call attention to another point.  I think this House is entitled, before agreeing to this Vote, to discuss whether certain of the non-intervention proposals are advisable in view of what is happening in Spain. If, as I suggested this morning, well-informed observers of the situation in Spain have recently pointed out that the position in Spain, subsequent to the 1st January, was that the Caballero Government was carrying on with greater Spanish support and less foreign support, and that Franco was carrying on with diminishing Spanish support and increasing foreign support, this House is entitled to consider whether, even with a view to preventing a European war, it is going to continue the non-intervention policy and to spend money on the carrying out of it.  What the Minister might have to say in reply to the point I raised on that matter, might entail some further remarks on the position in Spain, because if the position in Spain to-day is that the Caballero Government is dominating the situation and is tending, as that statement would appear to show, to overcome the Franco Government and the Franco forces, then, when you have such countries in the world as Italy and Germany, who are looking so much for fight, many of us would prefer to see them exercising their predilections in that respect in preventing the development of a Communist Government in Spain before Communism has finally rooted itself in Spain.  In that way they would save Europe from a situation that it would inevitably have to face later on after a Communist Government had established itself in Spain.  The voting of money in this way may be a very simple matter.  We, no doubt, could not do very much to assist in a military way, much as we would like to defend Catholicism and <Col N="684" /> the Catholic Church in Spain; but if the situation is passing to the stage which I mentioned here, we ought to open our eyes here and the Minister could help us to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some information as to the manner in which this £8,000 is to be spent.  Of course, our worthy President is not here to tell us.  Possibly he thinks that the amount is so small that it is not worth his while to come here to tell the Irish people what he proposes to do with this £8,000.  Possibly I may not be so highly educated as the President, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the members of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Labour Party, or I may not know so much about the Internationale as these people, but still I should like to know what is going to happen this £8,000. Some of the questions I should like to put are: How many representatives will the Irish Free State have on the International Committee?  What are the qualifications for men who are to be appointed on the Committee? What will their salaries be?  Will it be necessary to have the same qualifications as are required for an appointment at home&mdash;a knowledge of Irish as well as a knowledge of Spanish?</P>
      <P>I am very interested in this matter, because it has been rumoured all over a certain county that there are certain aspirants for nomination in the coming election.  I have been told that one of these men, on condition that he does not go forward to make things awkward in a certain county, has been promised that he will get a job in a certain position.  I want to know whether part of this £8,000 is going to be used as a sort of hush-money on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in the coming election.  Is this a sort of subterfuge whereby these men will receive a cheque for a couple of hundred each as members of this committee in order to stifle their activities during the coming year?  That is quite on the cards and it has been reported freely all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be sorry to see any of this £8,000 expended in that direction, in view of the fact that we have so many men working only three days a week <Col N="685" /> and that the free beef scheme has been stopped.  I think that this £8,000 could be devoted to a better purpose than to stopping these men from making trouble during the coming election. Eight thousand pounds, after all, is not a very small amount.  Again, I should like to know whether the money will be paid by the International Committee or will be paid direct by the Free State Government. These are all important matters that I think should be made clear here before we vote this money.  The man primarily responsible for the Vote is not here.  Of course, he likes to keep in the background, to be the great be-all and end-all of everything. He has not the pluck to come here to let us know what he is going to do with this money, where it is going to be paid, whether the salaries attaching to membership of the International Committee will be paid by the International Committee itself or whether it will be paid by the Executive Council.  Of course, if it is paid by the Executive Council, we know that the appointments to these positions will be made on purely political grounds and that men will be appointed on the committee purely because of their political affiliations. That is quite on the cards at the present time but, possibly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not hear it.  That rumour has been all over the country, and I should like if the President were here to give a categorical denial to it and to say that the Government does not intend to make use of any part of the £8,000 to stifle the activities of certain persons or to prevent certain men going forward at the coming election.</P>
    <P>Again, as Deputy Dillon has stated, this question of non-intervention in Spain depends on whether that non-intervention will really be non-intervention. After all, this Estimate is the natural consequence of the introduction of the Act, and in discussing the Estimate we must more or less discuss the Act.  I do not intend to go into all the details, possibly I am not competent to go into them; but looking at it from the honest <Col N="686" /> point of view, I want to know whether any part of this £8,000 is going to be used for the purposes I have enumerated to-day.  I believe that the Executive Council, with all their boasting about being honest men, are not above silencing certain people, who are at the present time making trouble, by giving them jobs on this Non-Intervention Committee.  It is right for an honest man to speak out the sentiments of his mind.  I say that the report which is being spread over certain parts of this country is that men have already been promised jobs on this Non-Intervention Committee, and that part of this £8,000 will go to pay the salaries of those men.  I should like to know, if that is a fact, whether the salaries will be paid direct from the Executive Council or whether they will be paid through the International Committee, and what are to be the qualifications of those who will be appointed on that Committee.  All those are things which are important.  They may be small in the Minister's view.  They may be small in the President's view; they must be very small in his opinion in view of his absence from the House on this particular occasion, but it would be as well if the ordinary man in the street had that information.  I am one of those who want to know whether any part of this £8,000 is going to find its way into the channels which I have enumerated.  I should like the Minister to make that clear before this Vote is passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely a formal Estimate, and it is very difficult to see how it could have called forth such a flood of irrelevant oratory from Deputy Dillon.  This House has agreed to the policy of non-intervention in Spain.  I think that policy has had the support of all parties in the House.  Furthermore, the House has agreed to the scheme of observation on the Spanish frontier, and has passed legislation enabling the Saorstát <Col N="687" /> to conform to the requirements of that scheme.  The final step is the making of a contribution to the cost of this observation plan, a cost which is likely to be considerable, but towards which our contribution is very small.  I think that most of the discussion which we have had here to-day was entirely irrelevant, if one leaves aside for a moment the observations of Deputy Coburn.  Deputy Coburn has, at least, the distinction of making a relevant speech, if not the only relevant speech from his side of the House so far.  Deputy Dillon, of course, was so wide of the mark in most of his observations, and his conception of the position was obviously so divorced from the facts, that it is very difficult to reply to anything he said, if, in fact, what he said calls for a reply at all.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that there is no proposal at present for the actual control of the shipment of arms or the sending of volunteers into Spain from other countries.  The Non-Intervention Committee was established when agreement was secured amongst the countries which are a party to it&mdash;the countries of Europe in favour of the policy of non-intervention.  The negotiation and the conclusion of that agreement was a considerable achievement, and a matter of considerable importance to the peace of Europe, but it is quite obvious that the agreement is of no value unless the parties to it intend to observe it.  The various observations of Deputies opposite as to the possible bad faith of some of those parties were on that account beside the point.  Every international agreement has no validity except in so far as the parties intend to keep it, and this agreement is no different to any other in that regard.  There were allegations that the agreement was not being kept, allegations which, to the minds of some people, appeared to be giving justification for the scrapping of the agreement and the resumption of intervention, with the danger to the peace of Europe involved therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of those allegations, and in order to ensure that there would be complete and proper observation of <Col N="688" /> all traffic into Spain, this scheme of observation, this scheme for the appointment of supervisors for the patrolling of the coast and the supervision of the land frontiers, was adopted.  All the countries have agreed to this scheme of observation, and the necessary steps are being taken to bring it into existence.  We are making a contribution to the cost of it, and that is the sole purpose of this Estimate.  Deputy Mulcahy wants to know what the effect of the policy of non-intervention has been upon the military situation in Spain.  My opinion in that matter would be of no value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not even asked that.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are those serious reports, and I have asked him if he will let us have some information on the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

In view of the very emphatic opinion&mdash;no doubt expert&mdash;expressed by Deputy Dillon here to-day, I am surprised that Deputy Mulcahy should still be seeking additional information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one matter to the Minister as he is on the point.  We are spending money on a non-intervention policy. What would be regarded as very authoritative opinion has quite recently stated what I have stated here.  The <Col N="689" /> Minister, no doubt, through his Government sources and the international exchanges between himself and the British Government and others, has information as to what is the internal situation in Spain, and he surely has the responsibility of giving the House some information which would either confirm or deny statements of the kind that I made, because if the circumstances there are as stated, it would have a bearing on the question as to whether we should be a party to a non-intervention policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that his question has a bearing on whether or not we should be parties to a non-intervention policy, but the Ceann Comhairle has made it quite clear that that question does not arise on this Vote, and would be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would submit that the question arises as to whether people who voted for legislation approving of a non-intervention policy, would &mdash;now that time has passed and more important and very different information has been placed before us as to the circumstances there&mdash;agree to voting the necessary money to implement it.  Surely this House is entitled to change its mind on a particular policy, and particularly to change its mind by refusing on one particular date to pass money to implement a measure which it passed on a previous date, and in respect of which it had got no information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is quite entitled to change its mind, but there is a legal and ordinary way of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is a more legal and ordinary way than by taking the earliest opportunity and by voting against the granting of the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of policy does not arise on a Supplementary Estimate, and the advisability of repealing or continuing legislation cannot be discussed in relation to it either.  Deputy Mulcahy, of course, knows that quite well, but he is just taking advantage of the introduction <Col N="690" /> of this Estimate on a Friday morning to make a number of irrelevant observations which he thinks are going to get publicity in the evening papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there is an orderly way of doing it. This is the only means we have of getting a decision taken on the non-intervention policy.  There is no other way of raising it in this House without the permission of the Government. We could not effectively do it on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, because there is no money in that Estimate for this purpose. This is the time and the place to do it, when the Dáil is being asked to vote money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into a discussion with the Deputy on his point of order.  On the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, the external affairs policy of this country can be discussed in an orderly way.  It cannot be discussed on a Supplementary Estimate.  This is a merely formal step arising inevitably out of decisions already taken by the House on the policy of non-intervention. The absence of the President was commented upon by Deputy O'Sullivan, who said that it was due to the fact that the President regarded any discussion in this House as a waste of time.  There is, in my opinion, no more fanatical democrat in this country than the present President of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the essence of democracy is this, that any representative of the people has the right to talk any nonsense he likes in this House, so that I can assure Deputy Dillon, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan that if ever their right to talk nonsense here is challenged they will have no more vehement defender of that right than President de Valera.  In answer to Deputy Coburn's point, this money is going as a contribution to the International Committee under the agreement regarding non-intervention in Spain.  So far, the members of <Col N="691" /> the committee have given no indication of any interest in the impending general election here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has stated that I was the only member of the House who made a relevant contribution to this debate, I would be glad to have a reply from him to the questions I put.  I think that as a member of the House I am entitled to get the information I have asked for.  We have been asked to vote this money and surely we ought to know where it is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing set out but the £8,000.  How many representatives are we going to have on the committee?  The Minister did not tell us anything about their qualifications. Who is going to appoint them?  Will their appointment be subject to ratification by the members of the International Committee, or are they going to be appointed by the members of the Executive Council in Dublin.  I think the Minister should be obliged to me for speaking out.  I much prefer to speak out my mind in this House rather than keep things secret for the platform at the general election.  I am not one of those who wants to make political capital out of this.  But I think that before we vote £8,000 we ought to know where it is going. Again, I say that the Minister admitted that I had made a relevant contribution to the debate.  I was meticulous in keeping within the terms of the Estimate.  Will the Minister give a definite reply to my questions: How many representatives are we going to have on the committee, who is going to appoint them and what qualifications are they expected to have? Will a knowledge of Spanish be a necessary qualification just as knowledge <Col N="692" /> of Irish is to enable one to get a job from the Government in this country? It does not much matter, of course, what one's other qualifications are so long as one has a knowledge of Irish. There is not much use in sending a representative to Spain if he does not know the language.  He will not be of much use on a committee, and, consequently, may have to spend his time roaming over the mountains and along the rivers.</P>

      <P>The whole of the money is going to the International Committee. The Irish Free State is not represented on that committee.  The board of control which will appoint supervisors will determine the conditions of employment and the rates of remuneration for the supervisors.  I stated, when introducing the Estimate, that in consequence of our contribution some ten or 11 persons of Irish nationality were likely to be appointed by the board.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had stated at the outset that these people were to be recommended by the Executive Council it would have finished the thing.  I raised the matter because of rumours that were going about to the effect that certain men are going to get a job on this committee.  It is said that they are giving trouble within the ranks of certain Fianna Fáil cumainn throughout the country, but that they are now prepared to stand down on the condition of getting a few hundred pounds out of this £8,000 of the people's money in the way of jobs on the committee.  That is how some of this £8,000 is going to be spent, to make things easy for Fianna Fáil at the next general election.</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was discussing the necessity for the secrecy in which minor relief schemes were being shrouded by the Office of Public Works, and whether such secrecy was desirable. I was indicating that we had been invited by the Parliamentary Secretary to submit schemes which we considered of a useful character to enable his Department to give all possible relief under this Vote.  I was wondering, and am still wondering, why it should be found necessary for the Department to shroud the schemes in secrecy even when these schemes had been definitely determined upon and sent out to the different county surveyors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should they not be available to Deputies?  I am not so guileless as to believe that all Deputies are kept in ignorance of these schemes.  In fact, I have reason to believe that certain Deputies have been made aware of the schemes which have been adopted.  I want to hear if that is so, because I contend that all Deputies should be treated similarly in having made available <Col N="695" /> to them what schemes have been adopted for a particular programme, what schemes have been deferred for further consideration, and what schemes have been rejected.  I think that would be only reasonable and fair to Deputies, no matter what Party they belong to, who are trying to get works done in various areas and it would avoid a good deal of correspondence between Deputies and the Department.  If we were made aware of the programme which had been adopted for a particular season we could then bend our energies to having the rejected ones considered for the following season.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my views and, perhaps, my speech has been more or less in the nature of a general complaint. I want again to reiterate that the Vote is supposed to serve two purposes: relief of unemployment and the carrying out of useful schemes of work for the improvement of local amenities. I am not unmindful of the good work that has been done under the Vote, but I am suggesting that it has not succeeded to anything like the extent which is possible with the same amount of money if the rotational scheme had not been introduced.  I put the first item first and that is the relief of unemployment.  As to that I say that the schemes are a ghastly failure as far as they go because the money paid to the recipients has not given any reasonable relief in the homes of the workers participating.  They were not provided with the necessary means for maintaining their homes in any kind of decency or frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>The fact of spreading a certain amount of money over an unnecessarily large number is not a sufficient justification; it is, I suggest, an abuse of the main and real purpose of the relief schemes.  They ought to be relief schemes in the true sense of the word. I have stated already that that is done for the purpose of saving the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  I repeat that and I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he has only a certain amount of money to disburse upon relief schemes it would be much better to give reasonable earnings to a reasonable number of people over the period <Col N="696" /> which can be covered rather than to spread it over a much larger number than it is capable of supporting in reasonable or frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>I gave an instance last night of a man who was alleged to be getting relief under these schemes and whose earnings approximated to 6/- a week ever a stated period, out of which he has to maintain his wife and seven children.  I do not think I could stress that too much.  Perhaps that is not a typical case, but it is by no means an unique case.  If that is so, I think it calls for close consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary to see if such hardships are being inflicted, because as long as that man was called to that work he must go there.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary maintains that it was marvellous that the thing had worked out so successfully and that the maximum results had been achieved.  I contend that a much better result in the actual achievement of work could have been got without the rotational scheme.  I am not complaining of the type of work done, but I am contending that more of that kind of work could be done with the same outlay by having men working for longer periods than two or three or four days per week.  In addition, I suggest that it is unreasonable to ask us to believe that men of all types, who are forced into these schemes without any question as to suitability for the work, can give a proper return to the people in charge. I have in mind the case of coach painters, who are not used to handling anything heavier than a lining brush, being forced into these schemes.  I know of one such man, highly skilled in his craft, who was forced to make concrete footpaths, and if he did not accept the work he would lose his benefit at the exchange.  I met a shoemaker last night who was disallowed benefit for refusing to work in a quarry.  That man never worked with anything heavier that a wax-end and he was supposed to work in a quarry with a crowbar.  Yet we are asked to believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is getting results from the flotsam and jetsam of suitable and <Col N="697" /> unsuitable types of people, over broken periods, which can compare favourably with that of men fitted for the work, working over a normal period from end to end of a job.  I do not think that squares with common sense.</P>
    <P>I further suggest that a distance limit should be fixed over which men should not be asked to travel to work. It is unreasonable to expect that a man can travel six, seven, or eight miles to and from his work.  I do not know personally of any case in which a man was asked to travel further than that to this work, but I am told that there are cases in other counties where men have to travel longer distances.  But I can speak from personal knowledge of men being asked to go seven miles.</P>
    <P>I heard of a case a fortnight ago of nine men being struck off benefit because they refused to travel six miles each way to their work, or 12 in all.  How these men could be expected to perform an average day's work after travelling that distance passes my comprehension.  I say it is manifestly unfair.  If schemes were put into operation within a reasonable distance outside which men should not be supposed to travel, there would be some reason for pointing to them as evidence of the success of the schemes and of the willingness of the workers. If those objectionable features were done away with, the schemes would work out more satisfactorily and be of some assistance in the homes they are supposed to relieve, as well as giving a much better return to the taxpayer, whose money is being expended on these works throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to commence what I have to say to-day by taking the opportunity of repeating a tribute I have paid on previous occasions to the Board of Works.  I think the machinery for allocating these relief works, the way they are allocated in rural areas, and the promptitude in which any reasonable proposal put up is fairly examined, reflects immense credit on the administration of the Board of Works.  Anyone who inspects the maps that have been prepared, and that are to be found in the <Col N="698" /> Library, showing the distribution of the works which the board has put through its hands during the past year, will see that it is a model of administration.  I take this particular occasion for saying, as one who has to do a good deal with Government Departments, that the application form devised by the Board of Works on which to make submissions for minor relief grants is an admirable and a skilfully drawn document, and immensely facilitates the task of those who find it their duty to bring under the board's attention works that require to be done.  It is a good thing, when one has an opportunity of complimenting a Minister for whose political judgment one has no regard, that I should take it to congratulate him; as in the distribution of grants of this kind nothing is more important than the impartiality and detachment which is a general rule now and which should be maintained no matter what Government is in office.  It is a pleasure to me to find the Parliamentary Secretary and myself in agreement about that, and it makes it all the more painful that I have to direct the attention of the House to what is, in my judgment, a mean and contemptible departure from that spirit.  All Deputies, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Independents, have to the best of their ability directed the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to schemes that might possibly be undertaken.  At the foot of the form to which I have referred there are three possible kinds of recommendations mentioned&mdash;ordinary recommending, recommending for special consideration, and recommending very strongly.  Many of us, when we weigh up the various recommendations, do, I think, carefully indicate our choice of them, and, as a result of that, work has been greatly helped.  I understand that within the last week every Fianna Fáil T.D. in this House was given a list of minor relief schemes that either had been carried out or were scheduled to be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To my recollection no document was circulated giving a list of works.  If the Deputy will give way, I want to repeat what he said, that it is of the highest possible importance that there should be complete understanding and acceptance by the whole House that the impartiality and fairness of the administration of these things should be maintained as anything that would affect it would, in my opinion, be deplorable.  The fact that that spirit has been there for a period of years is the best proof that no departure from that will take place.  No list of schemes, as far as I know, was given out.  What happened was this, as I told the House last night: we have done some 9,000 or 10,000 minor relief schemes, and on four or five occasions I appealed to the House to come to my aid and to give me schemes.  I am running out of schemes.  I have used every possible human effort to get in schemes.  I am entitled to go to members of my own Party and to put upon them a definite obligation to help me in the matter, and I have sent out to them a list saying that I wanted schemes for next year.  I am short of schemes.  They will be treated only on their merits, but let me have them. That is what is happening.  That intimation and invitation I give to the whole House.  There was a time when the getting of schemes by Deputies was something for which Deputies felt they owed gratitude towards someone. There was some kudos in getting schemes.  Now the whole position has been altered.  In the Department we are more grateful to Deputies who put forward good schemes than they can be to us.  We are anxious that they should do so.  My reason for intervening is because I value as the highest possible asset to this organisation the attitude of confidence in its impartiality which has been built up, and it is to remove any impression of any sort, accidental or otherwise, that might be there to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I frankly confess my experience of the impartiality of the <Col N="700" /> Board of Works.  If for no other reason I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement at its face value. As the Parliamentary Secretary says, he is quite entitled to take up the attitude that he is a member of Fianna Fáil and that he does not make any bones about it if he looks for help to the majority Party.  He is entitled to do that, but if he holds himself out as an impartial Parliamentary Secretary to Dáil Eireann if he desires absolute understanding he should not circularise only the members of Fianna Fáil but rather seek help and guidance from all sides.  It is certainly calculated to cause the greatest possible misunderstanding on the eve of a general election if a requisition is sent to Fianna Fáil T.D.s to send him their schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary, if he was merely looking for help would, I think, have served the purpose better if he had postponed the gesture which was made only a week ago until the Estimate had been introduced. He could have warned all T.D.s who were prepared to make representations that they would be favourably considered, and that he hoped to have funds to finance reasonable requests.  I do not believe in kicking up rows where they are not justified.  I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  I think it would be helpful, in view of the reiterated determination to act in this matter as the servant of Dáil Eireann, if he sent copies of that invitation to other Deputies, directing their attention to the areas which required special co-operation.  If he wants that cooperation, one Deputy can help as much as another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An immensely grave matter has arisen in connection with the administration of the Public Works Department. Part of the funds which financed these works was estimated for by the Minister for Finance on foot of savings from the Unemployment Assistance Fund, inasmuch as they proposed to take a number of people off that fund by giving them work out of the schemes.  It is only a small part of the total sum&mdash;about one-eighth. About one-fourth of the total sum has to be provided out of local funds and the rest of the money has to come <Col N="701" /> from other sources but, on the strength of the estimated saving to the Unemployment Assistance Fund an administrative regulation was made that nobody would get work on relief schemes if he was not in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Any of us who know the congested areas and the livelihood of many people there realise that an immense number of small farmers find it very hard to make ends meet on their little holdings, and, while they can drag along on their holdings, and while they will be adjudged by the inspectors to have more means than would leave them eligible for an unemployment assistance certificate, at the same time, if they could get a little job of work now and again under these public works schemes, they would have a few pence to provide what for them is luxury, but what, in fact, is no more than the minimum standard of life which they ought to enjoy.  There are a number of these men who are public spirited men and who have a kind of pride which I think is admirable. They will not make a poor mouth and they have a conscientious feeling that if they are able to carry on their little holdings, they have no right to seek unemployment assistance.  They may be a minority, and I must say frankly that the majority of small farmers, if they can pull the wool over the inspector's eyes, will get their unemployment assistance certificate and draw their 1/- or 2/- or whatever their means allow them.  That is plain fact and we all know it.  My own neighbours know it and know that the vast majority of fellows think that when there is money going, they ought to get a share of it.  It is unquestionably the position that they feel that if they are charged with having means, they are entitled to plead not guilty and that it is up to the Government to prove that they have.  That is their view.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable body of small farmers who have that kind of tradition, that they never were on relief, that they always earned their money and paid for their own family, and they do not apply.  They simply say: &ldquo;We are going to carry on.&rdquo; What happens?  They see the fellows on Tuesday or Friday or whatever day <Col N="702" /> it is queueing up for the dole and for free beef, and they say: &ldquo;Well, we do not want that yet; we will carry on,&rdquo; and they forbear to claim.  Relief works start in the neighbourhood and they go out with their shovel, or whatever implement they are in the habit of bringing, and ask the ganger for a job.  That is working and earning, and they are proud to do that, but the ganger tells them they cannot get work because only men from the labour exchange are taken on.  They go home and the wife says to them: &ldquo;Did you get work?&rdquo;  At first, they said &ldquo;No, we did not, because it is all Fianna Fáil people are getting it.&rdquo;  That was their first reaction, but after a while, when the truth seeped out to the country, they said &ldquo;No, because we are not on the dole,&rdquo; and the wife said: &ldquo;Will you not get it if you are not on the dole?&rdquo; and they replied: &ldquo;No, nobody but men on the dole will get it.&rdquo;  The wife is bound, and you cannot blame her, to say &ldquo;Well, you had better get on the dole.  If it is going to mean that you cannot earn a few shillings, you had better go on the dole.&rdquo;  That man, who, from the highest motives and in a good sound civic spirit, declined up to this to make any attempt to get something he felt he could do without, is driven to going on the dole.</P>
    <P>I will give the Parliamentary Secretary a concrete instance of that.  It is not exactly the same, but he will readily see the analogy.  A scheme of works scheduled for a parish in Roscommon came to my notice.  It became known to the Parliamentary Secretary that there were not enough people on unemployment assistance in that parish to justify the initiation of the scheme, but there were a very large number of small farmers who could very well do with a bit of work on the roads.</P>

      <P>What happened?  A responsible person in the parish&mdash;I do not care to go further than that&mdash; summoned the men together and said, &ldquo;You had better all get on the dole. There is no use standing on your dignity in this matter, because you will get no relief works in the parish at all.&rdquo;  The fellows all went out and got on the dole, and they had been getting on without it before that.  If a body of decent, respectable fellows are called together and told, &ldquo;You will get no work unless the whole parish goes on the dole,&rdquo; it is to reduce the thing to absurdity.</P>
      <P>Let us not overstate a case, because I see the immense difficulty of this problem.  The object of the Department is to orient the works where the employment is worst, and, naturally, one is inclined to say, &ldquo;If you are going to put it into areas where the employment is worst, it is the unemployed in that area who ought to get first preference.&rdquo;  But it is there that there is the flaw in the logical conclusion, because the modern definition of an unemployed person receiving unemployment assistance really does not constitute an exhaustive category. There are a very large number of his neighbours who are just as much entitled to the help these unemployment assistance schemes are designed to provide as the people actually on the dole.  I quite appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary cannot abandon the general indication which the unemployment roll provides for him in allocating the work, but I do think that, having used the indication for the purpose of allocating the work, he ought to relax the proviso.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy allow me?  I have a good deal of sympathy with that view.  It is one which is commonly expressed, and, I think, very sincerely held.  There is a small proportion of people who are not on the unemployment assistance register. There are 287,000 people, as a matter of fact, who have unemployment register qualifications, so that it is not a small and segregated body.  What I am concerned with is, whether the Deputy or anybody else can give me a practical means of ascertaining who <Col N="704" /> those are, how I would recruit them, and how I would discriminate between them.  It is a matter of practical machinery.  It has been put up to me by two councils&mdash;I think Mayo and Roscommon&mdash;who want to employ non-unemployment assistance men, and what I am asking anybody who believes that there are a body of unemployment assistance men, of poor men, entitled men, who are not on the register, is to give me a practical means of identifying those and dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will readily understand that a suggestion thrown out when I am on my feet might, on examination, prove to be impracticable, but for what it is worth, I will make this suggestion. The first step towards remedying it might be to provide that, in addition to the unemployment assistance men, married men on holdings under £6 valuation would get it.  I could not say finally in regard to this until I have examined the question more closely as to whether you should go to £8, but I think you might safely do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of the Deputy being able to formulate a suggestion, I am prepared to put at the disposal of himself or his Party a map which gives the average agricultural valuation of every electoral area in the Free State.  I should be very glad to see them attempt to co-ordinate the results we are now getting from the unemployment assistance map and the valuation map, and to see if they can make a suggestion.  I am meeting this in this spirit because I think the discussion is going along the kind of lines on which useful work can be done, and I am anxious to find co-operation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that this must be an empirical procedure.  We cannot lay down binding principles.  We can only grope along to a solution of the problem by the excellent liberal tradition of peace, retrenchment and reform, reforming each evil as it manifests itself and hoping that eventually we will reach Utopia in that way, and not getting a rigid principle and following it.  Therefore, I am in favour of the <Col N="705" /> somewhat illogical plan of orienting the works first in the way the Parliamentary Secretary is doing, on the basis of the unemployment assistance register; then, having fixed where they are to take place, to say: &ldquo;Now you can employ on those schemes not only unemployment assistance register men, but, in addition, married men whose holdings are less than a certain valuation.&rdquo; Logically, you cannot defend that because, if you take the unemployment assistance register and the men coming within that category for the purpose of the orientation of the schemes, the orientation might be very different and far more widespread.  I think that you might stop there and see how they got along.  Later, you might, for the purpose of orientating the schemes, say: &ldquo;We are going to take into consideration all the married men living on small holdings in that area.&rdquo;  That would present immense administrative difficulties in Dublin, but it would not do so in the rural areas where the work was actually being done.  You could devise a plan, in collaboration with the county surveyor, to ensure that only married men with holdings under a certain valuation would be admitted for employment, because the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the personal acquaintance of county engineering officials with the people of their district is quite astonishing.</P>

      <P>The assistant engineers know the family circumstances of practically every man who habitually applies for road work.  I now depart from that general question and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary realises how urgent and difficult it is. I have mentioned on four successive Estimates of the Parliamentary Secretary a plan which, I think, is one of the most hopeful for the allocation of small sums of money under these schemes.  That is, a plan whereby farmers living on small holdings would be permitted to open flagged drains on their own land and, where the levels and the size of the drains corresponded with the minimum requirements of efficiency laid down by the local agricultural inspector, the Board of Works <Col N="706" /> would give these people a grant of so much per yard of drain.  That scheme has this dual advantage&mdash;it removes all necessity for a taskmaster because every farmer becomes his own taskmaster. The more quickly he digs the drain the more money he gets.  If he digs 100 yards of drain in two days and gets <i>x</i> per yard he will receive 100<i>x.</i>  If he takes a week to do it, he will only get 100<i>x</i> for the week. It is, therefore, in his interest to do the work as quickly and as industriously as he can.  In the second place, no matter into whose hands that land may come, it will remain a national asset.  The man who has drained it has improved it for all time.  The productive capacity of the land is increased and, when you put together the small increases in productivity that could be created on thousands of small holdings in this country, you get a very substantial addition to the national wealth.  I do not want to labour that point because I have dealt with it already on more than one occasion.</P>
      <P>I notice that on the map this year there are more allocations of substantial sums than I have ever seen before &mdash;£2,000, £1,000 and so forth for particular works.  That can be amply justified if the schemes are of a peculiarly useful nature.  It is rather a relief to the people to see some permanent mark being left after an employment scheme.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us, generally, some kind of headline of the circumstances under which he would be prepared to accept a suggestion on these lines.  In the early stages, we remember that if he desired to spend more than a certain sum on a special work he had to apply to the Executive Council for special authority.</P>

      <P>I remember an occasion in the early stages of these schemes when the Parliamentary Secretary was asked to spend £500 or £1,000 on making a breakwater in the neighbourhood of Burtonport.  The scheme impressed him very favourably&mdash;so much so that he said he would go to the Executive Council and ask special <Col N="707" /> sanction to spend more than he had discretion to spend on any given scheme.  Has he now full discretion?</P>

      <P>That would be where a grant would not be justifiable either in respect of the labour-content of the work or the poverty-factor of the district. There is a small fund for works of national development out of which we might take the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been the case.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will find that people are deterred from putting certain schemes before him because they feel that if they are going to cost £2,000 or £3,000 they could not be described as minor relief schemes.  If he would lay down a general headline&mdash;not a binding rule &mdash;for the guidance of the people and say, &ldquo;If your scheme falls within that general framework do not be afraid to put it forward; we will be able to spend money on it,&rdquo; it would be useful.  He could add that there might be further exceptional cases in which they would be glad to spend larger sums but, as a general rule, that was the kind of case which would be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall end in the traditional manner on this Vote.  I often regret that the good old style of getting up and speaking about your own parish pump is beginning to fade away on this Vote. There was a time when we could spend two or three days discussing the parish pump and awkward corners in our own particular neighbourhood. Nobody seems to have the courage to do so now.  Being somewhat of a conservative in these matters, I shall return to the happy practice and mention one scheme which was not brought under the Parliamentary Secretary's notice because it was felt it would cost £2,000 to carry to completion. I do not think it would.  At a recent meeting of Roscommon County Council, representations were made on behalf of a number of people who are cut off from their market town and all contact with the outside world by a lake.  There is a narrow portion of the lake and if a causeway or bridge could be built across it, these <Col N="708" /> people's journeys to town and church would be shortened by about five miles.  It has come up for years as a supplementary work when the county council estimates came to be struck. Every year, it has been wiped off as involving too much expenditure for a supplementary work.  Money has never been found for it, and it has now become one of the hardy annuals which cause an immense amount of local irritation.  I am sorry Deputy Brennan does not happen to be in the House, as he could give the name of the scheme, but I shall send particulars to the Parliamentary Secretary. I can tell him that all Parties in the council would like to see this work done.  It is quite likely that he will be approached by a deputation from all Parties but, lest other matters might make it impossible for them to approach him as early as they might wish, I direct his attention to the matter.  The position is somewhere about Roscommon town.</P>

      <P>I shall arrange for a joint letter, giving particulars of the scheme, to be sent to the Parliamentary Secretary.  To tell the truth, I have never seen the place and I do not know much about the people.  I have, however, heard so much about it that I know it is becoming a source of chronic irritation to the people in that area and it is one of these things which minor relief schemes are peculiarly suited to end, because I am afraid it could not be defended on purely economic grounds.  The number of families to be accommodated would not be, perhaps, more than 20, but it would be of immense relief to those in the neighbourhood if this general wail from that part of the country was silenced once and for all.</P>

      <P>After the gentle purring of Deputy Dillon and the cooing of the Parliamentary Secretary, I wonder if I shall be entitled to a growl or two.  I want to say, at the outset, that with the administration of the Department of Public Works I have no fault to find.  I believe it is efficient <Col N="709" /> and that it is fair.  The Parliamentary Secretary treated us last night to a very careful and very useful statement. It was an exposition and defence of his system and his method of experimenting upon the workless under the employment relief grants. He told us how this machine synchronised at every stage, how we have perfect synchronisation between peak distress and peak supply.  That would be all very interesting in some kind of academic discussion&mdash;the discussion of a literary and historical society of some kind&mdash;but it falls far short of what we expected from the Parliamentary Secretary on this Vote.  Some points spring immediately to the mind in connection with these schemes. First of all, I noticed that more than half of this Vote is re-voted.  That is to say, that what we voted last year was not spent and it is being re-voted this year.  How much of this £1,500,000 that is being voted now is going to be spent this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the whole of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot open up the books of the Parliamentary Secretary, but I imagine that if I were to put to him last year the question I have now put he would have told me the same thing.  Yet something over £400,000 was unexpended out of last year's Vote.  The first thing that naturally occurs to one's mind is whether the Parliamentary Secretary considers anything in connection with these schemes except the economic factor. I heard a lot of excellent terms used by the Parliamentary Secretary in describing certain phenomena in connection with employment schemes.  He used the terms &ldquo;labour content&rdquo; and he said something about poverty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Poverty content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;poverty content.&rdquo; These excellent terms were used by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has no copyright in them, and I expect the terms will be used later. But he does not take any account of the humanity content of some of these <Col N="710" /> jobs.  Does he take any account of the necessity of keeping people alive, of keeping them fed and clothed?  Is that humanity content ever taken into account when a scheme is rejected on account of the labour factor?  Take the wages paid.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that the wages paid on these schemes are sufficient to maintain anybody in any sort of frugal comfort?  Has he endeavoured to relate the wages paid to the cost of living?  Has he endeavoured to relate the wages paid on these schemes to the wages paid by agriculturists in the districts where the schemes are operated?  He may say he has, but I know cases where the wages paid on these schemes bear no relation to the wages paid either by the public bodies in the county or the agriculturists in the county.  The wages on these schemes should bear a very close relation to the wages paid by the public bodies and to the wages paid by the agricultural community. Indeed it should bear a closer relation to the wages paid by the public bodies than to the wages paid in agriculture, which, as the Parliamentary Secretary himself will have to admit, is a depressed industry at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rotational system has been discussed here, and Deputy Keyes met the case made in favour of that scheme very fully and adequately last night. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the workers were overjoyed at the introduction of the rotational system. He said they were in ecstasies over it. I know that in one case where this scheme was introduced the workers got three days' work; they had to wait three weeks for the money they earned in that work, and they had to wait a fortnight to be reinstated at the employment exchange.  Therefore, it is clear that these people would be much better off if they had not got that work at all.  I know that; possibly that happened in the initiation of the scheme.  I am prepared to admit that.  The Parliamentary Secretary had not the machinery to carry out the scheme effectively at that time. But what is the general opinion with regard to the rotational scheme?  He says that the people are satisfied with it and that it was a very effective <Col N="711" /> system.  Now, the Clare County Council is not a revolutionary body. It is composed in the main of representatives of the agricultural community. The Parliamentary Secretary's own Party has a majority on that council.  Yet it passed a resolution unanimously condemning the rotational system, because, in the first place, it is not fair to the workers concerned, and, secondly, it does not give the best results so far as the work is concerned.  After three days you put off a man who may be a man who is useful and expert in the matter of quarrying.  You put him off and you have to take in somebody who is of little value as a quarryman; you may have to take in a man who may be quite useless as a quarryman and you turn the expert man away.  That matter was discussed at the Clare County Council, and a resolution was unanimously carried condemning the rotational system.  There are only three Labour representatives on the council, and it is a council that has a majority of Fianna Fáil representatives. That council decided that the system was bad in principle and bad in its results.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in reference to rotational work in connection with which I would like to see present the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am aware that the Conditions of Employment Act is being infringed in a great many cases because of the operations of the rotational system.  I know of cases where despite the Act people have worked for 54 hours per week. Under the rotational system a man works three days one week of nine hours each, and he works the next week three days of nine hours each. That is to say, he puts in a 54 hour week instead of a 48 hour week.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see if something cannot be done to put a stop to that sort of thing.  The Minister will have from the Clare County Council a unanimous resolution on that matter also.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the area of employment&mdash;the electoral area.  I do not think that that works out as well as he imagines it does.  I have in mind several electoral <Col N="712" /> areas where there is rather extensive unemployment and no relief work.  He may not think there was sufficient unemployment in a particular area; or that in the area there are not any suitable schemes, although there may be extensive unemployment.  The Minister may think that in a particular electoral area there is not sufficient labour to make the scheme an economic proposition, but it may happen that you may have two or three other areas bordering on that area, and then you have labour that could be used.  Sometimes the Parliamentary Secretary may have no scheme that would be suitable in the electoral area where there is unemployment, but he may have a scheme available in a bordering area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy in that matter.  What we would do in such a case is, we would draw the unemployed from other areas. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind I would like to take it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few cases in mind, but I do not want to introduce them in detail now.  They have been brought to my notice, and they bear out exactly what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to bring me those cases.  What the Deputy is anxious to do is just what we are anxious to do in that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal point in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary was the abandonment of the idea of solving the unemployment problem.  He has clearly abandoned that idea.  He told us it would take some £15,000,000 to put all the unemployed working every day of the week, I do not know at what wages. However, I will take the Parliamentary Secretary's word that it would take £15,000,000.  He said that, of course, was a thing the State could not attempt to do.  Therefore the unemployed are to be left unemployed, and this Vote is not aiming to prevent unemployment; it is rather a Vote to perpetuate unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of the unemployed to-day?  We have 25,000 people, according to the statistics provided <Col N="713" /> by the Department, who are absolutely destitute, drawing full unemployment assistance.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not indicated in his statement to us what he proposes to do to afford employment to these people.  There are 25,000 people who, if they had any visible means of any kind, would not be drawing full unemployment assistance.  We then have 60,000 registered who have some means, and the Parliamentary Secretary has no solution for the problem that faces these people.  We do know that the Government has a policy of industrial revival.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that this policy of industrial revival is going to absorb these 25,000 people who are absolutely destitute at the moment, in a reasonable space of time?  Does he think that commerce or industry is likely to absorb the 60,000 registered who are in need of employment but have some means?  These are questions the Parliamentary Secretary ought to give us some light and leading on.  It is a problem that his Government promised to solve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary is not the only person unable to solve the unemployment problem.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were looking for a very bad headline he could find it given by a colleague of Deputy Dillon.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made a very good paraphrase of Deputy McGilligan's statement, that it was not the duty of the State to provide work for the unemployed.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has made a very good paraphrase of that when he says that the State cannot afford to spend £15,000,000 in order to afford work for the unemployed. That is his paraphrase of Deputy <Col N="714" /> McGilligan's general statement.  I want to know what the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to do within the coming 12 months with those 25,000 people who have absolutely no visible means.  Does he propose to give them work on only three days a week on a rotational system?  What about the 60,000 who have some means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are those the correct figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the total live register on the 30th March last there were 84,411 men and the total, including boys and girls, was 93,426.  Do not blame me if the figures are wrong; I did not prepare them.  The statement says that the number of persons with means registered on the 30th March was 42,401 and the total, including women, boys and girls, was 43,543. What I wanted from the Parliamentary Secretary was not a statement regarding the perfect synchronisation of his machine or the rather excellently worded peroration last night, but rather a statement as to how he proposes to cure the unemployment problem or whether he has totally abandoned the idea of solving that problem.</P>

      <P>In connection with the minor relief schemes, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that he need not entertain any anxiety in relation to the question of furnishing sufficient schemes to his Department. I am satisfied that a plentiful supply will be forthcoming.  Indeed, so far as the people I represent are concerned, we have schemes lodged for a considerable period.  In fact, some schemes have been lodged for three or four years, and we are becoming somewhat disheartened when we are asked to furnish new schemes and nothing has been done with the schemes we furnished a couple of years ago.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should devote some attention to the question of having those schemes taken in hands, because the people have been appealing for such schemes for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> While I make that point, I must compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department upon the administration of various relief schemes.  The money that has been expended in the county I come from has been devoted largely to repairing boreens and carrying out minor drainage works.  I must say that the work done has been of great value.  The labour content has been essentially high and the people who were assisted by these works are satisfied that the money could not be better spent. People who had to use the old boreens were paying rates for a considerable number of years, and although they were considered good ratepayers their interests were not seen to until the Parliamentary Secretary came to the <Col N="716" /> rescue.  They feel now that something has been done for them and that all the money is not being concentrated on the main highways.</P>
    <P>In connection with minor drainage work, I believe very valuable assistance has been rendered to people who heretofore have had their small holdings flooded, and indeed their houses flooded.  I witnessed several cases of very serious flooding in rural areas, flooding of small houses.  I have seen the minor drainage schemes put into operation, and I realise the wonderful benefit that has accrued to these people.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Committee to sit again on Wednesday, 14th April.</P>
