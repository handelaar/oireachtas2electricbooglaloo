      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether proposals have been submitted to him by the County Kilkenny Board of Public Health for the erection of a modern sanatorium in Kilkenny, and, if so, whether he has sanctioned these proposals and, if not, whether he is in a position to state when sanction will be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No detailed proposal for the erection of a modern sanatorium for Kilkenny has been received. Immediately after the passing of the Public Charitable Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1931, local authorities were invited to submit to this Department applications for any grants required from Sweepstake Funds for the purpose of establishing sanatoria or other institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis. Many such applications were received from local authorities in <Col N="1027" /> various parts of the country and allocations from the funds were made in aid of the establishment of such institutions. It was not, however, until May, 1934, that any proposal in regard to a grant for the establishment of a new sanatorium was received from the Kilkenny Board of Health and Public Assistance.  By that time the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, had been passed and the Hospitals Commission had been set up.  Part of the duty of the commission is to consider the whole question of the provision to be made for the treatment of tuberculosis and a preliminary report made by the commission on the subject is at present under consideration.  Until a decision in regard to this matter shall have been reached, it will not be possible to entertain any applications for grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund in respect of the cost of the establishment of new sanatoria in cases like Kilkenny where allocations from Sweepstakes Funds have not already been made.</P>

These sites were approved on the 22nd December last, and it is understood that the preparation of the proposed scheme is now in hands.</P>

If a <Col N="1033" /> dispensary doctor resides outside his district there must be special reasons for his doing so.  Otherwise the universal rule is that the dispensary doctor must reside in his district, but in certain exceptional circumstances, if a residence cannot be provided or if the district is a small one, and if the doctor is living in a convenient centre, he may be allowed to reside outside the district.

      <P>On the Committee Stage, Deputy Dillon raised the question of the possibility of interference with or an attachment of conditions to a grant by a State authority.  I do not think the Deputy was in the House&mdash;perhaps he was, but I do not recollect that he was here at the time&mdash;when I dealt with that point in answer to his question. There will be no interference from any State Department.  A grant under the Bill may be made by a local authority.  The State does not come into it, or the Department of Finance. I do not think it is likely the local authority will be interfered with.  In the case of the philanthropic society we have in mind, the one which Deputy Dillon and Deputy Doyle will have information about, I do not think there is any likelihood of that occurring. There is no specific provision in the Bill to prevent a local authority interfering in the management of the institution.  I think the particular local authority concerned, who have experience of the work done by this philanthropic society, will be very slow to interfere in its affairs in any way, unless to give them a little financial help from time to time, largely by way of extending the accommodation necessary or by way of providing additional furniture or equipment.  I think the Deputy may feel assured that there will be no interference in the excellent work that these charitably-disposed people are doing.</P>

      <P>I oppose the passing of this measure on three grounds. First, the Bill does not assert the authority of this House to legislate when it purports to legislate extra-territorially. Secondly, the Bill contains a series of contradictions. Thirdly, practically throughout the whole Bill it indicates ignorance on the part of the Department and the Minister of its contents.</P>
      <P>I submitted a series of amendments and the Chair gave some of them a sudden death.  I was particularly concerned about the definition section which, I think, strikes at the root of the whole Bill.  In that section we purport to legislate with regard to the exclusive fisheries of this State and then, under a section to which I will refer later, we purport to legislate extra-territorially.  I feel there is a contradiction there.  I submit that if we legislate territorially and define what are territorial waters, it is illogical to proceed then to legislate extra-territorially.  I submit there is a contradiction there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and myself have endeavoured to get some indication from the Minister of the contents of this Bill, the main contents.  On the Second Reading the Minister admitted he did not know what were the objects of the Bill, what they meant.  I take it then the officers of the Department do not know and that those who drafted the Bill do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked through the Statutes since this State was created and there is no declaratory statement anywhere as to what are the territorial waters of the State.  There is this ambiguous thing:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The exclusive fisheries limit of Saorstát Eireann means the portion <Col N="1040" /> of the seas within which citizens of Saorstát Eireann have, by international law, the exclusive right of fishing and where such portion is defined by the terms of any convention, treaty or arrangement for the time being in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You ruled, Sir, that a declaratory amendment of mine was not in order on the ground that this was an international convention and we have either to accept or reject it.  Having got that ruling, I was bound by it, but while accepting it, I proceeded to do some research work and I found in the English Statute in which this convention was implemented a declaratory definition something on the lines of what I purported to put into this Bill.  Clause 17 of the Whaling Industry (Regulation) Act, 1934, 24 and 25 George V, Chapter 49, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this Act the following expressions have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(c) India:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;coastal waters&rsquo; means, in relation to any country or territory, waters within a distance of three nautical miles from any point on the coast or any part of that country or territory, as the case may be, measured from low water mark of ordinary spring tides.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not here when Deputy Dillon, apparently, was ruled out of order on the amendment I put in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy endeavouring to bring it into order now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  The purpose of the amendment was to raise a particular question.  That inference can be drawn from it, but really what I had in mind is what I have discovered in that clause, namely, to get a declaratory statement as to what are the exclusive fisheries of citizens of this State.  It is rather contradictory, I think, to refuse to do that and then to impose on our inspectors and citizens the <Col N="1041" /> task of discharging duties outside the exclusive fisheries when we do not know, and the fisheries inspectors do not know, and the fishermen do not know, what are the specific exclusive fisheries of this State.  We endeavoured to get from the Minister some idea as to what was meant by the contents of Section 4 of this Bill and also the Schedules.  Really, I think that it is sheer waste to go to the expense of printing and publishing this Bill and occupying the House with it in the face of its contents, because the House and the Minister do not know what they mean.  The Minister told us on the Second Reading that the expressions used were seamen's terms.  I submit that they are not seamen's terms.  They may be whale-fishermen's terms, but not seamen's terms.</P>
      <P>I should like to know how the Minister is going to ask an inspector to prosecute somebody for having killed a whale as defined in Section 4 (3) (c): &ldquo;A female whale which is accompanied by a calf or suckling whale.&rdquo;  The House can imagine an inspector, who has had no experience of the sea beyond that of a trip to the Isle of Man, being asked to prosecute some citizen for having killed &ldquo;a female whale which is accompanied by a calf or suckling whale.&rdquo;  I think there is no citizen who, if he saw a whale of any kind or anything of the proportions of a whale, would not clear away as quickly as he could to the mainland, and who would not look to see whether it was accompanied by a calf or otherwise.  And this Bill is going to be very rigidly enforced!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 is highly amusing.  Sub-section (1) states: &ldquo;There shall be kept at or in every factory licensed under this Act a record, in such form as the Minister may require, of (a) the date and place of capture, the species, sex and length measured in the prescribed manner of each whale treated at such factory...&rdquo;  I wonder what rule of measurement the Minister is going to employ.  Is it a yard-stick or a pot-stick or a walking-stick will be used?  This is the amusing part: &ldquo;and such other measurements and information (including information as to the contents of the internal organs) in <Col N="1042" /> relation to each such whale as the Minister may require.&rdquo;  When I read that my mind went back to Lougn Swilly, where the &ldquo;Laurentic&rdquo; is lying, which was supposed to be sunk with an enormous quantity of gold on board.  If a whale fisherman captured a whale in the neck of Lough Swilly, and the whale had swallowed half a dozen bars of gold, apparently he will have to record that.  Apparently the Minister hopes there will be another miracle and that another Jonah will be found somewhere within the ambit of the inspectorship of this State.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the inspectors&mdash;God help them.  Their job is to prosecute any citizen who catches any whale other than these &ldquo;Atlantic right whale, Arctic right whale, Biscayan right whale, Bowhead, Greenland right whale, Greenland whale, Nordkaper, North Atlantic right whale, North Cape whale, Pacific right whale, Pigmy right whale, Southern Pigmy right whale, Southern right whale.&rdquo;  I was told by you, Sir, that the reason my amendment was ruled out was that this was an international agreement and that we had either to accept or reject it.  It is curious that in the English Bill the schedules contain a number of others.  I had to accept your ruling, but I felt I was being rather&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I have been harshly treated.  I looked at the Schedules to see if there had been unanimity in this international agreement and whether it was one I should accept or reject.  I discovered that the list of whales in the English Act does not seem to be on a par with ours. Apparently the adopting of a category of whales was left to the respective countries and there was no unanimity in the matter.  My fundamental objection to the Bill is this, that I attempted to get this House to declare the territorial boundary of the State.  While accepting your ruling, Sir, I felt that it was due to this State to protest against the power exercised by the British Parliament, and I submit here, <Col N="1043" /> as I will submit outside this House, that this State is as sovereign as the British Parliament.  I shall assert that position both here and outside.  I will take every step to assert that right ultimately somehow.  In the Acts of George V, 24 and 25, Section 17, Chapter 49, the British Parliament has asserted that right.  Here is an opportunity for us and we should take it. I regret that your ruling, Sir, prohibits us from doing so now, but I hope that at some time an opportunity will be granted this House of doing it.</P>

      <P>I am not, but my inspectors will be.  The Deputy entirely underestimates the courage and gallantry of my inspectors if he thinks they would be afraid to approach a whale.  With regard to the contents of the internal organs of whales, all countries interested in this question have been trying to do a certain amount of study of the life habits of whales, where they get their principal feeding, and generally trying to find out what are the best conditions in regard to preserving whales in future. It is very important from that point of view that we should make returns to these countries studying the question on the contents of some of the internal organs.  It is for that purpose science and research have been put into the Bill.  As the Deputy has evidently read all the Bills about whales introduced in other countries, he must have seen that that particular clause is in all these Bills.</P>

I find that, so far as the machinery is concerned, it would be practically impossible to provide for it.  There are 126 Circuit Court clerks in the country.  It would mean setting up machinery in all those courts.  It would be absolutely impossible.  I suppose I should not say &ldquo;absolutely impossible,&rdquo; but certainly it would be very difficult to do it.  I have made inquiries from people who are in touch with this business and from bodies who are interested.

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 5, I think, the Minister, when introducing this Bill, said that there were only a few minor alterations intended, and in so far as the Bill improves the existing machinery for dealing with a number of very complicated questions, we can all agree with him.  At the same time I see that under Section 5 power is taken to the Executive Council that when they think fit they may direct &ldquo;that such quota shall not include any goods which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, either (as shall be specified in such Order) were manufactured or produced in a specified country, or were consigned to the importer from a specified country.&rdquo; As far as taking power to do that is concerned, I think that possibly the Minister is very well justified, but he would want to see that all the factors in connection with the matter were taken into account.  I should like to say that certainly if a percentage of the importations are to be taken from a specified country, or excluded from a specified country, it enormously increases the difficulties of dealing with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of illustration I should like just to mention one case where a definite percentage was specified.  I refer to the amount of cement that was last year allotted to English manufacturers.  As far as bargaining that this country would take English cement in exchange for Irish cattle is concerned, I have nothing but praise for that idea; as an ordinary business idea I think it was excellent.  I take it that the Minister saw that he got a <i>quid pro quo</i> in cattle.  I am merely <Col N="1048" /> saying that I am prepared&mdash;and I think everybody else who reflects on it is prepared&mdash;to approve of that general principle of bargaining what we manufacture and want to sell in return for what we do not manufacture, but it is the working out of the scheme in so far as that one particular commodity is concerned that I wish to bring under the Minister's notice. One-third of the imports of cement into this country were allotted to the British manufacturers.  I will not go into the method by which I think that could be just as successfully worked out in another way.  I merely want to show the Minister what happened under that particular Order that was made, namely, that one-third of the imports should be British, and that the other two-thirds should be foreign.</P>
    <P>What happened was that the importers, who had to import their commodities in the proportion of one-third British to two-thirds foreign, passed that on to the customers.  The result was that a person using cement, having done the front part of the building with foreign cement, was then faced with the statement from his supplier: &ldquo;Well, you have had your two tons of foreign cement, and now you will have to take one ton of British cement.&rdquo;  We all know that different cements have different colours.  In a case in which the front of a building was done with foreign cement and the back with English cement, the consequence will be that in years to come people will be able to point to that house and say: &ldquo;The difference in colour between the back and the front is due to the Coal-Cattle Pact.&rdquo;  That is in so far as the larger centres are concerned; when you come to the smaller ports around the West of Ireland, they naturally had to bring in that cement by some means or other. In certain cases, where there was no direct sailing to England, people were in the habit of loading up a ship on the Continent with foreign cement and other commodities.  What did they find?  They found that they had to take one-third of their imports in British cement.  They had no means of bringing it in; they had to rail it overland or make some other arrangement which altered the price of the <Col N="1049" /> commodity entirely disproportionate to the value that they received.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying on this Section 5, to say that in future all the factors in connection with a commodity will be taken into account.  I have conceded to the Minister that the main lines of the bargain were good, namely, bartering cement for cattle, but when the details came to be worked out, they were worked out in a most unfortunate, cumbersome and costly way to the community.  I hope the Chair will not think that I am comparing the Minister to a dog when I say that he should be allowed one bite, but I hope the Minister will see that we are not faced with percentage imports of certain commodities where they have to be brought in in bulk.  I am sure I have said enough for the Minister to realise that we do not want to see a recrudescence of the sort of thing that occurred in respect of cement, and I agree that, conceivably, the Minister is quite right in seeking power to vary the imports from different countries. I hope the Minister will deal with the question I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Deputy has addressed himself more to the advisability or wisdom of certain trade agreements which were made, rather than to the powers which the Government should possess for the regulation of imports.  It is quite true that the powers conferred by the original Control of Imports Act proved to be cumbersome in their operation in certain respects, and that is why this amending Bill has been brought to the Dáil, so that the machinery may be improved and enlarged as the experience of the Department of Industry and Commerce suggests it should be. It is true that a strict adherence to the letter of the Principal Act in the matter of distributing licences for the importation of cement within the period when there was a special quota in operation in respect to cement, would have involved the arrangement which the Deputy suggests, namely, that each individual importer should get two licences, one an open licence for two-thirds of his requirements, and the <Col N="1050" /> other a special licence for one-third of his requirements which would have to be imported from Great Britain; but, as the Deputy is aware, we tried, within the narrow limits fixed by the Act, to effect an arrangement among the importers themselves under which those importers principally engaged in the importation of British cement would continue to get it, and those importers principally engaged in the importation of non-British cement would continue to get it, but, in fact, the arrangement never got a chance to work out, because the price of British cement went up sharply, and, due to circumstances which were not under our control, the British cement manufacturers were not in a position to supply, except at prices which would have been unfair to our consumers. We had to secure, and we did secure, from the British Government a release from our obligations to purchase cement from Great Britain at all, and the special quota ceased to operate, but we hope that, as a result of the modifications of the provisions of the original Act contemplated by this Bill, we will have more freedom of action in dealing with a situation of that kind, if and when it should arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal purpose of this section is fourfold.  Firstly, it is to confer power to exclude from a quota goods manufactured in or consigned from a particular country; secondly, to confer power to ensure that where, in consequence of a trade agreement, we contract to take a specified quantity of a certain class of goods from one country, we can confine our imports to that quantity.  At present, as the Deputy is aware, when a special quota is made in favour of any particular country, that particular country not merely gets the benefit of the special quota, but it can import under the general quota as well.  That is a certain defect in the Act which is being remedied.  Thirdly, by this section we are making it clear&mdash;it is not a matter of great doubt, but there is no harm in having it clear&mdash;that where an additional quota is made, that additional quota can also be divided, if necessary, into a special quota and a general <Col N="1051" /> quota; and, fourthly, it confers power to do something which we thought we had power to do under the original Act, but which we are advised we have not, that is, to limit importations in relation to the total value of the goods coming in, rather than, as at present, in relation to the actual number of such goods.  At present, as Deputies are aware, all control of import orders define the permitted imports in terms of the number of items imported.  That was found in practice to be a rather inconvenient arrangement in respect of certain classes of goods where it would have been handier to have been able to limit imports with reference to the value of the goods imported, and that is the purpose of sub-section (4). This section merely extends the powers conferred by the corresponding section of the original Act in respect to these matters, because experience has shown that such extension will, in fact, facilitate importers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section introduces a new principle into the quota system, and, while the Minister's explanation of the matter has very largely clarified the situation, I am afraid, at the same time, that the extension of the quota system in this particular way is open to certain abuses and to the possibility of discrimination against certain importers.  I am not alleging that the Minister has any intention of doing any such thing, but I am afraid that section will lend itself to it.</P>

      <P>Whenever the Executive Council, by an order made...appoint a quota, they may, if they so think fit, direct that such quota shall not include any goods which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, either (a) were manufactured or produced in a specified country or (b) were consigned to the importer from a specified country....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> Does that not mean that if you have a quota order applying to a particular country and to a particular importer, it is in your discretion to alter it and to say that that particular importer shall not get those goods?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the individual importers are concerned, they do not come into the picture until long after this section has been operated.  A quota is fixed.  It can be fixed in the form of a global quota without restriction as to country of origin of the goods or otherwise; it can be divided into two parts&mdash;a special quota in favour of some countries and an open quota in favour of our country; and, under this section, it can be framed in the form of a total quota excluding only one or more countries.  It is not until the quota order has been made, the actual quotas fixed and the conditions under which importation can take place have been determined that the importer comes into the picture.  He then applies for his licence under the special quota or the global quota and, so far as that is concerned, the arrangements for the distribution of licences between all applicants are set out very elaborately in the Principal Act so as to ensure that there cannot in fact be any discrimination exercised as between one and the other, except in relation to their previous position in the business.  The arrangements in operation do permit of that amount of discrimination.  Preference can be given to an importer previously engaged in the business of importing the goods concerned as against a newcomer, or licences can be varied in proportion to their importations of the goods concerned in any year.  But apart from the element of discretion which is there in the interest of importers themselves, there can, in fact, be no discretion as between importers; all applicants for licences can register their applications for licences and they must get licences; and they must get precisely the licences asked for.  It is only where the total number of applications exceed the total <Col N="1053" /> of the quota that a certain element of discretion comes in.  But that discretion can only be exercised in the case of those previously importing those goods as against new applicants. The quota is fixed and the conditions as to importation are determined by so much as the national requirements exceed national production.</P>

      <P>So far as amendments Nos. 2 and 4 are concerned I am prepared to accept them in principle, subject to certain limitations in amendment No. 4.  It seems to me that if amendments Nos. 2 and 4 are accepted, Deputy Dockrell's point is met to a <Col N="1056" /> great extent, except that so far as amendment No. 3 is concerned it raises a different point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister has met me in the matter I had in mind and it really more or less remains to clear up this point.  I do not know whether it is a misunderstanding or not on the part of the Minister, but I would like to know does he wish to narrow the scope of people who are entitled to import?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that must be yes.  Where the quota order is in operation it is reasonable to assume that it was brought into operation for the purpose of diminishing imports of the goods subject to that Order.  There are some exceptions to that.  At present there is no attempt to diminish imports of oranges and coal and certain other items.  However, in respect of the great majority of classes subject to a quota order, the Order was made for the purpose of reducing the imports of these goods, with a view to their ultimate elimination.  Take the quota that operates in the matter of boots and shoes.  The intention of that quota is ultimately to eliminate boot and shoe imports altogether, because of the development of home production now.  We think the main purpose of a quota order is to limit and ultimately to diminish the imports of goods.  It should be our policy, and the original Act and this Bill were framed to enable us to confine the remaining and diminishing business in the importation of these goods as far as possible to the firms previously engaged in the business of importing, or at any rate to confine it to such firms plus nationally-owned firms.  In fact the Act operates to ensure that once a quota order has been made for that purpose in respect of any class of goods a very definite preference is given to the firms previously engaged in the import of these goods in the issue of licences&mdash;so far as licences are issued at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the purely administrative point of view the best arrangement would be to say that everybody can apply and everybody can get proportionately the same part of the total <Col N="1057" /> quota.  That would be the simplest procedure.  But it would be unfair to firms who have been for a number of years engaged in the business of importing these goods and who had been forced to change over to another business. So long as there are any goods to come in under the Order, all the business of importing them should be given to those firms I have mentioned. That provision is set out specifically in the Principal Act.  The Minister, in the exercise of his discretion, in the only circumstances where, in fact, he has any discretion&mdash;that is, where the total applications for licences exceed the total to be distributed&mdash;is required to have regard first to the interests of the firms previously engaged in the import of these goods.  This limitation imposed by this corresponding section upon all classes of persons interested in imports is designed to that end. These limitations are designed to secure that that limited amount of preference will be given to firms previously engaged in the business when that is brought to an end by legislative action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is following right lines in that respect, and I am glad to know he is keeping in view the people who were engaged previously in that business.  I do not agree at all with the Minister when he says the main purpose of the Quota Order is to limit it to diminishing goods or imports.  The main purpose is to limit the supply until we have production enough to meet our requirements. These are two different things. There has been a little misunderstanding about that.  To my mind the Quota Order is not for the purpose of diminishing supplies of imports, but for the purpose of enabling our own requirements to be met until our own manufacturers are in a position to supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>With a great part of what the Minister has said I entirely agree.  There can be no question of a case where the quota has been reduced because there is increased manufacture in the country.  I am certainly not objecting to that.  I think I would also approve and applaud the Minister for saying that the major portion of <Col N="1058" /> the import licences should be given to those firms previously engaged in the business.  I think that is very reasonable. Where I do join issue with the Minister, and where I do not think he has yet answered my question, is in this wise&mdash;it seems to me that certain classes of persons who were carrying on business before may now be shut out from getting portion of the quota. If they were merely importers there might be something to be said for the Minister's point of view.  But where there is a manufacturer who has come in and either complied with the Control of Manufactures Act, or at any rate has not been under any disability by reason of it, it seems as if there is a possibility that such an applicant might be shut out.  In my amendment No. 1 I want to add the words &ldquo;the owner, or one of the owners, of the business which was carried on in Saorstát Eireann on 1st April, 1937,&rdquo; so as to cover such cases.  There is another point under (iv) of (a).  Does the phrase in line 16, &ldquo;carried on the business of importing,&rdquo; cover a company which imports its raw material, or does it mean an importer only?  Perhaps the Minister may ask what I am getting at. What I want to know is if that wording is intended to decrease the supply of raw material which a manufacturer has been previously getting.  If that is to be done under the decreased quota due to increased manufacture in the country, I think the Minister is perfectly right, but are there any manufacturers who have complied up to now with the regulations and who are going to be hit in the supply of their raw materials?  I do not, of course, mean by reason of the reduced quota due to the increase of manufacture.  The real point I had in mind was whether that would really amount to attempting control of manufacturers under a Control of Imports Bill.  If the Minister says that nothing of that sort is intended, I shall be entirely answered.  I thought that a general discussion on this section might help to clear it up.  The Minister has largely cleared up the matter by accepting amendments Nos. 2 and 4.  We shall, perhaps, hear later why he will not accept amendment No. 1.  I agree with him that amendment No. 3 is in <Col N="1059" /> a different category.  We shall come to that in due course.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is intended that any section of this Bill should be regarded as retrospective.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but merely the question of the classes of persons who will be entitled to continue to import those goods which are made subject to quota orders.  The main purpose of this amendment was to extend the list of such persons.  I am prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment No. 2, for the reason that in the original Act we defined a &ldquo;person&rdquo; as a &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  What constituted a national of Saorstát Eireann was defined in that Act.  Since then, the Citizenship Act became law, and the term, &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; was changed into the term, &ldquo;citizen of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; to bring this legislation into conformity with other Statutes.  That, in the ordinary course, would mean a widening rather than a restriction of the term, but it had, incidentally, this limiting effect&mdash; that a &ldquo;national of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; as defined in the Principal Act for the purposes of that Act, was a person who had five years continuous residence in the Saorstát.  Such a person might not be a citizen, and might for some reason, be unable to acquire citizenship of Saorstát Eireann.  Consequently, he would be excluded from the register, if some amendment on the lines of amendment No. 2 were not accepted.  That is why I am prepared to accept amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards manufacturers, it is intended that a manufacturer should be allowed to be registered as an importer, and the Deputy's amendment to extend the definition of &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; in the relevant paragraph is acceptable, subject to one condition. As the section would stand with the incorporation of the Deputy's amendment, any manufacturer could get on <Col N="1060" /> to any register, and could become an importer of goods in which previously he had no interest.  I propose to limit that by words similar to those appearing in paragraph (b).  We would allow any manufacturer to get on the register and become entitled to import goods where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is necessary or usual for such manufacturer to import goods of the description to which the relevant quota order applies.  There must be some limitation of that type.  Otherwise you might have a boot manufacturer blossoming out as an importer of oranges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is necessary to accept the Deputy's amendment, No. 1, to meet his point, having regard to the acceptance of amendment No. 2.  If we did accept No. 1, the rest of this provision would become almost meaningless, because it would extend very widely the class of persons to whom registration could be given.  In fact, that limitation existed under the Principal Act, and no case of difficulty arose.  In any case where a firm was unable to qualify for registration under that section, they formed a company, and, as a company, were entitled to registration.  That still holds.  Once they form a company in accordance with the laws of the State, they are entitled to registration, irrespective of the location of the ownership of the company.  As regards paragraph (c), it is necessary to grant the power which it is proposed to confer&mdash;power for a Minister, head of a Department of State, to be registered as an importer.  I assume that the purpose of the Deputy's amendment is to compel a Minister requiring to import goods to arrange for their importation through some trader in the Saorstát.  I do not think that we should impose that limitation.  There is no reason why the stores department of the Post Office, which arranges for the purchase of most of the goods required by the Government, should not be in a position to contract for the supply of some materials which have to be imported, and which are subject to a quota order, direct with <Col N="1061" /> an outside supplier instead of being driven to make an arrangement for the importation of these goods on behalf of the State with some private trader, even though that private trader might not, in fact, have a licence to import the full quantity of the goods which the State would require.  I think it desirable that that extension of the register should be effected so that the head of a Department of State may, in fact, be registered.  It did happen in a few cases that a State Department had to import goods which were subject to a quota order and could not get a licence to import these goods.  When that situation arose, the State Department had to arrange with some private trader to import the goods on its behalf, whereas we think that the State Department should be in the same position as any other purchaser, free to contract with an outside supplier and entitled to get a licence to import.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister as the head of a Department of State on the register will be subject to every limitation that every other registered importer is subject to.  That limitation is expressed in Section 9 of the Principal Act.  There are three circumstances contemplated there.  One is where the total amount applied for by registered importers to be imported, that is the sum total of all the licences applied for, is less than 75 per cent. of the quota, in which case the Act prescribes that every applicant must get the licence applied for without question.  There are then the circumstances where the total of applications is less than 100 per cent. but over 75 per cent., in which case almost similar conditions obtain.  Where the total of applications exceeds 100 per cent. of the quota, the Minister must have regard to the interests of those previously <Col N="1062" /> engaged in the business of importing this class of goods to the extent of 75 per cent. of the total of the quota. That 75 per cent., in practice and by law, must be distributed in direct proportion to the previous importations of the applicants for licences. The Minister has a certain element of discretion in respect of the remaining 25 per cent.  It need not be distributed. It can be kept in reserve to meet emergencies, or to deal with unexpected shortages.  It is only in respect of that 25 per cent. that we could, in special circumstances, facilitate a State Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given the House an explanation of why a Minister as head of a State Department should be registered.  I desire to draw his attention to the first clause dealt with under paragraph (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;an individual who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there is Section 14 which gives power to issue licences in excess of a quota.  Surely the Minister could get his licence under Section 14.  The object in resisting paragraph (c) of this section was to establish that there was not to be an extension of State trading in all forms to Departments of State.  I think the Minister is covered under this paragraph, or the section I have referred to.</P>

      <P>When a business is transferred and the transferee applies to be registered in the register of importers relating to any quota order such business shall be regarded as having been carried on continuously from the date of the commencement of such business.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister realises the purpose of this amendment.  In the case of a business which is transferred, I think it would be a hardship if the goodwill which has been acquired in that business in quotas and so on could not also be transferred.

      <P>If what the Deputy has stated reflects his intentions, I do not think the amendment is necessary at all.  A person entitled to registration would in any event be entitled to it, even without the transfer of a business to him.  The only purpose which the Deputy's amendment would, in fact, serve would be to introduce a method by which a person not entitled to be registered could become registered&mdash; that is, by having a business transferred to him.  If a person to whom a business is transferred qualifies under Section 6 to be registered, then in any event he is entitled to be registered, even if starting a new business.</P>

      <P>In practice, in these circumstances, a question as to the amount of the licence under a quota can only arise where the Minister has to exercise a discretion, that is, where the applications exceed the quota, and it cannot be otherwise.  In practice we are giving credit for the importations under the old business to the person to whom that business is transferred, except in certain difficult cases which the Deputy's amendment would not touch: in a case where, say, two partners split a business and each carried on separately, or the case where a number of partners did that and thought that each could get a licence equivalent to the licence that the combination could have got before. These are types of cases that can only be dealt with with a certain amount of discretion.  In the circumstances which exist in respect of a number of quotas at the present time, where the total applications are less than the quota, then everyone gets what he has applied for.  In the other case, this element of discretion has to be allowed. I can inform the Deputy that, in practice, where a business is transferred from one person to another, the successor in the business gets credit for the previous importations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Only on the grounds that he did not previously import the class of goods concerned or that his importations were negligible.  The idea behind that is to confine the limited business left to the firms which were previously and genuinely engaged in it. Under the law, every applicant for a licence must get a licence.  Even if it be for only one boot or one shoe they must get a licence.  Obviously, a licence to import one boot would be of no value.  Take the case of a quota order in respect of motor cars.  In that case we must fix a quota for motor cars to correspond to the total number of persons on the register, because every registered person is entitled to a licence, the minimum number being one.  The intention there is to prevent registrations being inflated by the inclusion of people who have never been engaged in the business concerned or only engaged in it to a negligible extent.  We want to have that power in order to be able to keep such people off the register for the benefit of the genuine importers whose names would be left on it.</P>

We would prefer to see that everybody who wants to apply can do so and, from the purely administrative point of view, it would be easier for us to give them all the same amount.  That would be the simple way, but it would be unfair to the people genuinely engaged on the business.  That is the only reason for this provision.

      <P>I should like the Minister, if he would, to explain what is meant there by the removal of persons from the register.  My reason for asking is that it might so happen that difficulty might arise, such as that goods that came from a certain country might not be available for import by reason of something happening in that country, and would the manufacturer or the person who was on the register lose his registration because of that fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time, our powers of removal from the register are confined to two cases: one, where the person is convicted of an offence under the Act; and, two, fails to use at least 25 per cent. of the licence issued to him.  It is only in one or other of these circumstances that we could remove a person from the register.  Then there is the question of removing a person from the register at his own request, Now, any person who, in respect of two successive quota periods, fails to apply for a licence, may be removed.  It is not a question of failing to use a licence, but of failing to apply at all. It has happened up to the present time that certain firms, that applied for licences in the first quota period, subsequently got out of the business, but did not bother to inform us that they had got out of it.  Their names remained on the register and they had to be communicated with at each period, and were endeavouring to come back at any time.  We are proposing that if a registered importer fails to apply at all for a licence during two successive quota periods, he may be removed from the register.  If he gets his licence and fails to use it to more than 25 per cent., he may also be <Col N="1069" /> removed, but there, of course, he has the right to put forward as a good defence any such circumstances as Deputy Good indicates, such as a strike, the hold-up of shipping, or any international circumstances which made it unreasonable for him to be expected to use his licence.  We are also taking power here to remove from the register any person who, it subsequently appears, made false or misleading statements for the purpose of procuring registration.  This is really a widening of the powers of removal, because some of the registers were getting cluttered up with names of people who were not genuine importers at all, and the genuine importers suffered in consequence of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any clause, or is it necessary to have a clause, whereby the case of the person on the register would be heard as to why he did not apply during two successive periods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Deputy may take it that, in practice, any person who is seriously in the business will apply for his licence at the beginning of the quota period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that these periods are fairly long.  The period may be for two years, or there may be two successive periods of six months each.  If the person does not apply at all for two periods, he may be removed, but I think it is reasonable to think that anybody who is in the business, even in a small way, will apply for his licence.  He may not use it, and if he fails to use it to 25 per cent., he may be removed, but only in circumstances which give him the right of putting forward his defence.  He can plead any circumstances outside his control, if necessary.</P>

      <P>That applies in respect of the person who applies for a licence but who fails to use it.  That is covered in the Principal Act, but we <Col N="1070" /> are covering here another type of person, and that is the person who does not apply at all for a licence for two successive periods, and it is intended to cover the case of a person who has gone out of business and who has not informed us of the fact that he has gone out of business, and I think that any person who does not apply for such a lengthy period can reasonably be thought to have gone out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand that where the periods are, say, two periods of six months, that is 12 months in all, the country from which the manufacturer gets his materials may be affected all through that 12 months and that consequently he cannot get his materials.  He does not apply for his licence, and he may in consequence be struck off the register automatically.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it he will apply for a licence.  Remember the goods are coming from somewhere.  He is on the register of importers and he gets a communication from the Department that a quota for the goods has been fixed at the commencement of the quota period.  If he does not apply for a licence, it means that he is not interested in the importation of the goods concerned. He may not be able to get supplies from particular sources, but remember the goods must come from some source, and if this particular person is not pleased to apply for the right to import, we are taking power to assume that in such circumstances he has gone out of business.  It is, I think, a reasonable assumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say, also, that communications go out to everybody on the register at the commencement <Col N="1071" /> of a quota period, informing them that a quota has been fixed and that applications for licences to import must be submitted before a certain date.  They are given the appropriate forms on which they are to apply.  Any person interested in the goods has got that personal notification which permits him to apply for his share of the quota. The application need only be quite formal.  He merely makes the application and he does not know then, and will not know for some time afterwards, what amount he will get.  In fact the practice is to apply for a much larger amount than the importer hopes to get when the distribution takes place.  I can assure the Deputy that we would not remove from the register any person under the section without notifying him of the fact that his removal was in contemplation or without calling his attention to the fact that for two quota periods he had, in fact, failed to use his licence at all. The reason for that is obvious.  We have got at the beginning of the quota period to consider how 75 per cent. of the total quota is going to be distributed and we must assume that everybody on the register is going to apply. Consequently there can be only one unit of distribution.  That unit has to be fixed in relation to the number of people on the register.  If the register is full of people who are not seriously in business, confusion is caused in the Department and considerable loss is caused to <i>bona fide</i> importers who get less of the goods on their licences than they would otherwise obtain.  It is in the interests of <i>bona fide</i> traders that the register should be confined to such traders. It is also in the interests of the Department as it facilitates administration because it eliminates complaints towards the end of the quota period when supplies are running out and when the power of the Department to issue licences is strictly limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that under sub-section 2 (a) of this section, the Minister has the right to take into consideration any relevant consideration in fixing particular quotas for a particular period.  In paragraph (b) of the same sub-section it is set out that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where it is not possible or in the opinion of the Minister is not practicable, to issue the full number of the licences so applied for, the Minister shall issue only so many licences as appear to him to be reasonable having regard to the quantity of goods aforesaid and in such case the Minister shall issue such licences to such persons (being persons who have applied as aforesaid) and for such quantities of goods as he shall consider to be proper having regard to all the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us to understand that there was a statutory preference given to people who were doing the business of importation.  Does that not give the Minister discretion to go outside these people?  There is no mention there of the people who have been already regarded as importers of these particular commodities.  There is no mention of anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-section (a) under which the Minister takes the right to have regard to any relevant consideration, I should like to ask the Minister what is the machinery existing between the Minister and the manufacturers by which he is able to get the information required <Col N="1073" /> for the fixing of the quota?  Is the Minister satisfied that he is always able to get the necessary information in that respect?  Recently I have read in some of the newspapers that there were some factories, I think boot and shoe factories, working on short time, and at the same time we had an importation of boots and shoes under quota orders.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the machinery that exists as between himself and people who are engaged in the manufacture of certain articles, a certain proportion of which are being imported at the same time under licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the circumstances arise that the Minister has to exercise his discretion, in other words, where it is possible to give a licence if applied for, we require the applicants for licences to furnish evidence of their importations of the goods concerned during the year immediately preceding the operation of the quota and then we distribute the licences to each applicant on the basis of their importations in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you that information at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Obviously that method is going to become less satisfactory as time goes on in relation to certain businesses.  Some of the quota orders were made in 1934 and licences are being distributed under them in accordance with the importation of firms in 1933.  1933 is now four years away and a lot of circumstances have begun to operate which will justify some new standards. We have to adopt various standards from time to time in relation to the 25 per cent. of the global quota in respect of which the Minister is given discretion.  For example a boot and shoe retailer who, in 1933 bought a larger quantity of Irish boots and shoes than a competitor in the same business, would have been penalised in the matter of import licences, under the 1934 arrangement because of that fact, if we do not proceed to set up a new standard for the additional licences <Col N="1074" /> and give licences to import in proportion to purchases of Irish goods. The same applies to certain classes of woollen and worsted cloths which are subject to an import duty.  New firms are coming into the business of manufacturing clothing.  Some new standard has got to be fixed in relation to them and the standard we are operating is one in relation to the purchase of Irish materials.  It is in relation to these purchases that we are giving licences.  We are trying in sub-section (b) to look after another situation, where the total applications for licences are out of all proportion to the actual amount of goods admitted and where the number of articles to be admitted would not permit of giving a licence for one article to each applicant for it.  Take the case of motor cars. We might fix, say a quota for 20 motors to be imported in a period of three months and we might have 40 applicants for licences.  As the law stands at present we would be in fact bound to give everyone a licence, but it would be a licence in that particular case to import half a car.  Although we have met the difficulty by limiting the number of articles imported to the number on the register, it may be desirable to go below that in respect of certain articles and, therefore, we are taking power to confine the issue of licences in such circumstances in such a manner as the Minister shall think proper.  We might decide to confine the licences for the importation of complete cars to firms engaged in the assembling of cars.  We have not got that power at present.  It was a defect in the Principal Act, which limited the restriction on imports that could be imposed in certain cases.  We are taking that power now, again trying to preserve the situation in which the firms entitled to a preference will continue to get it.  I think it will be found more and more difficult to do that as time goes on, in respect of certain articles.  For instance, the distribution of a quota in 1940 in relation to importations in the year 1933 might be very unfair to a number of firms <Col N="1075" /> and, therefore, we have to depart from that position.  We are, however, trying to preserve that position as far as possible.</P>

      <P>There is an advisory committee, and that committee is brought together where any question arises and the whole position is investigated.  It is not merely necessary for us to find out what quantity the manufacturers did produce, but we must also ascertain the quantity they are likely to produce in the period covered by the quota order.  We get returns certified by auditors in respect of production, and we have to consult with the manufacturers as to the arrangements made individually for an extension of production.  We have to take into account new firms established, and we have to arrive at an estimate with regard to the quota. The quota is, in fact, fixed so as to allow a fairly considerable margin. We are under statutory obligation to distribute only 75 per cent. of the quota.  There is always 25 per cent. held in reserve.  That is used only to deal with a situation where a shortage might be expected, either because we miscalculated production or because some importer did not use his licence, or because of a strike at the ports or for some other reason.  In such circumstances that 25 per cent. margin may be and is utilised.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for an Advance for the establishment of an Air Transport Company (No. 40 of 1936).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the policy of the Government with regard to the development of civil aviation in the Saorstát envisages the establishment of a national aviation company which will operate, either directly or through subsidiaries, all internal air transport services, and which will represent the Saorstát in international air services connecting the Saorstát with other countries.</P>
    <P>The principal object of the company will be the development of civil aviation on an extensive scale and it will be the duty of its directors to formulate and pursue a policy designed to that end.  Such a policy will aim, amongst other things, at making the Saorstát the international junction for air traffic between Europe and North America, not only by direct services by air, but also by providing air connections at Saorstát ports with transatlantic shipping.  It should, we think, be feasible in time to establish air services connecting the Saorstát directly with all the principal European countries.</P>
    <P>Powers to enable that policy to be put into effect were obtained by the Air Navigation and Transport Act passed last year.  Section 68 of the Act requires the Minister for Finance to secure the formation and registration of a limited company conforming to certain specified conditions.  It appears to be inevitable that in any development of civil aviation in this country on a reasonably large scale the Government will have to take the initiative or, at any rate, take a very active part and that, in the early stages at least, the Minister for Finance will have to provide the necessary capital.  The Act, therefore, <Col N="1079" /> provides for the acquisition of shares in the company by the Minister for Finance up to the total nominal value of the share capital and for a guarantee by the same Minister in respect of any debentures issued by the company. The company will be organised on ordinary commercial lines, and it is intended that, so far as such a course is compatible with the discharge of its special duties and responsibilities, the board of the company should carry out its functions in the same way as the board of an ordinary business concern.</P>
    <P>The commercial activities of the proposed company will, so far as can be foreseen at present, fall under the following main heads.  First of all, I mention the transatlantic services. Under the recent Inter-Governmental Agreement, a joint operating company will be responsible for the operation of the transatlantic air services as soon as the experimental period is over, and that company is to be incorporated at the instance of three companies, each company nominated by one of the three Governments concerned.  It is intended that this national company will be nominated for that purpose by the Government of the Saorstát.  That nomination will involve the company's holding 24½ per cent. of the capital stock of the joint operating company.  The capital of the joint company is visualised at about £1,000,000, so that the Saorstát company's holding will be about £245,000.  The board of directors on the joint company, that is the Joint Transatlantic Services Operating Company, will be nine in number, and the Ottawa Agreement provides that three of these will be nominated by the Saorstát company. Under the financial arrangements connected with the project, the Saorstát Government is undertaking responsibility for the payment of 5 per cent. of the annual subsidy to the services, subject to a maximum of £12,000 per annum.  It is intended that any contributions payable under that undertaking will be paid through the national company. Authority for the payment of that subsidy is given in Section 79 of the <Col N="1080" /> Act; but the money will, of course, have to be voted by Dáil Eireann as required.</P>
    <P>The second I mention is the cross-channel air services.  These services are at present operated by Aer Lingus, Teoranta.  They are being financed on a temporary basis at the present time, but provision is being made in the capital of the national company for capitalising Aer Lingus, Teoranta, the nominal capital of which is £100,000.  That means that the cross-channel air services will be operated by a subsidiary company of this national company.  The unusual procedure of setting up a subsidiary before the parent company was due to the Government's desire to have these cross-channel services operated as early as possible.  The existing service provides transport between Dublin and London via Bristol.  During the summer months services were provided from Dublin to the Isle of Man and from Dublin to Liverpool. Extensions of these services to Belfast and Scotland from Dublin, and from Cork to Wales and the South of England are matters for consideration in the early future.</P>
    <P>I next mention other international services and internal services.  In operating internal services the company will be breaking new ground and the adaptation of air services for the economic requirements of air traffic within the Saorstát will be a problem to be dealt with.  It is to be assumed that at some stage the question of establishing air connections between Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway will come up for consideration. Besides the cross-channel services to Great Britain attention will have to be given to the operation of direct services to the Continent of Europe. Some of the transatlantic shipping companies have already shown their interest in air services linking up with their liners calling at Saorstát ports. Any internal development is, of course, dependent upon the provision of suitable aerodromes.  I have been trying to impress this on the local authorities in Cork and in Galway.  Cork has had the position investigated by a firm of aerodrome construction consultants <Col N="1081" /> and Galway is also considering the provision of an aerodrome.  The setting-up of connecting services between the Shannon airport and the Continent is a matter of prime importance for consideration by this national company.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of charter work, that is, the type of air service which is called, I think, air taxi work which this company will also perform; that is the provision of special planes as required by Press reporters, medical people and so forth.  It is to be assumed that the demand for such services in the Saorstát will diminish when regular services are established, but meanwhile there is no reason why this company should not seek to meet it.  It may be found advantageous to arrange that the transatlantic airport on the Shannon will be operated for the Government by the national company, charges on the usual scale being made to any companies utilising the airport.  The management of aerodromes is often undertaken by operating or air servicing companies and this is so even in the case of aerodromes established by municipal authorities.  As the national company to be established will be the only Saorstát company operating services, it may be called upon to undertake the management of aerodromes at Dublin, Cork and other places.</P>
    <P>While it is uncertain whether the manufacture of aircraft will be undertaken in the Saorstát as a commercial operation, it will be necessary to provide facilities for the repair and overhaul of aircraft, including private aeroplanes, operating within and to and from the Saorstát.  As this national company is to be responsible for practically all the commercial flying operations in the Saorstát the training of flying and ground personnel will come within the company's province.  There is also a considerable amount of work done by firms in other countries engaged in air photography and air surveys, and the national company will probably find it desirable to interest itself in this business.  It may also be found necessary, and not merely necessary but desirable, to popularise <Col N="1082" /> flying amongst the people, by organising special aerial displays and demonstration flights.  The amount asked for is £2,500.  That is required to defray the initial expenses in connection with the establishment of the company.  The greater part of that amount comes back to the Exchequer in the form of stamp duty.  The stamp duty on the capital of the proposed company of £500,000 is £1,250, and the expenses of printing the memorandum and articles of association are also being provided for, together with the necessary expenses in the form of repayment of advances made to the company to meet the expenditure between the present time and the time that the capital of the company will have been subscribed.  The Act provides for the advance of a sum up to £5,000 for this purpose.  We consider, having regard to experience of the floatation of other smaller companies that a sum of £2,500 should be sufficient and I move that that amount be made available.</P>

      <P>At this stage, can the Minister give the House some idea of what our commitments will be in respect to this air force, now that we are setting up a company for a particular purpose?  The Minister has outlined the purpose in view more than the details of the company in connection with this Bill.  We will have a certain amount of expenditure in connection with this air service, and many figures have been published. Can the Minister estimate what the capital outlay will be in connection with the whole matter, as well as maintenance, and what are the prospects of revenue coming to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not confuse this company and the air force. I mention that it is possible that this company will be in charge of airport maintenance in the Saorstát, but it is conceivable that some other procedure might be adopted.  The State is building airports at the Shannon and at Collinstown at present, one for the purpose of the civil air services and the other for the transatlantic services. These two operations are separate and distinct from this company, which is <Col N="1083" /> formed primarily to operate air services, and it may do so directly or through subsidiaries.  For the present the cross-channel service will be a subsidiary service of this company.  This company will be a shareholder in the company that will operate the transatlantic service or it may have a service through subsidiaries and organise services from the Free State to the Continent or internal services. The main purpose of this company will be the operation of this service. It may have no functions at all in regard to airports.  It will have certain functions in the training of personnel, the organising of special displays, and providing special planes for special routes or charter arrangements. I mentioned that we might consider it good policy to entrust this company with a lease of the airports. I would not like to think that we are committed to that, but at present that appears to be the most practicable arrangement.  Even if it might prove most practicable for the municipal airport contemplated at Cork, of which the State would not have control, the Cork municipal authorities might find it an advantage to lease the airport to this company rather than to attempt to manage it themselves.  What the cost of the airports that I mentioned are likely to be I cannot say at this stage.  Estimates have been prepared on a more or less provisional basis, and circumstances might arise to upset them.  The matter will come before the Dáil in the near future in the form of an Estimate to provide money for that purpose.  I could not commit myself to a figure, as I do not recollect what it is likely to be.  That is a separate matter to the formation of this company.</P>

The primary purpose of this company is the operation of air services and not the management of air ports.  We are not even committed to the suggestion which I put forward, that we might entrust the management of the air ports to this company.  So far as this company is concerned it will proceed with the other important duties it has to perform, irrespective of what is done in the other matter subsequently.

      <P>For the international route, or for whatever routes are provided, this company or subsidiaries must be set up by a company registered in this country.  Where an international service is concerned there must be two companies and they may carry on independent or competing services, or they may combine, as in the case of the cross-channel services, to establish a joint committee of management and to pool the receipts, or carry on services without competing with one another. Competition is not likely to develop to any extent.  I do not suppose there is any air service in the world carrying on at a profit.  Some may not be making a loss, but they are not making a profit.  Having regard to the interest shown in aviation, and the use made of the cross-channel services established last year, we are confident that a profit-earning stage must be reached soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that the situation will be something like that of the Industrial Credit Company. There was a public issue but very little private capital was subscribed. The bulk of the capital had, in fact, to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister has authority to subscribe the whole of the capital, and it is anticipated that he will have to do so.  Because of the circumstances I mentioned, that air services up to this were not profit-making concerns, it is unlikely that much private capital will be available <Col N="1086" /> to the company.  At any time he thinks it desirable the Minister for Finance is authorised to dispose of the shares to private holders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to tell us that he was very anxious that the control of this company should remain exclusively or almost exclusively in national hands. Is there not a danger in allowing the control of capital to pass into private hands, and is it not possible, if such an eventuality did arise, that the service might be operated in a fashion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not contemplate any circumstances in which the Minister for Finance will not have control of all or a great proportion of the capital.  It will be many years before any question of disposing of shares will arise, and it will certainly be another Government that will be considering the matter, because for a long period of time the situation will be as it is at present in all countries, that capital for air services has to be provided by public authorities.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that remark, I wonder would the Minister say, when he is finally replying, whether all this organisation has regard only to passenger transport, or whether there is any contemplation of a transport of freight?  I think it is the case that in other countries at present there is more and more of urgent traffic, even heavy traffic, being conveyed by air, and it would look as if there was very great advantage in air transport for certain of our exports&mdash; perishable goods, for instance.  Has that been considered?</P>

In reply to Deputy Roddy, I should say that the draft of the memorandum of association which is being prepared provides that no share of the capital of the company shall be allotted otherwise than to citizens of Saorstát Eireann, or to bodies corporate the greater part of whose share capital is held by citizens of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>This is a rather important matter, and I think that Deputies have, if I may use the term, got into an air-pocket.  They do not know where they are, nor do I.  We should have much more information before the House votes this money&mdash;not so much the amount involved here, but what will probably become involved later on.  I have here a publication called the <i>British News-Magazine,</i> which throws some light on this matter.  It refers to some things which I should like the Minister to clear up.  It quotes rather extensively from the <i>Airways Gazette,</i> which is apparently the official organ of the British air services.  The paper itself says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Britain's plans for the North Atlantic air service are well advanced.  The site for the Empire air base has been selected on the Shannon, for the 40 odd miles of water between Limerick and the sea are an unmistakable land mark for 'planes approaching the Irish coast.  The Shannon, although tidal, is completely free from the surge of the Atlantic rollers, and is for the most part sheltered from the wind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it quotes rather extensively from the <i>Airways Gazette:&mdash;</i></P>
      <P>&ldquo;The main details of the arrangements agreed between the respective Government are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A joint operating company which will be responsible for carrying on the services will be incorporated at the instance of three companies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those are the three companies mentioned by the Minister.  The quotation continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The capital of the joint company will be subscribed and held as to 51 per cent. by the United Kingdom <Col N="1089" /> company, 24½ per cent. by the Canadian company, and 24½ per cent. by the Irish Free State company. In the operation of the services all practical preference will be given to the direct route from this country via the Irish Free State, Newfoundland and Canada, but it may be necessary during an initial period to operate the services via Bermuda during the winter months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we come to the pregnant portion of the quotation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The control of commercial, technical, and operating matters will be secured to Imperial Airways, Ltd., through its stockholding and through the medium of the articles of association of the joint company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before the House votes this money, I think it should have the articles of association of the British company, which is Imperial Airways, Ltd., in order to see if that is true.  Apparently it was printed in the <i>Airways Gazette,</i> which appears to be the official organ of the British air services, and it was reprinted in this magazine without contradiction.</P>

      <P>We know that, but you are committing this country to this payment, and to accommodation for the Imperial company over which you have no control whatever.  I asked about the implications of &ldquo;operating,&rdquo; the word the Minister used, and the Minister told me that it meant the control and direction of apparently the machines.  Control of the company is nothing.  This means control and operation of these machines here and the net result of it will be that we will not have a solitary machine and we will have no control over the machines and no power to buy or sell or construct a machine.

The Minister drew for me the analogy of the Great Southern Railways, but that is not an analogous case at all, because they own the rolling stock and permanent way and they control the stock and the management <i>in toto.</i> Here you do not control anything.  You simply take the taxpayers' money and buy land at Rynanna, drain it and reclaim it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, this money is to form the company that will have control.  Referring back to the Bill already approved of, I say that that Bill, standing by itself, is utterly meaningless, because there is nobody to manage it.  It must be operated as a result of this Vote, and nothing can be done until the company is formed for which this money is wanted.  The thing is purely negative unless the Government of this State, having got that Bill, proceed to do things that the company would have done had it been formed, as it should have been formed, prior to what has already been done. These things were done in advance of the formation of the company and they are antecedent to the formation of the company, but they should have been done by the company itself.</P>

      <Col N="1093" /> It is quite clear that we are merely a sitting down spot in this matter and that this country will derive no benefit. It will share all the commitments, but it can receive none of the benefits.  It cannot even receive benefit in the matter of employment because there will be no construction of aeroplanes here.  They are going to be constructed elsewhere, I presume.  There is no word in this Bill, nor was there in the Minister's opening statement, as to a constructional provision with regard to the operations of this company here.  The operations simply consist of the very restricted matter of accepting financial responsibility and of giving accommodation to aeroplanes circling around the Empire, from England to India and Australia, and from England to the Free State and Canada.  Ultimately, there is going to be an arrangement with Pan American Airways and an accommodation as between them with regard to the use of the respective bases.  This magazine from which I have quoted actually gives the mileage of the routes in respect of the Western operations of this company.  They are given as: Portsmouth to the Shannon, 372 miles; The Shannon to Botwood, 1,993 miles; Botwood to Halifax, 510 miles; Halifax to Baltimore, 755 miles; and Baltimore to New York, 175 miles.</P>

      <P>But the Minister is getting the money to set about forming it.  It is for that the Minister is asking the money.  If we were private people and a scheme was being proposed to us into which we were asked to put our money, would not the Minister in such a case think that it would be a very pertinent question to ask who the directorate would be?  In this case I am not asking for the exact personnel of the directorate.  What I am asking for is the principle on which the Minister will nominate the personnel. The Minister is getting money to float a company, and it is immaterial to the national exchequer whether that money is to provide so many shares or set the machinery going.  It is with the spending of this money and its investment that the directors will be concerned.  Therefore I think it is a pertinent question to ask on what principle the directors are to be nominated&mdash;if the Minister has as yet evolved a principle on which it is proposed to appoint them.  I think the Minister mentioned a board of nine directors, but probably that related to the international board.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, later on, the Minister will give us some idea if he has arrived at the method by which he proposes to nominate these five. While on my feet, I propose to carry the discussion another point further. With regard to the Limerick airport which is being constructed, I do not know where the money is being provided from.  Is it provided by the Exchequer?  Now I come nearer home and I dare say the Minister can see what is at the back of my head.  The airport at Collinstown will be constructed half from the national exchequer and the other half by contributions to be made by the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council. What the cost of the construction of this airport will be is very much in the air.  It would not be, perhaps, relevant at all to develop the question of the cost of the site of that port. The relevancy, as far as I can see it under this Vote, is that here to-day <Col N="1096" /> we are putting up public money to bring it into being that mechanism that may possibly boss or manage this port later on.  In that way the matter has a good deal of relevancy.  This port in Collinstown is going to be constructed by national, municipal and county council subsidies and a loss is anticipated.  I take it, it has been agreed by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council.</P>

Between the City of Dublin and the Dublin County Council we are putting up half the money and there is an idea prevalent at the moment that neither the city nor the county will have any director on the company.  We in Dublin are putting up half the money and binding ourselves to bearing half the loss.  Deputy McMenamin has given the House very useful information which throws a vivid light on this whole matter.  I was very much impressed by what the Deputy had to say.  Are we going to be made tools of to provide for an All-Red aerial route?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This company for which the money is now being asked will fit in as a section in the international route.  I do not know that the House really appreciated the significance of this measure when it was proposed.  I do not know if they ever foreshadowed how it was to be implemented. Now we are down to tin tacks and are asked to put up the money, and not only are we asked to have the money provided by the taxpayer but by two local authorities.  We are asked to put up subsidies and to stand in and bear the anticipated losses that are expected in the running of this air business.  The Minister knows quite well that the municipal authorities were opposed to their being brought into this.  He was made quite well aware of that by a long memorandum from the City Manager of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not think that the Port and Docks Board were enamoured of the scheme either.  We are only asked to vote £1,500 now.  That is the beginning, and only God knows what will be the ultimate cost.  Why not develop our own aerial transport here, or at least the little bit of it that we want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what the overriding consideration is.  It is one brick <Col N="1098" /> in the long wall.  Why should we put in that brick when we are going to get no return for it?  Why should not the country that is going to have the benefit of these air services pay for it themselves?  With all their resources the cost would be only a fly-blow to that country if they were to do the whole job themselves. If we give them the right-of-way, are we not giving enough?  Let them construct and maintain the airport.  The construction side, as pointed out by Deputy McMenamin, is out of our hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is not correct. I am not trying to make a case against the proposal.  I am merely looking for information.  If my suspicions are wrong, nobody will be more pleased to hear that than I shall be.  We are dealing with this matter in the corporation and in the county council, and we have gone a bit farther in the corporation in connection with it than in the county council.  I supported it in the county council, but there has been vigorous opposition to it.  This Estimate coming on now will not make matters easier for me or for those who supported the proposal in the county council.  I hope the Minister understands that I am quite friendly and sympathetic to our being associated with this proposition.  I want to be able to show other members of the council who have not the same opportunity for getting information that I have as a member of this House, that this is a project into which it is worth putting money.  At the same time, we must not be throwing money into a bottomless hole.  That would recoil upon those of us who are supporting the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to think that we have not made a very good bargain.  I feel very strongly that if we never bothered about airways or airports, such as that on the Shannon or this one at Collinstown, interested parties and countries would be only too glad to pay us for the privilege of travelling through our country and using it for this purpose. Instead of our spending money in this way, in all probability other countries would spend money here and pay us for <Col N="1099" /> the accommodation.  I may, of course, be wrong; but that is my view.  The Minister mentioned an Ottawa agreement. I presume that that was come to three or four years ago when four or five representatives of the Government went over to the conference at Ottawa. Was it then that this agreement was made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have more enlightenment on this proposal. I should like to know if the Minister has yet worked out any plan as regards the directorate of this company for which he is asking this Vote.  I should like to know also whether there is any great need for this aerial port development or whether there should be any great hurry to form this company. This company represents the beginning of the control of the airports.  I have not a shadow of doubt about that.  It may not be absolutely definite yet, but it is quite obvious that that is the thing to do, from the business point of view.  It would be just as much as we could do to get an efficient board of directors to manage the ports and the air services&mdash;men with the requisite technical knowledge to look after both arms of the enterprise.  It would make for efficiency to have the one company looking after both services and ports. I have not the least doubt that, no matter what individual will have Ministerial responsibility in this respect, these matters will be brought under one control.  Now that we are starting out on this matter, I think the Minister should give us his plan for nominating the board of directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the company we are proposing to form will have a monopoly of the operative services internally but will not be responsible for the airports.  It is rather difficult to make these two items square, because, as Deputy Belton has said, it is obvious that, when they will have control of air services, the municipalities <Col N="1100" /> having aerodromes or airports will have to look to this company for the operation of the services.  They will have a monopoly.  In the case of services to Limerick, Galway or Waterford, airports will have to be constructed at these centres or they will have to do without the services.  Why should not this company be invested with some responsibility, if it is going to develop internal air transport, for the construction of these airports in the more populous centres from which they expect to get traffic?  As it is, the corporation or urban authority will construct the aerodrome and it will be at the disposal of this company. Nobody else can use it.  There should be some linking of interests, and this company should do something towards the construction of these aerodromes or airports.  I am not now thinking of the transatlantic service.  I think that this company is getting off too lightly, in as much as it will have no responsibility for the airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be annual losses on these airports.  These losses are being guaranteed by the Government, on the one hand, and the local authorities on the other hand.  If you leave the control of the services entirely to this company, they may cut down their charges so low that it will put up the loss on the airports.  That would be a very natural thing for the company to do when they know they have a blank cheque from the municipal authorities and the Government wherewith to pay whatever losses the working of the airports will show.  The suggestion made by Deputy Keyes was, I think, a good one&mdash;that this company should be formed quickly, and that they should, in some way, be invested with responsibility for the money the Government is putting up.  Let it be decided at once that this company will look after the airports and be responsible for them, and that, through them, the Government money to construct the airports will be spent.  In making that suggestion, I am not giving away the case that those other bodies who are putting up money and who will undertake to meet some of the annual working loss should have some control over the directors and some voice in <Col N="1101" /> the directorate.  I think the suggestion made by Deputy Keyes was a very good one, namely, that the company should be formed quickly and the members of it got together.  They should be given responsibility for the handling of this money and the working of the port and airways.</P>

Imperial Airways has nothing to do with it, and transatlantic air services are not the reason for its establishment.  In fact, practically nothing that the Deputy said about it is correct.  An airport is required in Dublin as it is in any city the size of Dublin.  Because air transportation is developing, the State is taking the initiative in the creation of an airport here, the reason being that the corporation was unable to do it.  I do not say that the corporation would not be able to do it in time, but their immediate preoccupation is housing.  The absorption of all their credit resources as well as the labours of their technical staffs are at the moment concentrated on housing and similar activities.  This makes it impossible for them to undertake the possibility of establishing an airport here as a municipal airport, but apart from that there is the fact that there are other considerations which, perhaps, justified the creation of a port in the vicinity of Dublin as a State port.  The corporation are contributing to the cost of this airport which is going to serve all the functions of a municipal airport.  The municipalities all over Great Britain provide airports out of their resources.  The Dublin County Council are also contributing to the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This port is being established for the convenience of Dublin on the coast and not for any other purpose.  It will be used by the companies engaged in cross-Channel air services, and, possibly, by private flyers, and later on <Col N="1102" /> by other companies operating other services to and from the capital of Dublin to the capitals of other countries. The revenue of the port will be secured by the fees charged.</P>

      <P>Whoever is responsible for the management of the port.  It may be this company and it may not. I am not prepared to discuss that because there is nothing in this Estimate about it.  No decision has yet been made in relation to the arrangements that are going to be made for the management of the port, and the same applies to Rynanna.  Statements have been made here about Rynanna based on some false information given to some obscure journalist writing in some obscure journal.  Deputy McMenamin prefers to take information from that source rather than from responsible Ministers in this House, or the official records of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The port at Rynanna is being built by the Saorstát Government.  It is being built for the purpose of equipping the Saorstát with the necessary facilities for the development of civil aviation, both transatlantic services and other services for the continent. It is being built by the Saorstát because we would have objected strongly, and would certainly have refused, to facilitate any proposal by the British Government or any other government to erect, own and operate an airport of that size in this country. I disagree entirely with the suggestion made by Deputy Belton.  I think it was a matter of fundamental importance for us to insist that nobody would own or control that airport except the Government of the Saorstát. I am quite certain that we could have got the British Government or some other European Government to build that airport, control it and operate it, and run services from it if we were willing to let them, but I certainly think it would be a great national mistake for us to do that.  We are providing in the Saorstát a fully equipped airport, owned and controlled by the Saorstát, which will be available for <Col N="1103" /> any company operating in the Saorstát that requires to use that particular service.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin has got airport and air services and companies all mixed up, and he cannot distinguish one from the other.  Whenever air companies use that airport, they will pay whatever dues are decided on for that user.  It may be the Pan-American Company or the Joint Operating Company.  Deputy McMenamin should first of all get to distinguish clearly in his mind between the companies operating the service and the airport.  The companies which will use the airport may have their headquarters in New York or Newfoundland, but it will be our airport and they will pay us.  A general operating company is being established to operate the transatlantic services because we could not afford to run them ourselves.  We had to combine with some country such as Great Britain to secure that we would have an interest in and a share in the direction and management of this transatlantic air service when started, but we could not run it.  It would be ridiculous to think that we could afford the cost.  Neither could we control the traffic.  This service for many years will be run for the conveyance of mails, and the bulk of the mails which pass over the North Atlantic originate either in Great Britain or in the United States of America.  Unless the company operating this service was in a position to get the carrying of those mails it could not run it with any hope of making a profit from it.  We do not control that traffic.  Therefore, we have made another arrangement, and I think a very good arrangement, one which secures that transatlantic air services run by the Pan-American company will be run so as to make the Irish port the last port of call westwards and the first port of call eastwards. With it will be another company in which the Irish National Air Transport Company will be a substantial shareholder and in which they will have a considerable part of the direction and control.  That company has also contracted to use an Irish port <Col N="1104" /> as the last port of call outwards and the first port of call inwards in its transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>That is a satisfactory arrangement, particularly as the port they will be using can be made by us an important, if not the most important, air transport junction in the world.  That is going to depend on a number of factors of such a nature that one cannot be definite about it.  If the Shannon Air Port becomes, what we hope it will, an important junction of international air traffic, then we will make it so and nobody else, and that is going to involve us in considerable expenditure in providing there, first of all, an airport that will be fully equipped to deal with all the services that may avail of it, and, secondly, the establishment of this company with adequate capital resources to provide the services of the Shannon airport to the other countries, while linking up all the transatlantic air services and making them of advantage to the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>The desire to travel abroad and some of the other matters that were dealt with have no relation whatever to this Estimate.  This Estimate is merely to provide for the establishment of this company.  The primary purpose of the company will be to operate an air transport service.  If it should be decided to entrust the management of this State airport to this company it would still be because such a function would be only a minor part of the activities of this new company.  Its primary concern will be the operation of air services, and upon it we must rely for the development of civil aviation in this country.  We are entrusting this task to this company.  We are conferring upon it certain powers and rights, but we are also laying upon it the obligation to proceed along sound lines and to secure the maximum possible development of civil aviation here.  This is merely a beginning.  It is not possible to say who the directors will be, nor can any indication be given at the moment of the basis upon which they are likely to be selected.  Having regard to the fact that the main purpose of this company is to secure adequate and proper development of <Col N="1105" /> civil aviation, directors will be selected who are most likely to be in a position to contribute to that purpose, but their selection and appointment will be, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Finance who has that function under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to assume that air transport companies should provide airports. The Deputy tried to make an analogy between air transport companies and the railways, but I think there is hardly an analogy there.  I suggest that there would be more of an analogy between air transport companies and bus companies, and the latter do not have to provide the roads. It may be taken that the facilities of the company here will be used by an increasing number of private flyers, and it is quite possible that an airport might be established here in the future as a private venture for the convenience of private flyers or for the convenience of persons desiring to be trained in aviation.  If, for example, the Cork municipal authorities wanted to establish an airport there, I think they should do so, even though there is no immediate prospect of having a regular air service there.  It must be remembered that aviation is developing very considerably and that flights from one place to another are becoming very common and are likely to become increasingly so.  In other countries very great progress has been made in that direction, having regard to the comparatively recent development of aviation, and cities situated as Cork is, and with the ambitions of the citizens of Cork, should be provided, I think, with an airport, even if there were no immediate prospects of regular air services, because if they want to see these air services established, an airport must be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, Sir, if the Minister appreciates the effect of sub-section (2) of this section.  Sub-section (1) says:</P>
      <P>Save as is otherwise provided by this section, this Act applies to every postal packet which (a) is posted outside Saorstát Eireann, and (b) is addressed to the addressee at an address in Saorstát Eireann, and (c) purports to come from or to be sent by or on behalf of a person residing or carrying on business in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Now that is quite clear, but then sub-section (2) comes along and says:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-section of this section, this Act shall not apply to a postal packet which purports to come from or to be sent by or on behalf of a person who carries on business both in and outside Saorstát Eireann unless such postal packet purports to come or be sent only from an address, or all the addresses of such person in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>I think the effect of that sub-section is that a firm which carries on business here and has a branch or branches in Northern Ireland or England can circularise their customers here in the Free State from their addresses abroad.  I think it is perfectly plain that that is so, and, if that is so, I think it is very unfair to persons who are Saorstát Eireann traders only, and who are prevented by this Bill from sending their circulars in from outside the country and thus evading the difference in the postage as between this country and, say, Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  I think the Minister can hardly desire that, say, some of those multiple firms, who have branches both here and in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, should be placed at an advantage as against competitive traders here, who are entirely confined in their trading activities to the Saorstát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we have a reciprocal arrangement with other foreign countries whereby we carry their postage for them and they carry our postage for us.  Now, if a legitimate business concern posts from an address outside of Saorstát Eireann we do not interfere with that particular postal packet; but if, by any chance, a firm in England does post a packet and it purports to come from a branch only in the Saorstát, then we would take action.  That, however, would hardly arise&mdash;I do not think it would arise&mdash;because naturally, as the Deputy himself mentioned, multiple shops will have their ordinary type of letter headings and it would be clear <Col N="1108" /> on that that the particular parcel or packet or circular was emanating from the branch in England and not from a branch in Ireland that was sending its post to England to evade the postage in Ireland.  I think that should make that clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would bear with me for a moment. Let us take, say, well-known firms such as the Home and Colonial, or Lipton's, or firms of that kind.  They have headquarters in England or somewhere outside the Saorstát.  Suppose they send out a circular from their headquarters, drawing the attention of a great number of people in this circular to Home and Colonial tea, or Home and Colonial this, that and the other, or Lipton's teas, on the other hand.  They will not purport to come from the branch here in Ireland by any means, but at the same time everybody who gets that circular will know the local Home and Colonial stores, or the local Lipton's store or the local multiple store, which has a headquarters from which this circular comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that they will do it, but they are put in a more favoured position thereby than the native firm which does all its trading in this country because, undoubtedly, if they wanted to circularise the customers in particular areas in a big way&mdash;I do not say that they do that&mdash; they could, in that way, certainly save a good deal of money on postage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not legislate against any concern that has a business headquarters, or a business, in England or Northern Ireland or any other foreign country.  We are under obligation to the International Postal Convention to carry the legitimate postage of these particular nations. As I say, therefore, we cannot take any legislative action against that particular type of person because of the fact that we have that reciprocal arrangement.  It might appear, as the <Col N="1109" /> Deputy suggests, not quite fair, but what I would like to point out is that we are only, through this Bill, attempting to make people here in the Saorstát do what we believe is their bounden duty, that is to give the administration here the revenue that they are sending to foreign countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I said I would give an estimate, but I said that I would do what I could. What we have found out is that in one case, of which we were aware, there was a loss of £500 per annum.  That was a regularly recurring happening, an annual happening.  In another case which does not appear to have been an annual happening, there was a loss of £160 approximately.  There was a number of other such cases which we have not followed up from the point of view of forming an estimate of the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it fair that the trader of Saorstát Eireann should be put at a disadvantage as compared with the trader who has only a branch establishment here.  It appears to me that he is put at that disadvantage and the Minister has not put forward any proposal whereby that state of affairs can be levelled up.  I would be glad if he could tell us some way of getting over the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot do that, because, as I pointed out to Deputy Lynch, these outside people are acting legitimately in their own country. What we strongly object to is the practice of our nationals going over to a foreign country and utilising the cheaper postal rates there to the detriment of our revenue.  We are bringing in this Bill to prevent evasions of that kind.  Practically every other country in the world has some legislation of the same type dealing with this problem.</P>

      <P>It certainly does appear unfair to the ordinary Deputy that the Minister should in present circumstances introduce a Bill for the purpose of penalising some few people who are trying to evade the postal regulations in this country at the moment.  We hear a good deal recently in Dublin about multiple shops. Apparently these multiple shops are about to increase their activities in Dublin.  They will be assisted in that direction by the fact that they can evade the postal regulations here and avail of the cheaper postal factlities on the other side.  There seems to be a certain element of injustice in that as far as our own traders are concerned. The people whom the Minister is trying to penalise by this Bill have to live in competition with these other large traders who are being facilitated by an international convention to build up their trade in this country.  I think that in the circumstances the Minister would have been better advised to leave this Bill alone altogether and try to meet the difficulties with which the Bill is intended to deal by some other method or by availing of some Departmental regulations.  Obviously there is an element of injustice in it so far as native traders are concerned.</P>

      <P>I take it that it is too late to object to the general principle of the Bill, but at the same time one can make the same point on sub-section (2) as was made on the Second Reading of the Bill.  The Minister, I recollect, quoted some figures showing the profits of the Post Office over a number of years, and he said that for last year it had shown a greater profit than ever before.  I think the figures were in the region of £400,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what view is generally taken as to what the aim of the Post Office with regard to profits should be, but it seems to me an extraordinary proposition, at first <Col N="1112" /> sight, that the Post Office should aim at making profits at all seeing what the nature of the service is.  It is a monopoly, of course, but it is supposed to be conducted entirely for the benefit of the people.  Why should it be the aim in any such service to make a profit seeing that it is for the service of the people?  Surely the Minister would be able to overcome the necessity for introducing this Bill by devoting portion of the profits towards reducing the postal rates?  I understand that one-third of the profits would be sufficient to enable the postal rates to be reduced to the British level, thus obviating the necessity for such a Bill as this.  I am not aware of what the Minister's outlook on this matter is, but he is head of the Department and on Second Reading he appeared to glory in the fact that the Post Office, which showed a deficit of £1,000,000 at one time, has now got into the position when it can show a profit of £317,000. He has bettered his position by £1,317,000 in the course of ten years. I think when it was seen that the Post Office had a credit balance that was the time to start out to see if anything could be done to reduce the postal rates.  For my own part, I may be abysmally ignorant on this subject, but I do not see why every penny made over and above the achievement of a balance should not be put into reduced postal rates.  I would like to hear the Minister on that point, if he thinks it relevant at this stage.</P>

      <P>That seems to be a very long time.  This thing has been delayed quite a considerable period.  I agree it was delayed for a big number of years during our time, but I understand there is a certain amount of uneasiness in the Army in regard to this matter.  They feel that it should have been introduced some time ago, and they are afraid that either the Minister for Finance or someone else is holding up the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the attention of Deputies to the fact that <Col N="1114" /> in the Book of Estimates for the coming year now being distributed, the figures set down for the salaries of the President, Ministers and others are those fixed by law&mdash;not the sums hitherto provided and taken by the President, Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle, the Attorney-General and others since the present Government came into office.  This does not mean that the Ministers and others affected will, during the period of office still to expire, accept the statutory scales.  They will accept the same net sums as heretofore. A general election, however, is due to take place during the coming financial year, and I am convinced that it is in the public interest that before the election, and before the new Constitution is put into operation, the question of the position and remuneration of the whole-time public representatives should be fully examined. At some stage, therefore, when the new Constitution is under discussion, I shall propose the setting up of an independent commission to inquire into the matter of the remuneration of Ministers and other such officers as will function under the new Constitution. The Dáil will then, on receipt of the report, be asked to take a decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>The procedure is that the President or a Minister is entitled to make a statement, but a discussion must not be developed in relation to anything contained in the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I freely confess I am to be guided by you, Sir, because I do not know what the correct procedure is.  It may, however, be of advantage to make a short statement from the Opposition Benches in order that there may arise nowhere any misapprehension as to our attitude in regard to the course the President proposes to pursue.  I understand that the proposal is to bring Ministerial remuneration more into line with what is reasonable. I know an attempt might be made to make political capital out of <Col N="1115" /> that.  In our judgment the remuneration of the President's Ministers and his predecessors bore no relation to the services they rendered, and I should like to say that we will cordially approve the inquiry into a more satisfactory basis of remuneration for Ministers serving this State in the future, whether that takes the form of an immediate increase in their present salaries or of a different salary, with some pension system which will make provision for those who spent the best years of their lives in the service of the State, and were then obliged to earn their living as best they could after the State no longer required their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President made a statement to-day in relation to the Coal-Cattle Pact. He was perfectly explicit in regard to its major provisions.  He also said it was intended to make some minor alterations in the rates of duty payable on cattle.  It would be of immense public importance if the President would amplify that now, for this reason.  Suppose there is any proposal to alter the scales of duty on the different ages of cattle, it might be possible for a man to make a corner in beasts of an age which were going to benefit under any new adjustment.  At present a beast with four teeth pays one rate of duty; a beast with two permanent teeth pays another rate of duty, and the beast without any permanent teeth pays a third rate of duty. This operates under existing circumstances unduly to depress the price of the beast with four permanent teeth. If there was any proposal to have a flat level of duty for the three classes it would be immensely advantageous to a man to go out and buy the beast with four permanent teeth at its present depressed price, as the value would appreciate considerably if there was a flat rate.  It is therefore not desirable that the matter should be made the subject of speculation between now and a date after to-night, because there might arise to-morrow morning a highly undesirable type of speculation either in rural markets or on the farms, the more outlying farms of people who would be left without any guidance as <Col N="1116" /> to what sort of adjustment the two Governments had in mind.  I think the President will understand how desirable it is that information of that kind should be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire from the President whether the inquiry which he has in mind in connection with the remuneration of Ministers is to be limited purely to the question of remuneration or whether it is possible to extend the scope of the inquiry so as to include other matters?  For instance, the question, possibly, of a retiring allowance for Ministers who have served the State for a long period.  Is it possible to have that matter included within the scope of the projected inquiry?  I raise that matter for this reason.  This State has been well served by the people who have been called to its service in the capacity of Ministers.  Many of them have served the State for a substantial period, the first set for ten years.  I do not think I am breaking any confidence when I say that many of these people are poor by reason of the fact that they served the State during that period.  Some of them, after serving the State for a long period, found it was not easy to adjust themselves to private and commercial life.  Some who have served the State in the capacity of Ministers, possibly suffered substantial losses by reason of the fact that they were called to the service of the State in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar position might arise under this Ministry.  Ministers may be required to serve for a period of ten or perhaps 15 years, and at the end of that period, having neglected their private and their professional work, they will be then, if they cease to be members of the Executive Council, required to adjust themselves to private and commercial conditions.  Again, I fear that in that case those who have served the State will suffer losses somewhat comparable to those suffered by Ministers who served from 1922 to 1932.  I think there will be general agreement by all Parties in the House that some provision should be made for Ministers in that connection, and the cost of doing it would be negligible so far as the community is concerned.  On the <Col N="1117" /> other hand, a provision of that kind will remove instances of genuine hardship, and I think the whole community would gladly pay whatever sum might be involved in order to treat fairly those who, according to their lights, irrespective of the Party of which they were members, served the community to the best of their ability.  I suggest to the President that in this matter he ought not to be conservative.  I feel that there will be a general measure of agreement amongst all Parties to treat fairly those who served the State faithfully.</P>

      <P>The matter of the Coal-Cattle Pact as mentioned by Deputy Dillon, is very important at the present moment.  The President definitely stated that adjustments had been made, and I think the House and the country ought to know what the adjustments are with regard to the cattle.  At the present time there is a tariff of from £4 downwards on certain cattle.  We want to know what adjustments have been made in regard to the cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, personally I do not know the details of the adjustment and I shall, therefore, ask the Minister for Agriculture to give the House any information that he has on that matter, so that perhaps I will be excused from dealing with it.  With <Col N="1118" /> regard to the question raised by Deputy Norton, I may say that I have had all these considerations in mind.  When putting the Estimates on the statutory scale in the book of Estimates, I thought it was advisable to draw attention to this particular matter at this particular time.  I think it is the right and proper time to do it.  I have not, however, thought out the details of the terms of reference to be given to the commission, but I think they ought to be sufficiently wide so that they will take into consideration the points mentioned by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>These details only concern quotas.  The tariffs are not changed so far as bacon, pigs and cattle are concerned.  I had the figures here as I thought a question would be raised but, unfortunately, I sent them back to the Department. Roughly, speaking from memory, we exported about 500,000 stores in the last year; 126,000 fat cattle, I think, and between 14,000 and 15,000 dry cows and bulls.  That was more than the quota allowed last year in the case of stores&mdash;considerably more.  This year we will have the right, as it were, to export the same number of stores as we exported last year, slightly more fats and slightly more dry cows and bulls, provided the other arrangements work out as they worked out last year with regard to coal, which I think may be taken for granted.  We have a 5 per cent. increase in the quota for bacon.  These are the only changes in quotas.  There is no change in the tariffs, except the one mentioned, and that is on horses.</P>
