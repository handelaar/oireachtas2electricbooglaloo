    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether any preparations have been made by the Executive Council or by the several Departments of State concerned for discussions and proposals at the Imperial Conference to be held this year with reference to (1) foreign affairs and defence; (2) constitutional questions; (3) trade, shipping and air communications and allied questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see from the reply which he will receive to his question addressed to the Minister for External Affairs regarding the Saorstát's representation at the Imperial Conference, that the question of preparation does not yet arise.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Saorstát representatives will be in a position to discuss questions of interest to this country should an occasion for such discussion occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the Government of Saorstát Eireann was consulted with reference to the preparation of the agenda for the Imperial Conference to be held this year and, if so, whether he will state what suggestions, if any, were made by our Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (the President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (the President)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government of Saorstát Eireann were duly informed of the questions which it was proposed to discuss at the forthcoming Imperial Conference.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann did not suggest any question for discussion at the Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Minister for External Affairs, did the Government of the Saorstát accept the terms of reference suggested by the other participants in the Conference, or did they decline them, or did they indicate that they had no interest in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not accept and they did not reject, and did not indicate definitely at any rate that they had no interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to say that the dignified position taken up was that they wobbled like a table jelly and are still wobbling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether the Government of Saorstát Eireann will be represented at the Imperial Conference to be held in London this year, and, if so, by whom; and if no decision has yet been reached in this matter, when will such decision be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply given to the Deputy in answer to similar questions on the 17th February and 11th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister for External Affairs that the Executive Council have not yet reached any decision as to whether they are going to take part in the conference or reached any decision as to when it is expedient to make up their minds as to whether they will join in the proceedings of the Imperial Conference or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy on the last occasion, the necessity for a decision has not arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I consider this a matter of some gravity, I beg to give notice that I shall raise it on the motion for the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of policy.  Furthermore, it is too wide in scope to be raised on the adjournment.  It is obviously not the type of question contemplated under the procedure provided for raising questions on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a submission in regard to that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair is aware, I have put down an analogous question on two previous occasions, and on each of those occasions the Minister for External Affairs stated that the Executive Council had not yet made up their minds.  On this third occasion I have put the question in two parts: (1), What was their decision and (2), if no decision had been arrived at, when will such a decision be taken.  The President's reply to that is that he has nothing further to add. May I not raise the question on the adjournment as to whether it is proper treatment of Parliament that a matter of such vital importance should be left in doubt at such a time as this, and that the President should refuse to submit to the ordinary parliamentary discipline of question and answer, even when he does not <Col N="4" /> want to make an answer to a question put from the front Opposition Bench?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which the Deputy considers to be of such vital importance is undoubtedly a question of policy and may not be raised on the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Chair indicate in what way Deputy Dillon may get the information which he requires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a function of the Chair to give any such indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully submit that the President has not indicated that it is a matter of policy at all.  It is a question of whether we are going to be represented at a particular conference or not.  If the Chair permits it, the submission which I wish to make, whether the Government Front Bench like it or not, is this: that the question of policy was dealt with by the President on another occasion when he said that the first Article of the Constitution of the Saorstát remained.  That was policy&mdash;whether we were to remain in the Commonwealth or not.  Now, being in the Commonwealth, it is a question of administration whether he is going to attend the conference in London or not.  That is my submission: that the House is entitled to be informed whether the Executive Council intends the Government to be represented and, if so, by whom?  I submit that is not a question of policy but of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would help the Deputy if I say that, in my opinion, it should be obvious to every member of the House that, in the existing circumstances, it would be of no advantage to our country to be represented at the Imperial Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair, in deciding that this matter should not be raised upon the adjournment, was not influenced by the form or matter of the Minister's reply, but by the facts of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="5" /> if he had yet arrived at a decision in connection with the representations made to him by the Council of Municipal Councils, that subsidies should be paid to local authorities on houses costing over £300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that local authorities are very much perturbed by the fact that building costs are increasing rapidly, could the Parliamentary Secretary give any information as to when we may expect a decision on this important matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he would arrange for the making and exhibiting in a suitable place of a graph, showing the average time involved in the providing schemes of (a) houses, and (b) blocks of flats in Dublin, to a scale of, say, 1/8&rdquo; high for one week's time elapsed, under the following heads:&mdash;(1) acquisition of site, (2) preparation of plans, (3) preparation of bills of quantities for tendering, (4) the period allowed for getting in prices and making out tenders, (5) consideration of tenders from time of receipt of same, (6) obtaining approval of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, (7) placing contracts after approval is received, (8) laying out of sites, including sewers, roads, etc., (9) any delays existing which do not come under any of the foregoing heads to complete the period elapsed from first consideration of a scheme, (10) actual construction of (a) houses and (b) blocks of flats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative. The particulars sought by the Deputy are being compiled in tabular <Col N="6" /> form and will be forwarded to him when completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if all schemes for housing in the City of Dublin offered for tender have been tendered for and contracts placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that all the schemes for which tenders were recently sought by the Corporation have been tendered for and contracts therefor are being entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what proportion in the City of Dublin of the programme for housing contemplated for the last four years has been offered for tender, viz., for 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no specified number of houses to be provided yearly before 1934.  In 1933-34 the number of dwellings erected was 847.  For the three years 1934-35, 1935-36 and 1936-37 the number of dwellings to be provided was estimated at 1,859, 2,000 and 1,900 approximately.  The full number of houses was completed in 1934-35 and 65 per cent. of the programme in 1935-36.  The final figures are not available for 1936-37, but it is expected that the proportion will be about 78 per cent. of the estimated number of dwellings to be erected in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, the question asks if all the houses contemplated were tendered for and placed&mdash;that is, that none were contemplated or put out for tender that were not taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that in recent invitations to tender for (a) houses, and (b) blocks of flats, a period for completion has been stipulated for by the Dublin Corporation inviting the tenders, and if he will state if this course is the only proper and satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the second part, the stipulation regarding a time limit for the completion <Col N="7" /> of contracts follows a long established practice in this country, and I see no reason at present to suggest another method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWalterBeckett" hpid="Mr. Beckett Mr. Beckett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state what is the programme for housing of the Dublin Corporation in 1937-8 for houses and flats which is now ready to be put in hands on sites approved and available, and how many of each of the following trades, viz.:&mdash;carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, plumbers, slaters and tilers, and labourers, does he anticipate will be required to complete them in the time required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position is that sites are available for about 2,000 dwellings.  When these are placed under contract it is estimated there will be employed thereon 150 bricklayers, 300 carpenters, 200 plasterers, 65 plumbers, 20 slaters and tilers, and 1,100 labourers.</P>

      <P>I am aware that during the week ended March 13th the retail price of a certain class of household coal sold in north County Dublin was 2/9 per bag, equivalent to 44/- per ton. I am aware that the average pit-head price of coal in Great Britain was 13/2 per ton, but this average includes cheap slack and duff selling at 5/- to 6/- per ton at pit-head, and also steam and gas coals, which are from 4/- to 7/- per ton cheaper than household coals. Consequently, the average pit-head price of household coals would be considerably <Col N="11" /> higher than 13/2 per ton. The average c.i.f. value of household coal imported during the month of January last was 26/6 per ton.  I may state that both the import prices and the retail prices of coal are under constant review, and I am satisfied that at the moment undue profits are not being taken in the sale of coal.</P>

      <P>Has any information been drawn under the Minister's personal notice as to the condition of the carriages provided on the Mullingar-Sligo division of the line?  There is no doubt that the travelling accommodation provided for travellers on that line is a public scandal, and has been the subject of repeated representation <Col N="13" /> to the traffic department of the Railway Company.  In view of the fact that the railway has now a monopoly, does the Minister not think that he ought to take action himself, either by way of representation, or such other action as may be necessary, to secure a reasonably adequate service for people travelling on that part of the line?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask the traffic department of the company whether it is true that numerous complaints have reached them?  If he does, I think he will find that an immense number of complaints have reached them.  In that connection, I suggest that he should bear in mind that the average travelling public do not care to bother the Minister about details of the condition of the railway carriages, and therefore complaints may not be addressed to him.  I therefore ask him if he will apply to the management of the Railway Company so that he may get all the complaints in one lump and be spared the annoyance of repeated individual communications.</P>

This increase is made up of a number of items, mainly as follows (a) Minister's salary net increase £550; (b) some additions to the office staff, chiefly a legal assistant and a staff officer.  The others are routine increases in the salary scales of various officers and an increase of £1,000 approximately in the estimated amount for cost-of-living bonus.  As regards sub-head (a) 4&mdash; Drafting of Rules of Court&mdash;this refers specially to the making of new appeal rules, and generally to the revision of the whole code of High Court rules, the latter a heavy undertaking which is long overdue and which it is hoped to commence this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain matters on these Estimates to which I have referred on previous occasions in which I take a particular interest. The first matter that I want to refer to is a general question that arises out of a commission of inquiry that was set up, oddly enough, by the Department of Education on matters relating largely to the Department of Justice. A preliminary observation which I should like to make is this, that steps should be taken at an early date to put an end to the dual responsibility of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education for the care of juvenile delinquents.  At the present time we have the extraordinary situation, under which Children's Courts, reformatories and the Borstal Institution come within the scope of the Department of Justice, but places of detention for juvenile delinquents and industrial schools come within the scope of the Minister for Education.  At the moment I am not quite sure whether reformatories do not come under the Department of Education.  Perhaps the Minister would inform me.  I think they do.  The Borstal Institution does not, being under the Department of Justice, with the result that when representations are made one is told in the Department of Justice that it is a matter for the Department of Education and in the Department of Education that it is a matter for the Department of Justice.  When any drastic suggestion is made both Departments say they would be glad to fall in with it, with the result that it is almost impossible to get anything done.  I need hardly add that if one could trick both of them into doing anything while both of them agree that it ought to be <Col N="21" /> done they say the Department of Finance will not allow them so that the thing has become a morass, in which it is very difficult to get anything done.  Nevertheless, the situation is one which is in urgent need of reform and attention.  The first matter for which the Minister for Justice is clearly responsible is the Children's Court.  The matter was discussed at some length before the Commission of Inquiry into the reformatory and industrial school system which was held under the chairmanship of Mr. Cussen, but I cannot find in the records of the House anything in the way of a verbatim report of the evidence given before that commission.  I do not know whether it is available. It is not in the Library so that one is rather handicapped in examining this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make a few concrete suggestions to the Minister: (1) I want the system of juvenile delinquents being tried in a court-room done away with, and (2) I want juvenile delinquents to be brought before a district justice sitting in his room at a desk much as a headmaster at school would interview delinquent pupils.  I suggest that members of the Gárda Síochána who are in charge of these cases should attend the proceedings in plain clothes. I make that suggestion because, these children who are, in many cases, of tender years are brought before these Children's Courts in circumstances naturally of great psychological stress, dismay and unhappiness, and I think it is undesirable to associate with the child mind the uniform of the Gárda Síochána, as great mental distress must affect it in the circumstances I have outlined.  That may appear to some people to be unimportant.  I consider it to be a matter of very considerable importance.  Thirdly, I want the public rigidly excluded from the proceedings conducted before the children's district justice.  At the present time, the public are excluded generally except by special permission of the presiding justice, but the parents of other children whose cases are awaiting adjudication and other children themselves are admitted to <Col N="22" /> the court and are sitting in the court when the proceedings take place. Inevitably, at the conclusion of these proceedings when it is necessary to remove a child to the house of detention, or even to an industrial school, there is bound to be a distressing scene in which very often a child's mother is greatly affected and very often the children themselves are crying and in a state of great mental distress.  I say that it is highly undesirable to have other parents and other children witnesses of that, when they are due themselves to embark on an exactly similar ordeal.</P>
    <P>However, I believe the fundamental necessity for publicity in legal proceedings is so valuable that it should not be absolutely waived even in the case of these Children's Courts and, therefore, I would not advocate any prohibition on admission to the Press. I have no doubt whatever that the Press will in the future, as they have in the past, exercise a prudent discretion and report no more than is necessary to report of such proceedings. It is good that the Press should be there and that the public should be the ultimate guardian of the due administration of the law as a result of getting full information as to the proceedings, in so far as it is necessary to publish them, through the Press.  I am glad to see that the Minister has recently filled the vacant post of the officer who looks after the children in one way or another, and I take this opportunity of complimenting him on a most excellent appointment which, I think, all persons interested in this work would concur in saying was as good an appointment as has been made in the Department of Justice for many a long day.</P>
    <P>The next matter in connection with the Children's Court to which I direct attention is that while we have probation officers in Dublin, I understand that no such officer is available in Cork, Waterford, Limerick or any other urban centre.  I fully recognise the difficulties, because the amount of juvenile delinquency in those centres may be very small and it is hard to find occupation for a full-time <Col N="23" /> officer.  Nevertheless, I feel that a point should be stretched and that where there is anything like sufficient work to occupy the time of an officer, a probation officer to assist the district justice in the care of these children should be provided.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention is the Borstal institution and the reformatory.  I had hoped that the reformatory would have been done away with altogether and that the children at present being sent to the reformatory would be committed to some approved school, under the new system of approved schools, which would cater for all delinquent children who are at present being sent either to industrial schools or to reformatories. I do not want to recapitulate every word that was spoken before the commission of inquiry into this whole question, and accordingly, I do not intend to go further into the question of approved schools than to suggest to Deputies who are interested in this problem that they should get a copy of the evidence given before the Commission of Inquiry into Reformatories and Industrial Schools, 1934-36.  There they will find a very full exposé of proposals which would remove the undesirable stigma of pseudo-imprisonment from children whom it was found necessary to send either to reformatories or to industrial schools.</P>
    <P>However, in the meantime, I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  If it is not intended to abolish the reformatories for the time being, would the Minister consider putting both the Borstal institution, which, of course, must be kept separate from reformatories, and the reformatories themselves under the direction of some religious Order which, primarily, devotes itself to the education of the young?  There are many religious Orders in the Church who have various missions.  I think it is of great importance that we should keep constantly before our minds that the primary purpose of reformatories and, indeed, Borstals, is not the punishment of delinquents but <Col N="24" /> their redemption from the difficulties into which they have got, very often through no fault of their own.  Keeping that view before our minds, we must remember the immense difficulty of the task.  It is not a question of educating normal children.  It is not a question of equipping ordinary boys for the battle of life.  It is a question of unteaching children almost everything they have learned and then teaching them in the right way.  Anyone who has any knowledge or experience of this work knows that unteaching the children is the hardest part of the job.  The hardest part of the work is getting them to change their whole outlook on life, altering their whole standards and getting them to recognise that many of the things that in their cunning they regarded as good things to do were very bad things.  The first part of the work is teaching them how to do the right thing and, second, how to earn their living in whatever trade or occupation they take up.  Therefore, I believe in concrete suggestions and I would be very glad if the Minister for Justice would invoke the assistance of the Society of Jesus or the Salesian Fathers&mdash;the Don Bosco Fathers. Both of these Orders have given abundant proof of their capacity for undertaking the impossible and carrying it through successfully.  When we are dealing with these difficult cases I feel that we stand in need of the best help we can get.  Both of these religious Orders have reputations for undertaking any task, however distasteful and impossible it may appear, provided they are satisfied it is right to do so.  I am convinced that if the Minister asked their assistance he would get it, and, in getting it, he would go a long way towards solving the very grave problem that confronts him and those in his position in dealing with these children.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from that question, I ask the House to remember this&mdash;that the supervision of an institution like a Borstal or a reformatory is extremely difficult.  It is even much more difficult than the supervision of a prison.  The general supervision of a prison by the public is conducted through the visiting <Col N="25" /> committees, who hear the complaints, if any, of the prisoners, and redress them if redress is necessary. Where you are dealing with a reformatory and a Borstal institution, you are dealing in many cases with children; and set over against the children, if the institution is run by laymen, you are dealing with trusted public servants. Supervision by these trusted public servants is terribly difficult. Suppose, for instance, that one of the delinquent children makes a bitter complaint. You have the situation that the child, probably, has been proved before a police court to be a notorious liar. It has been proved before the police court that he has repeatedly got into serious trouble, and that he would never have gone to the reformatory or the Borstal institution unless he was regarded by the magistrate as practically hopeless.  The testimony of such a child, judging it from the human standpoint, is practically worth nothing. Nevertheless, some great abuse may have crept in, and you are in this dilemma, that it is impossible to satisfy your mind that the allegations made by the children have absolutely no foundation. Now, no matter what you do, you can never completely remove that element of doubt.  But it is different where you get an institution run by a religious Order, which in the course of its administration is subject to the supervision of the Department of Justice, and in addition you have its superiors constantly vigilant to see that the members of their Order carry out, in the spirit of the law, the mission they have undertaken.  Then you have undoubtedly a further and more effective check on the procedure of this institution than any bureaucratic supervision can provide.  I do not wish to labour that point further.  I do not think I could elucidate it much if I did. Here again those interested in that matter will readily grasp the point I make, and they will, I think, appreciate it.  It is of immense importance to appreciate this point thoroughly.  I cannot emphasise it too strongly.  It is with very great reluctance that I depart from it, but those interested in this matter will understand its immense <Col N="26" /> significance just as readily as if I talked about it for an hour.</P>
    <P>The next question raised before this Committee on Industrial and Reformatory Schools is the question of a Borstal for women. That is a very difficult question.  I have no hesitation in saying that the establishment of a Borstal for women is a very urgent question.  The number of such women is very few; it is, therefore, going to be a very expensive thing, comparatively speaking, to run such an institution.  However, that should not stand in our way for a moment when we appreciate the gravity of the evil it will abate.  At the present time if a young girl of 17, 18 or 19 years of age goes wrong and gets into the hands of the police, and the police know that the girl has got into very bad company, they are faced with a very difficult problem.  The girl is perhaps of a very weak nature, and she is heading for her destruction. If the police bring her before the court, they find themselves in this dilemma, that they have either to send her to Mountjoy or release her altogether. There is no middle course.  There is no industrial school to which she could be sent.  She may be too old for the reformatory.  The Justice, perhaps, is very reluctant to send her to prison. He is in this position that he knows he can send her to prison or he may know that there is a man of disreputable character waiting outside in the street and if he releases that girl that man will follow her down and take her back into the situation out of which she had been rescued, and nothing can be done about it.  The Justice may say to her, &ldquo;If I let you off, will you give an undertaking to go into an institution and stay there for a year or two or three years?&rdquo;  and the girl may say, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and she may then go away with the Gárda to that institution and enter it, but having entered it, she may leave it in a week.  There is no means of preventing her doing so.  If the Justice makes up his mind that he cannot contemplate allowing the girl to go out into the world again in her present state, he must send her to Mountjoy.  No matter how much segregation is attempted there, you <Col N="27" /> may have some decent little girl, who has got into trouble through bad company or through lack of proper supervision, brought into association in Mountjoy with hardened old warriors who have been up 40 or 50 times in the Dublin Police Courts and who regard Mountjoy as their second home.  You bring her into contact with that class of people and you may make her a jail-bird for the rest of her life.  If you had a Borstal institution, and if a Justice were satisfied that a misdemeanour had been committed, and that it was in the best interests of the girl to prevent her going straight back into the life of the city, she could be sent to that Borstal institution where she would find herself in decent surroundings and equipped to walk straight into a job when she came out&mdash;a job in which she could earn a reasonably good living right from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  There is all the difference in the world between discharging a girl from a Borstal institution and discharging her from a prison.  We all know that the prison after-care committees do all they can to look after women coming out of prison and get them jobs.  But the difficulties are immense.  There is a vast difference in the case of a well-run Borstal institution.  The girls come out healthy and well looked after, with some kind of proper outlook on life, and, usually, with a good training for some kind of work for which the superintendent has discovered they are well fitted temperamentally. Girls of that kind do remarkably well.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain, where you have a great urban population which is particularly difficult to deal with, you have, I think, as high a percentage as 87 of successes in the Borstal institutes. That means that eight out of every ten girls discharged from Borstal institutes have never got into the hands of the police again.  That is an immense measure of success.  Even 45 per cent. of successes would be very good but 80 per cent. is immense.  It would be no reflection on the Borstal institutes if the percentage of successes was much lower, because we have got to recognise that the material upon which they <Col N="28" /> have to work is, usually, poor material &mdash;weak, wayward creatures who were in difficulties before Borstal ever got their hands on them.  There, again, if I were to talk for half an hour, I do not think I could make more manifest the urgent necessity for providing some place other than Mountjoy where you can send a girl who is in need of treatment, care and discipline.  One could paint lurid pictures of these cases, but the position is as well known to Deputies who are interested in this problem as it is to me.  Doubtless, the Minister has had many memoranda laid before him. The matter is urgent, and I press the Minister strongly to have something done.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the other matters arising under the head of &ldquo;juvenile delinquency&rdquo; must be raised on another Vote.  Otherwise, there are several matters which I and other Deputies would like to discuss here and now.  There are three or four minor matters which I want to refer to on this Vote.  On a previous occasion, I directed the attention of the Minister to the fact that transfer to the Gaeltacht at the present time for an Irish-speaking Guard is a penalty.  He is, perhaps, taken from the suburbs of Dublin and put in a Gárda station in Annagry or Belmullet.  For any young man, particularly a young man with a wife and family who like company and so forth, to be transferred to the back of beyond is poor compensation for becoming proficient in the Irish language. I have no hesitation in saying that, if I were in the Gárda Síochána at the present time, I should zealously conceal the fact that I knew a word of Irish, because I should know perfectly well that if it came to the knowledge of my superiors that I did, I should be immediately transported to the wilderness and would find in that wilderness no compensation, good, bad or indifferent, except some small percentage increase in the pay.  I want to see Irish-speaking public officials in the Gaeltacht.  It is eminently desirable that members of the Gárda Síochána in the Gaeltacht should be good Irish speakers.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he might start there a scheme which, subsequently, he might <Col N="29" /> consider extending over the rest of the country.  If there is one thing in a rural area that presents continual difficulty to responsible people, it is the provision of some centre where you can be certain that young people will engage in healthy, well-regulated and decent amusement without supervision by their elders.  The great difficulty is that if you let young people gather together in that way for afternoons or evenings, they may get into some mischief or other, and the whole business may end up in a row.  There is no use in advocating that mothers and fathers should go out and sit like tombstones around the scene of the amusements because the net result of that is that nobody will enjoy himself.  The old people will be bored stiff and perished with the cold, and the young people will either take to their heels or swear that they will never come to such an assignation again.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view&mdash;contrary to the opinion of some of my colleagues in this House&mdash;that the Gárda barracks could profitably be made a centre round which decent, parochial amusements would freely circulate.  The average Guard is a decent man.  He is not a prude, but he is a decent fellow who conducts himself properly.  You can trust him to allow nothing to go on in his company which would be scandalous or improper.  At the same time, he is not above having a bit of fun with the other fellows.  I should like to see the young people of the country, if they wanted decent amusement and were not out for &ldquo;devilment,&rdquo; encouraged to seek that amusement in and about the Gárda stations and with the Guards.  It would be a good thing to get into the minds of the young people, particularly, that the Guards are not the enemies of the people; that they are their friends, and that, if they are in trouble or difficulty, a very good person to consult is a member of the Guards.  One thing might be done in this connection&mdash;build ball alleys as part of the barrack accommodation, at least in the Gárda stations in the Gaeltacht. The scheme I have in mind at present is primarily designed for the Gaeltacht, in order to increase the <Col N="30" /> amenities of the Gárda stations there and compensate Guards for the loss of whatever comforts they enjoyed in a more central station prior to transfer to the Gaeltacht.  If a sports field could be provided in a rural area like that, it would be a very good thing to get such a field near the Gárda barracks.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in coddling people or in giving men more than it is reasonable to expect.  I do not want to turn the Gárda barracks into boudoirs of joy; but I do say that you have got to do something if you are going to make these Gaeltacht Gárda stations reasonably attractive, and by making them attractive you can kill two birds with the one stone.  You can, first of all, reconcile members of the Gárda Síochána, who have to go there, to their fate, and secondly, you can provide very useful amusement centres for parishes in those remote areas, which are very often deplorably deficient in any decent amusement.  I cannot expect that a plan of that kind is going to appeal very much to a person who does not know the Gaeltacht areas such as we have in the western parts of Ireland, but the Minister for Justice knows them very well.  I suggest these two birds require killing, and the stone I offer the Minister will at least do the job somehow or another, and, unless he can formulate a better stone, I ask him to give the suggestions that I have thrown out the benefit of his consideration.</P>
    <P>There are two or three categorical questions which I would like to put to the Minister.  The first is, what are the statistics of work in the High Court over the last four or five years, and is there any evidence of increasing work in the High Courts which would justify additional High Court judicial appointments? The second is, can anything be done by way of survey to restore to the Registry of Title the information that was destroyed in the fire that destroyed the Record Office 15 years ago?  At the present time I find, in connection with my work on the Roscommon County Board of Health, that when you are trying to acquire a piece of land, the title of which is registered <Col N="31" /> in the Registry of Title, it is virtually impossible to get a map annexed, because you are told in the Registry of Title that the maps are all burned.  I do not know enough about the administration of that department to say whether a survey would meet that difficulty, or whether fresh maps of each take of land registered in the Registry of Title could be made.  I imagine they could, and it would be a very great convenience to persons who hold their land under the kind of title registered in the Registry of Title if they could readily come by maps of the lands comprised in the various folios of their title.</P>
    <P>The third question is, could the Minister get us statistics of the comparative costs of feeding the inmates of the public institutions for which he is responsible, on an annual basis? Frankly, I want that figure in order to ascertain from one angle the amount of the increase in the cost of essential foodstuffs.  I think it will be agreed the inmates of Mountjoy, for instance, do not get very much more than essential foodstuffs.  Therefore, if&mdash;as I imagine is true&mdash;the annual cost of their maintenance is rising pretty briskly, both as to heat and light, and so forth, there will be evidence that costs of similar commodities have increased very heavily on the ordinary every-day consumer in the country.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  Have we any statistics available in the Department of Justice of the after-conduct of Borstal and reformatory boys?  It would be very desirable if we could find out how many Borstal boys in this country never come into the hands of the police again and how many have come into the hands of the police again.  It would be desirable to have similar information with regard to boys who entered reformatory schools. I believe that such information would be desirable.  Let me remind the House that we should not expect from these figures too high a percentage. Many people forget, when they see that 50 or 60 per cent. of these boys come back into the hands of the police, that it is not at all a bad percentage <Col N="32" /> when you remember the quality of the material upon which these Borstal and reformatory schools had to begin work.  Only the boy whom the District Justice thinks is perfectly hopeless is sent to one or other of these schools.  If there is any chance of redeeming him by leaving him with his own family, he is left there; if there is any chance of reforming him in an industrial school, he is sent there.  It is only the worst types of boys who are sent to the reformatory and Borstal institutions and, therefore, we must not expect anything in the way of absolutely perfect reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, I think, without significance that the first Estimate taken in this financial year is the Estimate for the Department of Justice.  The fact that this Estimate is taken now and not, say, a fortnight hence, rather hampers the discussion of it so far as I am personally concerned. The outstanding point that would have fallen for discussion on this Estimate would have had reference to matters that transpired in open court some few weeks ago in reference to the conduct of the Gárda Síochána and also in reference to their conception of their duties in connection with their right to shoot.  I am, I think, if not wholly, at least to such an extent as to make it impossible for me to speak on this topic, debarred from referring to those matters by reason of the fact that the case is still <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do think I am entitled to make a protest against this Estimate being taken at this time, the result of which will be that we may not have in this financial year, certainly not before the general election, an opportunity of discussing the very grave and vital matters, from the point of view of the public and the administration of justice, that emerged during the hearing of that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two controversial matters that arise on this Estimate to which I will have to refer.  On the whole, there is very little of a controversial <Col N="33" /> type, other than the subject to which I have referred, dealt with in this Estimate.  Most of the matters I want to touch upon are, I think, matters that will be non-controversial.</P>
    <P>The first point I wish to advert to is the provision in the Estimate for a temporary staff in connection with the execution of court orders.  There is a sum of £4,388 provided in the Estimate for that particular service.  That figure represents a slight decrease on the corresponding figure of last year.  I would like to have from the Minister some details as to the nature and the quality of the staff on which that expenditure is proposed to be made.  They are described in the Estimates as temporary staff.  I deduce, and it is only an inference of my own&mdash;probably a correct inference&mdash;that the persons who come within the ambit of the description of temporary staff are those people who have been going round the country in the last 12 months assisting the sheriff in the execution of orders equivalent to court orders in connection with land annuity defaulters.  I want to know from the Minister does he anticipate, during the course of the next 12 months, that there will be any necessity for the expenditure on the type of persons who have been employed on this work during the last 12 months?  I emphasise the words &ldquo;type of persons.&rdquo; Irrespective of the question of whether or not additional assistance may be required in connection with the execution of court orders, or orders of Ministers equivalent to court orders, I think we ought to be told whether or not the Minister has now definitely come to the conclusion that the type of persons who have been employed on this work are a disgrace and a scandal to this country, and that the type of persons who have been employed on this work should be dispensed with and proper material supplied.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last 12 months we have had two cases that came before the courts.  In one case a Dublin jury gave a verdict of £400 against the sheriff of the County Cork for illegal seizure in connection with a defaulting annuitant.  In another case, <Col N="34" /> a jury, either of the City or of the City and County of Cork, gave a decree against the same sheriff for a sum of £177.  I would not have referred to the second decree were it not for the fact that I have been informed in the last couple of days, authoritatively, that while there had been an appeal pending on behalf of the sheriff in that particular case, from Cork, notice of withdrawal of that appeal had been served, and, therefore, I am entitled to refer to the matter.  So, therefore, we have two cases in the last 12 months where juries&mdash;one a jury of the City of Dublin, drawn from a panel of business men here in the City of Dublin, under the impartial direction of the then President of the High Court, giving nothing but the very strictest interpretation of the law and forcing the plaintiff to a very rigid adherence to the pleadings in that particular case&mdash;we have that jury of independent business men of the City of Dublin expressing by their verdict their abhorrence of the methods that were employed, in connection with the execution of court orders, to the extent of £400.  A jury of the City of Cork, or of the City and County of Cork, did the same.</P>
    <P>It might be said by the Minister, or by some of his supporters, that a jury of the City and County of Cork, or a jury drawn partly from the City and partly from the County of Cork, would not be independent in a matter of this kind.  Be it so; we have the fact that a jury of the City of Dublin&mdash;a jury of business men in the City of Dublin&mdash; expressed their disapproval of the methods employed in the execution of court orders.  I think we are entitled to know whether the Minister proposes to continue the employment of the same sort of people as were employed in connection with the execution of those orders or of Ministerial decrees equivalent to court orders.  I can say here, what was perfectly apparent in court during the evidence of those individuals, that they had no conception whatever of their duties to the defaulting debtor as sheriffs' assistants.  Now, at least if the Minister proposes to continue the employment of that particular type of person <Col N="35" /> who, in my opinion, ought not to be in the public service, or if he proposes to continue any other type of people in this service, I think it is necessary in the public interest, apart altogether from the interest of defaulting annuitants or debtors, that those people who are engaged in the execution of court orders should be taught the fundamental and elementary principles on which the execution of court orders rests.  So far as these particular individuals were concerned&mdash;and I take it that they were typical of the people on whom the taxpayers spent over £5,000 last year and will be spending £4,500 during the coming year&mdash;it is in the public interest that these people should have at least some conception of the law in reference to execution that was summed up in one sentence in a judgment: That it is the duty of the sheriff and his officers to hold the scales of justice evenly between debtor and creditor.  As the proposition came as something in the nature of a thunderclap to these gentlemen who have been taking the part of the Minister in this connection, I am satisfied, from their attitude in the box and from their evidence, that they were under no conception that they owed any duty to the debtor, but only to the person who paid them, the sheriff and ultimately the Minister and the taxpayer&mdash;that it was their job to go in and scoop in everything they saw and which they could take away with the machinery which they had at their disposal.  That it was part of their duty to hold the scales evenly between creditor and debtor was a thing that never entered into their heads.</P>
    <P>Now, again, looking at it broadly and looking at it entirely from the point of view of the public interest, I think that it is essential that that principle should be enforced in connection with executions, whether for Government debts or for private debts, and that that principle should be known by every Government employee or by anybody who proposes or purports to levy anything in the nature of distress or execution on the goods of a debtor. Looking at it from a broad point of view, and leaving aside the heated controversies <Col N="36" /> of the last three or four years, it is proper now, I think, in the calmer atmosphere that now prevails&mdash; it is right and proper, I think, that we should have an assurance from the Minister that all Government employees who are engaged in the execution of court orders, whether they be orders of courts of justice or whether they be Ministerial decrees having the force of court orders under statute, should realise and understand that they owe a duty to the person from whom they are seizing his goods, not to do him any more damage than they reasonably can help.</P>
    <P>Consideration of that matter brings me to the point as to whether the Minister could consider, or has considered, or whether his Department has considered, the advisability of retaining the system by which county registrars carry on the duties formerly carried on by under-sheriffs.  Two or three days before the death of the late Mr. Patrick Hogan, he mentioned to me that, from his experience as a solicitor in very big practice for the then last four or five years, he had come to the conclusion that the system, for which he was partly responsible, of putting the responsibility for the execution of court orders into the hands of the county registrar, and not into the hands of an under-sheriff, was not working well.  I should like to know from the Minister if, from his experience, or from the experience of his Department, he has any information to give to the House on that topic.  I must confess myself that, originally, when that change was made, I thought it was a proper and a right change, and a change that was beneficial in the law. I am not so sure now.  I do think that whoever is responsible for the execution of court orders should be a State official responsible to the Minister.  I do not think that the old system of under-sheriff should be continued, but I think that the amalgamation of the two offices into the one has not worked as well as was anticipated.  Too much work is put upon one man.  The type of work that the county registrar has to do, in my opinion, is sufficient to occupy him his entire day, or ought to be sufficient, and he cannot give the <Col N="37" /> necessary time or the necessary attention, or, might I add, the necessary sympathy that is required in connection with the execution of court orders.</P>
    <P>There is one particular instance in which a gentleman&mdash;I shall not mention the name, he is not a county registrar, nor is he a State official&mdash;has demonstrated that it is in the interests not merely of the debtor, but of the creditor himself, that a certain wise forbearance should be exercised in the carrying out of this duty in executing court orders.  He demonstrated in practice that creditors, by the exercise of that forbearance, have got paid their debts in full in cases where, if the sheriff had gone in in the ordinary way in which he would go in if he were doing his duty as an automatic court official, and had executed his writ of <i>fi fa</i> and made a return of &ldquo;no goods,&rdquo; the creditor would have got nothing. In similar cases, by the exercise of a wise discretion, by not too forcibly pressing the debtor, in numerous instances within my own personal knowledge, creditors have got the full amount of their decrees and costs in cases where, if the writ were issued automatically, they would not get a penny.  The county registrar, in my view, will not be in a position to exercise that discretion or that wise forbearance. He will have his eye on his immediate superior in the Department of Justice, who will have his eye on the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It will be much easier for an official of that kind to send in his court messenger and give a return of &ldquo;no goods.&rdquo;  He has then carried out his duty, but the creditor has got nothing. He is entirely within his rights in doing that, and, in fact, if he did not do that, it would probably be said that he was not carrying out his duty, but if he were allowed to exercise his own discretion, a discretion that would not be subject to review departmentally, or in an autocratic manner, then the collection of debts would be greatly facilitated.</P>
    <P>There is another item here on which I should like the Minister to throw some light, an item for temporary staff in connection with registration work. It is a small item of £1,030.  I take it <Col N="38" /> that that item has reference to registration in connection with voters' lists. I should like to know from the Minister if I am correct in the assumption that the provision made for temporary staff in connection with registration has reference to the preparation of voters' lists.  If so, I then want to ask the Minister for information as to the manner in which the Guards carry out their duties in connection with the preparation of the parliamentary and municipal registers. It may perhaps be going slightly outside the scope of the discussion on an Estimate of this kind to state, merely in passing, that I think the time has come, if it has not long since gone by, when the entire work of the preparation of voters' lists of all kinds should be a State service.  The only way that I know of at the moment in which the State enters into it, is in the sort of examination, a cursory examination necessarily, that is made annually by the Guards.  The right of a voter after he appears on the lists is a very valuable right, but it is one of which he may be very easily deprived.  The Guards do a certain amount of work to see that the peoples' rights are preserved and that people who are on the register are there because they are entitled to be there, but there is no provision, as far as I know, for dealing adequately through the machinery of the Guards with that particular duty.  I think that duty should be increased, that the Guards ought to give more careful attention to the preparation of the register, and that when it is put into the hands of the Guards, they should have adequate time to make a very detailed examination of the register. It is not possible for every voter to look after his own interests. Theoretically, of course, the answer is that every voter should see that his or her name is on the list.  These registers are hung up in the Guards barracks and in branches of the post office, but they are almost inaccessible. Nobody knows where they are to be got or when they are to be got.  The whole system, in my opinion, calls very urgently for recasting and amelioration.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is <Col N="39" /> something in the nature of a perennial point.  I should like to know from the Minister what he proposes to do in connection with the retention of the official reporters in the circuit courts having regard to the passing of the recent Courts of Justice Act.  These men have had a very arduous task to fulfil in the last 12 or 13 years since the passage of the original Courts of Justice Act.  They have never got fair conditions of employment or pay, but they have served in that arduous task for a number of years.  I want an assurance from the Minister, if possible, that none of these people will be deprived of such remuneration as they have without compensation, if their services are dispensed with or, if they are continued, that they will be continued on a whole-time basis.  Arising out of this topic, the position of the Central Criminal Court emerges for consideration.  Very serious cases, the most serious cases in the State are dealt with in the Central Criminal Court.  One of the officials employed by the Department of Justice there in taking down the shorthand notes of evidence died as the result of overwork.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  I can say it from my own personal experience and from merely looking at the man fading away through overwork and worry.  Efforts were made to ameliorate his position but to no avail.  Now the same thing exists at the present moment.  Apart altogether from the question of a particular individual or particular individuals, whether or not they are properly remunerated or entirely overworked&mdash; I realise that such an appeal would fall on deaf ears in the Department of Justice&mdash;from past experience I know, and I am speaking now in the public interest and from a point of view other than that of the particular individuals involved, a man's life may depend on whether or not the evidence has been taken down properly or accurately.  I have had experience in this House even, where the reporting is on the highest possible level, where some slight errors have crept into the reports of debates by reason of the fact that the hieroglyphic <Col N="40" /> for one word would be the same as that for another word.  When a matter comes to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the only thing that can be looked at is the transcript of the shorthand writer's notes.  I have had civil cases myself where the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; was put in instead of the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; and the whole case was practically lost on that difference.  Now, realise the much greater importance that attaches to the written word in connection with a criminal matter.  Here in the Dáil we give ourselves the luxury of a reporting staff that changes after a short space of time, and that is quite proper.  I think it is entirely wrong that one man should be engaged in the Court of Criminal Appeal from 11 o'clock in the morning until sometimes 8 or 9 o'clock at night, and then have to transcribe his notes perhaps during the rest of the night, as happens in a serious and important case, for the benefit of the judge and the jury.  That is not a proper thing in connection with the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I think that a system somewhat analogous to the system that exists here in this House should be employed in connection with important criminal cases, at least in the Central Criminal Court.  I think that in all criminal courts&mdash;but certainly in cases involving life and death, as cases do in the Central Criminal Court&mdash;there should be relays of shorthand writers taking down the evidence.  In my view, it is nothing short of a public scandal that one man is forced to spend all day taking down the evidence in shorthand; subjected to the tremendous strain that he is bound to carry on that duty in cases where the judge directs, for the convenience of the jury and witnesses, that the trial should proceed beyond 4 o'clock, sometimes until 7, 8 or 9 o'clock at night.  He is bound to come again on the following day and perform the same arduous task, and perhaps in connection with one trial the same happens for five or six days or even longer.  I do think that that is a reform which calls for urgent attention.  It would cost very little, and it would be an <Col N="41" /> advance in the administration of our criminal law.</P>
    <P>Speaking of reforms, might I suggest to the Minister that, so far as I know, his Department administratively has done nothing in the way of having, either in or outside the Department, anything in the nature of a law reform committee.  I think that is something which requires to be set up by the Minister, at least departmentally.  I myself would not be satisfied&mdash;I would be very far from satisfied; I would be extremely dissatisfied&mdash;with a purely Departmental committee to deal with law reform.  I hesitated for some time to refer even to the establishment of such a committee, for the reason that on to such a committee there always tends to creep every crank in the country, and if such a committee were to be set up, very great care would have to be taken in the selection of the personnel.  I think there is a tendency for us to regard the law as brought over by Article 73 of the Constitution as static.  At the present time, some of the laws that are being administered throughout the country, even the criminal laws, are entirely out-of-date.  If the Minister will look at some of the indictments that have been preferred over the last few years in the criminal courts under the Larceny Acts, he will perhaps be a little bit surprised to find that the institution of the King was extremely useful to the Department of Justice.  At the present moment, although we have, or think we have, taken away the King from our internal affairs, the King is writ large over the Larceny Act of 1916, and employed by the Minister and his solicitors in indictments in the Circuit Courts throughout the country.  I think the Minister should give some attention to the question of law reform. In that respect we are lagging very seriously behind Great Britain.  I handed in a question last year&mdash;I refrained from putting it on the Paper, but I propose to do it very shortly now &mdash;in connection with the matter of joint tort feasors, in connection with the law of arbitration, and in connection with the liability of husband and wife in tort.  Those are matters that have been dealt with in England years ago, but <Col N="42" /> here we are to a very large extent dependent on feudal law, which has its ultimate origin in the King.  If the Minister and his Government have taken the King out of our internal affairs, they ought to take him out of our statutes.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has provided in the Estimate the sum of £100 for counsels' fees in connection with the drafting of rules of court.  It is a matter of great gratification to me to know that some of my colleagues will pocket that money sometime.  But that particular item appeared in last year's Estimates, too, to precisely the same extent, and, so far as I can see, this sum of £100 for counsels' fees is going to continue in the estimates for the Department of Justice <i>in sæcula sæculorum</i>, unless the Minister rouses himself and decides some time or other that counsel will be employed to do something which is 13, or at any rate ten years overdue&mdash;the consolidation of the rules of the High Court.  I should like to know if the Minister or his Department has the remotest idea or hope of doing anything in connection with the consolidation of the rules of court during the course of the next 12 months, or if the insertion of this £100 which appeared in last year's Estimates also, has merely the value of a pious hope as it had last year.</P>
    <P>There is one matter of detail that I want to press upon the Minister for his earnest consideration.  I think I raised it last year with the then Attorney-General.  Those of us who are engaged on work in connection with negligence accidents and traffic accidents of one kind or another have, in every case, come across police reports on the accident, and that performance has now become little better than a farce.  We all have our little document briefed to us, headed &ldquo;Abstract of Occurrence by the Gárda Síochána.&rdquo;  That particular abstract of the occurrence is signed by a guard or a superintendent, and purports to give an account of what that member of the Guards saw after the accident had occurred.  In practically every case it gives precisely no information as to what occurred.  Then we have to go through the farce on both sides <Col N="43" />&mdash;for plaintiff and defendant&mdash;of issuing a <i>subpoena</i> to the guard to attend to give evidence.  The guard solemnly attends both consultations, of plaintiff and defendant, and solemnly assures both plaintiff and defendant that he is debarred by his regulations from telling what is in his report or what the defendant said to him after the accident until the judge orders him to do so.  But both the plaintiff and the defendant have a very shrewd idea as to what has taken place and as to what is in those reports.  The guard gets solemnly and smartly into the witness box, and when asked &ldquo;Did the defendant make a statement to you after the accident,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;My lord, have I your direction to disclose this.&rdquo;  Well, now it is about time that that farce stopped.</P>
    <P>The police investigate an accident and their evidence is of vital concern in the interests of truth in every case. I say the Guards take up a strictly impartial attitude in accident cases. Their evidence ought to be available in the interests of truth and accuracy to both sides in the case, and to the court.  Statements made by parties to the police purporting to give an account of an occurrence after the accident ought to be at the disposal of all interested parties equally. Now, I think that the Minister ought, at this stage, to put an end to the regulation that prevents a guard from giving his evidence until the judge orders it.  It is the purest formality for the judge to give an order.  Until quite recently it was really a matter of very great doubt as to how far those statements could be used in evidence in court.  That matter has been more or less settled now, and we ought to have the position that all sides should have freely at their disposal the observations of the Guards taken after the occurrence, and statements made by the parties involved to the police, immediately after the occurrence, not merely in the interests of a particular litigant, but in the interests of the ascertainment of the truth of the occurrence and the accuracy of people's recollections in the matter.</P>
    <P>I saw in the papers during the last <Col N="44" /> few weeks a matter which certainly surprised me.  I am open to correction if I am wrong in the interpretation that I put upon it.  During the hearing of a criminal case in Cork Circuit Court involving, I think, a criminal charge against one of the officials of the Cork Circuit Court, the jury in the case had to retire each evening. That is a rather normal occurrence in the circuit courts, but to my astonishment I saw that the jury were solemnly told that they would not be allowed to go to their homes after the conclusion of the first day's hearing, or at the conclusion of any other day's hearing, unless they took an oath of secrecy.  I know of no oath of secrecy provided by the law of this country, but I do know that it is the law of this country that unnecessary oaths ought not to be taken.  A Statutory Declaration Act was passed for the purpose of preventing unnecessary oaths from being administered, but here we have&mdash;by whom I do not know&mdash;a so-called oath of secrecy manufactured <i>ad hoc</i> for a Cork jury. Now, I want to know who manufactured this oath of secrecy.  In my opinion it is profanity and nothing else, and I think the Minister should take steps to see that it will not occur again.</P>
    <P>The oaths to be taken by jurymen and by witnesses are provided by the law of this State, and nobody has the right, except the Oireachtas, to make law for this State.  No judge has the right to make it, and no official has the right to make it.  In the statutes passed by the Oireachtas we provide the various oaths that are to be taken by jurymen.  Where did this oath of secrecy come from, and out of whose ingenious brain did it emanate?  Oaths are sacred things, and jurymen ought not to be made take unnecessary oaths.  They were entitled to go to their homes that night without having administered to them this oath that has no statutory existence, and that in my view tended to bring the jurymen's oath into disrespect.  I personally take a very serious view of that performance. Personally, it shocked me very gravely.  I want a definite assurance from the Minister that, so far as he and his Department can control it, <Col N="45" /> such a thing will not happen again.  We have to have regard in this country for the solemnity and sanctity of an oath. That sort of performance brings into disrepute the sanctity of an oath.  In the administration of justice, nobody is entitled to manufacture out of his head an oath of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether it was in the course of the last 12 months that an incident occurred in court where one of the officers of the Gárda Síochána gave his evidence at the Central Criminal Court in Green Street in Irish.  The only reason for his doing so was because he would get an extra piece of remuneration for giving his evidence in Irish.  The judge knew some Irish, but was more conversant with the language of the Sassenach.  The jury knew no Irish, and why it should be necessary in those circumstances that this unfortunate officer, in order to retain some paltry allowance that he gets for giving evidence in Irish in the Gaeltacht, should go through the solemn farce of giving his evidence in Irish at Green Street, thereby causing additional inconvenience and expense as well as adding to the length of time that the trial occupied, passes my comprehension. I would like to be assured that such a farcical performance will not be repeated.  It again brings the administration of justice into disrepute and brings the Irish language into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I raised last year the question of the transfer of cases from the country to the Central Criminal Court.  That is a matter largely for the Attorney-General, but the Minister is responsible for juries.  The City of Dublin jurors are subjected to a heavy strain. They have to sit constantly in Green Street for the Dublin Circuit Courts which, I think, are sitting in their criminal jurisdiction throughout the year without a break except when the Central Criminal Court is sitting.  The Circuit Court and Central Criminal Court cases impose a very great drain on the time of the members of the business community in Dublin who have to give jury service.  They have also to attend civil cases in the High Court as well as civil cases in the <Col N="46" /> Circuit Courts.  I think the Minister should see that, so far as he is concerned, the officers for whom he has responsibility, the officers of the Gárda Síochána, will not be putting up to the Attorney-General demands for the change of venue for cases from the country to the city.  The principle upon which I always acted when I had the misfortune to have had the responsibility for dealing with those matters was that if the country people themselves would not deal with their own local criminals, well then they could have a present of them so far as I was concerned.  They ought not to be throwing the responsibility on to the jurymen of the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a matter which arises out of that consideration&mdash;the number of times that the criminal courts of this country are sitting, particularly in the City of Dublin.  I may be wrong, because I am speaking only from impression, but I have a most definite impression that we seem always to have in the City of Dublin some sort of Criminal Court sitting.  We have the Circuit Court sitting practically constantly, only interrupted, as I have already said, for the sittings of the Central Criminal Court.  My recollection of the days before the Treaty was that we had a very odd sitting of the Recorders' Court and a spring assizes and a winter assizes at which there was practically no work done. I should like to know from the Minister have we, since the establishment of this country as an independent State, advanced criminally?  Has the country increased in its criminal activities?  I know from my own experience the types of cases heard in Green Street of which the public know nothing.  Certainly, the ordinary public would be shocked at the variety and extent of the crimes dealt with in the Circuit Court and the Central Criminal Court in the City of Dublin. I take it that the Department of Justice have statistics of these matters. Have they, as the result of the compilation of these statistics, particularly in sexual crimes, yet come to any conclusion, or are they in a position to draw any conclusion from these statistics?  It is a matter of some public importance and I think we <Col N="47" /> ought to get some light and leading from the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing recently of the avalanche that is going to descend on the motoring community.  The Minister's officers are apparently preparing by-laws dealing with traffic.  I should like to know whether this House will have an opportunity of discussing these by-laws before they come into operation.  These by-laws affect the liberties, the liberty of action at all events, of a considerable section of the community.  They affect the business life of the community.  I should like to know from the Minister what consideration has been given to such rights.  I feel that these by-laws, whether good or bad&mdash;at the moment I express no opinion on them, because I have had no opportunity of considering them, as they were only partially published in the newspapers&mdash;will be issued from one point of view alone&mdash; from the point of view of the police. I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that that impression is a wrong impression.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that when the by-laws are brought into operation they will be administered with considerable forbearance by the Gárda for some time after they come into operation, and that they will not be used to chivy motorists around the place and to provide a largely increased revenue for some sort of fine fund, or one of those dark corridors down which revenue pours into the coffers of the Minister for Finance <i>via</i> the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>We are entitled, I think, to have these by-laws very carefully considered from other aspects than those of the police.  They will look at the matter, naturally enough, entirely from the point of view of the job the Gárda will have to do in administering these by-laws.  But the matter must, in my view, be considered from a very much wider and broader point of view.  The by-laws must be considered in the light of the situation as it exists in the country, particularly in the City of Dublin.  They must be considered in the light of the interests of the business people, who are entitled to <Col N="48" /> have their customers brought as near to their doors as possible.  But, above all, I want an assurance from the Minister that these by-laws, if and when they come into force, will be administered in a spirit of forbearance and good humour.</P>
    <P>These matters, I think, cover most of the points I had to deal with.  I had intended to refer to the question of the education of the police.  That is a matter that would cover a very wide field and we shall leave that for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago, and last year again, during the discussion on this Vote, I raised the matter of the Minister doing something to provide better housing for the Gárda.  It is evident to everybody that the lack of housing for the Gárda is a public scandal and that the Gárda, especially in our provincial towns, are being mulcted to an extent out of all proportion to that which they should be called upon to pay by reason of the salaries or wages they are in receipt of.  I indicated, I think, during the discussion two years ago that if the Minister for Justice could interest his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in the question of housing for the Gárda, rows of houses in large towns could be provided at a rent which the Gárda would be able to pay. If the Gárda were permitted to form themselves into something equivalent to a public utility society, and if the Minister for Local Government were prepared to concede the subsidies that he concedes to public utility societies, the Gárda would be housed properly. The Minister knows, I think, at least his Department ought to know, that when Gárda are transferred into towns, in most cases they have to go into lodgings, so to speak, and they are charged extortionate prices for a room or two.  In view of the fact that the rent allowance paid by the Department is very inadequate, these people find themselves in very straitened circumstances, as they have to pay very high rents.  I, therefore, again request the Minister to do something in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various proposals of this kind have been put before the Minister.  Schemes <Col N="49" /> have been prepared and the Minister has been shown how they would work out financially.  As far as I can remember, it was shown to the Minister on paper that decent houses could be provided for the Gárda in most of our provincial towns which could be let at rents from 8/- to 10/- per week.  I suggest to the Minister that it is in the interest of the Gárda that they should be properly housed.  In some towns they are living in back rooms.  I, therefore, request the Minister to do something to meet the demands made in that connection.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the rent allowance, I ask the Minister to take some cognisance of the representations made to him by the representative body of the Gárda for a better rent allowance.  The rent allowance made is not at all sufficient and is a good deal less than the allowance paid either in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  In that connection, I should like to remind the Minister that the Gárda have had two reductions in their pay since 1924, I think.  The Gárda are the lowest paid police force in any of the English-speaking countries.  Since the Gárda was established I think it will be admitted by everyone that they have done very good work.  It is a young force, formed, one might say, in the arms of a revolution and had very strenuous duties to perform.  The Gárda have been the servants of two Governments of very divergent views, and they have been called upon to carry out duties that police would not be called upon to do in any other country.  While they had a good deal of political work to do, it will be admitted by everyone that they answered the call of both Governments in a manner that was creditable to the force.  If we compare the pay of the Gárda with the pay of the police force in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, it will be found that there is a very wide difference in the rate of remuneration.  For instance, on appointment a Gárda gets 50/- weekly, while a constable in Great Britain or Northern Ireland gets 70/- weekly.  At the end of 22 years' service a Gárda gets 83/- weekly, but in Northern Ireland and Great Britain a <Col N="50" /> police constable with the same service gets 95/- weekly.  There was a cut made in the rent allowance but, I understand, that cut was given back a few years ago in England and in Northern Ireland.  The rent allowance for the Gárda has not been increased since 1924.  When the first cut was made in the Gárda pay, a guarantee was given by the then Minister for Finance that that would be the irreducible minimum.  Notwithstanding that, a further cut was made, and I suggest that the Minister should approach his colleague, the Minister for Finance, with a view to giving back at least some portion of the cut that was made in the pay in 1924.  No one can disguise the fact that the cost of living has considerably increased in recent years.  As I indicated, the difference between the pay of the Gárdaí and the police in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is 17 per cent.  That is a very considerable difference.</P>
    <P>It will be conceded that the Gárdaí have as many duties, if not more, to perform as the police in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  A large amount of the work connected with new legislation passed in this House has been placed on the shoulders of the police, and in view of that fact the Minister should seriously consider restoring the cuts in their remuneration, because new legislation has so increased the duties of the Gárdaí that they are a sort of general utility force. They certainly have not been treated in the matter of pay in accordance with the amount of work they perform. Finally, I ask the Minister to consider the request made to him by the representative body of the Guards as regards an increase in the rent allowance, and I ask him especially to consider a question that has been raised in this House on three or four occasions, that of providing decent housing accommodation for the Guards. The conditions under which some Guards have to live, occupying back rooms, and rooms over shops, for which they are charged excessive rents, are certainly not in keeping with what one would expect the environment of police officers should be.  If the Minister for Justice would ask for the <Col N="51" /> co-operation of his colleague to see if houses could be erected on the same principle as they are erected by public utility societies, and if some subsidy were forthcoming, the Gárdaí could be housed properly and when transferred from one district to another would be assured of good housing accommodation. That is one of the reasons why transfers are objected to so strenuously. If a Gárda gets a good house in a town and if he is then transferred to a place where there is no decent housing accommodation, he probably approaches someone in order to try to have the transfer cancelled.  That difficulty would disappear if the Minister made some effort to provide decent housing accommodation for the police. As he has had two years to consider the question I think the time has arrived when the Minister might make up his mind as to what he is going to do in connection with the housing question.</P>

      <P>There is one matter I wish to mention, and that is that the Circuit Court judge in Donegal took ill recently, and I understand, is still ill, so that it is possible there will be no sitting of that court until June.  I should like to know how it is the Minister has not appointed a deputy immediately he took ill.  I am rather of the opinion that if it took place in any other Circuit Court area, a deputy circuit judge would be appointed next day.  I do not want to complain unnecessarily about this, but I think it unfair that these people up in Donegal should be denied justice. The net result of it will be that people will not go to law to seek justice because they cannot get it.  Anybody who has any experience of courts knows that if these things hang on unnecessarily, one or two of the parties to a suit whose evidence would be essential may die and you will eventually find that people will not bother to seek justice at all.  I think most people will agree that there are plenty of gentlemen down at the Four Courts willing and quite competent to fill these positions. I understand that two sittings of the Circuit Court in Donegal will be missed this year, and, before the sittings <Col N="52" /> were suspended, there was a number of cases which had been hanging over for about two years, and I know from the present state of the list there that there is not the slightest hope of these cases being heard, although people are urging that they should be heard.  As I say, I do not want to labour this, but I appeal to the Minister to take steps to appoint a deputy judge if there is no prospect of the present circuit judge being able to resume his duties, and to send him down to Donegal and keep him there until he has cleared up the list.  The present position is very unfair to litigants and to solicitors.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of the oath taken in Cork, to which Deputy Costello has referred, I thought it was a desperately ridiculous thing.  It was about the most ridiculous thing I remember happening in any court.  I happened to be passing along a street in my constituency and I saw a poster of the <i>Independent</i> outside a newspaper shop.  I thought I saw something curious on it, and, being unable to understand what it was, I turned around and on the poster I read that a jury in Cork had taken an oath of silence.  The ordinary man in the street does not concern himself very much about such things and he cares less about them, but there are other people in the country and outside it, in Northern Ireland and in England, who are connected with the law and who, when they see this will ask, &ldquo;Where did this come out of?&rdquo;  I think oaths should be taken as seldom as possible, and, when taken, should be kept.  There is no such oath, and if this epidemic is going to break out, and if these gentlemen who are so fond of administering oaths do not know the law, the Minister should send out a circular telling them what the law is and that there is no such thing as an oath of silence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reinforce what Deputy Costello said about the position of stenographers in the courts.  There is an absolutely impossible burden placed on these men in criminal cases which extend over a couple of days.  I think the less said about it the better, and I think it is only necessary to mention the matter to the Minister and he will <Col N="53" /> stand up against the Department of Finance and demand justice for these people.  The work cannot be done and if any stenographer is going to do that work for a number of days, transcribe it and have it ready the following morning, as certainly as day follows night, that man will not be able to continue doing that work and there is no remedy for him, or for the wife and family he may leave behind.  One reads about slavery, but any greater form of slavery than one man sitting writing at that top speed for three or four days, from 11 o'clock in the morning until perhaps 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, because a judge wants to get rid of a case and sits longer than he normally would, and having his work ready the following morning, I have never heard.  One dose of it is sufficient to kill a man.  We hear about the rights of labour.  The only labourer, of course, who has any rights, is the labourer who is organised.  Labour has to organise to defend itself and apparently it cannot get justice until drastic steps are taken to wring bare justice from those in authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Vote for the Guards, I notice that for the last five years there has been an increase of 665 in the number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men, and, in addition to that, there is an increase in expenditure of £274,289.  If you divide that increase over the 665 men, you give them approximately £412 annually.  According to the figure quoted by Deputy Corish, a Guard's commencing salary is 50/-.  I wonder how is that increase apportioned? These 665 men did not get this money, and I should like to know how this extra expenditure has been incurred. I should also like to know the necessity for all these extra men.  We used to be told at the cross-roads throughout the country, before the present Government came in, that the reason an army and a Civic Guard of such dimensions was required in this country was because the Oath was kept in the Constitution by the deliberate sin of the previous Government. The Oath is now removed, but the expenditure for the Civic Guard continues.  One is curious to know the <Col N="54" /> reason for that.  In those days, all the ills that befell this country were attributed to the Oath and the Guards were kept there for the purpose of keeping down republicans, Sinn Féiners, and all those of an ultra-patriotic disposition.  The Oath is now removed, however; we have removed the King from the country; and we are sitting almost as free as air.  Still, there is something troubling these men, for the Civic Guards are as active as ever they were.</P>
    <P>I read a speech delivered by the Minister for Finance last Monday fortnight at Dun Laoghaire in which he said that the Dáil was going to pass a fundamental law that would leave everybody free and happy.  I wonder if you asked some of those fellows who got a battering last Sunday what the fundamental law was, what they would reply?  I suppose they would reply that it was a Guard's baton.</P>
    <P>This increased expenditure of £274,000 does not seem justified, but I should like to see some of it passed on to such matters as Deputy Corish referred to, for example, the rent allowance.  I have been told in my constituency, not from Guards or anybody directly involved, that men there are paying a rent of £45 annually.  In some of these small towns, the housing problem is very acute and it does happen that Guards and sergeants who have come to the age when they should get married, on account of that shortage of houses, have to take houses at any rent.  The rent allowance is only £18, and I think that under the conditions under which Guards have to obey orders given to them and go wherever they are sent, special consideration should be given to their claims for rent where they are transferred to towns in which there is an acute housing shortage.  Advantage is being taken of the shortage by those who own houses to charge increased rents, and so far as Guards and sergeants are concerned, those rents are in many cases twice as much as they are allowed for rent.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I wish to refer to.  A couple of years ago, the High Court gave a decision on a matter which came before it, and, as a result <Col N="55" /> of that decision, the Rules of Court under the Mines and Minerals Act were set aside.  That was, I think, at least two years ago, and the new rules have not yet been issued.  That affects the country in rather an extraordinary way. Take, for example, all the portions of land in which there are deposits of bog ore.  They cannot be removed or sold without the permission of the Land Commission, or without a licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Industry and Commerce cannot give a licence and people cannot remove the bog ore and sell it.  Owing to the huge armament construction in England at present, there is a very substantial demand for bog ore for the making of moulds for castings, and not a farmer in the country who has bog ore on his land can remove a ton of it. There are other cases.  There are granite quarries and things like that where the Department of Public Works would be prepared to give a grant for the purpose of opening it up and developing it under the relief works.  The grant cannot be given by the Government simply because this thing is tied up and involved by the non-existence of rules under the Mines and Minerals Act.  These are things that in many parts of the country are of very considerable importance.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of removing bog ore is concerned, this thing has become so chronic, the delay has become so acute, that a constituent of mine applied for a licence.  Of course he could not get the licence.  I understand these rules are being passed from one Ministry to another. I understand they are passing from the Ministry of Lands to the Department of Justice.  But they still remain in cold storage and they are not in operation. I advised this constituent of mine who wrote about this matter of bog ore to proceed.  The fact remains that he applied for his licence, he was prepared to put down his money but nothing could be done because the rules had not come out.  I advised the man to raise the bog ore himself.  I did that because when these armament works in England are finished the <Col N="56" /> demand for bog ore will have passed and he will have lost his market.  I think a matter of this kind should not involve any difficulty, and it is not fair to these people.  I notice that £100 has been put down in the Estimates for preparing these rules.  There are lots of barristers down in the courts who would be delighted to draft these rules, and they would not keep us waiting for two or three years.  I now appeal to the Minister to see that these rules are passed and not hold up these men who have bog ore on their lands.  These men want to raise this bog ore, sell it and make some money on it, but owing to the non-existence of the rules they are unable to go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This time last year other Deputies and I raised a question with regard to individuals who were brought into the courts to give expert evidence on certain points.  We criticised from this side of the House the qualifications of a gentleman who was called to give evidence as a gunnery expert.  Notwithstanding the fact that the criticism was badly taken, I am now disposed to thank the Minister for having removed that gentleman and put in his place as chief expert witness as regards guns and munitions an officer in the Army who has been praised in the courts for the evidence he has given.</P>
      <P>The situation remains the same with regard to the person who is ordinarily called on to give evidence as regards handwriting.  I suggest that the Ministers should make up their minds on the substitution of these witnesses by some other person.  If the Minister would appoint a person of expert capacity in this matter, if there is such a person available, it would be a step farther.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that two points have been raised here to-day by Deputies who have spoken earlier.  The first is the perennial subject of the long hours and the bad pay of the stenographers in the courts, particularly those who have to work in the criminal side.  Last year I drew attention to that matter. I was one of the group on this side who spoke on the question.  I asserted then, and though my statement was criticised by Government <Col N="57" /> speakers, no attempt was made to deny the evidence I brought forward, and that was that the late Chief Justice had said with regard to one of these stenographers that he had died as a result of overwork.  As far as any official information vouched to this House goes, the situation with regard to these court stenographers has not been improved.  The situation described last year was a particularly scandalous one. Stenographers hold some sort of semi-official appointment.  If a hurried record of any note taken by them in a criminal case is required it becomes necessary that a stenographer should spend part of his non-working hours in transcribing what he had previously taken down in shorthand.  If the transcript of evidence is required in an emergency that individual stenographer may have to relinquish, temporarily, the semi-official position he fills; if he desires to keep his place open he must have a substitute.  The information supplied to me, and which I stated in this House last year, and which was not denied by the Minister, is that such stenographer has to pay the substitute more than he earns himself. If any change has been made in that matter I would be glad to hear of it.  Apart from that question, there is a question of hours.  It is well known that in the criminal courts judges are disposed to pay more attention to the requirements of those citizens who come before them as jurors in criminal cases.  It is quite a proper procedure, if one is allowed to say that with regard to the judicial authorities, that they have shown they are so appreciative of the convenience of the ordinary citizens.  However that works adversely with regard to the stenographer.  It has happened that in an attempt to get a case disposed of on the second day of hearing, the judge often will sit very late.  As late as 8 o'clock is not an unusual experience in criminal courts, and that applies more especially in the case of the Circuit Criminal Court.  There have been occasions, not numerous but numerous enough to have comment made, that on the third day when the closing addresses are made and the judge sums up, the stenographer is not relieved until 10 <Col N="58" /> o'clock at night.  Though he gets a certain amount of respite when counsel is addressing the jury, he gets no relaxation after the judge has concluded his charge and the stenographer must remain on duty until the proceedings are over.  The stenographer will be on duty from 11 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock on the first day, going on until 6 o'clock the second day and having to remain as long as 8 to 10 o'clock on the third day.  After that he has to get out his transcript in longhand.  The notes in these cases are taken and transcribed admirably.  That entails an extraordinary amount of work, work so heavy that no individual should be subjected to it.  One other point should be noticed, and that is that in this Assembly we have such a regard for those who have to take down what is said here that they are allowed to operate in relays.  In the Criminal Court there is no such arrangement of relays, and the stenographer has to sit there throughout the day.  No time is allowed for making his transcript.  I do not think that it would cost a very large amount to have better provision made for the stenographers.  &lsquo;I do not think anyone could possibly object to the necessary expenditure falling on the State through making better provision for them.</P>
    <P>The second matter that has, I understand, been referred to here to-day is this extraordinary procedure adopted by the judge in Cork of imposing a new type of oath upon a body of men who have assembled to try cases.  As that matter has already been gone into, I do not want to say more than just to refer to it.  If there have to be regular proceedings in courts, these proceedings should be carried through according to the rules. If exceptional cases seem to require something like an exceptional oath, that is a matter which might be made the subject of a recommendation to whomever would afterwards have the power to carry that recommendation into effect.  In another case, in the area of that same judge, if newspaper reports be correct&mdash;I want to make that reservation&mdash;a further strange procedure is alleged to have taken <Col N="59" /> place.  In some case which came before that judge, an allegation was made that that notorious body, the I.R.A., had something to do with the matter.  On taking his seat in the court next day the judge announced that he had been in communication with those who represented that organisation and was satisfied that they had nothing to do with the matter&mdash;or was satisfied, in any event, that the mixing-up of their name with this particular procedure was unwarranted. If any investigation of that kind was to take place, it should have been done in open court and according to the ordinary rules of procedure. A summons could have been issued or a warrant could have been issued.  All sorts of coercive methods could have been employed to get before the judge the people whom he thought he should have before him to question on this matter.  Instead, he undertakes this investigation outside the court without anybody suggesting to him that it was reasonable or proper procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, under certain legislation, as representative of the Executive Council, to issue naturalisation certificates.  I have a list of some 60 names here.  I do not want to go through all of them.  They are not names that smack entirely of this country.  They may be names of people from that region where our ancestors are said to have originally proceeded from&mdash;the area of Upper or Lower Bohemia&mdash;but they are certainly not any nearer to us than that. I find on the list the names Zielinski, Geewurtz, Hachtel, Lipschitz, Anabeitia, Zabellicky, Silverstein, Popoff, Ratusky, Poznansky, Eichenstein, Hohn, and a name which I shall not dare to pronounce but which is spelt Mlsek.  Is there any principle upon which these matters are determined, and would the Minister tell us, if he has not already given the fullest possible information in reply to the question down to-day, how many people from Galicia, Poland and the regions of Bohemia have been naturalised in the last 12 months, and what are the reasons which induced him to give naturalisation certificates to these <Col N="60" /> people?  This is a list which was deliberately chosen because of the strangeness and, with all respect, the uncouthness of the names, and it is not to be taken as representative. There may be thousands of people who are entitled to secure naturalisation certificates, but these jewels are studded through the rest and it will be of some interest to the public to know why legions of this type are flashed through the columns of the official Gazette.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin referred to the old-time clamour for economy.  Let us consider that matter in connection with the Vote for the Guards, which is one of the block now under consideration. I find that the amount required for the salaries and expenses of the Gárda is £1,883,000.  For the year 1931-32, the figure was about £1,609,000 and, in the year previous to that, it was, so far as I remember, about £1,500,000.  It was announced from time to time that an effort was then being made to scale down the expenses on the personnel of both Army and Gárda to the sum of about £1,500,000 per service.  That sum of £1,500,000 was objected to in the most vigorous terms by everybody who was then vocal in support of the present Government Party.  Deputy Cooney, in his famous speech at Grangegorman, said that he was going to reduce that sum by more than £1,500,000. To get the police force run for nothing would have been a considerable effort. It was a most admirable and laudable aim, but they were not satisfied with that.  The Deputy was actually raising the bidding somewhat.  The present Minister for Justice himself was, I think, clamant about this matter.  He thought that the sum of £1,000,000 was the proper sum.  That seemed to be the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party at the time.  That sum of about £1,000,000 was spoken of so often that it seemed to me it could not have occurred to so large a number of people simultaneously and that there must have been some conversations or deliberations, resulting in agreement, on the matter.  We were told that any amount over £1,000,000 spent on the Guards was only for the purpose <Col N="61" /> of political persecution, or else for the purpose of having a considerable number of <i>agents provocateurs</i> running around the country.  We were told that if and when a Fianna Fáil Government came into power,that moment the people would be more concerned to obey than to disobey the law, and it would be possible to do without a considerable number of Guards and without this tax on the ordinary populace in their support. We now find that the amount has gone up to £1,883,000 from £1,609,000.  Why has not Fianna Fáil carried out that specific pledge in regard to the Guards as a special service?  It is possible to suggest reasons but these reasons will not commend themselves to those who support the present Government.  The old allegation, as I said, was that the police were being recruited and maintained in far greater numbers than the ordinary peaceful mentality and outlook of the Irish people required.  The ordinary peaceful outlook and mentality was not being allowed to have full sway, because things were being done that were quite definitely opposed to their viewpoints. In that connection, it was said more particularly that those individuals&mdash;both members of the Guards and members of the detective and auxiliary forces attached to the Guards&mdash;were being kept specially to persecute and hound down men whose only crime was to have a national outlook and national instincts.  In that connection, I may quote words used, in 1931, by a present judge.  He said that announcements had been made that the Government were inspecting sites for internment camps and for proposed new prisons, and he asked&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Prisons for what?  Is it for the thieves and burglars and the murderers?  It is not internment camps or prisons for these, but they propose to put the young men of Ireland who are animated by the sentiments and traditions of Irish nationality and who are trying to carry out the injunction of Wolfe Tone to break the connection with England, in these camps.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Are the prisons still being kept for these young men animated with the sentiments of Irish nationality, and who are trying to carry out the injunction of Wolfe Tone to break the English connection?  This oration goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If they tell you they are going to put Communists and Bolshevists into these gaols, ask them to look at your eye and find the green that is in your eye.  You know this is not aimed at Communists and Bolshevists: it is aimed at the young men who have lost faith in Parliamentary institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we still paying £250,000 extra to keep down young men who have lost faith in Parliamentary institutions? This person from whom I am quoting said that he would oppose in the House and out of it in any way he could any Coercion Bill to provide new means of arresting and imprisoning young men simply because they were in any organisation&mdash;he did not care what it was&mdash;the object of which was to break that connection.  &ldquo;Let the Free State Parliament repudiate the Imperial connection.&rdquo;  It has not been done.  &ldquo;...let them drop the Imperial conferences.&rdquo;  We are shilly-shallying about these things still.  &ldquo;... let them refuse to pay the tribute in annuities.&rdquo;  It is still being paid.  &ldquo;... and then if there are men who band themselves against a truly National Government, I might consider my position...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do not let us put any embarrassment on an ex-member of the Party who has been put into a judicial position. Will the Minister tell us is there an outbreak of ordinary crime in this country&mdash;is it worse than it used to be?  Is there a necessity to spend £250,000 more in relation to ordinary crime, in addition to not being able to save the amount that used to be spent in fomenting political disorder, which was the allegation made against the last Government? Can the Minister justify the expenditure of nearly £1,900,000 on the Guards when his whole Party were vehement in their denunciation of any expenditure over £1,000,000 in relation to these guardians of law and order?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> I might remark in that connection that if one looked to see the fruits of Government policy, it might be seen in some of the institutions under their control.  When I come to the Prisons Vote I find that apparently there are farms run in these prisons. Whether they are growing wheat or beet on these farms I do not know, but I do know this, that where the Estimate shows an expenditure of £175 for seeds and tools, the receipts from the farms and gardens, including the produce used in the prison, comes to £500.  Presumably that is with free labour.  Have we not there a very welcome object lesson from the Government?  Can they not take some of these prison farms where they have free labour, labour definitely under their coercion, and let us see if something better cannot be produced for an expenditure of £175 on seeds and tools, than £500, including, presumably, some cost put on a variety of fruits and vegetables for the use of the prison staff and the personnel in such prisons?</P>
    <P>In connection with crime in the country, somewhere about the middle of March of this year a detective was convicted of shooting at another member of the force with intent to do him grievous bodily harm.  He had fired six shots at that individual, and his own statement was that he was a member of the protective corps and he had been escorting the Vice-President up to 2 o'clock on the day on which he committed this outrage.  This particular outrage occurred about 6 o'clock, about four hours after he is said to have gone off duty, his duty on that day being to give protection to the Vice-President, as a member of the special protective force.  What the defence was, the judge said at the trial that it was rather difficult to discover, but a certain amount of it turned on the question that this man was very definitely under the influence of drink.</P>
    <P>One point did arise.  This detective was cross-examined as to whether he was entitled to carry a gun when he was dealing with political crime.  I presume that counsel who cross-examined him in this way had his <Col N="64" /> instructions.  In any event it appears to be assumed by that counsel that a man who is escorting the Vice-President in this State is dealing in political crime.  He was asked if he thought that in such circumstances he was entitled to carry a gun, and he said he felt convinced that he had full authority to carry it up to 2 p.m. on the day when he was escorting the Vice-President, because that was special protection duty.  He spent his time after 2 p.m. in three licensed houses, and he went into one where the fracas occurred after that.</P>
    <P>The judge, when the jury had convicted this man on the counts I have spoken of, asked an inspector who appeared before him whether there was any arrangement for controlling the carrying of arms by these men, and the answer was that once a man was appointed to the protective corps, or the special protective division, if there is any difference, a gun was issued to him and he was personally responsible for that gun.  He was asked if the man was in personal charge and control of it all the time, and the answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He was further asked if he could carry it at any time, whether on duty or not, and the answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Will the Minister give us some further enlightenment?  Will he tell us whether that inspector was properly instructed when he gave those answers? What are the regulations governing this matter?  Will he tell us whether a man, when he comes to his moments of relaxation and when he spends some of these in imbibing intoxicating liquor, is entitled to be in possession of a lethal weapon and that the Minister has no regulation with regard to the putting of that man's gun under control of some of his colleagues, or a superior officer in the branch to which he belongs?  It seems an extraordinary thing if there is not some regulation to that effect.</P>
    <P>This case has caused not merely comment in court, as indicated by the remarks of the judge, but it has caused quite a lot of comment amongst the people who served on the jury and amongst people in other walks of life. It has been widely commented upon <Col N="65" /> that no matter how they intend to spend the evening, detectives apparently consider that they are entitled still to carry their weapons around with them, with the result that might have been expected when you had what was obviously a man who fancied that he had special competence in the use of firearms and who felt he could shoot at a man a certain distance away from him six times, not ever intending to hit him, but intending to riddle his overcoat, and doing that while his aim was not made in any way the steadier by the amount of liquor he had consumed.</P>
    <P>In that connection I want to ask the Minister what has happened to the evidence which the Minister for Finance, in June last, said the Government had with regard to the murder of Admiral Somerville.  The Minister will, no doubt, remember the outrageous speech that the Minister for Finance delivered at Balbriggan in the month of June, 1936.  When he was referring at that meeting to the I.R.A. and the murder of Admiral Somerville, he was questioned by a girl who asked &ldquo;Where is the evidence&rdquo; and his answer was &ldquo;You will get the proof and it will be a sorry day for those responsible; it will be their last shooting.&rdquo; That was detailed at considerable length by the Minister on that occasion.  As far as one can deduce anything from a plain statement made in that way, the situation in June was this, that in regard to the specific crime of the murder of Admiral Somerville the Government had information, that the Minister for Finance as a member of the Executive Council had been allowed to see what that information was and the Minister felt so sure that the evidence was both evidence that could properly be produced and was cogent to the point that he felt entitled to say that the proof would be forthcoming and it would be a sorry day for those responsible&mdash;it would be their last shooting.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any exaggeration in a process of deduction to say that that meant that the Minister for Finance was convinced that the evidence he saw in the hands of his colleagues would be sufficient to warrant a judge and sufficient to warrant a <Col N="66" /> jury in getting somebody hanged for that murder.  If that was the situation in June, there has been a remarkable lack of development in that situation since.  The Minister was also referring, of course, to the Waterford outrage in which one person, and one person only, and he not one of the principals in the crime, was brought forward.  I have referred to this previously and I am taking this opportunity of referring to it again.  I do not care what justification the Minister may have thought he had, that speech never should have been made, and I think that the Minister for Justice here to-night, if he felt himself free to do so, would agree with me in that statement and would ask this House to brush that statement aside as being the remarks of a wholly irresponsible man.  Wholly irresponsible as he is, however, he occupies a responsible position, and in parading in that way on the occasion I have referred to he announced to a public meeting what I have quoted about their having the proof, how it would be a sorry day for them, and that it would be their last shooting and so on.  Yet, after that statement, there is silence and inactivity as far as the murderers of Admiral Somerville are concerned. Will the Minister for Justice tell us&mdash; it may be an unfair question to ask him, and one to which it would be impossible to expect an answer&mdash;whether he knows what was the information the Minister for Finance had before him when he made that speech and if that information has been conveyed to the Minister for Justice now; and will he tell us why the Minister for Justice and those for whom he takes responsibility in this House have not taken any better or further activity on that matter?</P>
    <P>There is one last matter to which I should like to refer.  Despite the protestations of Fianna Fáil in connection with the expenditure on the Guards prior to their coming into office, I cannot see why we should be asked to spend so much more now than they then thought proper.  Looking through all the Votes here for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, I do not think there is one that does not show <Col N="67" /> an increase.  I think that every solitary one of them shows some increase, the smallest increase, I think, being in the District Court, where it is a matter of £100 odd.  In that connection, I put down a question to the Minister somewhere about the month of November last and asked for a record drawn up in a form to which we have become accustomed in this House, a stereotyped form giving the returns as to the amount of court work during a certain number of years, something in the nature of what was presented to the committee that sat on the Courts of Justice Bill. If I had got such a return, it would have furnished me with information as to the amount of work being done in the courts.  I asked for information of the work done in previous years in comparison with the work done now, and because there was, to the knowledge of all those connected with the profession, a very decided drop in the case work that was listed for hearing in the courts at the opening of the Michaelmas term of 1936, I asked further for a return which would enable a comparison to be made of the work listed for hearing at the beginning of the Michaelmas term in each of a number of years.  I have not been favoured with a reply yet and, as the Minister probably has some information at his disposal, I should like to get from him now whatever information he has on the matter. I do not think it would be any great trouble to get one part of the information, where I asked for the number of new cases, other than criminal cases, entered in the High Court and entered similarly in the Circuit Court. I wanted that information because it was a comparison that had to be made.  A reply given to me in May, 1935, was that both in the High Court and Circuit Court the case work had stabilised itself at about two-thirds of what it used to be.  There had been a temporary and artificial increase in the Circuit Court owing to cases under the Damage to Property Act.  That was a passing matter which should have been ended in one or two sittings but the time being enlarged through court decisions and for various causes, <Col N="68" /> it is possible that the type of case that would arise under that particular Act may come into the court for a few terms longer.  However, it is a wholly artificial type of court work and there was a huge number of cases under that heading&mdash;roughly, I should say, about 4,000.  Taking out this exceptional type of cases, however, and concentrating on the ordinary cases such as civil bill cases and equity cases, there had been in the Circuit Court a drop of about one-third.  In the High Court, as far as the summary and plenary summonses were concerned, and also on the equity side, more or less the same drop was shown. For the year 1934-35 there was an increase, but 1933-34 showed the lowest number of cases on record.  It had gone below the 5,000 mark.  There had been one year some 9,000 cases, but the figure had become stereotyped at about 7,000 or 7,500.  There was that definite drop, however, of about one-third of the High Court cases other than criminal work, and the statistics on the Circuit Court revealed very much the same drop of about one-third.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the whole story is told by an enumeration of these cases, because there might be enumerated in the former cases in the Circuit Court a number of cases of a small and unimportant type which had now disappeared to the benefit of everybody, and that the solid cases were still remaining.  It is notable, however&mdash;and until some better analysis is made the figures must stand&mdash;that the work had dropped in both courts by one-third.  That is as far as 1933-34 is concerned.  The next year showed not much in the way of improvement and the experience of everybody connected with the profession&mdash;we have not got the figures yet&mdash; is, I think, that cases in the past year have gone much further down than ever before.  If the Minister would give me the returns at the beginning of the Michaelmas term in each of, say, the last four or five years, we could make some comparison.  I think, however, we will have to go further back to 1929-30 in order to make a comparison.  However, even without having the detailed figures <Col N="69" /> before me, I think it is possible to say that, whatever it may be a sign of, legal business has by no means gone back to the point it was at, say, in the years 1928-29, 1929-30, or 1930-31, and I should be glad if, at long last, the Minister can give me the information I asked for in that question that I put down, I think, in November last&mdash;certainly at any rate before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I have excluded from that statement of cases any reference to criminal work because the criminal work, as far as the questions I put down were concerned, had been segregated entirely from the ordinary civil work.  The same story of a drop cannot be repeated with regard to criminal work.  As far as one can see from the published figures, criminal work was at least as great; that is to say, there was as much criminality discovered by the police and brought into the courts in these later years as there had been at any earlier period. In fact, I think the tendency was that if an addition was made of the Military Tribunal cases to the ordinary criminal cases, the tendency was towards an increase.  In that connection, I do not know whether statistics will show any big increase in a particular type of case, or two types of cases, but it may be that in certain areas one meets with better police activity and that, as a result, you have more cases coming under the notice of the police.</P>
    <P>There is a belief, which I cannot say as yet is backed by figures, because I have not got the figures, that two types of cases are on the increase.  One is that type of crime we can put generally under the label of sexual crime, and the other the robbery type of crime.  There appears to be in certain parts of the country, and certainly around Dublin, a great outbreak of crimes of the nature of robbery.  I should say that the judges sitting in the Criminal Court have more cases of this type to deal with recently than ever before.  Would the Minister say whether it is the case that in the neighbourhood of Dublin the question of robbery seems to be either engaging better police attention <Col N="70" /> or else that there are more people inclined for crime of this type?  I would like to have excluded from that enumeration, in any answer the Minister may give, if he can find it possible to segregate them, any crimes of the robbery type which have a suspicion of politics.  I do not want to have included anything in the nature of a hold-up which is believed to be, or known to be, the work of an organisation.  I am referring to the ordinary crime of the robbery type which in its lesser form is heard of in the District Court and in its more serious form has made its appearance in increasing numbers in the last couple of years in the other criminal courts.</P>
    <P>The sexual matter is not one that can be debated here in a very open way, but there is undoubtedly a growing apprehension that crimes of that nature are on the increase.  It cannot be said that it is because cases of this type are not properly punished when brought before the courts.  I think all the time there has been a very definite appreciation of the socially bad nature of these crimes, and I think judges and jurors combined have set themselves out as far as they can, by penalties and by proper findings, to stamp out this type of crime in so far as they can control it.  Notwithstanding that, there appears to be an apprehension in the minds of ordinary people that that type of crime is definitely on the increase. In that connection, possibly the Minister would tell us if his attention has been called to it and, if he agrees that there is a growing tendency in that direction, would he say what, if any, extra precautions he is taking with regard to this matter?  It may be that some better activity in the way of police patrols, better watching of certain areas or even a better directed expenditure of secret service money, would bring about an improvement in conditions.  Whatever be the figures in that matter, there is a feeling&mdash;I cannot put it any further than that&mdash;that this matter is not being as well looked to as it might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">

      <P>Deputy Dillon raised a number of matters with regard to juvenile crime, the trial and punishment <Col N="71" /> of juveniles and the steps that might be taken to look after such people.  I admit that there has been some confusion, as the Deputy pointed out, with regard to the respective responsibilities of the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  The position is that reformatories and industrial schools are under the control of the Department of Education and that Borstal institutions, which deal with offenders between the ages of 18 and 21, are under the control of the Department of Justice.  One has to sympathise with the desire of the Deputy, a very laudable desire, I admit, that an endeavour should be made to have the trial of delinquents conducted in such surroundings and in such an atmosphere as will not, at any rate, encourage the development of criminal instincts in them later on. With the majority of the suggestions made by the Deputy as to the trial of these delinquents I certainly have every sympathy, but I would point out that this is very largely a matter of administration by the district justice who is dealing with these delinquents. It is entirely a matter for the district justice as to whether he will clear the courts or not.  It is entirely a matter for the district justice whom he shall allow to remain there.  I do not think there has been any suggestion&mdash;at least the case has not been made&mdash;that the district justices have not exercised their discretion wisely and in the best interests of delinquents.  The Deputy also suggested putting certain of these people under the control of religious orders.  I must say that I have every sympathy with that suggestion, but whether it would be practicable or not is another matter.  The Deputy further suggested that there should be a Borstal institution for women.  I say again there are difficulties in the way of adopting that suggestion, and while it might be a matter that could be examined, I cannot say whether or not practical effect could be given to the Deputy's suggestion.  It will certainly be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy went on to deal with the question of Guards in the Gaeltacht. I should like to point out that <Col N="72" /> when Guards in the Gaeltacht received no pecuniary inducement beyond that enjoyed by other Guards in other parts of the country, they had to do their duty there.  Some progress, the Deputy will have to admit, was made with the Irish language even at a time when these Guards received no pecuniary inducement.  Such a pecuniary inducement exists now.  I should like to point out to the Deputy also that even in the far west or other portions of the Gaeltacht, the position has improved with the passage of years.  Areas that were very inaccessible some years ago, through the development of 'bus traffic and motor transport generally, are now comparatively accessible, and the Guards are not living in the wilderness that the Deputy seems to imagine.  All the amenities which he has suggested to make life more pleasant for them, while they might seem very desirable, are not, I suggest, matters that necessarily call for urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about statistics in the High Courts and Deputy McGilligan referred to the same matter.  I regret that I am not in a position, although I am very anxious to meet Deputies, to give Deputy McGilligan all the information he requires in regard to that matter. All I have had for some time past has been those statistics&mdash;it seems to have been the practice in the Department&mdash;that were furnished by the Department of Industry and Commerce. We tried this year&mdash;we have been trying for the last four or five months&mdash;to come together and to get printed and issued by the Department statistics that we have been trying to compile for some considerable time back.  We have been trying to have those issued annually, giving both in civil and criminal cases a complete survey of those particular matters.  I could, perhaps, give the Deputy very incomplete statistics, which I do not think would be of any assistance; in fact, I think they would be misleading. Deputy Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the question of registry of title, and what was being done to restore what was destroyed in the Four Courts.  Every effort is being made to speed that up.  I have not received any complaints of difficulty having arisen, but if the Deputy has any particular case in mind, and if he makes representation to the registrar of title or to the Department of Justice, the matter will be attended to. Deputy Dillon also referred to Borstal institutions.  The Deputy will find that in the report of the Prisons Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello raised the question of the temporary employment of court officers for the purpose of the execution of court orders, and wanted to get some undertaking that the nature and policy of the staff would be improved.  In support of that, he points out that two juries have awarded damages for the plaintiffs in actions against under-sheriffs.  I suggest to the Deputy that one has to consider the difficulties under which those sheriffs had to operate.  It is rather amazing that there have not been many more actions.  I think those men must have behaved with tact and discretion and a good knowledge of their business, since there have not been more actions of that kind.  I do not want to go back&mdash;as Deputy Costello himself avoided it&mdash; and talk about the incidents connected with the employment of those officials, but even in the most normal circumstances actions against under-sheriffs for mistaken execution of court orders have very often arisen, and I do not think it is anything against those men who carried out this work that these two actions were brought.  I think it was a great credit to the way in which they performed their duty that there have not been more actions.  The Deputy also referred <Col N="75" /> to the question as to whether it was advisable to take away from county registrars the duties of under-sheriffs which they are now performing. He said that he had been informed by very experienced practitioners that this transfer of sheriffs' duties to county registrars has not been a success.  I, too, have heard that position stated.  I, too, have heard complaints along those lines, but in normal circumstances I do not see why the performance of those duties by the county registrars should not work satisfactorily.  There is no particular brief for it from one side or the other.  The fact that the under-sheriffs' posts were abolished and the work put over on the county registrars has not been any saving to the Exchequer.  In practice it meant that when the duties of the under-sheriff passed to the county registrar, he had to employ extra staff to deal with that position.  There has not been a sufficiently strong case put before us to justify any change back to the previous position.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned by Deputy Costello, and also, I think, by Deputy McGilligan, that a reporter died in the courts.  I want to deal with that question.  From the information I have before me, that would not appear to be so.  Again, if there is any point in the matter, and if we have the same person in mind, he died in January, 1932, before this Government came in.  The information at my disposal is that that man was paid £100 more than any other reporter, that he was paid £400 instead of £300; that he was allowed £175 to employ extra assistance, and that that £175 was never used up by him.  If that is the position, I do not see how it can be reasonably stated that he died from over-work.  If the man himself did not find it necessary to utilise and exhaust the money placed at his disposal for the purpose of easing the work he was doing, I do not see how it can be said that the Department is responsible for his death.  That is my opinion, at any rate.  I have as much sympathy as anybody who has made a case here with the position of the reporter in the courts.  I know it is a <Col N="76" /> most trying position.  So far as the reporters who have to deal with the reporting in the Central Criminal Court are concerned&mdash;very exceptional circumstances do arise, I admit &mdash;certainly a very strong case must be and can be made for them.  The whole position of stenographers in the Circuit Courts and the question of staffing in the Central Criminal Court are at present under consideration, and everything will be done to try and secure a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also referred to the temporary registration staff.  He wants the Guards to do their duty more effectively. I think there can be no complaint with regard to the manner in which the Guards do carry out that duty.  They visit practically every registered voter, or, if not, they make the necessary inquiries with regard to every registered voter.  If there are any complaints&mdash;I believe complaints are very rare&mdash;well, the people who make them have got their remedy. They can make a claim that they have not been put on the list, or they can object that somebody has been put on who should not be on.  In addition to all that, you have in the country areas at any rate the rate collector as well going around.  He inspects and puts on the list the people in his area that he thinks are entitled to be on it. The Guards are brought in at the revision sessions to say whether they believe those people are entitled to be on the list, and whether, in fact, they are living in a particular area at all or not.  In that way supervision is exercised and nobody will be allowed on the register who is not entitled to be on it.  It is only, I suggest, in very big centres of population where a complaint might be made that the Guards had not done this work effectively. That would be due to people changing not only from house to house but from flat to flat.  In such cases there is the possibility of some people getting on the register who may not be entitled to be on it and of others being off the register who are entitled to be on it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also advocated a law reform committee.  If the matter were not so difficult we would all be very enthusiastic about it.  Many of us are enthusiastic not only for law reform <Col N="77" /> but for a codification of the laws.  I admit that in many ways we have anomalies in the law arising from the adaptation of enactments, many of them very old.  In the legislation that has been enacted here for many years past an effort has always been made to eliminate all those anomalies and antiquated Acts that have no relation to present-day circumstances or conditions.  In that way perhaps a reform of the law is being carried out that is not very noticeable.  I imagine that to carry out what Deputy Costello has in mind would not only be an expensive but a tedious job.  I can tell the Deputy that the matter is one that is being considered.  I am sure he is well aware of the difficulties that are undoubtedly in the way.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a reference to the £100 that appears in the Estimate for counsels' fees in connection with the Rules of Court.  As I stated when introducing the Estimate, the £100 in the Estimate this year is only a token vote.  I expect that it will be necessary to introduce later a Supplementary Estimate to meet the expenses that will have to be incurred putting this work more quickly ahead than has been the case previously. Both Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan referred to the Cork Circuit Court case and the question of secrecy. I am not in a position, at the moment at any rate, to answer that.  The necessary inquiries will be made about the matter.  I would, however, like to point out that if a judge did anything like that, he did it in the exercise of some judicial function.  Therefore I would consider it very unwise and, indeed, improper, to discuss the matter in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also referred to the transfer of jury cases from the country to the city.  That is a matter for the Attorney-General's Department.  It was, I think, very fully and satisfactorily dealt with by the late Attorney-General last year.  He pointed out that there are certain cases that must come to the Central Criminal Court&mdash; murder cases and so on.  With regard to the other cases, there has been no disposition or inclination to take them out of the areas in which the crimes are committed, or in which the <Col N="78" /> accused persons reside.  Sometimes, in the interests of justice, cases have to be transferred to the Central Criminal Court for reasons that are obvious to any sensible Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the question of by-laws dealing with traffic.  Those by-laws have to be dealt with between the Commissioner of Police, the Local Government Department and the Dublin Corporation.  I think the Deputy can rest assured, in view of the fact that those three bodies have to deal with them, that the police point of view will not always get away with it.  Deputy Corish referred to the provision of proper housing for the Guards.  That is a matter that we are trying to remedy as fast as we can. The improvement in housing conditions throughout the country has done something to ameliorate it.  We are doing our best to meet the situation and to alleviate it as best we can.  It is not correct, however, to say that there has been a cut in the rent allowance here to a figure lower than what obtains in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin complained about the delay in appointing an acting Circuit Court judge in Donegal. The information available in the Department was that the present Circuit Court judge was resuming work next term.  It was not represented to the Department that there was urgent work to be disposed of.  A similar situation has arisen in another area in the South where the Circuit Court judge has been ill for some little time. In view of the fact that there have been no representations either from the county registrar or other parties we have decided, for the present at any rate, not to appoint anybody as an acting Circuit Court judge in that area.</P>

      <P>This Vote carries the film censorship Vote and also the censorship of publications.  As far as I can gather from people who came into this country, there appears to be a varying practice with regard to censored books. Sometimes the officials at the pier head purport to have authority to stop a person who has a banned novel, but has it clearly in his private possession. There is no question of sale or publication. Sometimes the officers at the pier purport to have authority to take that book from him; at other times they do not.  Will the Minister say what is the regulation with regard to books on the censored list and with regard to an individual bringing in a copy of such a book?  I am not raising the point of a man having four or five, when there would be a suspicion of their being brought in for sale, but of an individual with one copy of a censored book in his private possession.  Is that to be confiscated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call the attention of the House to certain criticisms which I made two years ago on this Vote for the Gárda Síochána, and to ask the Minister if he is able to report any progress in regard to two matters in particular that I brought before him in regard to the lack of completeness in the arrangement for medical attendance on the members of the force.  I pointed out to the House then that there was not any system of attendance on the Gárda beyond what might be called a general practitioner attendance.  If a Gárda required any further attendance, he had to provide it at his own expense.  If he had to seek admission to hospital, it was also at his own expense.  I suggested that such an arrangement was thoroughly unsatisfactory as regards the proper degree of efficiency and of attendance and was not likely to promote the health or contentment of the individual guard.  The Minister in reply stated that there was about to be established, or had been just established a certain fund to assist the Gárda in paying these extra expenses. He said that a sum of £10,000 from the Reward Fund was to be applied to form the nucleus of a Medical Aid Fund, and the Gárda were to make a contribution to that fund.</P>
      <P>I should like very much if the Minister would tell us what has been the development of that scheme of which he announced the initiation two years ago, and whether the members of the Gárda are now in a more satisfactory position than they were then as regards payment for illness.  I should like to say that, whatever arrangement may be made for such a medical fund, it is an entirely insufficient substitute for a proper system of attendance for which the responsibility should be on the Gárda authorities and the State.  A Guard should not be in a worse position for the care of his health than a soldier of the State.  No application of a medical fund or benefit of that sort can take the place of a thoroughly efficient medical service provided by the State for their own servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point to which I drew <Col N="84" /> the Minister's attention and with which I know he is very familiar is the unsatisfactory method of appointing the ordinary medical attendants to the Gárda stations through the country.  I pointed out that years ago the system was that the Gárda authorities, acting on local advice, invited a reputable medical practitioner in the convenient neighbourhood of a station&mdash;ordinarily, as a matter of fact, the dispensary doctor of the district&mdash;to undertake attendance on the men who might be in that station during the year at a fixed charge per head.  That covered not only attendance on the men while ill, but general supervision of the station, supervision of the health of the men generally, and an assurance that the station was kept in a satisfactory and healthy condition. The medical officer was not merely a man called in to attend the Gárda when sick, but a man whose constant duty it was to supervise the health and conditions of living of the Gárda in the district.</P>
    <P>Some years ago&mdash;not in the time of the present Government&mdash;but a bad legacy from its predecessors, a worse and a meaner system was adopted for the appointment of medical officers. The authorities, instead of making a choice after consideration, adopted the curious system of inviting all or a large number of medical practitioners in the neighbourhood of a Gárda station to state the fee for which they would give personal attendance there. A local officer of the Guards then interviewed them and asked certain queries, the answers to which were reported to the authorities.  Though the Minister assured me last year that the lowest tender did not always get the contract, I think it was the custom that the lowest tender always got it; that the medical practitioner who valued his services cheapest got the work of attendance on officers of the State who are members of the Gárda. I do not say that they got the worst medical attendance, but possibly they got worse than they could have got, and that members of the medical profession who put the lowest value on their services were likely to be mistaken in that respect.  When a vacancy occurred medical officers were <Col N="85" /> asked the fee for attendance on members of the Guards who were sick, and the fee for visiting if more than one member was sick, presumably suggesting a reduction for quantities; and the fee for inspecting the station. As a result of the replies to the questionnaire the appointments were made.  When I drew the attention of the Minister to that matter two years ago he said that, as far as possible, they would try to deal with it.  I know that representations have been made to him in the meantime, so that I hope he is in a position to-night to tell us whether he has been able to make any advance towards a return to what was a reasonably satisfactory method of appointment, or, at any rate, to substitute some method for the one in vogue for the last half-dozen years.  No doubt, it would mean some additional expense, but I do not think the House is likely to grudge the slight addition necessary, if it is going to ensure a more efficient service for officers whose services we all value.</P>
    <P>On looking at the Estimate, I see that there is no increase provided for that purpose, but I hope the Minister will be in a position to say that he will be able, as I am sure he would like to be, to improve the service by having more money available than is actually provided here.  I cannot but think that the present system of attendance is faulty, incomplete and lacking in efficiency, and that it would be good business of the State to undertake the thorough care of members of the Gárda, just as it undertakes the thorough care of members of the National Army, so long as they are serving in the forces concerned.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. The fact is that the Minister is quite unable to make an extempore statement in Irish.  That is manifest from the way in which he has read the manuscript which has been prepared for him.  Is it in accordance with the rules of order that he should get up and misread Irish from a manuscript prepared for him by a translator in his Department, seeing that the rules of order refer only to special statements requiring strict accuracy or the words that a Deputy used in this House?</P>

      <P>Do the rules permit a Deputy to read unless it is necessary <Col N="91" /> for a high State purpose to choose words very carefully?  There is, I admit, a convention that where a high State purpose requires every word to be weighed a statement may be read, but in the ordinary course statements are not read.  There can be no question of a high State purpose on the introduction of an Estimate.  If the Minister wants to speak in Irish, we shall be delighted to listen to him; but we do object to his reading from a manuscript when he can plead no high State purpose for this breach of the ordinary rules of order of the House. If the Minister wishes to speak in Irish, we shall listen to him with respect, attention and pleasure, but we do object to his reading.</P>

Mar seo leanas atá líon an Ghnáth-Airm atá beartuithe a bheith ann, déanta suas:&mdash; Oifigigh, cúig chéad a h-aon is nócha; Daltaí, trí is caoga (ar a náirmhítear ceathrar Daltaí is ion-choimisiúnta sa bhliain seo; Oifigigh Nea-Choimisiúnta, míle, ceithre chéad a dó is triocha (ar a n-áirmhítear triúr daltaí is ion-choimisiúnta sa bhliain seo; Saighdiúirí Singile, ceithre mhíle a h-ocht is seasca; Banaltraí, seachtar déag; Seiplínigh, naonbhar.

Tagann an gnáth-mhéadú san go díreach agus nách mór ar fad de thoradh na dtrí neithe seo leanas:&mdash;(a) an tArm do dhul i líonmhaireacht; (b) costas págha is cothála do dhul i méid; (c) costas na tréineála speisialta do Chúltacairí agus d'Óglaigh do dhul i méid.  Cúig mhíle dhéag, naoi gcéad is ceithre púnt déag an méid ba ghádh chun líon an Airm do mhéadú dhá chéad, ach toisc gur féidir nách mbeidh an cóilíon iomlán againn ar feadh na bliana airgeadais go léir, níl soláthar á dhéanamh leis an Meastachán so ach amháin d'aon mhíle dhéag, naoi gcéad is ceithre púint déag.</P>
    <P>Gan trácht in aon chor, áfach, ar an nídh seo, atá soiléir, tá neithe eile, nách ró-shoiléir, sa scéal, as a dtiocfadh gnáth-mhéadú, fiú amháin dá bhfanadh líon an Airm mar do bhi cheana .i., cúig mhíle is trí chéad Céimnigh Eile.  'Siad na neithe seo go cumair ná costas breise na n-earraí is gádh chun an tArm do cotháil, comh maith le breisithe agus leathnuithe na págha is na liúntaisí atá údaruithe le Rialacháin.  Trí mhíle dhéag, naoi gcéad is ceithre púint nóchad an méadú a thagann de dhruim phága is liúntaisí, mar shompla, agus tá ann, leis, gnáth-mhéadú eile de fiche míle, trí chéad is ceithre púint chaogadh, gurb é costas bídh, connaidh, soluis, furra agus petrol fé ndear é.</P>

Níor ghádh anuraidh na cúrsaí sin do sholáthar ach amháin do sé chéad fear i gcóir trí mhí, ach tá orainn i mbliana soláthar do mhíle is cúig chéad i gcóir na tréimhse céadna do dhéanamh&mdash;rud a chosnóchaidh tímpal le ceithre mhíle dhéag is dhá chéad púnt sa mbreis alos págha agus cothála.  Tuigfear, mar sin, i dtaobh an ghlan-mhéaduithe iomlán de chúig mhíle seascad, ocht gcéad is trí púint fhichead go bhfuil suim nách lugha ná dhá mhíle sheascad, is ceithre púint triochad á caitheamh ar an dá chéad sa mbreis, Céimnigh Eile, ar chostas méaduithe na cothála agus ar an leathnú den tréineáil is gádh do Chúltacairí agus d'Óglaigh.</P>

Táimíd tar éis coiste speisialta do bhunú, dá bhrígh sin, a fhéachfaidh i ndiaidh na ceiste seo sa mhéid go mbainfeadh sí leis an dtír seo in am práinne agus chun aon roimh-chostaisí dá ngeobhadh léi do ghlanadh, tá míle púnt a sholáthar leis an Meastachán so.</P>

Go dtí so ní raibh riar ná eagar mar is cóir ar chúrsaí biadhlainne aca, agus measadh, maidir le h-am síochána, ná raibh ceart ná cóir á fháil ag an saighdiúir agus an scéal do bheith <Col N="95" /> amhlaidh.

Tar éis áird chuibhe do thabhairt ar an nídh seo, socruigheadh ar an airgead do dheonadh, de bhrigh go spreagfadh sé sin spéis na bhfear sa ghnó, agus nár ghádh, 'na theannta san, mion-chúntas do thabhairt ar fho-chostaisí.  Tá beartuithe, mar sin, aon phúnt déag do bhronnadh mar dheontas bliantúil ar na Cistí Leasa uile i dtaobh gach aonaid go mbíonn céad fear chun bídh ann.  Is súil linn, dá bhárr san, go ndéanfar na coiníollacha seirbhíse d'fheabhsú mar aon le saoráidí do sna fearaibh i gcúrsaí bídh do chur in oireamhaint don tsaol atá anois ann.</P>

      <P>It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the use of Irish as a medium for our debates is an excellent practice.  The prostitution of Irish and the making of Irish into a laughing stock by resorting to such expedients as the Minister resorted to cannot be too strongly condemned, either from the point of view of those who love the language or from the point of view of those who are solicitous for the proper conduct of parliamentary affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some general questions arise on this Estimate.  I should like to raise a question in relation to the position of the Army reservists.  I am, however, in a difficulty because that matter pertains not only to this Vote but to the Vote of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  From the Department of Defence, the Army reservists receive a certain modest retainer which everybody knows is not at all adequate to maintain family life or individual life.  It is merely a retainer payable so long as they remain available for service on request.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has, however, made arrangements whereunder no person can get work on a relief scheme under the Minor Relief Schemes Vote unless he is in receipt of unemployment assistance. The Army reservists, who are largely <Col N="98" /> farmers' sons, apply, when they want work, for a job to the Labour Exchange. In default of a job beirg forthcoming, they ask for unemployment assistance.  Immediately, in accordance with the law, a Guard calls to investigate their means, and he ascertains that they have an Army reserve allowance and reports accordingly. The Army reserve allowance is sufficient to disqualify some of these men for a claim to unemployment assistance.  That is bad enough, but that disqualification operates to disqualify them from getting any work. So, you find men who have had the public spirit to join the Army and hold themselves available for the service of the State in an hour of emergency being penalised all through the country, while their next-door neighbour, who never had the courage or the public spirit to offer himself for the service of the State in the Army, is able to get unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>In whatever language you can.  If the Minister has abated that giaring injustice, it is greatly to his credit and to the credit of his Department.  On the Minister's assurance, I pass from that matter, complimenting him on having removed a glaring inequality.  I should like to have some information from the Minister on the general position of sluaighte and the sluaighte halls.  We had a parade of the armed forces of the State on Easter Sunday&mdash;an occasion on which we all wish to see the Army doing credit to itself, and an occasion on which the Army, I am happy to say, never fails to do so.  It is a force of which we may well be <Col N="99" /> proud, and we might have no fear if any strangers were present to see the exercises that take place.  Can we say as much for the Sluaighte who took part in this parade?  It may be that the juveniles of this city are unduly ribald, but I am told that, since the recent parade of the Sluaighte, we have small children going round with drumsticks, with their tummies stuck out and their shoulders humped, saying, &ldquo;Now, let us march like a Sluagh.&rdquo;  Then they throw their shoulders back, draw their stomachs in, and say, &ldquo;Now, we will march like a soldier.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think if the Sluaighte are to reflect credit on the force which they have been privileged to join, we ought to be able to pick from the Volunteer forces all over the country a body of volunteers who will have sufficient training and regard for the uniform they wear to comport themselves as good soldiers on an occasion when they are marching in parade before the Minister of State responsible for the armed forces.  I regret to say my impression of the Sluaighte has been that, so far as appearance and martial exercises are concerned, they leave much to be desired and I should be sorry that the standard which they set for themselves should extend to or be accepted in the ranks of the regular Army.  If I know the Army well, I do not think there is any immediate prospect of that, but in the meantime I think the Sluaighte should conform to a much higher standard than they appear to have set themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to the Sluaighte halls. I do not know how far the Sluaighte halls have conferred benefit on the areas in which they have been opened. I have personal knowledge of only one such hall.  It is in a district with which I am familiar.  I understand the Sluaighte hall there was leased and, so far as I am aware, nobody has ever gone into it since the day it was opened.  There were only two members of the Sluagh in the town and recently the entire Sluagh left for England, and now there are not even the two Sluaghs to go into the hall.  cannot imagine that such an arrangement <Col N="100" /> is in the best interests of the Army.</P>
    <P>I am a great believer in the forces of this State standing above all parties. I think that no matter what Government is in office it is the duty of all public men to encourage respect for the forces of the State and the men who command them, and to encourage in the public mind a general recognition of the fact that these are men who are serving the State as opposed to any particular Government which happens to be in office for the time being.  It is not easy to promote respect for the Army and the ancillary services if you have a derelict old hall there which is the Army hall, which is apparently serving no useful purpose and is apparently nothing but a source of expense to the State.  I do not know how far that situation is reproduced in other centres.  I can only speak from my own personal knowledge of the centre that I know of, and certainly the Sluagh hall there reflects no credit on the administration responsible for it and steps should be immediately taken either to provide a sufficient number of Sluaighte to take advantage of it or else close it and allow the parochial hall to provide for the interests of the local people as it did heretofore.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us how many claims he has in his Department for pensions under the I.R.A. Pensions Act, for which he was responsible to this House.  Rumour sets the figure at a very high level indeed.  I have heard it said as many as 50,000 applications were received. No doubt that is a gross exaggeration. I have also heard it said that only 1,000 of such applications had been adjudicated on or disposed of.  It is incredible that any Department would have proceeded to the extent of doing only one-fiftieth of their work in connection with this business in the time that they have had at their disposal. An authoritative statement on that matter would put an end to such rumours and would demonstrate that no body of men in this country could be so irresponsible or reckless as to deluge the Minister with 50,000 applications when probably in the country there are perhaps only a couple of <Col N="101" /> thousand men genuinely entitled to relief under the Act in question.</P>
    <P>I do not understand Item Z (6).  I would esteem it a favour if the Minister will explain that matter.  What is meant by receipts from personal clothing purchased by N.C.O.'s and men?  Are we to understand that the N.C.O.'s and men have to purchase parts of their uniforms out of their pay?  If so, I would like to know what defence can be advanced for such a system.  It would appear under Y 3 that the numbers of the Volunteer force are declining.  If we take Y 3 in conjunction with Y 2 we find that the moneys appropriated for the Volunteer force are going down and that we anticipate training grants for 11,000 volunteers, including the 1st and 2nd line, in the current financial year, whereas provision for 18,000 men was made in the last financial year.  Perhaps the Minister will give us an explanation on that matter.  The Minister also made provision for the enlistment of 6,000 volunteers in 1936-37 and he anticipates only 4,000 in the coming year.  That is a matter on which the Minister might say a few words.</P>
    <P>I notice that provision is made under sub-head A (1) for military educational courses abroad for specially selected officers.  I heard to my amazement recently, and I have no doubt Deputy Victory will be shocked to hear it too, that some of our officers were actually studying military science in English military schools.  In the midst of this desperate war that we are fighting with Great Britain we are sending our officers over to learn military tactics from them!  I am sure that sears the soul of Deputy Victory and I would like him to intervene and tell the Minister what he thinks of sending the armed forces of this State over to learn their business from the base, bloody and brutal British Saxon.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to raise in connection with this Vote is one of more general interest.  It appears perfectly clear that, with the modern development of warfare, the prospects of any State with our resources putting an effective infantry army in the field are very remote indeed.  In fact, no army which we could mobilise or arm, <Col N="102" /> if it is to consist principally of infantry and artillery, is going to count as against the modern war machine of one of the wealthier and more populous countries which at present exist, particularly in the Continent of Europe. Modern development seems to have made the aerial arm of great armies disproportionately important and you have immense military and naval establishments admitting that their great size and great power would be virtually useless without an immense air force as well.  As I understand the problem, one of the great difficulties about building up an effective air force is not the provision of machines or explosives or fuel; though those do present difficulties of their own, they are not the major difficulties.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty is, if you are starting from scratch and have not an adequate air force, and if you want to build yourself up to a great air power, to train pilots and to train competent airmen.  You can build an aeroplane, if you are prepared to make sufficient sacrifice, in a comparatively short time, but there is no expedient by which you can make a mechanic into an effective war pilot without a protracted period of training.</P>
    <P>I think it is a good thing, within limits, if you are going to have an Army at all, to make that Army as effective as your resources will permit for the defence of the country, and therefore I would suggest to the Minister that he should completely reorient Army policy in that matter. We must have at all times a small and perfectly trained regular Army, much like what we have at present, so that the arm of the law will be maintained by the ultimate sanction of military force if that necessity should arise. The kind of Army we have at present is eminently suited for that purpose&mdash; all very highly trained men, very experienced officers, and regular soldiers of long standing upon whose discipline and prudence absolute reliance can be placed.  That is the perfect instrument for supporting the arm of the civil law in emergency.</P>
    <P>Instead of expanding along the lines of the volunteer plan and giving a half-baked, casual training to a large <Col N="103" /> number of youngsters, I suggest that the Minister could very profitably employ himself in building up a small air force&mdash;small in the number of its machines, but having the most modern equipment, and having a more or less revolving personnel, the object being to train an immense number of pilots over and above what the present requirements of the Army are, but which would be there available to expand an air force rapidly if a situation arose in which it became necessary to put this country in a state of defence.  To-morrow, if we had to put this country into a state of defence; and if we had immense supplies of aeroplanes from whatever source we could get them, they would be of no use to us at all because the number of pilots available is infinitesimal.  If we had over 500 highly trained pilots, either in the Army or on the Army reserve, our Army would become an immensely powerful war instrument potentially.  If you had 500 trained pilots, and if you were able to get an adequate number of machines, you would immediately have a very substantial air fleet capable of counting very heavily in the mind of any State that contemplated striking at the integrity of this State.  In so far as our Army can be internationally effective. I can see no other way, and I think it would be good for the morale of the Army, good from the international point of view, and good from the point of view of the State at large, to pursue that line, and then I think the Army would feel that they were not only discharging a valuable internal function as being the ultimate sanction of the law, but, in addition to that, that they were a really genuine protection for the national integrity of the State they were concerned to defend.</P>
    <P>I have a last word to say.  I offer that as an alternative to the policy of pressing forward on the volunteer line of development which is giving casual training to a very large number of young men.  This is a matter about which I feel a certain delicacy in speaking but, nevertheless, I think we are doing less than our duty if <Col N="104" /> we do not face it.  This policy of giving a casual, half-baked training to an immense number of young fellows, and then sending them back down the country, is open to two very grave objections.  The first objection is that it familiarises a large number of young fellows in the country with the use of arms.  If they were going to remain under discipline and if they were going to have a protracted period of training, guidance and instruction as to when and how and under what circumstances it is justifiable to use arms, that might not be so objectionable.  Where, however, you take a young fellow like that and show him how to use a gun, familiarise him and make him feel at home with lethal weapons in his hands, and then turn him out into the country, quite a number of young men may be tempted to embark on courses which they would never have dreamed of embarking upon if they had not been so familiarised with the use of weapons.  The second objection is, perhaps, of greater delicacy. We must face the fact that, not alone in certain countries, whether Germany or France or any other country, but all the world over, the general standards of conduct when a chap goes off on a spell of military duty and when he is not subject, as I say, to constant training and supervision, tend to become loosened. There is a rather general loosening of his general conduct, and he is liable to get accustomed to a standard of conduct very much lower than he ever knew in his own home.  Now, some of you may have seen magazines that have been published by Sluagh summer camps.  Of course, we must not be too prudish in matters of this kind.  Youngsters, when they are gathered together, are liable to be a little more plain spoken in their jests than the more sober members of the community; but when you find published in a magazine, with a caption of &ldquo;The Regiment of Pearse,&rdquo; pleasantries which, to say the least of it, would be more appropriate in very, very restricted company, and when you find these things printed in black and white in the camp magazine, <Col N="105" /> you begin to realise that there is a standard of conduct and a standard of thought obtaining there very far different from that which obtains in most country homes in this country. If you bring boys up from the country and familiarise them for a week, a fortnight, or a month, with those standards, and then send them back to the country, 80 per cent. of them may be no wrose for the experience, but 20 per cent. will set a very much lower standard for their general conduct at home than they ever set before.</P>
    <P>Those are factors that, I think, we ought to weigh carefully if we are choosing between developing the Army along the lines of the volunteer plan and developing it along the lines of making it, for international purposes, an effective aerial instrument. Bearing all these considerations in mind, I have no hesitation in saying that, as a civilian, I think the development of the Army along the lines of making it an effective aerial instrument for international purposes is the best line, and also developing it along the lines it has followed since the inception of the State, and that is the having, for internal operations, a small highly-trained body of officers and men upon whose discretion and prudence we can have absolute dependence. I submit these considerations to the Minister, bearing in mind that in this matter I am a pure civilian, but I hope this House will not fall into the error of thinking that the only person who is competent to have views on military matters is a military person.  There are things in connection with military matters that are quite proper for a civilian to discuss and, after all, we in this House are ultimately the people responsible and we are all civilians.  I should be glad, therefore, if the Minister would give his consideration to these points I have raised on this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I should like to refer on this Estimate, and that is the question of the treatment by the Army authorities of people who contract disease in the service.  Those of us who are members of county health boards see from time <Col N="106" /> to time accounts of men who have contracted T.B. during their service in the Army and who are sent down to the county health board for treatment. They are discharged after the course of some time from some of the military hospitals.  They are then sent down to the county from which they came and the county health board of that county has to take all liability for any treatment, such as sanatorium treatment, that they may require.  I do suggest that it is very unfair when a person contracts tuberculosis or any other disease in the Army, and when he is discharged in consequence of contracting it, or when that disease has been aggravated by service in the Army, that he should be allowed to become a liability on the local ratepayers.  The county health board to which I am attached have repeatedly made representations to the Minister and his Department in this connection with a view to the Department taking on that liability. I think any fair-minded person will admit that it is a liability which the Army authorities should discharge or for which they should be responsible. I take this opportunity of asking the Minister to reconsider the decisions that have been made in this matter because it certainly is obvious, or should be obvious to everybody, that this is a charge that should be borne by Army funds and not by local ratepayers, who at the present moment are put to the pin of their collar to meet charges that are mounting rapidly every day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in rising is to protest against the burden of the Army Vote.  When the Government Party were in opposition in 1928 the present Minister for Finance&mdash;I am quoting him for the moment; I could quote the present Minister for Defence and the Minister for Industry and Commerce several times to the same effect, if I had time&mdash;speaking in this House as reported in Volume 26, page 978, in the discussion on the Army Vote said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We only hope that we shall be able to continue the good work and that when next a Minister for Defence comes to submit an Estimate <Col N="107" /> to this House, he will be able to tell the Dáil and the people that the Army will no longer expect out of their savings and the product of their toil £1,800,000 and that we can maintain an Army, as we believe it can be maintained&mdash;an Army adequate to the needs of this country&mdash; for a sum of something less than a million; in fact, for a sum of something less than three-quarters of a million&mdash;and we speak of this matter not without the book.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 983 of the same Volume he is reported as stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have suggested that the Army is too expensive.  We do that, as I have said, not because we are antagonistic to the Army but we feel that the expenditure upon it is very much more than this country can afford.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that statement were true on that occasion, should we not now when the Minister introduces this Vote, take the question seriously, more especially since the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in this House within the last fortnight or three weeks, said that there were 45,000 small farmers either in receipt of unemployment assistance or signing up for it?  Yesterday in my shop in Ballyvourney a young farmer came in and asked me to cash a cheque for £4 10s. 0d.  As a guarantee of its security, he said that it was a Government cheque.  I asked him &ldquo;What did you get it for?&rdquo;  He said that it was a free grant of £4 10s. 0d. for draining a field of one acre.  I met the mother of that young man immediately afterwards and I asked her how many cows they had.  She told me that between two farms they had 20 cows.  Yet the Government were compelled to give that man a free grant of £4 10s. 0d. in order to help him to carry on.  Does that not disclose a very serious position?  Is that not a question which should be investigated by the Minister when introducing this Vote?  To show the inconsistency of the Government now that they are in office with their position on the occasion I have referred to, I would like to say that the late Government <Col N="108" /> reduced the cost of the Army from £1,760,646 in 1928-29 to £1,259,100 in 1929-30.  In 1930-31 the Estimate was further reduced to £1,173,794.  In 1931-32 the Estimate was £1,247,354; in 1932-33, it was £1,154,416; while for the present year it is £1,595,810.  I would ask the Minister to tell the House and the country, seeing that they always boast they have fulfilled their promises, why they do not carry out the promise made by the present Minister for Finance in 1928 when he said they could run this country with an Army which would cost no more than £750,000.</P>

I think it is a compliment to anybody in this country who shows his willingness to fight for the country, to be sneered at by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon was quite a young man when this country required soldiers as no country ever required them before.  He did not shove out his chest or any other part of his anatomy then.  He sat down during those years.  It is 20 years after the war is won that he becomes a military expert.  There is not a single page of that book on which he does not profess to be an expert.  He is an expert on other matters that are not mentioned in that book, including my Irish.  I have a constitutional right to speak Irish in this House, good or bad Irish, and I shall speak it when I like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 200 Volunteer halls throughout the country.  It is not in every district that the Volunteers have been a success, but, generally speaking, I have been very pleased with the manner in which the Volunteers have behaved themselves.  I think that it has done them a lot of good.  We have, roughly, about 10,000 trained first-line Volunteers, and as far as I have seen, they are a credit to their country.  Instead of lowering their standard, I think it has raised their general standard of conduct.  The Volunteers have now been in existence for about three years, I think.  There was a fair amount of turmoil created in some parts by people who were egged on by Deputy Dillon, but in spite of that, only about three cases of indiscipline have come under my notice <Col N="110" /> in regard to the Volunteers.  I think they have been a very fine example to the young men of their district. In regard to their general appearance in parades and so on, I think that as a Volunteer force they carry themselves very well indeed.  It is only somebody who knows nothing about military matters, and who himself never tried to march at any time, who cannot realise that it would be impossible to turn out a body of men with 20 days' training in the year to look as smart as men who are at it five or six years with the regular Army.  The regular Army is recognised to be one of the smartest armies in the world, and it would be foolish to expect that Volunteers, however enthusiastic and earnest they might be, could, with 20 days' training in the year, bring themselves up to that high standard.</P>
      <P>In some cases where the local Sluagh has not come up to strength, we have shut the local hall.  We hope, in time, to have halls that will be very much better than those which we have been able to obtain for the accommodation of the Volunteers in some districts.  We have been forced to take whatever accommodation was available.  Some of the halls were not very attractive, but they were the best we could do.  As I say, in every district in which there is a number of men who are prepared to give their services to the nation in the Volunteer force it is my ambition to provide for them a hall in which they can have indoor games in the winter time, and which will serve as a social and cultural centre for the whole district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the air corps, while I realise its importance, I do not think that we should do away with the rest of the Army and concentrate on the air force.  The infantry man, the artillery man, the armoured car corps and all the rest of them are as important in their own way as the air corps. We are trying, with the limited funds at our disposal, to see that recruiting and training in all the different corps and branches are kept in step.  During the last couple of years we have added a number of trained pilots to the air corps.  In addition, we have <Col N="111" /> 15 young pilot officers in training. One of the most important things in connection with the air corps, in order to provide for rapid expansion, is to have a trained ground personnel. That is one of the things in which we are most efficient in connection with the expansion of the air corps.  A couple of years ago we adopted a scheme of recruiting boys of 14 to 16 years of age into the Army for ten years, and during that time giving them very specialised training, so that at the end of eight or ten years they would be very highly qualified aeroplane mechanics and fitters.  That scheme has been a very big success. During the last 12 or 18 months we have had about 30 boys in training. They have progressed very well.  We are looking after their general education and training as soldiers, as well as training them as mechanics and fitters.  The other day we advertised for, I think, another 40, and they will start their training as soon as they are picked.  Of course I should like to have the 500 trained pilots that Deputy Dillon speaks of, but I think there is not much use in training 500 pilots when you have not anything like that number of machines to give them.  Between the regular Army and the reserve, we have as many trained men as would handle three or four times the number of machines that we have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of men being discharged medically unfit. There is no doubt that we would all like to see a man whose disease arose out of Army service being taken complete charge of by the Army.  That has never been the case.  I myself should like to see it done, but I do not know whether we would be able to do it.  In most armies in these times responsibility is not taken for the man who is discharged as medically unfit. It is only during war time that men can earn their right to pensions for diseases arising out of service.  I do not know what can be done about it here.  I should like to see it done if the funds were forthcoming, but I cannot give any promise in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I <Col N="112" /> am not asking for pensions.  I am suggesting that the local body, the county board of health, should not have to take on full responsibility in a case of that kind, but that there should be some contribution from Army funds in order to help the local ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister two questions.  The first is what type of aeroplanes have we in the air corps, and what are the most recent acquisitions?  That is one categorical question.  The other is that I do not quite see why Deputy Corish does not press for pensions for men who contract industrial diseases.  I think pneumonia and phthisis is virtually an industrial disease in the Army where you have an immense amount of exposure and so forth. Legislation has been passed in this House and elsewhere to provide compensation for men who contract industrial diseases in mining work, asbestos work, and a variety of other things. That kind of risk is insured against. There is no reason why the Army should not insure against it.  I should like the Minister to examine the question as to whether insurance may not be effected with a commercial insurance company, if nobody else, scheduling pulmonary tuberculosis as an Army occupational disease, and providing in that way for compensation for soldiers who become disabled by it.  I do not see why that should not be done.</P>

      <P>I should like to make myself clear.  Like Deputy Dillon, I certainly would be glad to see those people getting pensions, but I was just explaining to the Minister that I did not raise it from that angle. I was concerned at that particular moment with the people who have become a liability on <Col N="113" /> the local ratepayers by having to go into either the county home or the county hospital.  I say that is unfair to the local ratepayer and to the discharged soldier.</P>

    <P>Maidir leis an gcéad is seacht míle, dhá chéad is dhá phúnt chaogad atá leagtha amach sa Mheastachán chun pinsin agus aiscí créachta is mí-ábaltachta d'íoc, tá ceangailte orainn cheana do réir Reachta trí mhíle seachtód, seacht gcéad dhá phúnt is dachad de do chaitheamh.  Meastar go gcaithfear an chuid eile dhe, trí mhíle triochad, cúig chéad is deich bpúint, ar phinsin nó ar aiscí nua, a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha fé sna trí hAchttanna i rith na bliana míle naoi gcéad <Col N="115" /> a seacht triochad&mdash;ocht triochad, agus tagann aon mhíle triochad is dhá chéad púnt ar a laighead den méid sin fé Acht míle naoi gcéad a dó triochad.

    <P>Is do réir na dtrí nAchtanna céadna a h-íoctar liúntaisí agus aiscí cleithiúnaithe.

Maidir leis an suim atá curtha síos mar gheall ar Achtanna na bPinsean Seirbhíse Míleata, míle naoi gcéad a ceathair fichead agus míle, naoi gcéad a ceathair triochad, chífear go bhfuil ceithre chéad naoi míle is dachad, <Col N="116" /> ceithre chéad is seacht bpúint déag le caitheamh, sé sin, timpal le seachtó seacht fén gcéad den méid iomlán atá ar fáil chun molta d'íoc.  Maidir le molta atá déanta cheana, seo iad na figiúirí:&mdash;Fé Acht míle naoi gcéad a ceathair fichead, trí mhíle, dhá chéad is cúig molta fichead agus céad is trí mhíle caogad, is sé chéad púnt; fé Acht míle naoi gcéad a ceathair triochad, dhá mhíle, dhá chéad is cúig molta caogad agus ceithre mhíle ochtód ceithre chéad is seacht bpúint déag.  Sin cúig mhíle, ceithre chéad is ochtó moladh agus dhá chéad is ocht míle triochad, is seacht bpúint déag.  Dhá bhrigh sin, tá ceangailte orainn cheana dhá chéad is ocht míle triochad, is seacht bpúint déag do chaitheamh den méid iomlán atá leagtha amach le h-aghaidh pinsean seirbhíse míleata fén dá Acht, agus maidir leis an bhfuighleach de, sé sin, dhá chéad is aon mhíle dhéag, is ceithre chéad púnt&mdash;tar éis na locáistí Reachtúla do bhaint as&mdash;is ionann é agus pinsin a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha fén dá Acht i rith na bliana.

    <P>Is amhlaidh atá an scéal, dá bhrígh sin, fé sna trí hAchtanna Arm-Phinsean is fé dhá Acht na bPinsean Seirbhíse Míleata le chéile, ná go meastar gur trí chéad is seacht míle fichead, seacht gcéad is aon phúnt seachtód a chosnóchaidh an sé mhíle, ocht gcéad is dachad moladh atá déanta cheana, agus go bhfuil dhá chéad is dhá míle chaogad, is seasca púnt á chur ar fáil againn le haghaidh molta nua déanfar fé sna hAchtanna céadna. Fágann san gur cúig chéad is naoi míle seachtód, ocht gcéad is aon phúnt triochad atá sa mhór-iomlán. ach ó thárla go bhfuil céad is sé mhíle seachtód, ceithre chéad is caoga púnt den méid sin le caitheamh ar riaráiste, agus ceithre mhíle is ocht gcéad púnt ar aiscí, 'sé glan-mhéid an mhuirir bhliantúil ná trí chéad is ocht míle nóchad, cúig chéad is aon phúnt ochtód.</P>
    <P>Ní gádh puinn do rádh i dtaobh na neithe eile sa Mheastachán.  Maidir leis an suim atá curtha síos i gcóir molta fé Acht Pinsean de sna Connaught Rangers, tuigeadh le linn í chur <Col N="117" /> síos go mbéadh an riaráiste uile íoctha i ndeireadh mí na Márta, míle naoí gcéad a seacht triochad, agus ná béadh ach gnáth-chaitheamh le déanamh as san amach.  'Sé fé ndear an méadú fén mírcheann &ldquo;Reiteoir agus Coiste Cómhairlitheach&rdquo; ná luchtfuirinne breise do cheapadh chun brostú leis an obair a bhaineann le molta dhéanamh fé Acht míle naoi gcéad a ceathair triochad, agus is amhlaidh atá na deontaisí nách deontaisí reachtúla ceapaithe i gcóir beirt chlainne le Treoraí in Eirghe Amach míle naoí gcéad a sé déag, go bhfuil deireadh le n-a liúntaisí fén Acht, mar ní folair leanamhaint de sna liúntaisí sin d'íoc leo go ceann tamaill, i dtreo is go bhféadfaid leanamhaint dá gcuid foghluma.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one or two questions before the Vote is put to the House.  Can the Minister give us any indication as to when finality will be reached in the matter of military pensions?  The relatively huge sum of money which this House is asked to vote for military pensions is, I feel, beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  Nobody in this House, and in fact nobody outside the House, would begrudge that any ex-volunteer or ex-member of the I.R.A. who suffered loss of health should be properly and adequately compensated.  But I should like to have the Minister's view as to the position in relation to able-bodied men holding good positions who are in receipt of military pensions.  I want to make the point clear.  I do not begrudge, and I am sure nobody will begrudge, pensions to persons who served their country in any capacity and who lost their health as a result of that service, or whose property was destroyed as a result of that service. But we have now a very numerous class of people in the country who, in addition to holding good positions, are enjoying military pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There used to be a great outery in the old days if an old R.I.C. man or an old military pensioner held a position while other people were unemployed. We are now, I fear, going to create that class in this country again.  Again, during the Great War we heard the sneers at the man who <Col N="118" /> went out to serve in the British Army. We were told that he was a mercenary soldier and was getting all sorts of allowances.  But, on the other hand, our volunteers said, &ldquo;We are volunteers; we are not looking for any reward for ourselves.&rdquo;  The strange fact about it is that, now that all the trouble is over, there appear to have been about sixteen armies in the field instead of one.  It is because numbers of persons in this country rightfully object to the thousand and one pensioners we are creating, young able-bodied men, that I feel somebody should make himself vocal on this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Another question I want to put to the Minister is, whether numbers of persons, deserving people, people who contracted tuberculosis as a result of their service in the I.R.A. and Volunteers, have not yet received any pension? These are the people with whom I have sympathy and with whom, I think, most people have sympathy. Another point I would like the Minister to clear up is this.  I have been informed&mdash;perhaps wrongly informed&mdash;that it is essential to be a member of one of the Fianna Fáil clubs in order to have the case of an ex-Volunteer or an ex-I.R.A. man attended to.  It has been stated that there are people who refused to join Fianna Fáil clubs and who will not get pensions because they will not apply through the channel possibly of Fianna Fáil clubs.  These are points which should be made clear.  I want particularly to emphasise the fact that I do not object, and nobody will object, to men who have lost their health, who have lost their property, or who have suffered great pecuniary loss, getting compensated.  But when you have men in the enjoyment of £300, £400 and £500 a year getting pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy should deal with the Estimate and not advocate legislation or the repeal of legislation.

      <P>Under the administration of the Act hardship has been caused to some of those persons who were entitled to pensions.  Many of those persons to whom I refer have made application and have not yet had their cases decided.  Many of those persons who have applied are almost compelled to seek home assistance. These cases have been brought under my notice and I am sure they must have been brought under the notice of the Minister.  When does the Minister expect that finality will be reached in connection with military pensions, and when does he propose to examine some cases which may not have been brought to his notice?  Is he aware that a number of ex-I.R.A. men who are not connected with Fianna Fáil clubs have not been treated in the way that most people would expect they would be treated, in the way of getting adequate compensation or small pensions?</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Board dealing with wounds and disability applications is working as hard as it can, and the members have been through most of the applications that reached them for wounds and disability pensions.  There are some cases that it is impossible to deal with under the Act as it stands, but I will bring in an amending Bill, which I hope to have introduced within the next couple of weeks, to deal with cases of hardship that we could not deal with as the law stands.</P>

    <P>Ó Bhóta 45 go dtí 50&mdash;agus an dá Bhóta sin féin san áireamh&mdash;tá £4,635,508 measta mar lán-chostas ghlan na seirbhís oideachais le <Col N="120" /> h-aghaid bhliana a 1937-38, agus tá an tsuim sin níos mó ná suim bhliana a 1931-32 fé £146,560.  Ins na Bhótaí do Mheadhon-Oideachas agus do Cheard-Oideachas atá an mhór-chuid de'n bhreis.  I Bhóta an Mheadhon-Oideachais, tá £92,445 do bhreis ar shuim bhliana a 1931-32.  Tá dhá adhbhar mhóra le sin (1) méadú de bheith ag teacht, i n-aghaidh na bliana, ar líon na mac-léighinn admhálta a níocthar deóntais cheanntsraithe ar a son, agus (2) méadú, freisin, do bheith ag teacht ar líon na múinteóir a bhfuil breis tuarastail iníoctha leo.  Tá Bhóta an Cheard-Oideachais níos mó fá £82,776, ná mar bhí sé i mblian a 1931-32.  Breis ar na deóntais bhliantúla do choistí gairmoideachais an fáth is mó atá le sin, agus tá an bhreis sin le h-íoc mar gheall ar na deóntais áiteamhla do bheith níos mó ná an minimum atá leagtha amach ag Acht Gairm-Oideachais a 1930.  Caithfear bheith ag súil le méadú mar sin do bheith ann do ghnáth. Ós a chomhair sin, tá an Meastachán do Bhun-Oideachais níos lugha, fá £38,687, ná mar bhí suim bhliana a 1931-32.</P>
    <P>Ó Bhóta 45 go dtí Bhóta 50&mdash;Agus an dá Bhóta sin san áireamh&mdash;tá an Meastachán seo níos mó, fá £34,744, ná mar bhí suim bhliana a 1936-37.  Tá £7,926 do mheadú sa Bhóta do Oifig an Aire. An ghnáth-bhreis tuarastal, agus soláthar do thuilleadh áirithe feadhmannach, an dá nídh is mór-adhbhar do'n méid sin.  Tá £6,332 de laghdú déanta ar an Meastachán do Bhun-Oideachas. Do laghaduigh costas na gcolaiste oileamhna, agus meastar go dtiocfaidh laghdú eile, fós, ar líon na mac-lighinn i gcoláistí na bhfear, agus go dtiocfaidh costas na ndaltaoidí anuas, ar an adhbhar nach ndéanfar a thuilleadh aca sin do cheapadh feasta.  Le n-a chois sin, tháinig £13,830 de laghdú ar chostas tuarastal na n-oide scoile agus na ndeóntas ceanntsraithe, agus is é an fáth is mó atá le sin líon na n-oide do bheith níos lugha mar gheall ar an meadhointinnreamh do bheith ag tuitim.  Is cóir a thabhairt fé deara go bhfuil £3,000 do mhéadú ar an soláthar le h-aghaidh aois-liúntas oide scoile.  Tá an costas seo ag méadú leis go buan, ar <Col N="121" /> siocair pinsiona do réir tuarastal beag do bheith ag éag agus pinsiona do réir tuarastal níos áirde do bheith ag teacht chun íocaidheachta.</P>
    <P>Tá an Meastacháin do mheadhonoideachas níos mó, fá £12,870, ná mar bhí suim bhliana a 1935-36.  Tá £2,800 do mhéadú ar na deontais cheanntsraithe, ar an adhbhar gur mhéaduigh líon na mac-léighinn.  Nidh eile do chuaidh i méid is eadh an deóntas do Scoltacha Gaedhilge agus do Scoltacha Dhá-Theangacha, óir mhéaduigh uimhir na scoltach sin, agus mhéaduig líon a gcuid mac-léighinn.  Tá £5,800 do mhéadú ar chostas na ndeóntas le h-aghaidh breis tuarastal, agus is iad seo na neithe is príomh-adhbhar de sin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) An ghnáth-bhreis tuarastal do réir an scála;</P>

    <P>(3) A thuilleadh múinteóir do bheith ann a bhfuil breis speisialta iníoctha leo, mar gheall ar theagasc tré Ghaedhilg.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Bhóta do cheardoideachas, tá sé £19,634 níos mó ná mar bhí suim bhliana a 1936-37, ach ina thaobh sin, caithfear gan a dhearmad go dtáinig méadú maith ar na Stáit-deontais, ar an adhbhar gur h-árduigheadh na deontais áitiúla ós cionn an mhinimum do shocair Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>An Bhóta do eólaidheacht agus ealadhantacht, tá sé £6,026 níos mó ná mar bhí sé anuraidh.  I dteanta neithe eile, tá soláthar dhá dhéanamh ann do phostaí i scoltachá Gréasa, Péinteireachta agus Snoigheadóireachta an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealadhan, agus soláthar do chostais bhreise a bhaineas le clódóireacht agus cumhdú foillsiúchán Ghaedhilge, le h-íocaidheachta do lucht aistriucháin, do chumadoirí ceóil, do eagarthóirí láim-scríbheann (atá i n-Acadamh Ríoghdha na h-Eireann), agus le cánacha aghdar agus mion-chostais eile d'íoc.  Tá £5,380 de laghdú ar an Bhóta do scoltacha ceartúcháin agus scoltacha saothair i bhfarradh 's mar bhí sin i mbliadna 1936-37.  Is é is príomhfháth le sin go dtáinig laghdú, le do <Col N="122" /> nó trí de bhliana, ar líon na bpáiste ins na scoltacha saothair, agus, do réir sin, gur chóir an deóntas ceanntsraithe do laghdú.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tinnreamh na mbunscoltach, féadtar a rádh go geinearálta gur fheidhmigh an t-Acht go maith i mblian a 1935-36.  I gcomórtas leis an mbliain roimhe sin, thainig laghdú anbheag ar an tinnreamh&mdash;3% de na paistí go léir, agus 0.5 de na páistí a mbaineann an t-Acht leó&mdash;is é sin páistí ó 6 bliana go dtí 14 bliana d'aois.  Má tá, laghaduigh an tinnreamh go mór le linn na doininne agus an tsneachta agus an tseach do bhí ann sa ráithe ar dheireadh bhí an 31adh de'n Mhárta, 1936.  I scoil-bhlian a 1936, bhí an tinnreamh, i gCathair Chorcaighe de réir 89% de na páistí a mbaineann an t-Acht leo, agus ba é sin an tinnreamh b'áirde sa chéad do rinneadh i gCondae ná i mBuirg ar bith.  O sin anuas, bhí Cathair Phort Lairge&mdash;86.4, Cathair Bhaile Atha Cliath&mdash;85.9, agus Condae Chorcaighe agus Condae Phort Láirge&mdash;85.8 agus Condae Chill Choinnigh 85.5.  I gcomórtas leis an mblian roimh ré, mhéaduigh an tinnreamh i n-aon cheann déag de na Condaetha nó Condae-Bhuirgí, agus laghaduigh sé go beag i naoi geinn déag aea.</P>
    <P>Nuair do bhí Meastacháin na bliana seo thart dá gcur in bhur láthair, rinneadh trácht ar an mhór-obair do bhí le déanamh, maidir is tógáil agus deisiú bun-scoltach ar fud na tíre, agus tráchtadh ar a rabh le déanamh i mBaile Atha Cliath, maidir le scoltacha do chur ar fáil do pháistí ar h-athruigheadh a muinntearacha ó lár na cathrach amach do dhí áiteacha comhnaidhe atá ins na h-imeall-bhordaí.  An bhliain seo thart, do cuireadh suim mhaith leis an stáit-deóntas chun tithe scoile do thógáil agus do dheisiú. I mblian airgeadais a 1935-36, deónuigheadh £222,018 chun tithe nua scoile do dhéanamh agus chun seantithe scoile d'fhairsingiú nó d'aithdhéanamh. Is é rud orduigheas na riaghalacha gur £2 de dheóntas is cóir do'n Stát a thabhairt uaidh de ghnáth, ós comhair gach £1 dá gcuirtear ar fáil go h-áitiúl.  Mar sin de, tá cuid mháith de'n obair seo i dtuilleamaidhe an chonganta áitiúl atá riachtanach <Col N="123" /> do bheith le fáil; agus dá mhéad dá ndearnadh de thithe scoile, bheadh a thuilleadh déanta, dá gcuirthí an congnamh áitiúl ar fáil go lán-sásúil ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>I naimhdheóin á bhfuil déanta, tá a lán tithe scoile i ndroch-chaoi fós.  Sé barúil na gcigirí go bhfuil 10 nó 15 fá'n gcéad de na scoltacha i gceanntracha áithride atá mío-oiriúnach, ionnus gur gádh tithe nua do chur 'na n-ionad.  Is leor i gcoitchinne a bhfuil de scoltacha ar fud na tíre.  Tá tithe scoile fairsinge nua dhá gcur suas ar imeallaibh Baile Atha Cliath (agus timcheall Corcaighe leis) mar a bhfuil cuid mhór tithe comnuighthe dá dtógáil ag Comhairle na Cathrach do na daoine atá dhá dtabhairt annsin ó lár na cathrach.  A trí nó a ceathair de bhlianta ó sin, ba mhinic gearán fá easbaidh spáis 'sna scoltacha i lár na cathrach; agus deirtí go raibh páistí ar na sráideanna toisc gur theip ortha fáil isteach i scoil ar bith.  Ach tá athrú ar fad air sin anois ó d'imthigh cuid mhaith teaghlach as an gcathair go dtí na tithe nua.  Tá cuid de na h-oidí ins na sean-scoltacha cathrach i bpeiriacal a bpost a chailliad agus an dul i laighead atá ar an méid páistí ar na rollaí le tamall.</P>
    <P>Maidir le deisiúchán agus maisiúchán na dtithe scoile, tá an scéal mar bhí sé riamh.  Tá a lán bainisteoirí ann atá an dúthrachtach san ní seo agus ghnidh siad a ndícheall le na ndualgas a choimhlíonadh ar gach uile shlighe; ach tá uimhir mhór díobh ann ata faillightheach san ngnó so agus is beag beann leo cé'n bhail atá ar na tithe scoile fá na gcúram.  Ní dhéanaidh mion-deisiúchán nuair a bhíos gádh leis agus i gcionn roinnt bliadhan, bíonn cuma na faillighe ar na tithe. Ró-annamh a chuirid péint ar an adhmad ná dathú ar na ballaí go tráthúil, i riocht is go mbíonn na dóirse agus na fuinneoga ag lobhadh ó-n taise agus an foirgneamh tré chéile ag dul i léig.  Deirtear go bhfuil scoltacha ann nár cuireadh péint ortha i gcaitheamh fiche bliadhan.  Is annamh a cuirtear blátha agus tuir mhaiseacha ag fás ar aghaidh na scoile amach nó i mboscaí ar na fuinneoga.  Agus ní ró-mhinic a chitear pictiúirí geala feileamhnacha ar na ballaí.  Ní coinnightear clóis scoltach de ghnáth mar <Col N="124" /> ba chóir agus ní cuirtear caoi ar na casáin.  De réir tuairisce samhluigheann sé go bhfuil deallramh níos measa ar go leór de na tithe scoile ná mar a bhí riamh.  Ar chaoi ar bith ní féidir a rádh go bhfuil aon tionnrodh mór chun feabhais le sonnrú.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh amach cearcalán oifigiúl chuig bainisteóiri agus múinteóirí ghá ngríosadh chun aire do thabhairt do ghlanadh na gcúltithe.  Ach do réir tuairiscí na gcigirí, is beag toradh atá ann dá bhárr.  Is ionlochtuighthe an déanamh atá ar go leór de na cúltighthe ar fud na tuaithe agus is doiligh daoine d'fháil le na geartadh. Ins na bailte móra agus áit ar bith a bhfuil cóir uisce ní cloistear gearán de ghnáth.  Ach pé áit a bhfuil camracha tiorma is annamh a úsáidtear cré thirm go laetheamhail agus bíonn boladh bréan ag éirghe aníos dá heasbaidh. Is contabhairteach don tsláinte an chaoi a mbíonn siad.  Seo mar a scríobhann duine de na Roinn-Chigirí fán rud so:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Níl feabhas ar bith ar na cúltighthe tiorma agus deir cigire amháin gur scannal don náisiún iad faoi'n dtuaith.  Ní hannamh go bhfágtar na clóiseanna gan ghlanadh agus gan chré acht is ró-mhinic a déantar faillighe chomh mór san ortha nach féidir d'aoinne dul isteach ionnta in aon chor.  Tá scoileanna ann nach bhfuil cúltighthe d'aon tsórt acu gidh go mbíonn buachaillí móra agus cailíní móra ag freastal ortha gach lá; coir in aghaidh na sibhialtachta is eadh é sin, agus tá sé thar am deireadh do chur leis an neamart aidhbhéal, ar ais nó ar éigin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I rith an ama, tá suim dha cur ag an Roinn sa mhór-obair speisialta úd a bhaineas le Cathair Bhaile Átha Cliath.  I mbliadhain a 1935-36, cuireadh fá thuairim £60,000 de dheóntais ar fagháil le tighthe scoile do dhéanamh agus d'fheabhsughadh sa Chondae-Bhuirg.  Tá dlúthas mór dhá chur leis na scéimeanna chun tighthe comhnaidhe do sholáthar do dhaoine atá i n-áruis chumhanga i lár na cathrach, agus caithfear obair dhian do dhéanamh chun scoltacha do chur ar faghail go réasúnta do na pháistí a bhéas ina gcomhnaidhe ins na tighthe <Col N="125" /> nuadha sin.  Gach duine agus gach dream a mbaineann an obair leo, ní mór doibh iarracht sáir-dhícheallach do dhéanamh le n-a cur i gerích.  Tá glactha le scéimeanna chun a tuilleadh tighthe scoile do dhéanamh sa Chondae-Bhuirg, agus tá siad dá ndéanamh i geeanntair áirithe anois féin.</P>
    <P>Cúis imnidhe do'n Roinn an méid oide nach féidir leó obair d'fhagháil ins na Bun-scoltacha.  Le cuid mhaith bliadhanta thart ní raibh postaí le fagháil ag a lán de na fear-oidí i n-éis a dtréineála, agus, ar na mallaibh, tá cuid de na ban-oidí sa chás chéadna. An rud is príomh-adhbhar do seo, rinneadh mórán cainnte air le goirid. Is é sin an laghadughadh atá ag teacht ar an meadhoin-tinnreamh i n-áiteacha tuaithe.  Táthar ag déanamh díthchill leis an scéal seo do léigheas chomh maith agus is féidir, agus le n-a aghaidh sin, ba léir go gcaithfidhe gan a oiread adhbhar oide do leigean isteach ins na Coláistí Oileamhna.  Tá socrughadh déanta dá reir sin, agus táthar ag smuaineadh ar riaghlacha eile do dhéanamh mar gheall ar an scéal céadna.  Ach, taobh amuigh de'n fhaithchill seo, tá neithe áirithe ann cheana is dóiche bheith ina gcúis le gan a oiread oide do bheith ar easbhaidh oibre agus le gan laghadughadh buan do choinneáil ar líon na ndaoine a leigfear chun tréineála&mdash;rud do caithfidhe a dhéanamh, dá maireadh an scéal mar tá sé.  Sa chéad chás de, tá an riaghail a bheireas ar ban-oidí éirghe as an múinteóireacht tráth póstar iad, má's nidh gur tar éis an ladh de Iúl, 1934, do fuair siad a gcéad phosta seasta.  Níor bh'fhéidir don riaghail sin athrughadh mór ar bith do dhéanamh go fóill, dar ndóigh; ach, le h-imtheacht aimsire, béidh a thuilleadh posta folamh dá barr.  I gcás na bhfear féin, is féidir go mbéidh beagán postaí sa bhreis le fagháil, ar an adhbhar gur dócha cuid de na ban-oidí do bheith ag éirghe as an múinteóireacht mar gheall ar na riaghlacha fá leith a bhaineas le ceapadh oidí do chineálacha áirithe scoltach.  Ina dteannta sin, tá molta an Choiste do bhreathnuigh cúrsaí na Scoltacha Ceartucháin agus na Scoltacha Saothair.  Má chuirtear i ohfeidhm, maidir leó seo, na coingheallacha a bhaineas le cáilidheachta oidí <Col N="126" /> na mBun-Scoil, is léir go dtabharfaidh sin obair, de réir a chéile, do fhir agus do mhná do tréineáileadh ina n-oidí de Bhun-Scoltacha.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, tá an cheist chomh mór leathadach sin agus nach leór leis an Roinn fanamhaint le toradh na riaghlach seo a dubhairt me.  Ní h-é amháin go bhfuiltear ag leanamhaint do na cosca do bhí ann cheana, ach táthar ag cur a thuilleadh i bhfeidhm mar gheall ar líon na n-oide do thabhairt i gcomhthromacht leis an riachtanas. Ceann amháin de na riaghlacha seo eile, troimeascann sé glacadh feasta mar Oidí Bun-Scoil le fir ná le mná do tréineáileadh taobh amuigh de Shaorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na Fó-Mhaighistreasaí Conganta, is riachtanach, dar leis an Roinn, gan a oiread aca do bheith dhá n-admháil gach bliadhain, agus tá riaghlacháin scrúduighthe déanta le n-a agaidh sin.  Béidh feabhas níos airde ag teastáil i mbéal-scrúdughadh na Gaedhilge, agus stadfar de'n nós do bhí ann roimhe seo leigean do iomaitheóirí áirithe dul faoí scrúdughadh athuair i n-adhbhair do theip ortha roimh ré.  Fuagradh go mbéadh an dá riaghail sin i bhfeidhm i mbliadhain a 1938, agus fuagradh, freisin, go gcoinneóchadh an Roinn de cheart aca féin laghadughadh, de réir riachtanais, do dhéanamh, i mbliadhain ar bith, ar an lion iomaitheóir do bhéadh ion-ghlactha as an méid do dhéanfadh coingheallacha an scrúduighthe do coimhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an obair sna scoltachaí, is léir ó chonntaisí na gcigirí go bhfuil mór-chuid na noidí mar bhíodar riamh dílis agus fonnmhar ag tabhairt teagaisc mhaith agus deagh-oileamhainte dá gcuid daltaí.  Taobh amuigh díobh san atá ar bheagán Gaedhilge&mdash; agus tá a líon san ag dul i lagadh ó bhliadhain go chéile&mdash;táid na h-oidí go léir agus a ndóthain eolais aca chun a bhfuil do dhualgaisí ortha do choimhlíonadh. Caitheann a bhfurmhór cuid mhaith dúthrachta le na saothair in oileamhaint agus i dteagase na bpáistí, agus is féidir a rádh go bhfuil an toradh ar foghnamh i gcoitchinne.  Tá roinnt de na h-oidí nach ndéanann obair chómh éifeachtamhail is d'fhéadfaidís ach cur chuige ar mhodha ní ba tuigseanaighe agus machtnamh a dhéanamh ar riachtanaisí an chláir <Col N="127" /> agus ar an gcaoi is fearr chun a dteagasc a chur in oireamhaint do na páistí ó bhliadhain go bliadhain agus ceachta dá réir sin d'ullmhú ó ló go ló.  Ag cur síos ar an rud so deir cigire:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá beagán de na h-oidí fós ann nach dtuigeann cad is ullmhúchán ann seachas crothán do nótaí seachránacha a bhreacadh síos gan machtnamh ar fhorfhás an ádhbhair nó ar fhigheadh na gceachtann as a chéile. Bheirtear fá deara go ró-mhinic go leagann oide scéim oibre amach i dtosach na scoil-bhliadhna ach i gcionn tamaill ghníonn sé faillighe ann, i slighe nach cabhair ar bith don teagasc an scéim agus nach bhfuil ann ach scríbhinn le cur ós comhair an chigire.  Cuirtear cuid mhór ama amudha le teagasc scaoilte gan cinnteacht cuspóra.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Níl ach fíor bheagán de na h-oidí a áirmhtear mar oidí gan éifeacht.  Seo leanas fó-chéadas na h-oidí i Saorstat Eireann do réir na réimeann atá faighte aca ins na mór-thuairiscí:&mdash; An-Eifeachtach 27.7; Eifeachtach 68.2; Gan Eifeacht 4.1.</P>
    <P>Tá an uimhir múinteóiri a bhfuil láncháilidheacht san nGaedhilg aca .i. iad san a bhfuil an teastas dá-theangach nó an t-ard teastas aca, ag dul i méid ó bhliadhain go chéile.  Ní áirmhtear ach na h-oidí a bhfuil an teastas dá-theangach ar a laghaid aca mar oidí arbh fhéidir a rádh le cinnteacht go bhfuil sé ar a gcumas an clárscoile i na iomlán do chóimhlíonadh, .i. a mbéadh ar a gcumas na h-ádhbhair fré chéile a mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg áit a bhfuil a ndóthan Gaedhilge chuige sin foghlumtha ag na páistí.  Seo thíos an fóchéadas de na h-oidí a bhfuil gach cineál teastais aca:&mdash;An t-Ard-teastas 6.5; an Teastas Dá-theangach 47.6; an teastas 28.6; gan teastas ar bith 17.3.</P>
    <P>Furmhór de na daoine atá gan teastas is daoine iad atá aosta, agus do réir mar imthigheas siad as an seirbhis, tagann daoine óga i na nionad atá lánoilte ar an nGaedhilg.  Fuair an chuid is mó díobhtha so a gcuid oideachais ar fad tré Ghaedhilg agus ba cheart dóchas a bheith ag Gaedhil go néireochaidh leo siúd an Ghaedhilg a chur i nuachtar san tír seo i gcaitheamh <Col N="128" /> aimsire.  Ach tá duine de na Roinnchigirí gan bheith ró-mhuinghíneach as an dream óg, agus labhrann sé fútha mar leanas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Na h-oidí óga a bhfuil a ndóthain Gaedhilge aca, agus a fuair oideachas lán-Ghaedhealach ó thús, ceapfaí go bhfeicfí iad go léir i lár baill i ngach áit i na mbeadh Gaedhealachas dá shaothrú, ag múineadh agus ag mealladh daoine le fórsa a sompla, ach ní mar sin atá go fóill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I rith na scoil-bliadhna 1934-35 rinneadh an clár scoile d'éadtromú.  Gearántai air na bliadhanta roimhe sin go raibh riachtanaisí an chláir ró-throm chun caoi cheart a bheith ag na múinteoiri leis an nGaedhilg a chur chun cinn mar ba chóir.</P>
    <P>'Sé baramhail furmhór na gcigirí go bhfuil feabhas tagaithe ar mhúineadh na Gaedhilge de bhárr éadtromú an Cláir, de bhárr an chabhair a gheibh na h-oidí as na Notaí do mhúinteoirí. agus be bharr muinteoirí óga atá oilte go maith san teangaidh bheith á gceapadh i nionad meanoidí a chuaidh ar phinsiún.  Nílid ar aon intinn gur socar do'n Ghaedhilg a rinne an tathrú ar an gClár.  Tá roinnt de na cigirí nach léir dóibh aon fheabhas dá bhárr. Is dócha go bhfuil breitheamhnas chóir a thabhairt ag an Roinn-Chigire a chuir síos ar an gceist mar leanas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá an clár nua ag cuidiú go mór leis an nGaedhilg in aon scoil in a bhfuil a ndóthain Gaedhilge ag na hoidí chun a chuspóir do chur i gcrich.  Tá scoileanna eile ann, amhthach, scoileanna in a bhfuil na hoidí ar bheagán Gaedhilge, agus is é deifridheacht a rinne an clár nua an cúrsa léighinn do laghdú go mór gan aon mhaith in aon chor do dheanamh do'n Ghaedhilg.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sé tuairim na gcigirí fré chéile gur mhór an chabhair do na múinteoiri na &ldquo;Nótaí do Mhúinteoirí,&rdquo; iad sin a ghnidh staidéar cruinn ortha agus a chuireas a gcomhairle i gcrich.  Ach tá roinnt mhaith oidí ann nach gcuireann aon stró ortha féin na Nótaí do scrúdú agus beart dá réir do dhéanamh.  Ní leagaid amach scéimeanna tuigscanacha i gcaoi go mbeadh néithe áitride&mdash;puinntí gramadaighe, <Col N="129" /> cora cainnte, leathnú stór focal&mdash;le teagasc ó sheachtmhain agus go leanfaidh cúrsa bliadhna amháin ar chúrsa na bliadhna dár gcionn.  Ní dhéanaid aithdheanamh ar an obair go féilteamhail. Ní bhíonn aon órd ealadhanta ar a gcuid teagaisc.  Ní thugaid sompla maith do na páistí ag baint úsáide as an nGaedhilg gach uair a bhíos rud la rádh aca taobh amuigh de'n teagasc.  Go leor de na hoidí ni bhíonn ar siubhal aca ach síorcheistiú agus an fhreagairt chéadna ag na páistí i gcaoi nach feidhm nadúrtha a baintear as an teangaidh.  Amannta bítear ró-shásta le haon tsaghas freagra agus ní ceartuightear na lochta.  Ní cuirtear suim i bhfoghraidheacht ná i gcruinneas abairte. Ach sé an rud is measa ag oidi de'n chineál so nach gcuirid gradh do'n Ghaedhilg ná do'n tír i gcroidhe an pháiste, ach a mhalairt go minic, mar is baoghalach nach bhfuil a gcroidhe féin san gcúis.</P>
    <P>Ach scoil ar bith a bhfuil múinteoirí dioghraiseacha tuigseanacha ionnta, ni bhionn aon rian d'easbaidh duthrachta ar na daltaí agus is mór an dul 'un tosaigh a bhíos le breathnú ar an obair ó bhliadhain go chéile.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir bheith ró-shásta leis an dul chun cinn in a lán scol i mBaile Átha Claith agus ins na contaethe timcheall air.  Seo sleachta as tuairiscí na Roinn-Chigirí a bhfuil an limistéar fán na gcuram:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  &ldquo;Tá furmhór na gCigirí míshásta leis an ndul chun cinn atá a dhéanamh ag na naoidheanaín i labhairt na Gaedhilge, agus tá mór-chuid d'oidí na cathrach ag gearán i dtaobh a luighead eolais ar Ghaedhilg a bhíonn ag na páistí ag teacht chuca na naoidh-scoileanna.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(2)  &ldquo;Caithfidh mé a rádh go bhfuil labhairt na aGedhilge lag go leor ins na hocht gceanntair seo....  Ní bhíonn na páistí i ndon de ghnáth an teanga do labhairt ag fágháil na scoile dhóibh.  Ní bhíonn an foclóir aca chuige sin, agus ní bhíonn líomhthacht ná cruinneas ná comas cainnte aca, agus teipeann ar an gcuid is mó aca cunntas cruinn tuigseanach a thabhairt ar rudaí bunadhasacha simplí.  Meascann siad aimsireacha <Col N="130" /> na mbriathar i gcaoí a cuirfeadh éadóchas ar dhuine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do réir gach tuairisce tá feabhas ag teacht ar staid na Gaedhilge san nGaedhealtacht ó cuireadh scéim an dá phúnt i bhfeidhm.  &ldquo;Is léir,&rdquo; arsa cigire &ldquo;gur stop an deontas an meath san Ghaedhealtacht agus san Bhreach-Ghaedhealtacht.&rdquo; Bhí trácht fada ar an gceist seo i dtuarasgabháil deiridh na Roinne agus is beag athrú a tháinig ar an scéal ó shoin.  Is mall réidh atá an Ghaedhilg ag fairsingiá mar ghléas múinte, agus ní féidir bheith ag súil le haon fhás mhór bheith fuithe go ceann roinnt blian do réir mar bhéas oidí a bhfuil lánchailidheacht Gaedhilge aca ag dul i líonmhaireacht.  Tá mór-chuid de na h-oidí a bhfuil eolas maith ar an nGaedhilg aca ag déanamh a ndíchill. Bheirid teagase tré Gheadhilg do réir a n-acfuinne agus acfuinn na ndaltaí.</P>
    <P>An chomhairle oifigiúil agus na coingheallacha a bhaineas le feidhmiú na Gaedhilge mar ghléas múinte, tá siad le léigheadh san imlitir a foillsigheadh i mí na Samhna, 1931.  Tá sé luaidhte annsin nach ceart an Ghaedhilg d'usáid mar ghléas múinte ach mar a bhfuil eolas maith ag an oide ar labhairt na teangadh agus comas réasunta maith ag na daltaí uirithi freisin, agus moltar don oide gnáith-teanga a dhéanamh de'n Ghaedhilg i gcóir mion-chaint na scoile sul a dtosuighthear ar na h-adhbhair eile a mhúineadh tríthe. Tosc go mbítí a rádh go raibh oidí ag gabháil do mhúineadh tré Ghaedhilg sul ar gcóimhlíonadh na coingheallacha so agus go raibh cigirí ghá ngríosadh chuige, cuireadh amach cearcalán ag déanamh ath-chuimhnimh ar an imlitir thuas-ráidhte agus a dhéanamh soiléir nach raibh aon athrú ar intinn na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na h-adhbhair léighinn eile is beag athrú atá tagaithe ar a dteagasc sna scoltachaí.  Maidir leis an scrúdú le n-aghaidh theistimér eacht na nbun-Scoltac, tá sé le rádh agam, mar bhí roimhe seo, nar chuir ach fír-bheagán oide a gcuid scoláire chun an scrúduighthe.  An bhliain seo thart, ní dheachaidh fé scrúdú ach fá thuairim 10% de'n méid scoláire d'fheadfadh dul.  Tá an Roini ag breathnú slighthe áirithe is dóigh leó <Col N="131" /> do chuirfeadh athrú chun feabhais ar an scéal sin.</P>
    <P>Deineadh an tríomhadh íocaidheacht de'n deontas as ucht na Scoil-Bhliadhna dar chríoch 30 Meitheamh, 1936, agus do thuill breis agus deich míle páiste agus cúig míle líntige nach mór an deóntas.  Is léir ó na figiuirí seo go bhfuil an cuspóir 'á tabhairt go sasúil 'un criche.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Meadhon-Oideachas, tá líon na scoltach agus líon na mac-léighinn ag síor-dul i méid.  319 de Mheadhon-Scoltacha Aitheanta do bhí ann i mbliadhain a 1935-36.  San tréimhse chéadna do chuaidh líon na mac-léighinn suas ó 33,499 to dtí 35,111 &mdash;agus ní bhaineann na figúracha seo leis an méid mac-léighinn do bhí ag freastal na ranga ullmhúcháin i meadhon-scoltacha.</P>
    <P>Le deich mbliadhna thart, tá líon na Meadhon - Scoltach agus na mac-léighinn ag dul i méid go buan.  Ins na deich mbliadhna sin, tháinig 14% de bhreis ar líon na mac-léighinn.  Dá réir féin ba mhó do chuaidh líon na gcailín i méid ná mar do chuaidh líon na mbuachaill&mdash;60% breis na gcailín, agus 42% breis na mbuachaill.  Ar fud na tíre go léir do thárla an méadughadh &mdash;is é sin le rádh i ngach aon Chundae agus i ngach aon Chundae-bhuirg.</P>
    <P>Mar bhí roimhe seo féin, tá sé le rádh fá bhliadhain a 1935-36, freisin, go dtáinig breis ar líon na scoltach ina ndéantar an teagasc tré Ghaedhilg.  I mbliadhain a 1935-36 bhí teagasc dhá dhéanamh tré Ghaedhilg i 57.5% de na scoltacha aitheanta; i mbliadhain a 1934-35, ba é a méid a bhí ann 56.4%.</P>
    <P>Le beagán bliadhanta anuas, b'iontuigthe as tuarascabhála na gcigire go bhféadfadh fuaimeanna agus cora cainnte an Bhéarla bheith ag cur isteach, a bheag nó a mhór, ar an nGaedhilg, mar gheall ar an mbreas mhóir feadhma atáthar a bhaint as an nGaedhilg chun adhbhair eile do theagasc.  Ba mhian leis an Roinn a leithéid sin de chontabhairt do sheachnadh, agus caoí do thabhairt do mhuinteóirí sochar do bhaint as Gaedhilg na Fíor-Ghaedhealtachta, idir comhrádh agus litridheacht.  Mar sin de, cuireadh ar bun cúrsa thrí seachtmhaine, i Samhradh Bhliadhna a 1936, agus bhí an cúrsa sin faoí stiúradh ag ollamhain <Col N="132" /> cháileamhla a bhfuil Gaedhilg ó'n gcliabhán aca.  Ag cleachtadh foghraidheacht na cainnte, agus ag cleachtadh na leaganacha cainnte atá dúthchasach ag an nGaedhilg, is eadh caitheadh an tréimhse go léir.</P>
    <P>Is beag má tá scoil ar bith ann anois nach n-aithnightear innte nach bhfuil a dteagasg sa Ranng agus i bhfoghluim na gceacht ach roinn amháin d'oileamhaint agus d'oideachas na n-óg.  Tuigtear nach ceart faillighe a leigint i sláinte an chuirp ná i bhforás na h-inntleachta, agus dá bhrígh sin ghníthear cúram mór de na cluichí agus den drill agus den rinnce agus den drámaidheacht agus den ceol agus de dhíospóireachtaí.  Thar gach tráth eile, is féidir a dheimhniú faoin tráth seo i láthair go bhfuil iarraidh dá déanamh ag na meadhon sgoileanna gach taobh agus gach gnó den oideachas do chur ar fagháil do na daltaí agus do chur i gcion ortha.</P>
    <P>Is mór an gar do na daltaí na leabharlanna de leabhra maithe ealadhanta atá curtha ar bun anois ag furmhór mór na scoltach.</P>
    <P>Is ar éigin atá sgoil ar bith ann anois nach leagann am ar leith amach chun léightheoireachta príobháidighe, agus téigheann sé sin go mór chun suime d'eolas na ndaltaí, go h-áithrid i gcás na dteangthach.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh cáilidheachta, tá feabhas ag teacht ar na múinteóirí ó bhliadhain go bliadhain.  Daoine duthrachtacha díoghraiseacha 'seadh an mhór-chuid mhór de na Meadhon-Mhúinteóirí, agus cibé deis a fhághas siad ar iad féin d'fheabhsú gabhann siad léi go fonnmhar.</P>
    <P>An borradh agus an fás a bhí faoi'n nGaedhilg anuraidh ní trághadh ná laige a tháinig ortha i rith na bliadhna ach a atharrach sin ar fad.  Maidir leis na hádhbhair eile, níl móran le rádh ina dtaobh thar an méid adubhradh anuraídh.  Cloistear gearán ó na cigirí ar uairibh nach ndéantar dóthain cúraim d'fhoghraidheacht na nuadhtheangthach agus nach mbaintear feidhm mar budh cheart as an stair ins na rannganna Laidne agus Gréigise.</P>
    <P>Le n-a mheas ina h-iomlán, bhí bail maith ar an obair ins na sgoltacha, bhí na sgoltacha dá stiúradh go healadhanta <Col N="133" /> agus bní na múinteóirí agus na daltaí ag obair go duthrachtach i rith na sgoilbhliadhna atá caithte, 1935-36.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGairm-oideachas, is áthas liom bheith i ndon a rádh go bhfuil sé ag dul chun cinn go h-anmhaith ina iomlán, beagnach.  Le cúig seisiúin anuas, tá scéimeanna faoí Acht Gairm-Oideachais a 1930 i bhfeidhm, ar fud an tSaorstáit.  Fuarthas buaidh ar na deacrachta a bhaineas le córas nuadh, agus tá furmhór na scéimeanna go daingean ar a mbonnaí fá láthair.</P>
    <P>Ba í an obair ba mhó bhí le déanamh ag gach Coiste Gairm-oideachais, san am seo, scéim d'eagrughadh de Oideachas leanamhnach do bhéadh oireamhnach dá gceanntar féin.  Do réir a chéile, d'eirigh leo cláir áirithe oibre do leagan amach le h-aghaidh cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae.  O 20 uair go dtí 25 uaire gach seachtmhain a bhíos ins na cúrsaí sin, agus le h-obair láimhe a chaithtear trian, nó b'fhéidir, leath an ama.  Fá láthair is iad seo leanas na cúrsaí leanamhnacha is mó atá i bhfeidhm.  (a) Cúrsa leanamhnach geinearalta; (b) cúrsa leanamhnach ceard (foirgnidheacht); (c) cúrsa leanamhnach ceard (innealltóireacht); (d) cúrsa leanamhnach tráchtála; (e) cúrsa leanamhnach tíoghbhais; (f) cúrsa leanamhnach tuaithe.</P>
    <P>An chiall chumhang atá le Ceard-oideachas i nAcht a 1899, d'fhág sí nach raibh san oideachas sin ach saothar acadamhail; thiormeasc sí láimh-chleachtadh na gceard agus na dtionnscal do theagasc, agus ba é sin an deacracht ba mhó bhí le réidhteach, maidir le Ceard-Oideachas.  Cuireadh deireadh leis an deacracht sin, agus cuireadh deireadh, freisin, leis an seanchóras d'fhág an teagasc faoí cheangal cúrsaí áirithe do leanamhaint i n-ein-feacht. Fá láthair, tá sé ceadmhach ag ceard-scoltacha cúrsa fá leith teagaise do chur ar bun do aon adhbhar ar bith da mbaineann le ceardaidheacht nó le tionnscal.  Ba tráthamhail ar fad do fuarthas an tsaoirse sin&mdash;san am a rabhthas ag dul i mbun dúnghaois gheilleagraigh ar chuspóir dó tionnscalacht na tíre do mhéadughadh. Mar sin de, bhítheas ag iarraidh go foirleathan ranga ceard-oideachais do chur ar bun ina bhfuighthidhe an <Col N="134" /> teagasc a bhíos ag teastáil le h-aghaidh gach ceirde agus tionnscail fá leith.</P>
    <P>Bhí sin da iarraidh ag daoine a bhí ag obair san iomad tionnscail nuadh a bhí tar éis a gcurtha ar bun sa tSaorstát, agus ag daoine do bhí ag súil le n-a leithéid de obair; agus ó thárla an tsaoirse ud ag na Ceard-scoltacha, bhí siad i ndon freastal ar an riachtanas.  Ar fud na tíre cuireadh ranga de'n chinéal seo ar bun, ins na monarchain féin, nó ins na ceard-scoltacha. Is iomdha ceard agus tionnscail do bhain sochair mór as na ranga seo agus atá ag baint sochair asta fá láthair.  Ag seo cuid aca:&mdash; Monarchan Bróg, Monarchan Ailimíne, Monarchain Biatais Siúcra, Cearda Clodóireachta, Gruagaireacht, Muilneeóireacht Plúir, Monarchain Léine, Innealltóireacht leictreachais, Tionnscal Iascaireachta, Déantús Bréagán, Déantús Láimhín, Monarcha potaireachta agus Tionnscal Súdaireachta. I ngach cás, tháinig feabhas ar saothar na n-oibridhe do bhí i mbun na gceard cheana; agus ní n-é sin amháin, óir mar gheall ar an tréineáil do cuireadh ar fagháil roimh ré ag na Coisti Gairm-Oideachais, tá monarchain go leór ann agus giorruigheadh go mór an seal aimsire do bhí riachtanach ó bunuitheadh iad gur cuireadh a gcuid earraidhe chun margaibh.</P>
    <P>Bhí deacrachta móra ag baint leis an chóras nuadh seo Gairm-Oideachais. Sa chead dul amach, ní raibh múinteóiri go leor le fagháil, go h-áirithe múinteóirí le h-aghaidh teagaise i láimh-cleachtadh, i ndéantóireacht mhiotail, i ngeilleagar tíoghbhais agus i n-eólaidheacht tuaithe.  Cuireadh ar bun cúrsaí naoi mí le h-aghaidh daoine áirithe do toghadh chun a bheith ina múinteóirí, de bhrigh go raibh láimh-chleachtadh maith cheana aca ar obair adhmaid agus ar obair mhiotail.  Mar an gcéadna, toghadh daoine a raibh meadhon-oideachas oireamhnach aca, chun iad do thréineáil mar mhúinteóirí tíoghbhais agus eólaidheacht tuaithe maidir leis an dream deireannach seo, cinneadh gur riachtanach tréimhse dhá bhliadhain de tréineáil do thabhairt dóibh.  ar bun cúrsaí samhraidh do  muinteóir chun a thuilleadh  do tabhairt  <Col N="135" /> nó chun eólas do thabhairt dóibh ar mhodhanna nuadha teagaise.</P>
    <P>Faoi dheireadh sheisiúin a 1935-36, bhí breis agus seacht gcéad go leith múinteóir lán-aimsire ag teasgase ins na Scoltacha Gairm-Oideachais.  San áireach sin, tá breis agus 160, i mbun geilleagar tíoghbhais, breis agus 150, i mbun adhbhar tráchtála, breis agus 140 i mbun láimh-theagaise, breis agus 130, i mbun adhbhar geinearalta, agus breis agus 80, i mbun innealltóireachta. Tá breis agus 35 múinteóir ar fagháil anois le h-aghaidh eólaidheacht tuaithe, agus tá ullmhughadh dá dhéanamh sa chaoí a mbéidh a tuilleadh ar fagháil gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>O thárla an garm-oideachas ag leathadughadh mar bhí sé, bhí a thuilleadh scoltach ag teastáil, agus, le n-a linn sin, thaisbeán urraí áiteamhla na rátaí gur mhaith leo aca scéimeanna nuadh le h-aghaidh ceard-oideachais. San am atá i láthair, níl condae sa tSaorstát nach bhfuil scoil nuadh gairm-oideachais ann; tá cúig scoil, agus ó sin go dtí deich gcinn, i gcuid de na condaethe, agus furmhór a geostais curtha ar fagháil ag urrai áiteamhla na rátaí.  Dá sheomra nó tri sheomra atá i scoltacha na fíor-tuaithe, agus ó cheithre sheomra go dtí sé sheomra i scoltacha na mbailte móra.</P>
    <P>Ins na condae-bhuirgí, rinneadh athruighthe is mó agus is truime toradh ná mar rinneadh ins na ceanntair tuaithe.  Rinneadh méadughadh maith ar scoil Phort Láirge.  Cuireadh go mór leis an cheard-scoil do bhí i Luimneach cheana, agus, le n-a chois sin, tá pleananna dhá n-ullmhú chun teach scoile conganta le h-aghaidh cailín do thógáil sa cheann eile de'n chathair.  An scoil nuadh tráchtála agus eólaidheacht tíoghdhais atá beagnach déanta i gCorcaigh, cosnóchaidh sí fá tuairim £75,000 agus tá pleanna dhá n-ullmhú chun cur leis an gceard-scoil atá ann fé láthair agus chun teach scoile conganta le h-aghaidh cailín do thógáil sa taoibh thuaidh de'n chathair.  Maidir le Baile Atha Cliath, cuireadh le Scoil Shráid Bholton, le Scoil Dhroicead na Bothra, agus le Scoil Ráth Maonais: táthar tar éis scoil nuadh d'fhoscladh i Muiríne; agus tá glactha le tairgsint chun lán <Col N="136" /> scoil eólaidheacht tíoghdhais agus obair ban do thógáil, ar chostas breise agus £100,000.  Le n-a chois sin go léir, tá tuarascbháil idir-thráth atá an-tabhachtach déanta ag Coiste &ldquo;Bord&rdquo; Cúrsaí na gCeard-scoil i mBaile Átha Cliath. An Coiste Gairm-Oideachais d'iarr an tuarascbháil sin do dhéanamh, agus is é rud atá molta innte scéim chruinn dheimhin do chur i bhfeidhm chun gairm-oideachas do chur chun cinn sa chathair.  Mhol lucht na tuarascbhála go gcuirfidhe ar bun cúig lár-scoil speisialtactha:&mdash;(1) an coláiste ceardeólaidheachta, (2) an árd-scoil tráchtála, (3) an scoil ceard agus oibridheacht, (4) an scoil eólaidheacht tíoghbhais, (5) an scoil cheóil.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na scoltacha speisialtachta seo, tá trácht sa tuarascbháil ar &ldquo;nidh amháin a bhéas sár-riachtanach chun iomlán a dtairbhe do chur ar fagháil&rdquo; agus is é an nidh é &ldquo;go gcaithfidh siad bheith i lárchímpal na cathrach agus i bpríomh-shráideanna a bhfuil slighe chomhgarac idir iad agus gach mór-cheanntar árus comhnaidhthe dá bhfuil sa Bhuirg-Achar.&rdquo;  Tá sé molta, freisin, ag lucht na tuaraschbhála go soláthróchar dhá cheanntar-scoil&mdash; ceann aca do'n taoibh thiar-dheas mar aon le Croimghlinn agus Cill Maighneann, agus an ceann eile sa taoibh thiar-thuaidh le h-aghaidh na Cabraighe, Ghlas Naoidhean agus Dhroim Chonnrach.</P>
    <P>Ó thús an chéad seisiúin go dtí deireadh an cúigeadh seisiúin de fheidhmiú Acht Gairm-Oideachais a 1930, togadh sé cinn agus dá fhichid de scoltacha nua, rinneadh méadú maith ar scoil agus fiche dá raibh ann cheana, agus tá ocht gcinn agus dá fhichid de scoltacha nua dhá ndéanamh fá láthair. Na daoine atá ina n-urraí áitiúla rátaí &mdash;agus in a mbaill de na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais, san am chéadna&mdash;bhain siad úsáid mhaith mhór as an geumas do tugadh dóibh chun an ráta áitiúil d'árdú le cuspóirí an Acht Gairm-Oideachais do chur i gcrích.  Do h-árduigheadh an ráta i ngach uile cheanntar, agus, sa mhór-cuid de na ceanntair, tá sé chó h-árd agus mheastar a bheith oireamhnach.</P>
    <P>Toradh an-mhór de'n Acht nua is eadh an iarraidh bhuan atá ar chúrsaí -aimsire lae, agus tá an iarraidh <Col N="137" /> sin ag dul i méid.  Tá an feabhas sin le h-aithbeachtáil go h-an-soiléir ar na figiúracha: san am atá i láthair, tá 14,500 mac-léighinn ag freastal ranga lae i scoltacha gairm-oideachais, agus tá 12,500 aca sin ag freastal cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae; ach san am ar ritheadh an t-Acht, ní raibh ach 2,500.  Rud eile, i mblian a 1930-31, an seisiún deireannach de'n tsean-scéim, ní raibh ach suas le 47,000 de líon iomlán mac-léighinn ag freastal ranga na gceard-scoil aitheanta, nó ag fagháil teagaisc faoi scéimeanna condae.  Ach i seisiún a 1935-36, bhí 63,452 de líon iomlán ann, agus bhí 14,500 aca sin ag freastal ranga lae.</P>
    <P>I dtuarascbhála na bpríomh-oifigeach feidhmiucháin agus na n-árd-mhaighistir, tá sé ráidhte aca go mbíonn lucht gnótha agus lucht monarcha ag iarraidh mac-léighinn do fuair tréineáil ins na scoltacha seo agus go bhfuil an iarraidh sin ag fás.  I n-aon bhaile mór amháin, fuair 100 mac-léighinn obair, i seisiún a 1935-36.  Le n-a chois sin tá cunntas sa tuarascbháil ar chúrsaí speisialta d'iarr comhluchta gnotha do chur ar fáil dá gcuid oibhridhe.  Muinntir Guinness, Son agus Co. cuir i gcás, tá sé socair aca go gcaithfidh tréineáil ins na ranga ceard-oideachais lae i mBaile Atha Cliath do bheith faighte roimh ré ag na printisigh a bhéas i gceard-teach na beasaireachta aca.  Cearcallán do chuir Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais amach le goirid, tá sé ráidhte ann go gcaithfidh cúrsa dhá bhlian de thréineáil oireamhnach i ranga lae le h-aghaidh séisear, i gceard-scoil, do bheith faighte ag buachaillí ar bith a nglacfaidh an Bord leó mar phrintisigh i mbrainnse na leictreachóir.  Mar aon le sin, tá buan-obair dhá geallamhain do bhuachaillí a gheobhas an t-ard-theastas ar innealltóireacht leictreachais ag deireadh na cúigeadh bliana.  Maidir le tréineáil oibridhe monarcha, an áit ina mbíthear ag brath tionnscal nua do chur ar bun, is gnáthach a fhios sin do bheith ag muinntir na h-áite roimh ré, agus má bhíonn an díbhfeirge cheart i bPríomh-Oifigeach na Ceard-Scoile, is féidir leis, de gnátha, dul chun cainnte le lucht ceannais an tionnscail agus réidhtheach do dhéanamh sa chaoi a mbéidh tréineáil oireamhnach le fáil sa cheard-scoil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> Is breagh an rud a fheiceáil go bhfuil a lán ranga dhá geur ar bun ins na ceanntair tuaithe le h-aghaidh teagaise a bhaineas le Sníomh agus dathughadh Olna sa bhaile.  Bhí ranga mar iad sin ann i n-áiteacha i gCondae an Chláir, i gCondae na Gaillimhe, i gCondae Liathdroma, agus i gCondae Ros Comáin.  Bhí iarraidh mhaith ar an gcinéal seo teagaisc i gCondae an Chláir, agus ins an áit sin múineadh neithe a bhaineas le cárdáil na h-olna, agus le n-a sníomh, agus le n-a dathughadh.</P>
    <P>Áit ar bith ina gcuirfear scoil tuaithe ar bun, ní féidir an éifeacht cheart do bhaint aiste gan na neithe seo leanas:&mdash; (1) Teach scoile do bheadh oireamhnach maidir le fairsingeach áite, uirlise agus troscáin; (2) giota talmhan do bhéadh réasúnta mór, agus é do bheith i n-aice na scoile, sa chaoi i n-ar bhféidir eólas so fheicsionach do tabhairt do na scoláirí, ar a mbaineann le fás na mbarra, na dtortha agus na nglasraí; (3) múinteóir a mbéadh gach cáilidheacht aige da bhfuil riachtanach le h-aghaidh eólaidheacht tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Scoltacha agus giotaí talmhan mar sin, tá siad ar fagháil fá láthair nó béidh siad ar fagháil roimh deireadh an tseisiuin atá anois ann&mdash;i ngach aon chondae aca seo:&mdash;Ceatharlach, an Cabhán, an Clár, Corcaigh, Tír Chonaill, Gaillimh, Ciarraighe, Luimneach, Lughmhaigh, an Mhidhe, Muineachán, Ros Comáin agus Tiobrad Arann.  San am chéadna, beidh an cúrsa críocnuighthe ag an fhuirinn speisialta do Mhúinteóirí eólaidheacht tuaithe atá ar tréineáil fá láthair, agus beidh siad fá réir la h-aghaidh na scéimeanna teagasc do chur i bhfeidhm.  Rinneadh obair an-tabhachtach sa bheagán scol in a raibh eólaidheacht tuaithe dá teagasc i seisiuin a 1935-36.  I ngach aon áit aca sin, cuireadh gach cineál de bharra gráin, de thortha agus de ghlasraí, agus d'eirigh go sár-mhaith leis an obair sin go léir.  Ina theannta sin, tógadh tighthe gloine chum tomátaí do thógáil ionnta.  Mar an gcéadna, rinneadh coirceóga beach do solathar, agus, ar an gcaoi sin, bfhéidir do na múinteóirí eolas ar bheachaireacht do thabhairt uatha.</P>
    <P>Ins na condae-bhuirgí, leanadh do'n chleachtadh do bhí ann cheana maidir <Col N="139" /> leis na mic-léighinn do tabhairt ag breathnughadh na dtighthe gnótha agus na dtighthe tionnscail atá ina gceanntair féin.  Ait ar bith a dtéidhthear ghá breathnughadh mar sin, is gnáthach le duine éigin de chinn urraidh na h-áite labhairt leis na mic-léighinn agus míniughadh do thabhairt dóibh ar chóras oibre cibé gnó no tionnscail atá ann.  Ar an gcaoi sin cuirtear ar a súile go soiléir do na mic-léighinn cad é an baint atá idir a n-obair féin sa scoil gairm-Oideachais agus obair na dtionnscal agus na ngnótha a bhfuiltear ghá n-ullmhughadh le n-a aghaidh.  Ba léir, freisin, gur éirigh a thuilleadh suime ina gcuid oibre ag na mic-léighinn de thoradh na gcuairt seo; agus ní h-é sin amháin, ach gur éirigh a thuilleadh bróid aca as tráchtáil agus tionnscalacht a dtíre féin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le staid na Gaedhilge ins na scoltacha gairm-oideachais, is athas liom a rádh go bhfuil an uimhir múinteoir atá lán-cháilighthe le Gaedhilg a theagasc ins na scoltacha gairm-oideachais ag dul i líonmhaire ó ló go ló.  Tá na cigirí go léir ar aon aigne go bhfuil staid na Gaedhilge mar ádhbhar léighinn an-tsásamhail ins na scoltacha gairm-oideachais.  Tá scéimeanna maithe oibre dhá n-ullmhú.  Ina dhiaidh sin is uile, is lag é staid na Gaedhilge i gcuid de na scéimeanna fós féin.  Ar thaobh amháin sé neamhshuim chuid de na príomh-Oifigigh Feidhme is cionn-tsiocair leis, agus, ar an taobh eile, sé faillighe na múinteoir seo a bhfuil a ceárd-teastas aca cuidiú leis an múinteoir triollúsach Gaedhilge, atá ag cur cúl leis an obair.</P>
    <P>Ceist achrannach is eadh fós féin múineadh na Gaedhilge do dhaoine fásta i ranganna trathnóna faoi scéim an ghairm-oideachais.  Tá sé ag dul i léire in aghaidh an lae nach é amháin nach mór don mhúinteoir a bheith cáilighthe leis an nGaedhilg a theagasc, ach nach fuláir dó ina theanta sin, é bheith ar a chumas drámaigheacht agus amhránaidheacht a chur ar siubhal más mian leis rang Gaedhilge a fhághail agus é choinneál.  I gCondaethe Chorcaighe, Roscomáin, Loch Garman agus sa Trian Thuaidh de Chondae Thiobrad Árann, déantar <Col N="140" /> freastal maith ar ranganna Gaedhilge i ngeall ar an nídh sin.  De bhárr feabhais an eagair a bhí ar ranganna den tsaghas seo fá Choisde Gairm-Oideachais Chondae Chorcaighe i rith an tseisiúin míle naoi gcéad cúig triochad-sé triochad cuireadh os cionn aon chéad déag duine fá'n scrúdú a cheap an Coiste, i ndeire an tseisiúin sin.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag cur leis na cúrsaí lae agus trathnóna thrid an nGaedhilg amháin ins na ceanntair Ghaedhealacha.  I rith an tseisiúin atá i gceist againn, cuireadh cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae agus trathnóna den tsaghas seo ar fáil i gceanntracha mar an Cheathramha Ruadh, Rosmuck, Gaillimh, An Áird Mhór agus Carraig an Chobaltaigh. Tugadh deontas speisialta do Choiste Gairm-Oideachais Chondae Chorcaighe le cuidiú leo le scoil gairm-oideachais a thógáil agus a ghléasadh i mBéal Atha an Ghaorthaidh ina ndéanfar an teagasc go h-iomlán tríd an nGaedhilg. Ins na h-ádhbhair i gcoitchinne gan trácht ar an nGaedhilg, is áthas liom a rádh go ndearnadh dul 'un cinn an-tsásamhail do réir tuairiscí na gCigire.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Coimisiún a bunuigheadh sa mbliain míle, naoi gcéad ceathair triochad le fiosrúchán a dhéanamh ar Chórus na Scol Ceartúcháin agus na Scol Saothair críoch ar a saothair i Mí Lughnasa seo caithte.  Rinne an Coimisiún a fhiosrúchán go cruinn beacht agus chuir tuairisc ar fáil gur chóir go mba mhór an cuidiú é ag pléidhe leis na ceisteanna tábhachtacha Sóisialacha ar a ndearnadar scrúdú.  Tá na moltaí a rinne an Choimisiún dhá meas ag an Roinn i láthair na h-uaire. Is mian liom, amhthach, leas a bhaint as an ócáid seo le mo bhuidheachas ó chroidhe a chur in iúl do bhaill an Choimisiúin as uacht a ndearnadar ar mhaithe leis an bpobal agus as ucht ar chaith siad dá gcuid ama agus ar chuir siad de thrioblóid ortha féin leis an bhfiosrúchán.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cur síos ar cúpla poinnt eile acht is dó liom go ndearn me tagairt do na nidhthe is tabhachtaighe a bhaineas le hoideachas.  Má tá a thuille eolais a dhith air Teachtaí, is féidir leo ceisteanna do chur orm.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we are now discussing together <Col N="141" /> all the Estimates dealing with education and the Minister's Department, that is from Votes 45 to 51 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, say a general discussion.  At first I want to thank the Minister for his courtesy in letting me have a translation of his Irish speech.  I congratulate him for the fluent character of the translation. It is so beautifully fluent that I rarely have seen so successful a translation from one language into another.  The translation is almost as if it were in the national language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a great change in the policy so far as the Department of Education is concerned, but there are a number of matters, as the Minister knows, attracting the attention of the country at the present moment.  If we take the main Vote, or the Vote for Primary Education, with which the Minister has dealt, there are, under that heading, two matters that are attracting a considerable amount of attention amongst those affected, and also amongst the people in the country generally.  With one of these the Minister has dealt.  I do not say that he has dealt quite fully with it. The other was not dealt with at all by him.  Both are questions that are undoubtedly causing a great deal of dissatisfaction and unrest amongst those on whom, in the last analysis, the success of primary education depends, namely the teachers.  I refer to the question of salaries on the one hand and to the question of averages on the other.  I know that so far as the two Governments are concerned, the salaries have been cut by both. When the Act of 1933 was passing through this House, I pointed out that I considered there was an essential difference between the attitude of this and the previous Government in this matter.  The previous Government made it quite clear that it was anxious to cut down expenditure on all items as far as possible, and that it stood against any increases in taxation. To a deputation of teachers which the Ministry then received that was made perfectly clear.  The question of the justice of the cut or the proposed cut was not argued.  That cut was never carried out by the then <Col N="142" /> Government owing to a little error on the part of the country.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out that it was not a question of justice or a question of pensions but a question of fact.  It was pointed out that the country could not afford a higher scheme of education and that unless in view of certain circumstances a cut was made, higher taxation would be necessary.  In that connection it was put up to a deputation of teachers that a certain cut would be proposed in their salaries but in partial return for that, an effort would be made to solve the pensions question and to deal with the pensions fund.  At the time I made it quite clear to the teachers that I was not arguing at all against the case they put forward, that on the repeated showing of various Ministers&mdash;of Ministers while the English were in control of this country&mdash;various statements had been made as to the segregation of the fund that took place afterwards, and that no argument could be put up against the teachers' case that their side of the pensions fund was quite solvent and that it was only the Government's side of the pensions fund that was not solvent.  I told the deputation that as far as the Government was concerned they need not argue that, because from my reading of the documents I told them that their case could not be combated.  They had an absolutely perfect case so far as that was concerned.  Every statement made by the British Ministers and statements made by our own Ministers did bear out the teachers' case as to the division of the pension fund into two parts, in one of which the teachers' contribution was responsible and in the other of which the Government's contribution was responsible.  Therefore, I took the line that it was not a question of asking them to accept this cut in return for settling the pension fund on the ground that the Government was not bound to settle the pension fund, but merely on the ground that the Government at the time could not afford to increase taxation. Since then, I think even the Minister will admit that there has been an increase in taxation, and in these circumstances it is quite natural that <Col N="143" /> whatever may have been the attitude of the Government on the teachers' salaries in 1931 or early in 1932, the fact that there has been such considerable increase in taxation and that yet the cut that was imposed on them in 1933 stands, is to me a legitimate source of grievance on the part of the teachers.</P>
    <P>The other matter with which the Minister dealt and on which he did not offer a full solution was the question of averages.  I am convinced that the rule which demands the dismissal of a trained teacher and when the average falls below a certain figure for a certain length of time the substitution for a trained teacher of a J.A.M. was framed and was operated in entirely different circumstances to those in which it is being operated now.  At that time it was only very occasionally that a teacher lost his position owing to falling averages.  At the present time large numbers of them are losing their positions through the averages rule.  At that time a teacher could reasonably look forward to getting, in a very short time, employment in another school.  Now many of them have no hope within a reasonable time of getting such employment.  There have been teachers who have been trained and passed successfully through the training colleges and they have been, so to speak, on the hazard for a considerable time and have given up all hope of employment as school teachers.  Many of them have to seek employment in other Government Departments.  They have to present themselves for examination in other Government Departments.  I suggest that that in itself shows that the situation as regards this averages rule is decidedly different from the normal state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The method by which the Minister proposes to deal with this may, in a number of years, have the effect that he contemplates.  He admits himself, in the phrases he uses, that it is only a partial method of dealing with it, namely, limiting the number of those who will be considered qualified, cutting down the number of teachers who come out of the <Col N="144" /> training colleges, and so on.  These are expedients that may help, no doubt, but I am sure the Minister must be convinced that they do not go to the root of the matter.  The Minister and the Department knew perfectly well, even before this crisis came upon them, the effect the approaching decline of averages has had on the efficiency and the whole outlook of the teacher.  Sometimes teachers are inclined to adopt doubtful expedients&mdash;one or two cases have occurred&mdash;to see that the average is kept up.  Undoubtedly, it is a kind of terror before the unfortunate teacher and it must affect the efficiency of his teaching.  It is regrettable that it should happen in any case, but that it should happen in a large number of cases, that there should be teachers considerable in number through the country who are actually not sure how long they will be able to hold their position, is really very deplorable.  It ought to be evident to the Minister and to the Government.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and the Department would like to remedy that as quickly as possible, if there was no other obstacle than the one that is in the way.  That obstacle is not an educational one; it is purely a financial one.  I claim that a Government that has found money in increased millions every year, that has had no difficulty in finding money, that boasts it has no difficulty in finding money, in a matter vitally affecting education ought to have no hesitation in overcoming the financial obstacle that is in the way of a settlement of this particular matter. In this instance there is not what used to be the quite legitimate excuse in the case of the Government's predecessors&mdash;&ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  The Government's predecessors tried to keep down taxation. The present Government does not. I am not going into the question of the wisdom or otherwise of that policy. I only contend that the argument, &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; cannot apply to the present Government. They have found money for an expenditure of much more doubtful <Col N="145" /> national value than expenditure of the kind I now suggest.</P>
    <P>That it should happen in a large number of cases that an inferior class of teacher is put in a rural district is, on the whole, unfair.  Children in a certain district have been accustomed to be taught by two trained teachers.  Suddenly, because of the declining population in that district, on account of the fall in the average number attending the school, the school is de-graded in the sense that it has lost the help of one trained teacher, whose place is taken by an untrained teacher.  From the educational point of view, there is nothing to be said for the keeping of that particular rule of averages at the present time.  The one excuse that can be urged in its favour is the question of money, but I hold that that excuse cannot be advanced by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the continued good attendance.  I think that is a matter that we can congratulate ourselves upon.  Despite a certain amount of scepticism on the part of some people, dissatisfaction sometimes expressed on the part of others, the Compulsory Attendance Act has operated well.  It is quite true you will find other countries with a higher percentage of attendance than you will find in this country; but I was never impressed with these statistics, some of them were quite impossible. When I find an attendance of 99.5 per cent. in certain schools, there are certain conclusions to be come to. The more reasonable one to accept is that they are basing their calculations of attendance on a different system from ours.  When you take all the circumstances that militate against attendance at school, in the way of sickness, bad weather, and so on, the figures given by the Minister in that respect are highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As we are on the subject of attendance, there is one matter I would like information upon.  I am anxious to know in connection with this matter whether the Department of Education has been appealed to or whether it has felt itself called upon to intervene. There has been a dispute in the West <Col N="146" /> of Ireland in connection with school attendance.  The parents of children apparently broke the law by not allowing their children to attend.  It all surrounded the question as to what were the duties of the teachers.  Was the Department of Education asked to determine for anybody what it regarded as the normal duties of the teachers?  If so, what was its reply? Here is a dispute between the parents and the teachers are.  Did the Department give its view as to the limitation or the extent of the duties of the teachers?  I am not now asking the Minister whether or not the Department interfered in connection with the question of the attendance of the children at school; that is not a matter for this Department; I quite admit it is a matter primarily for the Department of Justice and, therefore, it does not now arise.  I am putting a simpler question to the Minister, as to whether his Department was asked to indicate what the teachers' duties were and, if so, what was the Department's attitude.  Did they reply to any such request?  I hope they did not take up the attitude of more or less washing their hands out of the whole dispute.</P>
    <P>In connection with attendances, I should like to bring up a matter that is of long standing.  It applies more to the large cities than to the country districts.  When the Minister was dealing with the secondary schools, he referred, more or less with a note of complaint&mdash;I think he will admit that was so&mdash;to large classes that were to be found in some places.  I gather he did not approve of the classes being extra large.  He rather indicated that they recognised that from the educational point of view it was a disadvantage. Does not that apply equally to the primary side?  If it is something deleterious to education that those who are running secondary schools should have classes too large, surely it applies with equal force&mdash;I do not say the numbers ought to be the same, but it could apply with equal force&mdash;to those primary schools in, say, the City of Dublin, where undoubtedly the lasses are too large&mdash;too large, I mean, to <Col N="147" /> be taught as one class?  Where you have big schools you could have plenty of differentiation of functions between the teachers.  In the city that is, to a large extent, counteracted by the size of the classes.  If that happens, it happens not on account of any fault on the part of the manager or the principal of the schools, but on account of the operation of the rules of the Department.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I would ask the Minister to consider the reforming of these rules so far as large classes are concerned.  No doubt he will tell me it costs money, but I refuse to receive from a Minister of the present Government that particular excuse.  If he will look at his Estimate he will find that the Education Estimate is a lesser percentage of the total supply services of the State than it was, say, ten years ago.  He probably has noticed from time to time that various countries in Europe, generally speaking, when they want to speak well of themselves, pride themselves on the amount of money they spend on education&mdash;the percentage of the total Budget that goes to education.  I think it should have been the aim of the Government of this country to keep up at least the percentage.  Once more, therefore, if the Minister replies, in reference to these large classes, that it would require more money, I say that that excuse would come badly from a member of the present Government which finds money, as I said, for practically anything it wants to, and which certainly is spending a large amount of money on much more questionable things than on trying to remedy these particular drawbacks in our educational system.</P>
    <P>As I am on the subject of increased cost, I think I may say that the Minister has power under the Compulsory Attendance Act to extend the age limit.  Now, I am not asking that the Minister should compel all children of a certain age&mdash;I mean, under the age of sixteen&mdash;to attend primary schools, but he could use that power under the Education Act&mdash;I think I am quite right in saying so&mdash;to compel children to attend either a primary school or <Col N="148" /> some other school such as the continuation school of which he spoke in the last portion of his speech.  I think he could at least make a start.  I do not say that it need be universal, because I think the Act itself allows him discretion with regard to different portions of the country, if he likes, and, therefore, he could make a start in that matter in, say, the City of Dublin or the City of Cork.  There may be difficulties, but the difficulties can be overcome.  I am not now referring to the financial difficulty because, as far as this Government is concerned in educational matters, as I said, I cannot consider that plea a sound one. Other difficulties of a purely technical nature, if they are there, can be overcome. It is a matter that certainly should commend itself to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn, from the Minister's survey of the educational progress during the year, of the success of the Vocational Act of 1930, and of the eagerness with which it is being adopted and worked, not merely by his Department&mdash;I know well how keen they always were on it&mdash;but also how keenly it was being adopted and worked by the various local authorities. At the time the Act was being introduced, there was a certain amount of scepticism on that particular point, and those in this House who suggested that the local authorities would not contribute even the minimum sum they were compelled by law to contribute will be glad, I am sure, to see that not merely have they proved willing to do that, but that they were willing to go beyond it and to recognise the advantages that accrue to the community, from the point of view of employment as well as from other points of view, from that particular kind of education. That also leads on to the point that efforts were being made, and not without success, to bring that type of continuation education into close contact with the industrial life of the country, whether in the towns or in the country, and that is also a matter, I am sure, that most of us will be glad to see.</P>
    <P>In that connection, again, however, there is a matter about which I should like to have some assurance from the Minister.  It is a thing in which, from <Col N="149" /> every point of view, I was always interested, and I would ask the Minister now to deal with the matter a little more fully.  Apart from the subject of emigration, which I will mention in a moment, I was always convinced that one of the most important advantages that could come to the country from a vocational education scheme was the improvement of the teaching of domestic economy&mdash;of cooking and so on.  I am well aware of the difficulty of making a success of that.  I am quite well aware that the difficulty does not always by any means come from the Department or from the local authorities or from those who are ready to provide the facilities.  Generally speaking, the difficulty comes from the people themselves.  There is a slowness to take advantage of the facilities that are offered, especially the facilities for learning what I might call the ordinary management of an ordinary house.  I am not now referring to fancy cooking, because I regard that more or less as a kind of an ornament, if it is even that.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is often taught, and possibly with a certain amount of profit, in the technical schools; but what I mean is the plain, ordinary cooking for the ordinary man.  I think it is a matter in which this country is exceptionally backward.  It has been always backward in comparison with what is done in any of the Continental countries.  I cannot speak about England because I do not know whether they are much better there &mdash;I doubt if they are&mdash;but certainly the Continental countries are much further advanced in that particular aspect of being able to make the most out of the materials they have.  It would be a great national saving to this country and a great improvement from every point of view if something could be done in that respect.  I know that the Minister is willing to provide the facilities, but I know that the real difficulty is, very often, to get the people to accept the facilities, and it may require some kind of propaganda to enable such a scheme to be carried out.</P>
    <P>That particular matter, to which I have been referring, applies particularly <Col N="150" /> to the problem now presented to the country in connection with the emigration, especially of a large number of girls, to England.  That they do emigrate will hardly be denied. We need not, for a moment, discuss exactly whether more are emigrating now than at any other time, but that they are emigrating at the present moment to England is what I might call common knowledge to everybody. As I say, whether more are emigrating now than in 1926 is a matter that we need not discuss now.  I have my own very definite views on that, but I am not discussing it now.  The fact remains that a large number of people are emigrating to England, and, if that is so, if we must have emigration of that kind&mdash;and I see nothing in the speeches of the Ministers and the policy of the Government to suggest that we can avoid it&mdash;then, surely, it is better that these young girls who go to England should be trained.  It is better for themselves, better for this country, and better for their spiritual future as well as for their material future.  If that could be tackled, it is one of the most useful works that could be undertaken. It will require, as I said, not merely the provision of facilities, but something in the nature of propaganda on the part of the Ministry to get people to undertake or to attend to that particular type of instruction.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned school buildings in his report, and mentioned the amount of money that was being spent on these particular buildings. What he did not make clear, however, was whether there was really anything more being done than merely keeping pace with the wastage.  There may be just a little bit more being done, but how much more?  I remember, some years ago, there was a census taken of the unsuitable schools in this country, and year by year other schools are falling more into decay and more and more are falling from the class of being just tolerable into the class of being unsuitable.  I often wonder whether the amount of new building for which the country pays year after year does do much more than keep pace with the yearly loss and the yearly decay and, <Col N="151" /> as I have said, the falling of schools from one class into another class. Again, may I call attention to a matter to which I referred on a previous occasion, namely, the cost of these schools?  I do not know whether it is so at present or not, but I think the Minister will find, that on the average, the school put up by a vocational education committee is much cheaper than the primary school.  Could the Minister tell me right off, whether that is the fact at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that that was so, namely, that you could get a good technical school for £2,000, but if you wanted a school of the same size to accommodate the same number of pupils on the primary side, you had to pay £3,000 or £3,500.  I think it is a pity that that problem should not be tackled.  The Board of Works, I think, used to take up the attitude that the type of school that was built by the vocational education committees had not the lasting qualities that the school which they sanctioned had.  They held that the school they sanctioned should last longer.  If the Minister will look over his speech, he will find that one of the troubles with which he has to contend at the moment is that some of the old schools have lasted too long.  They are not merely schools that have fallen into decay. Some of the difficult cases in connection with schools that are unsuitable to which the Minister has referred, are schools that are perfectly sound structurally, but they do not fulfil modern requirements.  It is very optimistic on the part of the Board of Works to think that they can plan a school that will be suitable in every way, not 40 years hence, but 100 years hence.  I think they need not be afraid that the school will last only 40 years.  Considering the way in which requirements &mdash;I might almost say fashions&mdash;are constantly changing, there is a certain advantage in having the cheaper type of school and a certain advantage in not having it lasting too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a great deal more could be done in that respect in the way of <Col N="152" /> school building, if that problem were energetically taken up with the Board of Works, because I think, from the plans that were submitted for technical schools, that these buildings seemed to be quite suitable in the ordinary way for primary schools as well.  The Minister in that connection referred to the changes that had to be made in the lay-out of schools, and he said that it was particularly difficult to teach different classes in one room, where say you had three classes and three teachers.  Undoubtedly it is.  He said that that was still more difficult owing to the introduction of Irish.  I take his word for that.</P>
    <P>I do not know why that should be so but probably it is the case.  If that is so, will he not recognise that in that particular case the alteration of the building is at least partly, if not mainly, due, not to anything that was originally wrong in the construction of the school, but that it follows directly from the programme of the Department itself?  Consequently, in that case&mdash;it is the only case I am arguing at the moment&mdash;the Minister should not require a one-third contribution for the reconditioning and remodelling of that particular type of school.  It is in a class apart because, as I say, the remodelling is, to a large extent, due to the requirements of the Department itself.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer&mdash;teaching through Irish in secondary schools.  I gathered from the Minister that there was an increase in the number of schools that were adopting that particular method and that the Minister had made it quite clear that it was only in certain conditions that that policy should be adopted in any school, namely, when the teacher was quite competent to give the instruction and when the pupils were, on the whole, fairly competent to follow it.  I think I have interpreted the Minister correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said, however, that complaints were coming in still that teachers were inclined to chance their arm, apparently, to undertake such instruction without these <Col N="153" /> necessary conditions being present and that inspectors, apparently, were still accused of pressing that particular scheme where the conditions did not justify it, so much so that once more the Minister had occasion to call attention to the fact that there was no authority for doing so.  Does it not dawn on the Minister, if it is necessary to issue these warnings year after year, that these warnings are having very little effect?  I remember when I was in the Minister's position I tried to make the policy quite clear on that matter.  I had not an opportunity of doing it very often, owing to a lapse on the part of the nation, but still I did it once and possibly twice.  If it is necessary to repeat the warning year after year, and once again in the year 1937, it does suggest that the earlier warnings were not heeded.  I have seen excellent laws passed to deal with abuses in various ways in other cases and under other bodies, but I always got suspicious when I saw that the same laws had to be enacted to get rid of certain abuses year after year. It does suggest that the previous ones have not had the effect that was intended.  It seems to me that the previous statements of policy on the part of the Minister have not been attended to if it is necessary to reiterate them once more.  I think the matter is important because grave damage can be done as the Minister himself recognises because, as he said, it was necessary to issue warnings in that particular case to show that there was no change in policy.  Grave damage might be done, by disregard of these warnings, to the pupils, the schools and the language itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with a number of other matters in the report, the Minister points out quite candidly the many drawbacks that are still there.  It would be absolutely unfair to be captiously critical in that respect.  You will always have drawbacks; there is not the slightest doubt about that.  You will never have a perfect system of education. What I should like the Minister to do would be to indicate the number of faults he found in various ways&mdash;old school buildings, the teaching of various subjects, etc.&mdash;not give us a <Col N="154" /> mere resume of these faults which are inevitable, but rather the steps that he and the Department are taking to cope with these faults and to overcome them. I do not say that he will be fully successful in that respect, and I do not make any such demand, but at least he should indicate to the House the various faults he had found in connection with teachers, with managers possibly, and incidentally or by implication, occasionally with inspectors, and what steps are being taken to remedy these faults.  I do not think we could expect anything else, but we should like to know what steps are being taken to deal with these and other faults.  These are the rather disjointed remarks I have to make on the Estimates before us.  I have confined myself largely to matters of major detail.  I have not discussed the question of general policy, but the Minister might give his attention to the matters of which I have spoken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In succeeding years on this Estimate, I have directed the attention of the Minister to what appeared to be the failure of his Department adequately to cater for the revival of the Irish language in this country.  I have pointed out on several occasions that the system of asking teachers to instruct infant children who know no Irish, and who never hear a word of Irish in their own homes, through the medium of Irish is a public scandal.  It is not calculated to serve the best interests of the Irish language.  Far from it; it is calculated not only seriously to interfere with the health of the children, but to create in the children's mind a prejudice against the language, and to give grounds for a very widespread feeling against the language throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I have plenty of knowledge of what I am talking about.  If the Deputy had patience, and would listen to a prudent argument, he would be able to get up afterwards and calmly give his view, instead of run ning away like a cross child.  I am going to read for the Deputy's colleagues <Col N="155" /> the report of the Minister's own inspector on this subject.  The Minister himself has read it to the House, but the learned Deputy, who has just skipped away, apparently did not listen to it, or else he would see that the case I have made repeatedly on these Estimates is amply vindicated by the report of the Minister's own inspector.  The Minister's inspector, speaking of the system of teaching infant children in Dublin through the medium of Irish, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The majority of the inspectors are dissatisfied with the progress made in the speaking of Irish by the infants, and a great number of the teachers in the city schools are complaining of the little knowledge of Irish which the infants have when they leave the infant schools.  I must say that the speaking of Irish is weak enough in those districts.  The children are usually unable to speak the language when they cease to attend school.  They have not the vocabulary to do so, and they have neither fluency nor accuracy nor power of conversation. The majority of them fail to give an accurate, intelligent account of simple, fundamental things.  They mix the tenses of the verbs in such a way as would make one despair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the Minister's own inspector's report on the result of the system that I have attacked in this House time and time again, not because I am opposed to Irish, but because I want to see Irish the vernacular in the mouth of every person in this country.  I have always hoped to see the people of this country speaking Irish and English, as the Swiss people speak French and German or French and Italian.  I have always hoped that in this country we might develop the bilingual life of the people, because I believe it would enrich the life of our people and educate our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have urged upon the Minister time and time again was that the methods at present being used in the schools were not bringing us towards that goal; that they were making the achievement of that objective <Col N="156" /> far more difficult, and that if he went on long enough with this kind of codology, the end of it would be that he would make it impossible to revive the language at all.  A lot of Deputies over there think that all this impracticable and foolish fraud that is being carried on in the national schools is materially contributing to the revival of Irish in the country.  The fact of it is that the £2 which was given by the Department of Education to the parents of children who use Irish as their daily vernacular in the Gaeltacht has done far more to preserve the language than all the money which is being wasted in the national schools, because, as I have pointed out in this House time and time again, what you want to do is to make it manifest to the people who have preserved the language and to the people who are learning it that it is worth something to them.  If you will do that, you will get the language revived much more effectively than by trying to force Irish down the throats of our people.  It is perfectly impossible to force anything down the throats of our people.  Unless you can persuade the people to be with you and to co-operate with you in a matter of this kind, the backing is lost before the fight is begun.  I have never asked the Minister or the House to accept my view.</P>
    <P>Mind you, this report of the Minister's own inspector is an extraordinary vindication of the view I have repeatedly expressed in this House, but I never asked the House to accept that view.  The limit of my request consistently has been that the Minister would set up a commission of persons interested in education in this country to inquire into the success of the present policy of teaching Irish in the schools.  I do ask for a commission which will consist of persons other than officials of his own Department.  I know that any commission of prudent persons inquiring into such a question would send for the officials of his Department, and would ask them for all the assistance they could give by way of information and advice; but what we want in regard to this matter is <Col N="157" /> a detached view.  I am informed that the standard of Irish that is coming from the schools is deplorable.  I know from my own experience that the standard of general education that is coming from the schools is dreadful &mdash;perfectly dreadful.</P>
    <P>I see here a boast made in the Minister's statement that mathematics has ceased to be a compulsory subject in girls' schools.  The very idea of eliminating one of the three R's from primary education seems to me to be so insane as to baffle description.  Just imagine leaving it optional&mdash;I did not know that was true until I read it in this statement&mdash;for little girls at school as to whether or not they will learn to add.  That seems to be absolutely insane.  I want to see the children who go to school in this country being turned out at the end of their period in school able to read and write and do simple arithmetic efficiently.  I expect the children to be able to read almost anything.  I expect the children to be able to write anything that, in the ordinary course of their daily work, they would find it necessary to write.  I expect them to do whatever sums any of us requires to do in our daily lives.  I say that to suggest that children should be permitted to leave the primary schools without that essential equipment is an outrage.  I want to remind the Minister of something he said when discussing a private Deputy's motion which was moved here in this House. He used language which suggested to me that he interpreted his function as Minister for Education as being to get the people to talk Irish but not to educate the people.  I think that is absolute insanity.  There are those of us who love the language and who want to see it advance and prosper. Mind you, there are many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who do not give two thráneens for the language, and who think it is a &ldquo;cod&rdquo; to revive the language, only they have not the courage to get up and say so. But I am one of those&mdash;and there are many others in all parts of the House &mdash;who want to see the language revived, and who want to see people speaking it as fluently as they speak English, but if you want to do that <Col N="158" /> you cannot set up an antagonism between teaching Irish and educating the children.  You must make it possible to teach Irish and provide education at the same time.</P>
    <P>It is an intolerable proposition that this whole generation of our people should be denied education in order that they should be used for the purpose of handing on Irish to the generations to come.  The thing is grotesque. You have no right to ask any body of people for such a sacrifice, and it is wholly unnecessary.  You have no right to go to the parents of this day and generation and say to them: &ldquo;All your children are going to be left uneducated in order that they may be made propagandists for the Irish language for the generations yet unborn.&rdquo; The thing is intolerable; it is unjust; it is wrong and quite impracticable, and if it is persisted in it will result in a general revolution against Irish. So that Irish, instead of being something which the vast majority of the people cherish and desire to see prosperous, will appear in their eyes to be a hideous scourge against which they are bound to rise up.  Now there is no inconsistency between giving the children of this country a liberal education and teaching them Irish at the same time.  I ask any unprejudiced Deputy has he not heard parents complain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would probably find himself in complete agreement with me.  I put it to any unprejudiced Deputy, has he not heard parents complain that there is so much Irish being taught in the schools that the children are learning nothing else?  That complaint is popularly made.  The point that I am trying to make is this: that there is no necessity for giving any ground for any such complaints. <Col N="159" /> It is perfectly possible to teach children Irish, to equip them to be good Irish speakers, and to give them a liberal education at the same time, if you will only go the right way about it.  Now that is what I want to do.</P>

      <P>It is marvellous how far the Deputy would be able to agree with me if he would only have the patience to listen to me.  I think, in order to make that effective, we have got to carry conviction to the minds of the parents of the children that that is what we are doing.  No matter how well we do it, if we leave parents under the impression that their children's general education is suffering&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is going to block and obstruct the work that we want done.  The Deputy and I are both agreed that there is a way of giving the children a liberal education and Irish at the same time.  I entirely agree with him on that, if we go the right way about it.  The Deputy is something of an expert on education. I cannot profess to be an expert on education.  I was at school, and I know it from the point of view of the pupil, but I am quite prepared to surrender my judgment on the methods of education to a body of experts who will command confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got confidence in the Department of Education as at present constituted.  I think they are approaching this whole problem in the wrong way.  I think they have allowed themselves to get into certain grooves and they are afraid to get out of them for fear certain people like the Deputy will lose their tempers with them and begin to denounce them as bad Gaels.  Most of these officials have not got the patience with the Deputy that I have.  They do not argue with them and gradually lead him back when he runs out of the House, and explain the situation to him.  When the Deputy stamps his foot he frightens them so that they <Col N="160" /> think it safer to stay in the old rut than try any revolutionary reform, because Deputy Kissane or Deputy O Briain may start to stump the country and denounce them as West Britons.</P>
    <P>As a way out of that dilemma I suggest that we ought to have a body of independent educationists who will command the confidence of the Deputy and who will command my confidence before whom every person who has a grievance will be invited to come. Before that body of independent persons I would ask any teacher who had a grievance in the matter, any parents who had grievances in the matter, any public man or woman who had a grievance in the matter, or anybody who had a constructive suggestion to make to come and make himself heard. Now if they do not come they cannot complain.  If the Minister is prepared to provide a tribunal before which everybody can get a hearing, and if people will not bother to come there and make their voices heard, then they will have no grounds for complaint if the programme evolved by the Department does not fall in with what they believe to be correct.  But I venture to say that a great many people will come forward to that tribunal to explain the personal difficulties of which they have knowledge, so that out of that we will find a method of advancing the cause of spoken Irish which will command the support of everybody who believes in the Irish revival.  Then we can divide the community into two clear divisions&mdash;first those who believe that Irish is a &ldquo;cod,&rdquo; and I venture to say that we will find a good many recruits for that brigade on the benches of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that such a body is already in existence, and that it is on its report the present programme of the Department of Education is being worked?  That body was first set up in 1921.  It was presided over by the Rev. T. Corcoran, S.J., Professor of Education in the National University. It was reassembled in 1926 under the auspices of the last Government, and it is on the report presented by that <Col N="161" /> body in 1921 and 1926 that the programme of the Department of Education is at present being worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I tell the Deputy a little story that may help him to understand some of the difficulties?  I am sure that Deputy Tom Kelly will agree with me in this little narrative. About 1870 there was a commission set up in this country to solve the slum problem.  They sat and made a report. In 1880 there was another commission set up and they made a report.  In 1890, in 1900, in 1910, and in 1914 other commissions sat and reported, but none of them provided a method which solved the problem.  There were two things to do when successive commissions failed to solve the slum problem: either to say that the problem was insoluble and drop it, or to continue&mdash; to go on like the Scottish King and keep trying to find some method that would achieve the purpose that you had in view, the abolition of the slums. That is the procedure that has, in fact, been adopted, because the community knew that they could not leave the slums there.  The Deputy has said that we had commissions in 1921 and 1926.</P>
      <P>I now allege that the methods that they advocated and approved have completely broken down, and I call in evidence the report on the results made by inspectors in the Minister's own Department.  The Deputy was not present when I read extracts from the inspector's report, a few minutes ago, but with the permission of the Chair I will read the extract again for his information.</P>
      <P>(<i>Extract again read.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rest my case on that and nothing else. I ask for an inquiry.  I am prepared to say that if there is a reasonable inquiry given, before which all people who have grievances are invited to attend and speak their minds freely, with the assurance that all the Minister wants is information as to the nature of the complaints that have been made, then let that information be collected and let the best brains of the country devise a plan to meet the difficulties which have been proved to exist.  If we do that we can make great progress in this matter.  If we do not do that then <Col N="162" /> we are going to have the situation existing that even the Minister's own inspectors feel constrained to speak about: to say that the policy has failed and that the system has completely broken down.</P>
    <P>Surely, for anyone who wants the language to succeed, in the face of that report, he must see how vital it is to prepare for some kind of change that will end a system of education which leaves the children quite unable to speak Irish after they leave school. That is all I want.  It is blinding your eyes to facts if you deny that the children coming out of the primary schools now have not got as much ordinary education as they used to have.  I was recently told that in a public examination set up here for boys coming out of the primary schools, if the standard which used to obtain ten years ago was enforced, no child would have qualified and that, even after lowering the standard substantially, only one candidate, I think, attained the required standard.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I think it is good that those of us who want the language to succeed should accept responsibility for criticising the system which is failing to make it succeed because anyone who does not want the language to succeed is immediately suspect if he says anything by way of criticism of the present system of education.  There is going on in this country a thing which I must describe as a ramp, and that is this business of pretending that the secondary schools that do all their instruction through the medium of Irish are giving a better education to the pupils than the schools which give education through the medium of English.  In proof of that contention marks are produced.  It is shown that pupils from the grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools, or what ever they are called&mdash;those schools which teach exclusively through the medium of Irish&mdash;get higher marks than anybody else.  Anybody who comes to study the facts discovers two things, one of which is capable of proof, the other of which is practically incapable of proof but is nevertheless certainly true.  The first thing is that there is a bonus given to every <Col N="163" /> child in respect of each question, not because the question is well answered, but because the question is answered through the medium of Irish.  In theory, as far as I can find out, if question 1 on the paper is, &ldquo;Is black white?&rdquo; and the pupil answers &ldquo;Sé,&rdquo; he will get 10 per cent. of the marks because he answered the question in Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find that the pupil is entitled to a bonus for doing the paper through the medium of Irish, which the pupil who does the same paper through the medium of English does not get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you sure of that? Has he to be correct in his answer? Supposing his answer is 50 per cent. correct, will he not get a bonus on the 50 per cent.?  I think he will.  Supposing it is 25 per cent. correct, will he get a bonus?  Suppose it is proposed only to give 2 per cent. out of 100 for a question, will he not get the bonus? I think he will.  Where does the Deputy stop?  If he gets 50 per cent. he gives the bonus.  Would he give the bonus if he only gets 25 per cent.? Where does the Deputy draw the line? The Deputy should look into that.  The second thing is this, and it is much harder of comprehension.  When you get a mass of papers set for children and their answers come in, some standard must be struck whereby those papers will be marked.  So far as I am aware, the general system is that the standard struck is such a standard as will permit 70 per cent. of the pupils to pass.  That is a general average; I do not say that is a rigid rule.  That is the kind of point that the examiners aim at in order to fix a standard for any given examination.  It might result in practice that 65 per cent. of the pupils will pass or 75 per cent. of the pupils; but the general average aimed at is that 70 per cent. will pass. That is for examination papers done in the vernacular of the children undergoing the examination, so that it is a <Col N="164" /> pretty fair guide.  You have an average for the children and you let everybody who gets above that average pass the examination, and only those who grotesquely fail are rejected.</P>
      <P>Now you come to the same papers translated into Irish, and the pupils are to answer through the medium of Irish.  You take the same papers but you do not translate the standard. You do not mark the Irish papers on the same standard that you mark the papers when in English.  You take the Irish papers into another group.  You take all the children who did the paper through Irish and fix a standard for them which will allow 70 per cent. of the pupils who have done the paper through Irish to pass.  In practice that works out that if only the same standard of accuracy was required of the English-speaking pupils as, in fact, is required of the Irish-speaking pupils, 99 per cent. of the English-speaking pupils would have passed.  To put it the other way round, if you ask the same standard of accuracy in the subject in which the examination was made of the Irish-speaking children that you do of the English-speaking children, not 10 per cent. of the Irish-speaking children would pass.</P>
      <P>The reason is simple, because the children taught through the medium of Irish find it very difficult to employ the words to express the thoughts.  I am afraid that they very frequently find it difficult to understand fully the lessons imparted to them through the medium of Irish.  They learn them in a parrot-like way and do not really get the full meaning of the lesson in such a way as makes it possible for them to put it forth again at the time of the examination in their own words. So that you are actually examining pupils in different schools in the same subjects but by entirely different standards and you have those two purely artificial advantages given to the child who answers through the medium of Irish, so entirely distorting the character of the education imparted in two different types of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a wicked thing that the child whose parents want to make a child an Irish speaker is getting a poorer education, is being beaten down to a <Col N="165" /> lower standard of learning than the child in a school where it may be he does not hear Irish at all, or only in a very cursory way.  That sounds like rank heresy to certain Deputies but these are facts.  These are facts to which we ought to put an end.  So long as there is a cloak thrown over the whole of this business we will never be able to mend the situation.  If we could pull the whole thing into the open air, dust it up, and get it working right we would make much more substantial progress.</P>
    <P>It is a subject about which I feel very strongly because I am afraid that the general education of our children in secondary schools is sinking lower and lower and lower.  The Romance languages are being abandoned; children are not learning the Classics; not 1 per cent. of the scholars going to secondary schools are learning Greek; Latin is gradually disappearing; few, if any, learn German, French or Spanish.  It means that they are not getting education in the true sense of the word at all.</P>
    <P>All this is being blamed partly, I think, fairly blamed, partly unfairly, on Irish.  Surely that cannot serve the cause of the Irish language.  There is a simple way out of it all, and I urge it most strongly on the Minister, and that is, to give the commission for which I asked, and to let all who <Col N="166" /> have complaints to make go before it. In the light of that knowledge, either in this House or by the commission, you can evolve a system of education to secure the preservation of the Irish language and, at the same time, to secure a steadily improving standard of education which will equip students for the battle of life.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the Minister's attention to the fact that in Drumbane, in my constituency, there is a clamour for a school.  I have details of the hardship occasioned to the people of that village by having to send their children a considerable distance to attend a school.  I understand the matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister, and that the number of children to be catered for would be about 100.  Perhaps, when the Minister is replying he will say if he has received representations from the people of the district as to the need for providing a new school.  I hope that the Minister and the Department will give every consideration to the need for a school there.  I believe a school is a vital necessity there.</P>
