      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention was directed to the interview given by the Saorstát Minister at Berlin to the German newspaper, <i>12-Uhr Blatt</i>; whether he is aware that the Minister is represented as stating that the German Reich and Herr Hitler have many admirers among the youth of Ireland; whether the Minister was authorised to make the statements attributed to him, and if not, whether he will state what steps have been taken to remove impressions created by the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the interview given by the Saorstát Minister at Berlin to which the Deputy refers. The interview was not authorised, but as it was very general in character and dealt mainly with the cultural and trade relations between the two countries it would not require special authorisation.  From inquiries I have made I find that the statement quoted by the Deputy had reference to the visit of some Irish school boys to Germany last year at the invitation of the <i>Hitlerjugend.</i>  In the circumstances I do not think that the statement could be regarded as more than an expression of courtesy, and consequently I do not consider it necessary to take any steps in relation to the statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the bacon curers of Saorstát Eireann are paying producers an average price of about 67/- per cwt., dead weight, at the factory for pigs, and are charging the consumer 120/- to 130/- per cwt. for Wiltshire smoked bacon, and whether he will refer this matter to the Prices Commission for investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Minister for Agriculture that up to the 19th instant the Price Order made by the Pigs Marketing Board provided for a price of 69/- per cwt., dead weight, for pigs of the highest class. In addition, curers were required to pay to the Board the difference between the appointed price and the hypothetical price, namely, 12/- per cwt.  On the 14th instant the board made a new order which came into operation on the 19th instant, and under the terms of this order the highest appointed price is 73/- per cwt., and the difference between the hypothetical price and the appointed price is 10/-.  The effect of this is that pigs of the highest grade are now costing curers 83/- per cwt., dead weight.  I am not in a position to confirm that bacon curers are charging consumers 120/- to 130/- per cwt. for Wiltshire smoked bacon.  I have made orders under the Control of Prices Act, 1932, requesting the Prices Commission to investigate whether unreasonably high prices are being charged throughout Saorstát Eireann for bacon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state under what statute he purported <Col N="1184" /> to act when fixing the price of bakers flour at 53/- per sack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 24th March, 1937, I made an Order under Section 2 (1) of the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act, 1936, fixing for the purposes of that Act, the price of flour throughout Saorstát Eireann at 53/- per sack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not calculated to deceive this House to say that he fixed the price of flour, seeing that he has no statutory power whatever for doing so?  All he can do is to assume that, on a given date, the price of flour was 53/- for the purpose of the calculation which he is supposed to make prior to fixing by statute the price of bread under the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to fix the maximum price of flour, but for the purposes of the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act I fix the price in relation to which the price of bread is fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no power whatever to compel any miller in this country to sell flour at a price fixed by him in connection with the administration of the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price fixed by me in connection with the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act has nothing to do with the price at which flour is sold.  It has, however, very direct reference to the price at which bread was sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recollect that one week ago he categorically denied the statement he has just now made?  He said that he had fixed the price of flour at 53/-, and that if I had paid 57/- I was paying more than the fixed price.  The Minister now admits that he could not fix the price of flour, and in fact did not fix the price of flour, as between seller and purchaser in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I fixed the price at that figure which the advisory committee <Col N="1185" /> established under the Act said was the actual price being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but you did not fix the price, and could not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the price of maize-meal mixture has advanced by 20/- per ton during the last three weeks, and whether he intends to take any measures to reduce the price of this commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass (for Minister for Agriculture) Mr. Lemass (for Minister for Agriculture)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass (for Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a recent advance in the price of maize-meal mixture due largely to the increased cost of maize, which has advanced by about 25/- per ton since the end of February last.  This is a matter over which I have no control but which must necessarily affect the price of maize-meal mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of maize-meal mixture in this country is £2 10s. to £3 per ton dearer than the price of pure maize meal in Northern Ireland and Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that it is not a separate question, because I asked the Minister if he will take the steps which lie within his province and his power to reduce the price of maize meal.  I say that he could take steps in Saorstát Eireann to bring the price of maize meal, not below the world price, but down to the level that obtains for pure maize meal in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to maize-meal mixture, and not to maize meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister could take steps in regard to maize-meal mixture by reducing the content of home-grown cereals to .001 per cent., which will operate to reduce the price of maize-meal mixture down to the <Col N="1186" /> price which obtains in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  If he does not know that, he ought to know it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Resolution No. 11:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That it is expedient to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provision in connection with finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday last I was dealing with the question of the reduction of taxation, and the promise that derating would be financed by economies.  I had quoted some speeches made by Deputy Boland, now Minister for Lands, and the Minister for Finance questioned the pledge to derate land.  I have here a quotation from a manifestó issued in the <i>Irish Press</i> of February 27th, 1932.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With two of the £3,000,000 involved the farmers can be relieved completely of the rates on their holdings. Another £1,000,000 is available for the relief of taxation, or for such purposes as the Dáil may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1932.  Away back in 1929 there was a by-election in Longford-Westmeath, and apparently this question of derating was a hot question there.  It was essential to give something hot to the electorate in order that <Col N="1194" /> they would catch the bait.  I have here a copy of a pamphlet issued at the by-election in Longford.  It sets out the amount of rates paid by the two counties at £146,607, and sets out the amount of land annuities paid by the tenant farmers of Longford-Westmeath at £177,288.  Then it goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So that if the Government elected by the people would only stand by the rights of the people&mdash;rights admitted to be theirs by British statute&mdash;the farmers, householders, shopkeepers of Longford-Westmeath need not pay one penny in the rates.  The land annuities would do the whole thing and leave £30,000 over to aid agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder how are the people of Longford-Westmeath feeling to-day?  The pamphlet goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since they came into office the Free State Government have handed over to the wealthiest Empire in the world £1,400,000 taken out of the pockets of Longford-Westmeath farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, this was all put before the electorate to induce them to &ldquo;End this robbery.  Vote No. 1 Geoghegan.&rdquo;  It is significant to notice that this pamphlet was published by Eamonn Donnelly, election agent for James Geoghegan.  I am sorry that Deputy Donnelly is not here to have a look at this pamphlet.  Now, the House and the country has been told in 86 pages of words that there is a reduction of taxation in this year.  I question that.</P>
    <P>This year's Estimate exceeds last year's by £49,251.  It is worth while having an identification parade of the rise in taxation since the present Government came into office.  The figure in the last Budget introduced by the Minister's predecessor was £21,722,888; in the following year, 1932-33, the figure was £24,217,504; in 1933-34, £26,391,880; 1934-35, £26,531,105; 1935-36, £26,050,016; 1936-37, £29,213,018, and in the current year the figure is £29,262,269.  This year's Estimate exceeds the last one introduced by the Minister's predecessor by the sum of £7,539,381.  In spite of that we have been given 86 pages of words to tell us that there is a reduction in taxation. <Col N="1195" /> We have been told by Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen about the excellent position of the farmers.  I have quoted elsewhere, and will repeat here, the position with regard to agriculture. Whereas the farmer's average annual income in 1926 was £93, in 1936 it was £51, or a drop of £42.  A good deal has been said in this House about the position of the agricultural labourers. There has been some criticism of the way farmers have been treating them, but it is significant that to-day the agricultural labourers are getting more out of the land than the farmers who employ them.  The average annual income of the 140,000 agricultural labourers employed on the land in 1926 was £66.  In 1934 the figure was £55, or a drop of £11.  Therefore, the position is this, that in 1934 the agricultural labourers were getting £55 a year out of the land as against £51 by the farmers.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Budget speech delivered by the Minister for Finance was devoted to an attempt to show the soundness of the position, financially, from the national point of view.  There was one serious blank in it, because the Minister evaded dealing with the question of our national liabilities. He said that the national debt, as compared with March, 1932, has gone up by the net sum of £5,737,000.  But what is the position of the local authorities?  Is not their indebtedness a national concern, because in the last analysis has it not to be borne by the general body of the taxpayers?  Since the present Government came into office this indebtedness has increased from £15,750,000 to about £26,000,000.  Why is that figure not taken into consideration when reviewing the position in regard to our national indebtedness? That, surely, is a national liability because it is as much due by the Government as by the local authorities. In the last analysis the Government must face it as such, but whether it is faced by the Government or by the local authorities the general body of the taxpayers will have to meet it.</P>
    <P>Not only has the indebtedness of local authorities increased by about £10,000,000 during the period of office <Col N="1196" /> of the present Government, but in addition about £2,500,000 in extra rates have been levied off the people.  While that is so the real wealth producers of the country have had in that period their annual income reduced from £93 to £51 in the case of the farmers, and from £66 to £55 in the case of agricultural labourers.  The indebtedness of the local authorities has been increased by, roughly, £10,000,000, and our national indebtedness by about £5,750,000.  That is the unpleasant trail of taxation that the Government have left behind them after their five years in office, and yet they come along and say that they have reduced taxation and brought prosperity to everybody. They say that is apparent from the amount of money that is being spent on certain articles.  We have the situation, therefore, that the enormous sum of round about £30,000,000 of public money is now being expended annually.  That money must come ultimately out of the pockets of the citizens of this State.  If you have that mad gallop in the spending of the entire resources of the country annually, and even if that is not sufficient without having recourse to increasing our indebtedness, surely we have there a situation which indicates the rate's progress.  Some day we must cry halt to that.</P>
    <P>On page 19 of his Budget statement the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this stage I must refer to other consequences of the 1933 Land Act, which as well as granting a reduction in the annuities payable under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, granted a like reduction in those payable under previous Acts.  By the grant of this concession the Exchequer has lost an annual income of £1,480,000; but purchasers under the old Land Acts have been relieved of capital burdens amounting to £38,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that the phrase &ldquo;old Land Acts&rdquo; refers to the pre-1923 Land Acts?  If it does, I would like to hear the Minister defend his statement that he is giving a remission of £38,000,000 to the farmers.  Was the phrase stuck into the Minister's statement as a bait to the farmers to make them believe that, when they were not getting the <Col N="1197" /> derating that had been promised to them by the Government, they were going to get rid of this capital liability of £38,000,000.  If we assume that the phrase &ldquo;old Land Acts&rdquo; refers to the pre-1923 Land Acts, what is the position with regard to them?  The penal tariffs which are being paid in lieu of the payments to Great Britain are not in discharge of the payments under the pre-1923 Land Acts, and in respect of these tariffs England has collected a sum of at least £20,000,000.  Some time ago I examined the British finance accounts for the current year.  They estimated for a collection of about £750,000 over and above the amount due to them for the year 1936-37.</P>
    <P>They have collected up to the 31st March&mdash;we will know the exact amount in a few days&mdash;approximately £20,000,000 under these Acts.  It will be observed that while that money has been collected the capital sum due under these Acts remains frozen, that no part of this £20,000,000 collected during these years has been allocated to the sinking fund and that the capital sum, which, if this £38,000,000 refers to the pre-1923 Land Acts, should be doubled and made £76,000,000, is still due so far as the British Treasury is concerned and remains a frozen debt. The Minister says that he has given relief amounting to half that amount; that is to say, he has collected half of the amount originally payable.  I do not want to let an item of that kind, because it is too substantial, pass with out some comment in order to get an explanation as to whether &ldquo;old Land Acts&rdquo; refers to all the Land Acts, including the 1923 Act, or the Land Acts up to 1909.  There has been no remission, so far as the liability of the farmers is concerned, under the pre-1923 Land Acts.  They have paid an amount since 1932 that would approximately liquidate about one-half of the liability under that to the British Government.</P>
    <P>Each year since 1932, since the penal tariffs were imposed, we have a statement contained in the Budget by the Minister for Finance that he is justified in borrowing some of the money to pay export bounties on agricultural produce because it is an abnormal liability. <Col N="1198" /> So far as the average person can see, there is nothing abnormal about it.  He is not at a loss to know how the Minister can use the word &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; about a sum of this kind when the Government have entered into two agreements with the British Government in order that these moneys will be collected and paid.  One could understand the Government saying it was abnormal if we had not entered into agreements with the British Government to collect these sums.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here that unemployment is decreasing, that owing to the number being put into employment there are practically no unemployed in the country.  As I have said in other places, the way to find out whether there are unemployed is to ask unemployed people.  The Minister questioned a statement of mine on Friday with regard to an unemployed man working on rotational work.  He said he could go anywhere he liked and find work for the other two or three days in the week in which he was unemployed. The Minister knows as well as I do that it is utterly impossible for that man to get any work in that way; that it is only by mobilising the resources of the State that he at present can get three days' work.</P>

      <P>When I said that he would not be allowed.  I was told that.  But he cannot get work and the Minister knows that.  He only gets three days a week under this.  A lot of these men have been put on drainage work and the making of bog roads. I know something about bogs, and I say that a bog is no place in which to put a man to work in the winter time. I suggest to the Minister that, so far as drainage work and work in very wet bogs is concerned, these men should be put on that work in the summer and autumn and not in the winter.  I have seen men working this winter in places where it was nothing short of penal servitude for them.  I was referring to the question of three days a week and to the wages paid, and relating it to the fact that that had the effect in many places of reducing the wages paid to other men, particularly agricultural labourers.  It has been admitted by Deputies on all sides of the House that this rotational work is vicious, because the 12/- or 13/- a week paid in rural parts of Ireland has the tendency to become a headline for others employing labour in the district and to bring the wages of other workers down to that sum.  So far as the sum itself is concerned, for a man who has to keep a wife and family the thing is futile.  He cannot buy sufficient food to provide the minimum of nourishment for himself, his wife and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emphasis has been laid on the fact that, as a result of the Budget, all taxes have been removed from essential foodstuffs.  Deputy Dillon had a number of questions on to-day's Order Paper which had reference to this matter.  While the Government may not be directly getting revenue from articles of food, there are various circuitous ways by which the prices of these essential foodstuffs are being <Col N="1200" /> increased.  It does not matter to the consumer whether he pays directly or indirectly.  The point is that the cost of foodstuffs is beyond what he is capable of paying and what his income can afford.</P>
    <P>The members of this Party have stated hundreds of times, both inside and outside the House, that until the agricultural industry is restored to prosperity there is no hope for this State&mdash;that it will go on declining and declining, frittering away year after year the resources of the people.  Ultimately, there can be only one end to that, to sink down into poverty.  Time and again we have declared that it was vital for the agricultural industry, which of course governs the prosperity of this State, that the economic war should be settled.  We have been asked repeatedly how we would settle it.  Deputy Cosgrave stated on Friday that any settlement would be better than the present position.  We have the actual loss on certain things in figures but does the story end there? Not at all.  The actual decline in agricultural exports annually has been put at £22,000,000.  But what about the depressed prices for the foodstuffs retained and consumed at home?  Is not that an additional loss?  What about the other losses?  The Minister for Agriculture has figures for each year showing the number of cattle fattened, only a limited number of which could be exported, plus the number consumed in this country, and the balance the feeders had to turn back on grass and eventually sell as stores.  What is the extent of the loss there?  Then we have the loss that accrued from the fact that the money that could be had for these cattle was not put back into production. Any settlement that could be made by anybody, even the most fantastic settlement that could be conceived, would be better than the present arrangement.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government, not on behalf of the Government but on behalf of the people, irrespective of what Party they support, to enter into an agreement and to bring about a settlement.  Year after year, for the past three or four years, the position <Col N="1201" /> is becoming more acute.  The working people are becoming poorer and poorer, and they have now reached the stage when they are driven to desperation and do not care what happens.  The same applies to the farmers, many of whom do not mind what happens.  Many of them were amongst the most prosperous farmers in the country.  They were making money and were saving it.  I quoted figures recently to show that 35,000 acres had gone out of tillage in Country Donegal.  Picture the effect of 35,000 acres of land having gone out of tillage in that country.  It may be assumed that that consisted mostly of land that had been reclaimed from bogs and moors, owing to the efforts of the people who had been driven to these places in the past.  It was by their efforts that that land was reclaimed and kept in production, but it rapidly goes back to a wilderness, if not worked.  We have as honest and as good farmers in Donegal as are to be found any place in this country.  They work hard and are industrious, but their position has become so desperate, after all their labour, and having no results, that they are now selling their stock and implements, turning the keys in the doors, and leaving their places derelict.  They are not even letting the land in con-acre, and the consequence is that there will be default in the payments of rates and annuities.  The additional burden will fall on the remaining farmers who are carrying as much as they can bear. The policy of the Government in imposing an additional burden on farmers who are trying to carry on will undoubtedly result in crushing them out.  The local rates in County Donegal have increased in the past four years by £34,000, while 35,000 acres have gone out of production, so that there is a vicious circle of increasing taxation and reduced production. If you go on crushing these people, ultimately, the entire farming community will be driven out of production. There must be an end to this thing.  There is no use in the Government thinking that taking some taxation off tea or a farthing off sugar will meet the position.  That is a joke.  The Government must do something <Col N="1202" /> bigger and bolder.  They must do what they should have done long ago, settle the economic war.  People on the land must be given an inducement to work it, so that they will have something for their labour.  Nobody expects people to continue working land indefinitely if they do not get some remuneration.</P>
    <P>There are ups and downs in every walk of life, and in agriculture there will be bad years, but in recent years every year has been a bad one for those in that industry.  Young men after four years' experience find that it is utterly futile to stay on the land and, as a consequence, they are going across to England and Scotland.  That is a national tragedy, and this Government will some day waken to the fact that it has committed a great crime against these people and against the country.  The Government can tax away, because they got the votes of the people by promising to reduce the burden of taxation when it was £21,000,000 by £2,000,000, but instead of that, they have increased national taxation by £10,000,000.  They have increased the national debt, and the debt of local authorities by about £10,000,000, and the figure is still increasing.  Where is it to end? Where is the money to come from? They will have to cry a halt when the sack is empty, and they will have to do it, as Irishmen did in the past, when the boats are burned.  In that situation people begin to cry and to ask why they did it.  That is not the time to cry halt.  A halt must be called long before that stage is reached.  It is utterly useless to quote the old phrase about locking the stable door when the mare is stolen. If the mare is gone, it does not matter when the door is locked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one vote this country is not going to drop, and that is the vote given for the last five years for the Government. The Deputy may be quite sure of that. We have no anxiety about the country burning the boat of the Fianna Fáil Government, because the country is perfectly satisfied with it.  The Deputy indulged in the usual jeremiads <Col N="1203" /> about rising taxation and the Kathleen Mavourneen disaster and bankruptcy which is always coming. He told us the story of how taxation is rising.  I happen to be one of those people who does not like to see a State taking a very large share of the total income for its services.  I like the State to leave as much as possible of the total income, that is, the total production, of the country in the hands of the people themselves to spend.  I have always been of that opinion and I am of that opinion now, but, unfortunately, I belong to a generation which is past in that respect.  The Government of every country in the world at present is taking&mdash;and this is the meaning of taxation&mdash;a larger share of the total production of the State into its own hands, and redistributing that production for the purposes of the general community in the way it thinks best.  That is what taxation is.  There is always an idea in an Opposition that taxation is the taking away of money and dropping it into the sea.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is merely, as I have said before, that portion of the total income or production of a country which the Government of the country decides to spend for the purposes of the country, and, therefore, merely to say that the amount of taxation has risen by £5,000,000, £10,000,000, £15,000,000 or £20,000,000, as the case may be, means nothing until you ask yourself what is done with the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anybody who contests that proposition?  I do not think there is. There was the loud laugh which betokened the very vacant mind, but the Deputy, or any other Deputy, is not prepared to get up here and say that it is not the purpose for which money is used which decides the burden of taxation.  If, for instance, you take £10,000,000 and throw it away, that is a dead loss to the community, but if you take £10,000,000 and spend it, as a central and unified authority, better than the community in the whole of its diversified activities could spend it, that expenditure is a profit.  It is being more profitably and better spent and, therefore, we <Col N="1204" /> come down to brass tacks.  We treat the Opposition as honest and intelligent men when we ask: What portion of the total added expenditure which has taken place do you object to? What portion of that expenditure are you prepared to go into the Lobby and vote against?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has given me a return which appeared in the Budget showing the expenditure on social and similar services as, in 1931-'32, £9,343,000 and in 1937-'38, £15,250,000.  Which item there does the Deputy or any other Deputy desire to economise?  Until they are prepared to do that, they are beating the wind and beating the wind very foolishly in the face of an intelligent electorate when they merely talk of the increase of taxation.  In the same way, they speak of the increase of national indebtedness.  An increase of national indebtedness which went into bombs, destruction or something of that kind, by all means, but what portion of the increase of national or local indebtedness that has taken place do the Deputies object to?  The money that is being spent on public health works?  The money that is being spent on roads?  The money that is being spent on housing?  Until they come down to that very simple issue, they are wasting their time, and I do not want them to waste their time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, speaking the other day in relation to another matter, said that men who are working on a rotation system, who are working three days, were not permitted by the Government to work, and were prosecuted by the Government if, in fact, they worked on any other day.  I am not recalling that at the moment to blame the Deputy.  It was a reckless and foolish statement and, coming from a Deputy whom the general public would not know was utterly irresponsible, would convey to a lot of people a very wrong and a very dangerous impression.  One of the real difficulties of the Unemployment Assistance Act, as everybody knows, was that men who were getting the dole were so anxious to retain it that they used to avoid openly taking casual work.  By the system under which they are now employed, they are entitled to work, <Col N="1205" /> either on their own farms at home or elsewhere, or to take paid work in the interval.  Why I am raising this particular point with the Deputy, having regard to the fact that he has withdrawn the statement, is not in any way to blame him, but to get rid of the damage done by publicity of that kind which has been given to a statement which is false.  It is necessary that the people should understand that one of the difficulties, one of the purposes, of the rotation system is to enable a person, freely, openly and with his head up, to take any additional work that is available and every encouragement is to be given to him to do so.</P>
    <P>I have at different times had various criticisms of rotation into which I am not going now, but there is one which I have not heard here which, in my opinion, is serious.  As a matter of fact, it came to me from a priest in the West of Ireland who promised to report the fact to his bishop, including me, I take it.  I think there was sound ground for his complaint and that is why I am bringing it out.  He complains that in certain districts, where the men are little farmers or fishermen, the fact that they are getting three days a week and that it is continuing over a very considerable period of time is allowing them to neglect the work which they ought to be doing on their own farms and in relation to their own fishing.  I do regard that as a serious consideration and one which would have to be taken up to the extent that we will go into conference with the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture, and try to eliminate the times and periods in the year in relation to the different types of agriculture in the different districts at which relief work must not interfere, and even the three-day week must not be allowed to interfere, with the fundamental matters.</P>
    <P>I notice that I get no attack&mdash;and I am saying this to their credit&mdash;upon rotation from Donegal or from any of the poor districts because&mdash;and, again, I am giving them credit for good faith in the matter&mdash;they know that to the small farmer and people of that kind the two or three day's work which still <Col N="1206" /> enables him to do the work he ought to be doing on his own farm is a valuable thing, while the complete withdrawal of his labour by continuous work might very well be a disastrous thing.  However, I do not want to deal further with that.  So far as the Deputy is concerned, I do want publicly to remove any impression or misunderstanding which may have been caused by his statement here that the Government will prosecute men for working on the days on which they are not employed by a rotation system. I want to say that one of the objects of the rotation is to encourage them to take any other work which is available in the other time and that no question of prosecution, penalty disability or odium of any sort, kind or description attaches to any man who attempts to use that other time.</P>
    <P>The rest of the debate has run along what I may call the ordinary, customary lines of discussions of this character in whatever country and at whatever time they take place.  I think that if you were to envisage about 50 Parliaments engaged in their Budget debates, the Oppositions would be making precisely the same kind of speeches that they are making now.  They might do it with a little bit more discretion and a little bit more regard for the possibility that some of their idle utterances might have ill effects on the State itself but, broadly speaking, and naturally, the business of the Opposition is to say that the particular Government to which they are opposed is the worst and that their administration of the finances is the worst piece of work that ever was done.  One takes that for granted.  I looked through these debates rather in the hope of finding things with which I could agree, but they do not give me much chance because they do not agree with themselves.  Perhaps the one statement I do agree with is the initial statement of Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;that this is the worst Budget which ever came, the worst Budget for Deputy Cosgrave.  He will not know how bad it is until he shall have lived with it through a general election. <Col N="1207" /> Then he will know how bad it is.  I remember another Budget which was followed by a county council election. That Budget was described as a very bad Budget, and we were told that, in 23 out of the 26 councils, Deputy Cosgrave was going to sweep the field.  We are told now that this is the worst Budget and that Deputy Cosgrave is coming back at the head of the Government after this election. History repeats itself.  He was wrong before and he is wrong again.  The Budget to which the Opposition previously referred was bad for them; the election was worse, but it was nothing to the blizzard that is coming now.</P>
    <P>After the sort of jeremiad we have had from Deputy Cosgrave, it is rather encouraging to turn to the speech by Deputy Dillon.  One would not expect, at first, that one would find in anything that Deputy Dillon would say anything that would make for encouragement.  But he says that it will take a long time to spend that amount of money, that the productivity of this country has been steadily reduced, that the inevitable consequence of the present line of policy being pursued by the Government will be to drive our people back below a decent standard of living. But he tells us that that is not going to happen in a hurry.  &ldquo;The last word I have to say,&rdquo; he told us, &ldquo;is that it will take a long time to bring this country to the stage where the State cannot meet its commitments.&rdquo; He is satisfied that there is a great deal of solid worth in this country. Having regard to the fact that it ought to have been bankrupt years ago, that it was going to be bankrupt every six months or three months in the interval, it is amazing to learn that we still have these reserves which, according to Deputy Dillon, will prevent us from going bankrupt. But he has not convinced Deputy Anthony.  Deputy Anthony tells us that he actually sees the crash coming. Other Deputies told us that, for the past four or five years, we have been spending our substance in riotous living, selling our foreign investments, <Col N="1208" /> living on our fat or, as they would say, on their fat.  It is encouraging to know from Deputy Dillon that our foreign investments have increased by between £100,000,000 and £120,000,000. That is very encouraging, indeed.  He tells us that they have gone up from the highest estimate I had previously heard of £180,000,000 or £200,000,000 to £300,000,000 so that, on the whole, we seem to be doing fairly well.</P>
    <P>Then, we move along to column 1071 and we find Deputy Anthony telling us that, due to the increase in the cost of commodities, all necessaries have passed out of sight and out of the buying capacity of the ordinary person. Deputy Dillon does not agree with that. Deputy Dillon says the people are so poor that the unemployed are smoking all the tobacco, drinking all the drink, and absorbing all the luxuries.  Even that is not good enough, because Deputy McGovern comes along and says that all the luxuries are being absorbed and eaten by the profiteers. I was rather anxious to develop points of agreement with the Opposition and see how far we could get along together, but with which of these views am I to agree, with Deputy Anthony, who sees the crash coming, or with Deputy Dillon, who cannot see it coming&mdash;the dim, far-off event on which they have banked for years, the approaching bankruptcy which they tried to create and have failed to create?  Are we to agree with Deputy Dillon when he says that all the luxuries are being consumed by the poor, and that that is why the Budget returns have gone up, or are we to accept Deputy McGovern's view when he says that the consumption of luxuries is due to the fact that, as Deputy Anthony has pointed out, the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer?  What am I to take&mdash;I am not particular&mdash;as the judgment of the Opposition?  What is their basis of criticism?  They tell us what completely unregenerate methods we use in raising the money.  Deputy Dillon speaks of the dexterous devices of borrowing.  Deputy O'Neill uses certain language, and this is a matter in which, now that Deputy MacDermot has gone into another sphere, Deputies on the opposite benches are allowed to <Col N="1209" /> indulge in blackguardism.  The Deputy speaks of the bunk and humbug and fraud of the Minister.  Deputy Anthony speaks of legerdemain, of dishonest methods used by my friend the Minister for Finance for getting in this money.  Some people do not like to hear the devil rebuke sin, but I do.  I always like to hope that this is a sign of repentance.  I like to see the devil rebuking sin.  Some time they may begin to practise the things they preach.  I see nothing actually dishonest or unsound in this Budget nor, I think, has anybody suggested it.  But when one looks back on the history of the methods by which Deputies opposite, when they were a Government, balanced their Budgets, one at any rate, commends their cheek.  On a particular occasion they would not raise the income-tax.  What they did was&mdash; they collected two years together. They did not raise the tax, they simply collected the two years together.  I think that is a great idea.  Then there were certain moneys in relation to tax which the brewers had on credit.  For instance, they did not increase the tax on beer or do anything like that.  They simply collected in three months credit in advance.</P>
    <P>These might be regarded as what one might call devices, clever little things. But when it comes to the actual selling of property and calling it &ldquo;miscellaneous revenue&rdquo; it is a different story. There were a couple of million pounds belonging to the Department of Education which became &ldquo;miscellaneous revenue.&rdquo;  The old Congested Districts Board left money here behind it.  That money belonged to the poor, I should say to the very poor.  It became &ldquo;miscellaneous revenue.&rdquo; Though it took them three or four years to engender or to excogitate a tariff on rosary beads, when it was necessary in order to balance the Budget to put on a tariff, the tariff jumped its head and a tariff was found to provide £250,000 to balance the Budget.  Compared with that, the dexterous devices of borrowing became fairly innocent, and the &ldquo;bunk, humbug and fraud&rdquo; of the Minister for Finance in this Government pales its ineffectual fire and bows <Col N="1210" /> its head in humility before the great masters of these arts.</P>
    <P>Then we are asked, and we are asked continuously, to come down to brass tacks.  Deputy McMenamin ends up his speech by asking us to come down to brass tacks and to settle the economic war.  Yet when Deputy Dillon is asked how he is going to settle the economic war he says: &ldquo;Do not ask me a silly debating question.&rdquo;  When we are told that one of the difficulties is that we are not buying the goods we used to buy from other people we ask &ldquo;which of the industries are you going to lay on the altar of this settlement?&rdquo; and all we hear is &ldquo;do not ask me a silly debating question in a debate of this kind.&rdquo;  Those are the brass tacks. What is the settlement?  Someone has suggested that it is going to be difficult to settle the economic war in three days.  It is not going to be difficult to settle the economic war if any settlement will do.  Now, that is the little cat and all its kittens coming out of the bag&mdash;any settlement.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin is horrified by the idea that we still have a frozen debt of £78,000,000 or £76,000,000 owing to Britain.  Does &ldquo;any settlement&rdquo; include that £78,000,000?  It is not unreasonable to ask that we should get some indication, some shadowy adumbration and foreshadowing of the method of construction leading up to the proposals which may effectuate a settlement.  I am not putting the matter closer than that.  But &ldquo;any settlement&rdquo; is a bit too vague.  When very shortly Deputies opposite have the pleasure of talking to quite a few people in this country, the vast majority of whom have a very clear and intelligent understanding of this problem, I hope they are going to tell them from their platforms that the settlement which they propose is &ldquo;any settlement&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;any settlement&rdquo; which the British will accept in three days.</P>
    <P>The next part of the stunt by the Opposition Deputies was the unemployment figures.  Everybody quoted the unemployment figures.  They quoted 93,000 and they added various things to it and they got an extraordinary total, and they divided that by four and <Col N="1211" /> added the first number they thought of. We have been hearing about unemployment figures for quite a long time. These figures have always been quoted as if they were definitely comparable&mdash; as if you could build and work on them. I personally have protested against that proposition time after time in this House, but always I have been told: &ldquo;The figures are there and those are the things that count.&rdquo;  Well, at least that story has been debunked.  I want to get this very definitely on record because I do not want to hear the unemployment figures ever quoted here again without taking into account the method of their compilation.</P>
    <P>In column 980, No. 7, Volume 66 of the Official Debates, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported as dealing with those figures.  The Minister said that on March 5th there were 145,000 people, about 50 per cent. more than here.  He was quoting the Denmark figure.  Deputy Morrissey intervened&mdash;in my opinion, quite legitimately: &ldquo;Are the figures in relation to unemployed calculated there in the same way as they are here?&rdquo;  Mr. Lemass replied: &ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo; Then Deputy Morrissey said: &ldquo;The figures are of no use then.&rdquo;  We turn to column 1003, where Deputy Morrissey is speaking, and he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree that the method used for compiling unemployment figures shows the true facts.  Indeed, at one time the Minister declared that the statistics were prepared specially in order to shield the actual figures.  The Minister has changed the method of compiling those figures very considerably and very often during the last five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the face of that acknowledgment, of something that Deputy Morrissey knew and that every intelligent member of this House has known all the time&mdash; that these figures had been changed very considerably, on two or three occasions; their method of compilation &mdash;how on earth can any reasonable and sensible person keep on using figures in that way?  I am glad that has come out; I am out to encourage it; I am out to create as far as possible the condition <Col N="1212" /> in which everybody quoting unemployment figures will quote them in the conscious knowledge that they are an algebraic sum, that they consist of pluses and minuses, that they consist of things sometimes of a different order added together and, unless you do take these considerations into account, the figures of one particular period are not comparable with the figures of another.</P>
    <P>I think one might well take as a basis the actual figure that you now have, which is somewhere about 93,000. You could add to that the number of people who are artificially employed and say that is the immediate and visible measure of your problem.  You can ask yourself how to deal with it, but then you would have to go back and ask yourself how that new total was made up.  Is it an unemployment census or is it a poverty census?  Until you face that fact it is no use pretending to use these figures in the way in which we are using them.  Anyone who will have a look at the map which I have put up near the Library will see the story of where the unemployed are. If you pick out the black areas from the areas in Mayo, in West Donegal, in West Galway, the small portions of the coast of Clare, in North-West Mayo, the Dingle peninsula, the Bere peninsula and West Cork, and ask yourself what employment means there or ever has meant, in human memory, you will be surprised.  There are no employed persons, agriculturally employed persons in the sense in which that term is commonly used in other portions of the country.  There you are taking a census of endemic poverty, an age-long and historically-founded poverty, a splendid poverty, a courageous and noble poverty, I may say; a history of an heroic endurance with which I know nothing to compare in the history of the rest of Europe.  But to add that, as if you are adding two things of the same kind together, to the casual employment of a city like Dublin or Cork, is nonsense and nothing but nonsense.</P>
    <P>The employment exchanges were first set up for a specific purpose; they were set up as part of the machinery of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  They <Col N="1213" /> had two purposes, one was to keep tab of all those who were entitled to unemployment benefit and to provide the machinery for allocating the stamps and the rest of it, and, secondly, to find out of those insured persons in insured trades for commercial employers commercially desirable employees whom they wanted to have.  There was added to that as a concession the right to register all people who were called &ldquo;others,&rdquo; who were not entitled to insurance benefit, but whose names could be recorded upon such lists in case employers wanted them.  If you go back to 1931 you will find there was a total somewhere of about 30,000 people, between unemployment insurance men and others.  That total was swelled under this Government by special methods of recruitment for the exchange and by special inducements to recruit.  For instance, a man, instead of having to walk a considerable distance, could register at every police barracks in the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, at the same time as the Government did it, they provided an unemployment grant of £2,000,000, and announced that that grant would be allocated territorially on the basis of the number of people actually on the register in those districts.  Deputy McMenamin and Deputy O'Sullivan know that there were no people registered for unemployment in West Donegal and West and North-West Kerry, in Mayo and West Galway&mdash;west of the Shannon.  I have a map which I got made.  The first thing I did when it was my job to try to distribute the money on the basis of unemployment was to make a map to find out where the people were and, to my amazement, there was no poverty west of the Shannon.  It is an unemployment register which showed no unemployment west of the Shannon that is being suggested as a basis of sound comparison, one in which we have done everything that was humanly possible to get on to the record and analyse exactly into the position of their economic standing every poor person west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Now, those are facts that everybody knows.  Of course, when one uses the term &ldquo;everybody knows,&rdquo; as a rule <Col N="1214" /> one is saying things that are going to be highly controversial.  It is the commonest thing for a man to say, &ldquo;I am not going to talk politics,&rdquo; and then to proceed to talk about nothing else but politics.  In the same way, when he says &ldquo;everybody knows,&rdquo; it is a thing which is highly controversial. There is nobody questioning that, however. It is a matter of history.  It is a matter of legal and mathematical demonstration.  You might as well compare glasses of milk and elephants. What are two elephants and two glasses of milk added together?  I should say they are two very thirsty elements, but they certainly do not make four.  Now, that is the sort of thing which has been going on, and it is because that doctrine is now thrown away, finally and for ever, that it is openly acknowledged that these unemployment figures can never again in this House honestly be used in that sense in which I have called attention to this statement of Deputy Morrissey.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying to the effect that everything has the defects of its qualities, and when I am asking for unemployment returns to be treated as an algebraic sum, I am quite satisfied that I am going to raise a lot more. We have an example in to-day's newspaper where Deputy Norton, speaking over the week-end, says that the figure is 93,000.  Last year it was 146,000.  Is anybody going to say that there has been that enormous and phenomenal improvement in one year?  They are not.  The mere fact, however, that they are not prepared to acknowledge that drop from 146,000, the peak point last year, to 93,000 this year, is the best reason why they should not use arbitrary, casual changes and unexplained changes in the figures in the way they have been doing.  However, Deputy Norton said yesterday that the figure is 93,000, but if you take in the people who have been unemployed under the Employment Order&mdash;the men over £4 valuation&mdash;it should be 130,000.  That would mean that 37,000 men have gone off the register as men over £4 valuation. Now, I know what is Deputy Norton's mind in this matter.  He knows that there is a drop, or was a drop last year, of 40,000 when a certain <Col N="1215" /> employment period came into operation, but that was the employment period which included £4 valuation men and single men without dependents.  The actual drop in the case of the £4 valuation men is only a few thousand.  I am not saying that in any sense of complaint, because I think the mere fact that there has been an attempt to treat these figures as figures that have to be analysed before they are used, is such an enormous advance that even a wrong result from it is commendable, but I do suggest that in using these figures care ought to be used to see that misunderstandings of that kind do not take place.  We will come back to this subject again, I have no doubt, many times, but I do hope that the interchange, the very useful and proper interchange, that took place between a member of this Front Bench and that Front Bench, in relation to the reality of these figures, will not be wasted, and that we will not get back into the old habit of adding the milk and the elephants together and making four.</P>
    <P>Another cause of complaint which has been brought up here in relation to this Budget has been the local contributions which were made by local authorities to finance the unemployment schemes.  I do not propose to deal with it at any length now, because I shall have to deal with it again, but it is necessary to deal with it in relation to this Budget in so far as it is, apparently, part of the &ldquo;fraud, bunk, and general criminality&rdquo; of the Minister for Finance in framing this Budget. The suggestion is that the whole object of the method in which we employ a great number of men off the unemployment register, instead of a few men, out of the same money, is to save the Minister for Finance money.  Well, now, I can tell you from inside exactly what does happen.  It comes to a certain period of the year, and we come to estimate the amount of unemployment work which we may or may not do, and I am asked to give a return of the actual effect of that upon the Unemployment Assistance Fund, in order that, when the Minister for <Col N="1216" /> Finance comes down to the close estimation at the end of his Budget, in which he decides whether he is going to have a surplus or whether he is not, or what taxes he may have to put on or take off, he will be dealing with an actual net figure.  Previously unemployment relief schemes were of an entirely sporadic character.  They came like the blossoms in spring, and they departed in the frosts thereof. Gradually, however, over the last few years, they have been evolving themselves into a logical position: that the State was prepared to take, in relation to the submerged tenth&mdash;in relation to the poorer portion of its own population&mdash;a certain definite responsibility, measured in terms of money, for the purpose of softening and alleviating their lot.  There was added to the original sporadic provision of relief votes, the Unemployment Assistance Act, under which the State agreed to pay to every person, under a certain level of financial position, during the actual period of his unemployment, and dependent upon the degree of the dependency of others upon them, an amount of money which would bring him up to a certain standard. That varied with different districts, but that is the actual general position.</P>
    <P>Now, that costs a certain amount of money and is one of the provisions made by the State, and financed out of this and other Budgets, for the purpose of dealing with this question.  In addition to that, there was the sporadic provision of unemployment Votes.  However a method was attempted by which to estimate upon some logical basis what that other amount of money ought to be, and to put it upon an ordered basis, and we have evolved now towards a stage where we envisage an employment fund which would consist of these two elements: one, the provision which the State is prepared to make for people during the period in which they cannot be employed; and, second, the amount of money which the State is prepared to pay for that temporary, artificial employment; and those two together form the Employment Fund.</P>
    <P>Now, as far as the Minister for <Col N="1217" /> Finance is concerned, when he comes to prepare his Budget, he has to estimate for a total of these sums and that is exactly what is being done.  If, for instance, the Minister arranges for £3,000,000 as a total, he says: &ldquo;I have got to spend £1,500,000 on unemployment assistance; then I have only £1,500,000 for the purposes of providing employment.&rdquo;  If, in fact, due to the operation of employment schemes, the call upon the Exchequer for unemployment assistance is forced down to £1,150,000, then the Minister has £350,000 more to add to the fund which he requires for the purpose of giving direct employment.  You may take it that is exactly the process, exactly the attitude of mind, in which the matter is dealt with.  I have thought round every possible way, and I think the Minister for Finance has done likewise, and I do give it as my considered opinion, after a lot of thought on the subject, that there is no possible way in which the Minister for Finance can employ people on public works which is not dearer than giving them unemployment assistance. In certain classes of work, it might cost the State six or seven times as much to employ people as to give them unemployment assistance.  The cheapest of all ways&mdash;I make this free gift to the House for criticism&mdash;to deal with the unemployment problem, if there were no social reactions in the matter, is by providing unemployment assistance.  You can double it or treble it, and it will not cost you anything like as much as employing people but you will have certain reactions which are definitely undesirable.</P>
    <P>It is because those reactions are regarded as undesirable that every effort is now being made, and will be made, to convert as much as possible of the unemployment assistance, or dole money as it is called, into work and into wages.  I would be very glad indeed to see a position in which the Unemployment Assistance Vote could be reduced to £100,000 and the whole of the balance, what is called a saving, transferred for the provision of works under which employment <Col N="1218" /> can be given.  I am perfectly sure that anyone who knows what has been going on in Donegal, in North Kerry, in Mayo, in West Galway, where literally tens of thousands of men have been working instead of drawing the dole&mdash;anyone who knows this and who has seen what is going on, as I have seen what is going on, will have no hesitation in saying that a national duty is being performed in the attempt which is now being made.  Here are the actual figures over a period of years for unemployment assistance and employment schemes combined:&mdash;For 1934-35, £1,281,000; for 1935-36, £1,922,000; for 1936-37, £2,002,000; for 1937-38, £2,621,000.  There is clear evidence, whatever may have been the intention of the Minister for Finance, that he certainly has not carried out any intention of saving money on these schemes.  In every year he has increased the amount expended.  He has raised it from £1,281,000 in 1934-35 to £2,621,000 in 1937-38.  I can tell the House quite definitely that every activity in the direction of employing people, rather than keeping them on the dole is going to increase that &lsquo;total.  I was at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce some time ago, when they were all enthusiastic for employing people, instead of giving them the dole, and I told them what they would have to face if they did that, that it would cost two or three times as much, and might cost five or six times as much, as paying people on the dole.</P>
    <P>We now turn to the point that local authorities are being put upon in some extraordinary way by being asked to contribute.  I do not want to go back on the history of how the moneys were distributed previously but I shall tell you how they are distributed now. We do estimate, as nearly as we can and as honestly as we can, the relative need of particular districts.  We take the U.A. figures for the districts and we take the poverty map of the country which has been formed on the best statistics we can get.  From that we estimate how the total amount that is provided is to be divided between these districts.  In other words, the <Col N="1219" /> money is distributed on the basis of necessity.  Then when it comes to the question of contribution, the contribution is based on the exact opposite basis, on the basis of ability to pay. We have the position, under this method, by which a district, if it is very poor, gets a lot of money.  If it were distributed on a flat rate, which would be dependent on the amount of money to be got out of a district, then it would mean that a poor district would have to find a much larger amount of money than a more prosperous area would have to find.  Take a district like Donegal for instance. There you have about 10,000 people on the register.  To ask the remaining portion of that county to pay 20 per cent. or 50 per cent. or whatever the estimated figure might be, of the amount of money required, justly to deal with the poverty there, is not a feasible proposition, while, if you turn to a place like Dublin, Dublin Borough has practically the same number of people on the register as Donegal, but the overwhelming wealth relatively of Dublin does enable it to stand up to a good deal of its own responsibility. The result is that as far as justice for the poor is concerned, it was met by distributing the money in proportion to the need of the district.  As far as the district itself is concerned, its contribution is proportioned to its own wealth and its own capacity.  The result is that there are very definite differences in the rates of contribution over the country and every one of those can be justified upon the sound ground of rigorous and strict justice in the matter.  Then, why any contribution at all?  I think everyone will recognise that, where money is going to be spent in a district, and under the control of the local authorities in that district, they should have, first, a definite interest in seeing that that money is properly spent, and secondly, a definite knowledge that they are contributing to it.</P>
    <P>There is an idea that the Minister for Finance, in some extraordinary way, has money of his own.  We do not pretend that during a Budget debate.  During a Budget debate <Col N="1220" /> every penny is taken from the poor. Every single penny is being dragged out in the most deliberately brutal fashion it is possible for the misconceived ingenuity of man to devise.  But as soon as the Budget debate is over, then it becomes a grant from the Government. It is very undesirable that local authorities should feel that grants from the Government are things which they do not have to pay for.  They do.  The Government draws its resources from precisely the same people that the rating authorities draw their money from.  They draw them in different proportions and different ways, but it is the same people who pay them, and it is very desirable indeed that every local authority&mdash;in spending money or in receiving money or in asking for money, or in criticising the expenditure or non-expenditure of money on unemployment relief&mdash;should know that they pay for it; not merely the proportion which is collected in the form of rates, but the total sum.  The poorer counties, as I said, do not pay as much; the richer counties pay more. Let us take a district like the Borough of Cork.  The Borough of Cork is pretty well an average of the community from the point of view of the statistical position in relation to wealth. The Borough of Cork may take it that though they are directly paying only a couple of shillings, more or less, for the direct relief of unemployment, the total charge which rests on Cork at the present moment for dealing with its unemployment alone is equivalent to a rate of 14/7 in the £, and that they have to pay it.  I want them to understand that they pay it.  I think it is time that the local authorities freely recognised that.  As a matter of fact intelligent Deputies in this House know it perfectly well, but they say &ldquo;Do not tell us in that brutal fashion.&rdquo; Deputy Corish the other day spoke of the annoyance of having to collect this money.  He said it was quite easy for the Minister for Finance to juggle with millions here, but when he went down to his local authority and tried to collect a rate of 9d. in the £ it rather blew the gaff.  Deputy MacEntee shall collect the money; <Col N="1221" /> Deputy Corish shall spend it.  The central authority shall have the odium, the discomfort, of drawing in the money; the local authority or the local representative is to be the grand almoner who gives it out.  The people who really pay it, the local ratepayers, are to be kept from knowing that. That is exactly what is not going to happen.  Whether the contribution is large or whether it is small, the local authorities are going to tell their local ratepayers that they, the local authorities, are openly taxing them for the purpose of paying part of their share. That may not seem good politics coming on to a general election.  It would have been so much easier to pose as the kindly godfather who was distributing all that money, but democracy is a hard faith, and one of its first and cardinal principles is that the people shall understand that that which they enjoy they themselves, out of their own labour, their own production and their own sweat, shall pay for.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I will give the actual figures in relation to a number of municipalities.  I will show that the total amount of money which is being taxed for by the local authorities is relatively small compared to the portion of money for which those same people are being taxed by the central Government.  In the meantime, the first and chief thing is that it should be understood that this money which comes for the purpose of unemployment relief is money which is not collected here in Dublin, which is not invented here in Dublin, which is not provided merely by the Minister for Finance, which is not something that he is to be attacked for and for which he is the only person who taxes, but is money taken from the whole community, and rightly and properly taken.  If the people who are going to ask for grants of that kind and the people who are going to administer them are sound, hard democrats, they will recognise that they ought to stand over the facts. I think that this Budget will improve on discussion.  I am looking forward to hearing it denounced; I am looking forward to hearing it defended on the hustings.  I am perfectly satisfied <Col N="1222" /> that, whether Deputies opposite like it or not, the people will like it so much better than any Budget which has been produced by the Opposition that as long as grass grows and water runs they will never send back the Opposition to provide another Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, who has just sat down, in his effort to enliven the Budget debate propounded a number of interesting problems, none of which he answered.  He demonstrated I should say at great length that there are Government Departments engaged in publishing figures, and the only deduction to be drawn from the very elaborate statement of the Parliamentary Secretary is that no particular use can be made of those figures.  I will admit quite freely that it is not the first time he has made that particular plea in this House.  Again, I will pay him the compliment of saying that he demonstrated it on this particular occasion&mdash;by example&mdash;at some length and with full cogency.  Furthermore, he indicated that it was the policy of the Government to rob Peter to pay Paul, or, as he put it in more Parliamentary language&mdash;that always appeals to him&mdash;to go in for a redistribution of wealth.  He pointed out that, of course, he himself belonging to an older generation&mdash;I was sorry to hear him acknowledge that&mdash;does realise that this continual interference on the part of the Government is something which does not appeal to his&mdash;I can hardly now call them principles after this speech and after his talk for the last three or four years&mdash;shall I call them, old-established prejudices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He prefers that the money should be left in the hands of the private individual, because, as I say, these old prejudices that he seems to have shed not to-day, but shall I say from night to morning, in the year 1932, and to have shed very successfully, demand such a belief.  He must give up these old prejudices, because the rising generation will demand ever and ever more expenditure, ever and ever more taking by the Government from those that make money.  He said, of course, that <Col N="1223" /> the wisdom of such a course could only be judged in one way&mdash;who makes the best use of the money?  I gather that the old out-of-date prejudice of his inclines to the belief that the private individual will.  But having propounded that very interesting thesis in political philosophy he said unfortunately that it cannot be answered. Nobody can answer it, and it was the same way with the unemployment figures.  We get them.  We were told what they could not do, what they should not do, and what they were quite incapable of proving, but we had no indication of what precise use they were.  I was rather sorry for that because, as the Parliamentary Secretary put it very clearly, this is not the first occasion on which he has brought this matter before the House.  I remember having the pleasure of listening to him before, when he already brought it before the House. The important question did dawn on me then and still dawns on me now&mdash; what use does he suggest should be made of them?  Having brought them before the House on a previous occasion, I was hoping that this time he would indicate to us what use he thinks ought to be made of them.  I am sure he does not want them to remain in a purely negative atmosphere. Possibly he will utilise the further various opportunities to which he referred in order to enlighten us in that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the great optimism in the Parliamentary Secretary's words, if not in his manner, to-day, there are certain things in connection with the Budget statement, and with the statements of various Ministers, that are inclined to raise a certain element of despair so far as this country is concerned, one is the apparent incapacity, even now, of the Government to realise what is the condition in the country.  We see them still trying to deny the fact, the blatant fact known to everybody in the countryside, of the emigration that is taking place to Great Britain.  I am dealing now merely with what everybody in Kerry, at all events, knows.  The Government may not know about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> If not, I suggest it is their fault and the fault of members of their Party.  But I have heard one story, and one story uniformly, in that county.  I have not heard it challenged in that county.  I am confining myself now to the account given me by people who spoke to me on the matter, and they were unanimous on the serious amount of emigration to Great Britain that is going on there at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is useless, in the face of what everybody who has any knowledge of the country knows, for the Government to try to shut their eyes to that particular fact.  One of the elements that makes me almost despair of any good coming from this Government is their refusal to recognise the evil. How can we expect the Government to cope with a situation, to cope with what many people regard as a serious evil, if they start off by obstinately refusing to believe in its existence? I wish that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce would go down to country places, say, in Kerry, and tell the people there that there is no serious emigration; that they would go down to the farmers and tell them that they were never as well off as they are at present, and not content themselves with making statements of that kind here in the House; to tell the ordinary housewifes in town or country that there is no serious increase in the cost of living.  Surely these are things that ought to be within the knowledge of Ministers.  When the people down the country demand bread, to give them figures of the type that are published by the Government, the precise use of which has been so eloquently demonstrated by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;what good is that for the ordinary woman in the country who goes into the market once a week or once a fortnight, who knows perfectly well what she has to pay extra and what her cost of living has gone up by?  Of what use is it to her to be told that, after all, these are only the retail prices?  Is it suggested that she buys at any other price?  Now, every housewife, whether she lives in <Col N="1225" /> the town or country, knows of the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>I remember a couple of weeks ago speaking in a country district in Kerry and pointing out what the Government takes in the way of taxes on foodstuffs alone from the person, say, that earns or gets 10/- a week.  What was the comment I heard on that when I went down a week afterwards?  A report of my speech had appeared in the local newspapers.  The comment I heard was this: that the ordinary man and woman in the country were saying that I put the figure too low when I said that 2/6 was being taken in that way off the 10/-.  I justified myself by pointing out that I deliberately referred only to a number of articles: to three or four of the necessities of life.  Those people protested that they had to clothe themselves and to buy things for the household, and that when these were taken into account the taxes levied on them were not 2/6, but that the Government were taking considerably more than 2/6 off the 10/-.  That was the only criticism I heard on that portion of my speech.  In face of what the ordinary person knows, what is the use of pretending that the cost of living has not gone up?  How are the cost of living figures calculated?  Supposing a woman goes into a shop and she buys a couple of pairs of shoes for her children.  It may be that she pays the same price for them now as she paid before, but, as I pointed out here before, the question arises&mdash;very important for her&mdash;how often has she to buy shoes for them now during the year as compared with five years ago.  Everywhere you look the cost of living has gone up.  In the case of coal in the City of Dublin last year the Government had to give way to the clamour that was raised in regard to that particular matter; so now I can only look on this Budget as a very poor effort on their part, but still some effort, to meet the rising wrath of the people against the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I have listened to Ministers' speeches and have read them, and so far as I can gather from them their attitude is this: that there is no serious emigration problem, that the cost of living has really not gone up and that the <Col N="1226" /> Department of Industry and Commerce is ready to demonstrate that; that employment is on the upward bound, that the farmers were never better off than they are now.  I wonder what kind of a Government have we?  How can they be so completely out of touch with the realisties?  I wonder whether they realise that they are out of touch with the realities?</P>
    <P>I will admit that a number of factories have been set up in the country, some of them useful, some possibly with a very doubtful future before them.  That difference in value is inevitable perhaps in a scheme of the kind for which the Government have gone in.  But it will take many factories, and much larger and more successful factories than the Government have set up at tremendous cost to the consumer, to make good the loss that they have inflicted on the principal industry in the country.  A factory undoubtedly is a boon to a town.  Not merely the country, however, but the town is much harder hit by the destruction of the bigger factory, namely, the productivity of the countryside and the amount that the countryside is getting for what it is producing.  As we stand at present we ought to realise that, however useful these things may be, they will have to be examined in detail to see how useful each one is.  However useful they may be, they are a small thing compared with the big industry on which now, and for many years to come, any prosperity in this country has to be based.</P>
    <P>What is the good of the President, occasionally even a Minister, the Minister for Agriculture perhaps, acknowledging that the lot of the farmer at present is hard and that he has sympathy with him when, at the same time, we have Ministers getting up here and stating in the coldest possible blood, from typewritten sheets, that the country is remarkably well off, that it is prospering? To which class of statement is the unfortunate man in the countryside to pay attention?  To the lip-sympathy he gets from the President, and occasionally from one of his Ministers, or to the ignoring of the <Col N="1227" /> real situation as displayed in other statements of his Ministers?  Surely we must assume that the latter is the real thing, when we see the policy of the Government and the actions of the Government based on and justified by the alleged prosperity of the country?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance did give what is an explanation for what his, if possible, more literary colleague, the Minister for Finance, would call the buoyancy of the barometrical character of certain taxes.  There has undoubtedly been a lot of distribution&mdash; as the Parliamentary Secretary points out, there must be.  If you raise one way or another, by taxes or by concealed taxes, £10,000,000 extra, that does make money circulate, and there is nothing astonishing in the fact that for the time being it will produce a better yield in certain taxes.  But does it not dawn upon our literary Minister for Finance that there are various ways of sending up the barometer besides the natural atmospheric pressure, and that is what he and the Government are doing at present?  Naturally, under the conditions that prevail, there is a great deal of spending.  Apart altogether from the various other aspects of Government policy that lead to this spending, there is this immense amount of money that is being raised by taxation and &ldquo;distributed.&rdquo;  That will show itself undoubtedly.  Men are getting money that had not it before.  The question is, and I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary was going to tackle it, are you unduly taxing the productive side of your community?  Are you really doing anything to improve, to the extent it ought to be improved, the general productivity of the country? In so far as there has been an upward trend, slight though it is, in the last couple of years, how far has that been due to our policy, and not simply to an improved condition of a market that we despised, that we were anxious to get out of, that was dead and buried?</P>
    <P>There are things to which I thought the philosophic Parliamentary Secretary would turn his mind, but unfortunately he did not.  Signs of prosperity <Col N="1228" />&mdash;the capacity of the Government to levy more money!  But go down, as I said, to the country, see the condition of the people there, listen to them, see the way, even, in which farms are kept at present.  Are there signs of prosperity there?  Most of the people familiar with the country fail to see them.  What would, as I say, be calculated to drive the people to despair is the defence put up by members of the Government in support of their policy; a defence, as I said, that shows obstinacy on their part to face the real situation in any of the spheres I mentioned&mdash;the condition of the farming community, the question of employment, or the question of the cost of living.  In none of these things were they willing to face facts.  Neither were they in connection with the problem of emigration.  What hope can there be then for a country that is run by a Government which ignores these things?  What hope can the people have left to them?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of a somewhat lengthy statement when introducing the Budget&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary wants as much agreement as possible in this country and we can all agree that the statement was rather lengthy&mdash;referred to the amount of money handed over to Great Britain.  How much has the Government handed over?&mdash;taken from them at the point of the pistol, they say. They may call John Bull a highwayman or anything they like, but they have agreed with him as to the amount that is to be handed over, and the method of its being handed over.  That is what their various pacts have amounted to. What are they doing?  We have this Budget.  The Parliamentary Secretary clearly indicated the purpose of it; I think the Minister for Finance will agree that he indicated the purpose of it pretty clearly&mdash;an election Budget. He taunted the leader of the Opposition with the fact that he did not know how bad the Budget was from his point of view but that he would know it at the election.  Therefore, let us calmly and freely take this for what it is intended to be, an election Budget, a Budget meant to catch the votes of the people. That being so, I ask the Minister: Is that the best he can do as an election <Col N="1229" /> Budget?  Is he not aware that the Budget, from that point of view, has already flopped, that the people, as a result of their experience&mdash;I will admit that Opposition Deputies have been pointing it out for a number of years&mdash; are finding out the inevitable that has taken place in the rise in the cost of living as a result of Government policy? That was inevitable.  We could not hope to escape the experience of most other countries that adopted wild tariff policies.  But it was not because anybody pointed that out that the people are now aware there is such an increase in the cost of living.  It is because of their experience.  When you consider the extent of the rise in the cost of living or form some vague idea of how it has gone up, I ask you is this the kind of relief which can bring joy to the bosom of any consumer&mdash;a relief the amount of which is negligible in comparison with the burdens that the Government has placed on the country, negligible in comparison with the extent to which the cost of living has gone up on account of Government taxation and general Government policy.  No wonder the Budget, even for the purpose for which it was introduced, as we gathered from the Parliamentary Secretary, even for electioneering purposes, has failed to catch on.  How could it?</P>
    <P>We have here repeated a trick that the Government tried elsewhere.  They are trying it now in reference to the cost of living.  As a result of their general policy they brought farmers and the people engaged on the land to the verge of absolute ruin a couple of years ago by the economic war or, as the Minister for Finance put it, by winning the economic war because according to him it had been won at that time.  Then they stepped in when the farmers were at their last gasp and we had the Coal-Cattle Pact, giving a certain amount of oxygen, just enough to keep them alive.  That is all the Government did.  They helped the farmers to that extent only, just kept them alive.  What was the result?  A slight improvement in the price of cattle, and an improvement in the number that could be exported.  It was some relief to the farmers and just kept them alive.  Then we had the <Col N="1230" /> Ministers going around boasting of that slight improvement.  What did it amount to?  They had so depressed the condition of the farmers and people living on the land that even a slight alleviation was something, as it kept them alive.  As I stated a couple of months ago, it was the policy of a man who set a house on fire and boasted that at the eleventh hour he called out the fire brigade.</P>
    <P>The Government are doing the same thing so far as the cost of living is concerned.  In the course of their tenure of office they put burden after burden on the taxpayers and the consumers and they now take off something like £500,000 of the millions they put on.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary the people are so rejoiced at that that they are going to sweep any critic of the Government into political oblivion &ldquo;as long as grass grows and water runs,&rdquo; although I did not think that the Fianna Fáil Party approved of grass-growing.  They are going to do that by giving the paltry relief of £500,000 and keeping on all the other millions that they put on during their period of office.</P>
    <P>They whipped the unfortunate taxpayers and consumers so that even a slight diminution in the strength of the whipping would be regarded as a relief by them.  That is what this Budget stands for.  Is that all the Minister can do on the eve of an election to show that he is alive to the increased cost of living?  Is this miserable contribution the only one that he can make to enable the budget of the ordinary housekeeper to balance. The Minister can balance his Budget. The ordinary housekeeper finds it daily more difficult to do so.  And that is all he can do on the eve of an election. What are we to read from that?  That this Budget is no performance but it is merely a promise, and a promise like all the other promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Had a relief of this kind been introduced under other conditions when taxation was much lower, which would cut down expenditure, there might be something to make consumers and taxpayers joyful, but that a Government having put on some £6,000,000 in taxes, or if you include the concealed taxes, well over <Col N="1231" /> £10,000,000, can come and boast of relief to the extent of £500,000 that they can give, that is quite typical of them and of their failure to deal with what is gradually becoming one of the most menacing factors in the situation &mdash;the increased cost of living.  We had a dissertation from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I thought as he had the Official Debates before him he might have dealt with or tried to refute some figures of the prices of various articles which Deputy Mulcahy gave last week. Instead of that we had general principles of government and taxation, but these general principles of government enunciated by him do not bring down the cost of living or the cost of practically every article bought by the consumer. If there are people&mdash;and I gathered from the Minister that there are, and the Parliamentary Secretary certainly thinks there are&mdash;grateful for this Budget, I wonder what they expect from a Government.  If the ordinary person, whether his income is 10/- £2 or £3 a week, sees an immense relief in this Budget I wonder what he was expecting in the way of Fianna Fáil policy dealing with the cost of living.  Does the Government still maintain or will they tell the ordinary consumer, the ordinary housekeeper, that there is no such increase, that it is a mere figment of the brains of the Opposition?  The Opposition could talk on that matter for a long time, and their talking would not have much effect if the facts did not support them.  But it is because everybody in the country town, a lot of people in the cities and everybody in the countryside knows perfectly well what they have to pay extra for things, that anything the Opposition may say will have effect.  It is only because the people feel the pinch, the merciless grip of the pincers, that anything that we can say about the cost of living can get over the people.  They know it.  There may be a certain number better-off now than they were before.  I know that the policy of the Government does mean easy money, and large sums of money, for some people, inevitably perhaps as a result of the policy they pursue, but it certainly means a thinner time for many others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The whole policy, I am afraid, has the effect of hitting the producer.  We are now, as regards housing, the furnishing of houses and Government expenditure in various directions, still at the point of spending money.  The meeting of the obligations in many cases is not yet at hand.  Is it strange then that there should be in certain taxes, especially when we consider the certain type of help given by the Government, an increased yield?  We have seen it in other countries where for six, seven or eight or more years they had a period of apparent prosperity and advance in the spending of money and which are now face to face in many cases with a much more serious problem.</P>
    <P>The situation is serious from another point of view.  I gather from the various speeches made by the President, at various portions of his career, and from various speeches made by the Ministers, that they do not believe in their hearts, although they sometimes seem to indulge in a recantation, in developing an export agricultural trade.  I cannot understand&mdash;I cannot say the policy&mdash;the various attitudes taken up by the Government on any other basis but that.  They talk of world depression and give that as an excuse for what the country is suffering and for the losses the country has suffered, but in that connection I should like to point out two things. There is recovery in the world at present and we are not getting our fair share or anything like our fair share of it.  I have heard supporters of the Government give world prices as the excuse and the explanation of the increased cost of living.  It is only a very slight excuse because the Government policy is mainly responsible, but supposing we take that for the moment, how are we prepared, or are we prepared at all, to meet that improved condition in the world markets?  There will possibly be an opportunity of discussing that more fully on another occasion but I cannot see anything that promises well for the future in the condition as revealed by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance or, indeed, by the other Ministers, or in the slight relief <Col N="1233" /> now offered that was confessed by the Parliamentary Secretary to be election bait.  If this is the best which the Party well known for its political&mdash; in the baser sense of the word&mdash; acumen on the eve of an election can offer it is a rather poor lookout for the future of the country if that policy is to continue.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House long but I felt that I should say something in view of the Minister's statements.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That improvement is not felt in my county and I tell the Minister that things are very bad in my county and neighbouring counties. I have come across cases of poverty within the past three weeks that would make the hair stand on his head.  I came across one case of a labouring man with five children who had constant work at £1 a week and who had to keep himself.  He fell sick on last Monday fortnight and did not get his insurance up to last Sunday.  His children went into a neighbour's house in a state of starvation and three labouring men had to go out and make a collection to keep these people from hunger.  I know also of the case of a farmer's wife whose husband died three months ago.  His land is set and when the doctor visited that house, where there are three children, during the illness of the wife and children, he had to go back to the town and buy food there and bring it back to them.  I know several other cases of that sort.  In County Westmeath there is worse want than there is in any part of Cork or the West of Ireland, and if the Minister cares to come down there I will bring him to ten, 20 or 30 houses where there is nothing but want and starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself have had to put my hand in my pocket along with my neighbours to keep people there from starvation. The other day I had a letter <Col N="1234" /> from a poor woman near Finea.  Her husband became ill last November, and for six months he was getting 15/- a week.  Now he is getting 7/6, and that poor woman sent me a letter stating that she could not possibly exist on 7/6 and feed her husband and crippled daughter.  All she asks me to get is money that would buy a stone of flour, a stone of meal, a pound of butter, six pints of milk, sugar and tea, and, as far as I remember, the amount totalled about 17/-.  That poor woman beseeched me to get home help for her to get these things.  There are hundreds of cases like that through the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary dragged in the question of prosperity in the country, and said that the Government was going to win the election.  Let me tell him that they are not going to win the election.  I know that from the high cost of living within the past fortnight.  That is reacting on the Government, and it is bound to do so. I am telling the Minister plain facts. There is no use talking of millions; that is no use to the people of the country.  Go into any bank manager in the town of Mullingar and he will tell you that you could count on the fingers of one hand the number of farmers who had any money in the bank.  All the others are up to their eyes in debt.  And why?  In 1934, when you had no quota for cattle, the small farmer with three or four cattle to sell always had a debt of £20 or £30 with the local shopkeeper.  He always relied on his three or four cattle to pay that debt, but with the policy of the Government he found that he did not get £20 or £30 for the cattle he sold.  He scarcely realised £10, and he kept that in order to keep the wolf from the door.  He still has that debt with the shopkeeper, and the same applies also to the man with an overdraft in the bank, who might have 50 or 60 cattle.  He, too, always thought his cattle would clear off his overdraft.  In 1934 he was left with the same 50 or 60 cattle, but he has that overdraft as well as the poor man with £20 or £30 owing to a shopkeeper. These poor people cannot go to the shops because of these debts, <Col N="1235" /> due to the operation of the Government's policy.  A priest in Moate told me the other day that the number of people looking to him for charity has increased within the last three weeks or a month.  All this shows the position of the people.  Neither I nor many other farmers think it is good policy to balance the Budget on the strength of the funded arrears of annuities.  That is not good business, because I do not see how these arrears are to be paid.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Deputy who has just sat down, one would think that we were responsible for the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act.

I want to show the sort of argument which has been advanced, time after time, in this debate in attack upon the Government and upon this Budget.  Here is the position as admitted by the Deputy: that, in pursuance of the law as it has existed here since, I think, the State was established, this unfortunate woman and this unfortunate man found themselves compelled to live upon 7/6 per week; due to the present high cost of living, the Deputy says that the situation of these unfortunate people has been rendered much more grievous <Col N="1236" /> than it was.

      <P>The earliest year for which I have figures in this connection is 1926.  I should like to have in my hand, when I come to deal with the statement by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, the earlier figures, because the position would have been more grievous in 1923, 1924 and 1925 than it was in 1926.  In 1926, the cost-of-living index stood at 189.  The cost-of-living index for the past quarter of this year was 167.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the Deputy or Deputy O'Sullivan may say when in opposition, the cost-of-living index figures are compiled on a perfectly reliable basis.  When the Government came into office, one of the first things it did was to set up an independent committee to inquire into the fairness of the basis upon which this cost-of-living index was compiled and its reliability.  I cannot recall the names of the members of that committee now, but they included that of a very eminent representative of the Labour Party who had devoted a considerable amount of time and attention to this question of the cost-of-living indices, as well as the names of eminent statisticians. The substance of the committee's report was that our cost-of-living index figure was perfectly reliable as showing the trend of the cost-of-living. That cost-of-living index shows that the cost of living was much higher in 1926 than it is to-day.  Certainly, it was much higher in 1923 when our predecessors reduced the rates of pension granted to old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass now to Deputy O'Sullivan's point&mdash;that the increased provision which we were making for old age pensions, and the allowances and concessions we have made to those in poor circumstances who had attained <Col N="1237" /> the age of 70, had been more than wiped out by the increase which has taken place recently in the cost-of-living. The fact is, as I have shown, that, whereas in the first quarter of 1932 the cost-of-living index stood at 162 and in the April quarter at 159, to-day it is standing at 167.  There has, undoubtedly, been some increase, but we all know that depression was steadily and rapidly increasing during 1932; that agricultural prices and prices of primary products&mdash;and, indeed, of manufactured products, for that matter&mdash;were rapidly falling until, ultimately, in 1933-34 they had fallen to an entirely unremunerative level, a level so low that producers were going out of production.  The endeavours of politicians and economists the wide world over, since this depression struck us, have been directed towards increasing the general price level, particularly in regard to all these things which enter into everyday competition &mdash;agricultural commodities, food stuffs and the primary products generally.</P>
    <P>Let us say that this is the concerted aim of statesmen, economists and politicians the wide world over.  The people to-day who tell us we cannot do this or that we cannot do that, and who tell us then that we are dependent upon our neighbours at the other side of the sea, are criticising us because we could not stand up against the world. That has been the general thesis of the whole criticism that has been directed against us during the debate on this Budget.  I would not mind even if arguments such as that had been based upon sound premises or upon factual proof.  Deputy J. M. O'Sullivan said there was a general recovery in the world at present and that we were not getting our share of it.  In saying that he merely repeated what his colleague, Deputy Dillon, said last Thursday as reported in column 969, volume 66, of the Official Debates.  He said: &ldquo;I say now, as I have said before, that while every other country in the world is growing richer, this country grows poorer.&rdquo;  Those of us who have listened to Deputy Dillon speaking here for a long time now&mdash; over five years&mdash;know that the Deputy often speaks without the book.  The <Col N="1238" /> Deputy seems to make a hobby of teaching other people their own business. In the course of his speech amongst other things he said that Java tea will bear 1/2d.  The Deputy's hobby is to teach other people their business. Now, on the very day that Deputy Dillon made that statement, a number of tea merchants indicated that the consumers of Java tea would not have to bear any share of the non-preferential tariff, that so far as the 2d. a lb. which was imposed upon those extra-Commonwealth teas, teas which do not enjoy the preference, so far as that is concerned the duty will be borne not by the tea consumers of this country but by the tea producers and the tea growers of Java and elsewhere.  Deputy Dillon gets up and makes a statement here completely at variance with what is said by those whose business it is to know who will bear that 2d. a lb. duty.  I am going to repeat the Deputy's own words: &ldquo;I say now, what I have said before, that while every other country in the world is growing richer, this country grows poorer.&rdquo;  Against that statement I bring the evidence of people whose occupation and profession it is to study economic situations not merely in Great Britain and this country but the world over.  Here is what the Copenhagen correspondent of <i>The Statist</i> says in reference to conditions in Denmark, in an article which appeared in that journal on the 3rd April, 1937.  The article is headed &ldquo;Denmark's Economic Difficulties.&rdquo;  I do not propose to read it all, but amongst other things this well-informed student of the economic position of Denmark says, in regard to that country:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No wonder that the unemployment figure which is almost everywhere else on the decline is in Denmark following a curve considerably higher than a year ago.  By the end of January there were about 26,000 more people out of work than at the corresponding date last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Least satisfactory of all is the plight of agriculture, which accounts on the average for four-fifths of Danish exports.  A few weeks ago the National Council of the Danish <Col N="1239" /> Farmers' Association, representing some 104,000 farmers, sent the Prime Minister a petition in which the present situation of Danish agriculture was described as the most serious for many generations... The low price level for agricultural produce combined with rising prices for fodder and a bad harvest, has compelled many of the small holders in particular to use up their reserves.  What makes matters worse is the heavy long-term indebtedness of Danish agriculture (due largely to its advanced mechanisation), the total of which is estimated at 4,000,000,000 kroner.  The annual interest of about 150,000,000 kroner imposes on Danish farmers, a burden which many of them under present conditions are unable to bear.  Hence the growing discontent and repeated cases of rioting in rural districts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Denmark is a country which is very often held up to us as a model for our imitation, as an ideal for our farmers, and we heard last year and in the preceding years about the wonderful inroads which Danish agriculturists were making upon the British market. If everything we have heard here about the favourable position of Denmark in the British market be true, if all the golden stories be true, if all the sorrowful stories and the sorrowful admonitions which have been addressed to us about the opportunities which we were losing and which the Danes were availing of were true, it is hard to see how the conditions which are the conditions which are described in this reliable and reputable journal can be the conditions which can possibly exist there.  I do not doubt the truth of the statement which I have read.  The Copenhagen correspondent of <i>The Statist</i> has no reason and no motive to misrepresent the position in Denmark. Therefore, I think the statement I have read is true.  If his statement be true, then all the things we have heard about the opportunities which we were denying to our farmers during the past two or three years are quite obviously unfounded.  They were simply a mirage.  These bright, golden opportunities do not exist anywhere except in the minds of Opposition <Col N="1240" /> speakers.  So far as there were losses and so far as we are concerned, our farmers do not seem to be any worse in regard to the British market, notwithstanding the fact that the economic dispute has continued and is apparently continuing.  Notwithstanding that our farmers are no worse off than the Danish farmers who had no political or economic dispute whatever with the British Government.  But apart from that, this article does show that that statement of Deputy Dillon and the statement of Deputy O'Sullivan are without any foundation whatsoever, at any rate so far as Denmark is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is not the only evidence from reputable sources which show these statements of the Opposition Deputies are not true.  The statement that has been repeated here so often during the debate on the Budget is not true&mdash; namely that while every other country in the world is growing richer, this country grows poorer, or that there is a widespread recovery in the world at present.  I quote now from another article in <i>The Statist.</i>  That article is headed &ldquo;Changes in International Trade.&rdquo;  The writer of this article points out that the general value of international trade is still far below the pre-depression level, and has not yet reached the level of 1932.  The article has this statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A closer analysis, however, shows that the recovery is by no means universal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the writer goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that the volume of trade did not expand proportionately if at all.  Germany, and probably Italy too, had forcibly to restrict imports in order to reconcile the increased costs of foreign raw material, with limited supplies of foreign exchange.  In Holland and Switzerland, typical examples of the smaller States of Europe, which have not been able yet to share in the benefits of economic recovery, imports were lower last year than in 1934 or 1935.  The same applies to the three largest countries of Asia, India, China and Japan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So we see that, according to those whose business it is to study these <Col N="1241" /> matters and be well informed in regard to them, the one thing that is clear to-day is that the world at present in general is not enjoying anything like improved economic conditions, and that it is not true to say that most other countries are growing richer while we are growing poorer.  That is one of the false premises upon which a criticism of this Budget has been based.</P>
    <P>All of us know that, in fact, there is a highly artificial prosperity being enjoyed in one or two countries at the present moment.  One is Great Britain and the other is the United States.  In regard to Great Britain, we all know why it is that trade seems to be booming there.  The very fact that those who are responsible for British policy decide to spend huge sums upon rearmament, and that in consequence of that expenditure conditions improve and prices rise in this country, surely is a complete disproof of all the statements and all the propaganda for which the Opposition have been responsible during the years 1932 to 1935. When the British Government was retrenching, when British manufacturers were going out of production, when wages were being scaled down in Great Britain and unemployment was on the increase in Great Britain, then our farmers, dependent upon that market, naturally and automatically suffered.  There was nothing that we could do that time to improve the position for them.  It has been said that we were being shut out of that market, that we were being shut out of a market which did not exist.</P>

      <P>I was saying that the writer of the article in <i>The Statist</i> lived in Denmark and that the description which he has given of the position of the Danish agriculturist shows that he was as badly off as the Irish agriculturist and that the Dane, just like the Irishman, suffered from one thing and one thing only, and that was a decline in the purchasing power of his best and possibly, as in our case, only customer.  And we were blamed for that.  On occasions I quoted figures here which showed that the consumption of meat in Great Britain had declined by almost 16 per cent. per head during the three or four years of the depression.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows and I suppose even Deputy Fagan knows, that if there is a restriction of purchasing power people are not able to buy so much as they at one time were. If the people who formerly supplied them continue to produce at the rate they were formerly accustomed to, and the demand falls off and purchasing power decreases, then prices must fall.  Everybody is going to try to get out of a surplus stock at the lowest possible cost.  Like everybody, he tries to cut his losses.  Often people who are dealing with bookmakers are compelled to cut their losses, sometimes at a very heavy discount.  It does not matter where you are, however, if you are up against that situation you have to reduce prices in order to get out quicker, and that happened in Denmark, just as it happened here, and just as British manufacturers, in regard to manufactured products and industrial products, had to cut their prices, so, too, our farmers were compelled, with all the farmers the world over reducing prices, to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Until this year, we have been blamed because the trend of agricultural prices was downwards, but the Opposition, which has no difficulty in putting on a blue shirt one day and taking it off the next, no difficulty in prating about Fascism one year and preaching about democracy the next year, no difficulty in calling itself Cumann na nGaedheal one year and calling itself Fine Gael on another occasion, has likewise no difficulty in turning round now, like a vane on a weather-cock, and condemning the present Government now because agricultural prices, upon which the cost of living is based, happen at the present moment to be rising in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Here, again, is the position.  We were blamed, as I said, when agricultural prices were falling, and now we are being blamed when they are rising, and the people who come here, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, and condemn us because the cost of living is going up, who talk here of the people in this great city of 500,000 population being affected grievously by the rising cost of living, are the very people who will go down the country and tell the farmers that, under the Fianna Fáil Government, they are not getting enough for their butter, their beet or for their cattle.  That is the sort of opposition we have.  They are not even consistent in their inconsistencies. They talk here about the rising cost of living and go down and tell the farmers that they are not getting enough for their products.  Naturally, if the prices of agricultural products go up in the country, the cost must go up in the towns also.  However, I would not mind that.  We have been condemned during the past five years because, in order to help the agricultural population when agricultural prices were falling, we adopted the policy or device of subsidising certain products and making subventions in one form or another to help the agricultural producer.  Admittedly, we granted subsidies to a considerable amount.  We have subsidised the production of beet and the manufacture of sugar in this country, and we have subsidised the production of creamery butter, so that we have paid away almost £6,500,000 in subventions and subsidies to that industry.  We have been condemned for doing that, but while we are being condemned for doing that, the Leader of the Opposition, on Friday last, answered this question in a way in which the Dáil will hear for itself in a moment.  I am quoting from column 1162, volume 66, of the Debates of last Friday. Deputy Cosgrave was speaking and I said to him: &ldquo;That is to say, the Deputy wants to subsidise pig production?&rdquo; And Deputy Cosgrave <Col N="1245" /> answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  We have been condemned because we have subsidised butter production, but now we are being told that we ought to subsidise pig production and bacon production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is enough money to spend on calf skins and there ought to be money there which would enable the Bacon and Pigs Board to make up the difference between, let us say, the factory price and the price which would compensate the farmer for raising the stuff.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I then said: &ldquo;That is to say, the Deputy wants to subsidise pig production?&rdquo; And Deputy Cosgrave answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I then went on to comment on that, and I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I thought that subsidisation and all that sort of thing was anathema to the Deputy's Party?  We have been subsidising butter production and we have been attacked for it; we have been subsidising wheat production and we have been at-attacked for it; we have been subsidising sugar production and we have been attacked for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the Deputy wants to subsidise pig production.  One of the principal points in the Deputy's speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I not go on to say that the Pigs and Bacon Act made for a general level of prices which would be remunerative, and that when the price was low the people should have an increase in the price, and when it goes high you could give a lower price than the high price and make it up to the fund?  The provision was to keep a general level of prices, and if the market price of a pig was not sufficient, the funds would make it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When we brought in a measure which would enable us to subsidise butter production, in 1932, the Deputy split his Party on it, because he went into the Lobby, and one of his principal fuglemen&mdash;one of the Deputies most frequently put up to make the Opposition case in regard to these agricultural questions, Deputy Bennett&mdash;went into the Lobby against Deputy Cosgrave, and Deputy Cosgrave's Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tariff duty of 3d. in the £ on that butter that the consumer is paying here.  The Minister will not advert to that.  Three-pence a lb. on every lb. of butter puts it into England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of paying an inflated price for pigs except to put them into England at a lower price, that is, the world market price in England&mdash;that is to say, as the Deputy has told me, to make up the difference between, let us say, the factory price and the price which would compensate the farmer for raising the stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On what is the factory price based?  In general, it is for the exportable surplus; it is what it will fetch in the English market, and if it happens to be unremunerative to the farmers, the Deputy's suggestion is that we should tax our domestic consumers in order to sell bacon cheaply in the British market.  We have done that in the matter of butter&mdash;quite frankly because it was necessary to keep the industry going&mdash;and now <Col N="1248" /> Deputy Cosgrave, who voted against that, urges us to do it in regard to bacon.  As I have said, let them be at least consistent in their inconsistency. If they now believe in export bounties and subsidies, let them apply them through the whole gamut; but if they do, let them not come in here and talk to us about raising the cost of living, because if the cost of living has risen in this country, it has risen for one reason, and for one reason only, and that is because of the measures which the world depression compelled us to take in order to help the agricultural community.</P>

We have been listening to tales about the price of bread, the price of wheat and of flour.

A very depressing picture has been painted as to the future of this country, if these conditions continue to prevail. There will be a general election shortly. I suppose we shall be on opposite hustings.  Deputy Cosgrave will be depicting, with all that command of figurative language which characterises himself and Deputy O'Higgins, the situation of the people.  They will be telling the people about their sorrowful <Col N="1249" /> plight.  They will be pointing to the depression which Fianna Fáil policy has brought on them.

Not merely are we going to have sugar beet subsidised, but that subsidy is going to be heavier still and we are going to subsidise the production of pigs and bacon as well.  Change the Government! But we are going to have the same old policy.  That is the alternative. It is not going to be a change of policy; it is not going to be a change of personalities.  I do not think that the people who suffered in this country during the period 1922-1932 are simply going to vote against us in order that Deputy Cosgrave may come back and fill once again his old seat here on the Government Benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked forward to this discussion with a considerable amount of interest for a considerable time because, as the House is aware, a very large and very significant experiment has been in process of operation in the country, in relation to the method of employing men and the method of using money which the State provides for the temporary and artificial employment of people who are in a state of distress for one reason or another.  I was very anxious to get authoritatively from the House, from the 152 Deputies who have had experience of what is occurring in the country, their reactions to that system.  I wanted to know from their knowledge, as distinct from the knowledge which we had through Departmental sources, exactly what was happening.  What had happened was obviously something which was capable of being treated controversially. During the summer of the past year an experiment was made covering, I think, about £20,000 or £30,000, in five or six counties for the purpose of trying this thing out, to see whether or not the difficulties which we envisaged as possible in relation to it would occur, and whether or not there were some other incalculable snags of which we had not knowledge. These experiments were carried on throughout the summer.  They were brought very fully to the knowledge of the Dáil and the public and every means was taken for the purpose of eliciting unfavourable comment.  No such unfavourable comment was produced. The actual troubles which were envisaged did not occur and no troubles, other than those which were envisaged, turned up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> We had, as a result of the tests which were made in all these countries, very careful inquiries made from all those who carried out the schemes and all those who were in contact with them. It had been suggested that it was impossible administratively to employ men on a system of this kind without complications; that surveyors, local authorities, gangers and men would not understand the method and that it would break down.  There was no truth in that.  We left, as far as possible, the organisation of these things to those who were carrying out the experiments in the hope that some of them would break down and that in the process of breaking down, the difficulties we had to guard against would be revealed.  They were uniformly and unquestionably successful from an administrative point of view.  We investigated the question of the degree in which efficiency could be attained under this method during the experimental period.  We have reports from all the responsible authorities who carried out those schemes.  Those reports, with one single exception, are absolutely satisfactory and the reasons why that other was unsatisfactory have been investigated, ascertained and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Having failed to meet any trouble by trying those things in the country districts, we then decided to experiment in what we regarded as the most difficult area of all, the Borough of Dublin.  I may say perfectly frankly that we were looking for trouble.  We wanted to find out, during the experimental, the laboratory period, the worst that could happen.  When we decided to experiment on the register of a capital city like Dublin&mdash;on to which register, as you know, men of the very best and some not of the very best tend to gravitate&mdash;we thought and we hoped that we would find it.  I am glad to say we were successful.  From the time that scheme started, from the very first day, everything possible was done to impede and to break up the scheme.  We had public meetings at lunch-time and at 5 o'clock.  We had all sorts of outsiders doing everything humanly possible to aggravate and bedevil the position.  That was the <Col N="1252" /> first time that anything of that kind had occured.  We also&mdash;and we were glad to hear it&mdash;had the information that this was the first of all the schemes which had been put forward in which the men were not delivering the goods.  We calculated that under those circumstances everything that it was humanly possible to find out to the detriment of such a system would be found out.  We had regular returns showing the proportion of men who were doing a full day's work, who were doing a half day's work, and who were not doing work of any particular value.  Those figures were kept.  In the meantime, we investigated every possible objection or grievance that could be drawn up under those methods, and dealt with it, until we were satisfied that everything which was humanly possible to meet the difficulties had been done.</P>
    <P>We then gave the instruction&mdash;which is the fundamental instruction in relation to rotation work&mdash;that every man on that job should deliver the goods or go.  All I can tell you is that those men reacted to discipline and to organisation in a manner which was entirely creditable.  The end of that particular experiment was that that gang was working as well as any gang I know working on relief schemes under any conditions.  When it was notified that the work would be shut down, I think somewhere about 94 per cent. of the men sent in a petition for its continuance under those conditions. When that additional grant was exhausted a further petition to continue that scheme came from those men.  At the same time, investigations through an outside authority were made into the social reactions in relation to those men who were employed, as a result of having been employed on part-time work of that character over a considerable period, as distinct from living on the dole. The report was in every degree and in every particular satisfactory.  The whole home life and the individual life of those men had reacted in a manner which was entirely favourable.  With that background behind us this year we decided to adopt, in relation to the large scheme of employment works throughout the country, a modified <Col N="1253" /> system of rotation.  The system of rotation under which we worked during the summer was a strict mathematical rotation&mdash;that is to say, as far as we could work it out every man got in wages an amount of money which was equal to or slightly greater than his unemployment assistance, plus beef vouchers, plus 40 per cent., and during the winter we decided to adopt a modified system.  As a result of that, some 20 counties which had no experience of this system, some thousands of gangs, some 50,000 men at one particular moment, with probably a total of 75,000 to 80,000 men altogether, have had experience of working under this system.</P>
    <P>It was for the purpose of knowing what had been the reaction in that matter that I was anxious to meet the House and hear what was to be said. I wanted to hear the worst possible and the strongest case that could possibly be stated against rotation. I wanted that to be founded on experience.  We have tried to make such a case.  Quite frankly, we have failed to make a case such as would of itself be convincing.  My own desire and my own wish would have been to open a discussion of this kind by a statement from inside, the very worst that could possibly be said, founded upon a sound experience of this system.  Personally, I have not been able to formulate a case which seemed to me to be reasonably and sufficiently convincing.  For that reason, I have had to wait in the hope that someone else would do it.</P>
    <P>While there has been a good deal of denunciation of the rotation system from four or five people, there has been no attack upon it.  I want to make that quite clear; there has been no attack upon the rotation system.  We have been told that it is abominable; we have been told that it is horrible. We have been told various things of that kind, but no one has come down to brass tacks&mdash;except one man&mdash;in attacking it as a system.  Deputy Davin, with a courage which was far greater than his discretion, stated that the part-time employment of men was demoralising to those men.  He was the only person who came down to the <Col N="1254" /> attack, and his courage, as I said, was greater than his wisdom.  He was followed by two Deputies of his own Party, Deputy Corish and Deputy Everett, and both of them immediately got out from under that story.  They wanted to make it perfectly clear that neither of them stood for the doctrine that it was demoralising.  Neither of them stood for the idea that the dole was preferable to part-time employment. Apart from that, there has been no attack on rotation by saying that, intrinsically, there was anything wrong with it.</P>
    <P>What has developed here is two schools of thought.  The first demands full time employment for all men at full trade union rates, all the year around, on works of full economic value, placed near their homes.  In addition, there has been a demand for employment on those terms for all men prepared to register, whether unemployment assistance men or not, as well as for widely distributed schemes of public works on the basis of their usefulness, independent of the poverty condition of the area.  Now, that is not an attack on rotation.  That is simply a demand for an unlimited amount of money to be used on unemployment schemes.  Against that, we have put as our standard economic expenditure, as far as possible, on the most useful works available with the limited sum of money provided by the Oireachtas, in such a manner as to relieve the maximum amount of distress, by a wide distribution, in proportion to the individual needs of the poor. Now, these are the two schools that have been in conflict, and not the rotational system.  Unless the Dáil is prepared to vote a sum of money for several years in succession to the order of about £15,000,000 a year, the needs of even the unemployment assistance registrants cannot be met under the standard of the first school, and the needs of the others could not be met in money or works at all.</P>
    <P>Some form of rationing of money and works is inevitable.  Unless, therefore, someone in this House is prepared to contend for an unlimited amount of money over a considerable period of time the principle of rationing, or <Col N="1255" /> whatever you call it, of the amount which is available must be and is universally accepted.  Rotation, whether with or without unemployment assistance in intervals, daily or weekly, must be universally accepted as a solution. Our purpose is to convert the largest possible proportion of the present unemployment assistance payments, plus any further provision for the relief of distress, into wages for useful work at standard rates of wages.</P>
    <P>The unemployment assistance and unemployment schemes together form the employment fund.  The total is calculated on the actual estimated transfer of funds from unemployment assistance to the Employment Vote. We have previously been providing sporadic sums for unemployment relief, and, in addition to that, we were providing a sum of about £1,500,000 for unemployment assistance. What is happening now is that these two funds are being put together, and they are regarded as the State's provision for the purpose of dealing with unemployment and distress.  What happens is not, that when a man on the unemployment assistance register is employed, there is any saving to the Exchequer, but that the money expended in the dole is transferred to the other fund, and our ideal is to see that the Unemployment Assistance Fund itself is reduced to the smallest limits; that the largest possible amount of that money is transferred to the other funds.</P>
    <P>In doing that I am certainly no friend of the Minister for Finance, whoever else I may be a friend of. The cheapest of all ways to deal with the unemployment problem in this country is to ignore it.  The cheapest of all ways to ignore it is by paying unemployment assistance.  You can double and treble unemployment assistance to everybody who is now receiving it, and give it to a lot of people who are not receiving it, at a much less charge to the Exchequer than by any method of employing people.  It is purely from the point of view of its social reactions that we prefer, and feel that we are bound, to attack the other line.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> The relief schemes are justified in themselves on two grounds.  The first is on the public work done, and, secondly, the social benefits to labour rather than payment for idleness.  They cannot be justified on budgetary grounds.  Now, I think at least six statements in relation to rotation have been put up during this discussion. Rather than seem to ignore them, I had better set them out.  Deputy Davin said that it was an attempt to smash the trade unions.  He also stated that it was demoralising for the individual.  That disappeared on the testimony of Deputy Everett. Neither Deputy Corish nor Deputy Everett was prepared to allow the Labour Party to lie under the onus of having said, or suggested, that part-time employment was less desirable than the dole.  There was a suggestion that our intention was to save the money of the Minister for Finance by robbing the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  Deputy Norton made the extraordinary statement that it was intended to intimidate the Agricultural Wages Board, and Deputy Keyes said that men were forced unwillingly to work.  I have dealt with the question of demoralisation and with the question of saving from the Unemployment Assistance Fund. It was also stated that in the opinion of competent engineers it was inefficient.</P>
    <P>Now, let us take the question of trade unionism.  When this scheme was first adopted there were rumblings in the shades, and we were told that the trade union authorities had their eyes on us.  I said I would be very glad indeed if they would have their eyes on me at a little closer quarters. Their representatives came to see me. I gave them every fact and figure that was in my possession in relation to the whole scheme.  I asked for comment, favourable or unfavourable.  I asked for suggestions of any sort or kind for its amendment.  I asked for any information which would show that this was an attack on trade unionism.  They went away and made no comment and, as far as I know, they have made no comment since, except the statement that we have <Col N="1257" /> received here from Deputy Davin.  We are paying the standard local rates in all places.  Minor relief wages were fixed independent of rotation.  I have had the closest possible contact with all sorts of people during the progress of the scheme, and up to the present no suggestion has been made to me that there was any attack, except by one Deputy.  I told him I was extremely glad to hear that such a question had arisen; that I would be very glad indeed if the complaint, to the extent to which there was a complaint, could be formulated, and that it would be dealt with.  I have heard nothing since.  In other words, so far as I know, there is nothing whatever in that charge.</P>
    <P>Now I come to efficiency.  Deputy Keyes, Deputy Anthony and Deputy Pattison, all three, have told me that eminent engineers, none of whom have been named, have condemned this system.  They have appealed to me, as an engineer who believes in and understands efficiency, to say that efficiency under such a system is impossible. Foreign cows have long horns; unnamed engineers may be very eminent, but no engineer, with the exception of one, has given a report unfavourable to this.  With that exception, the whole of them have been favourable in their opinion.  But I do not need to go to engineers; I do not need to go to my own experience, which is now very considerable. I have seen hundreds of these schemes; I have seen, literally, tens of thousands of men working on these schemes, and I know the result which is being delivered from them.</P>
    <P>But I will turn to Deputy Corish and Deputy Everett as witnesses. What Deputy Corish says rather sums up pretty well what my own opinion would be in the matter.  As reported in column 903 of the Official Reports, Deputy Corish said: &ldquo;I am talking now of the efficiency with which the work is being carried out in spite of the handicap with which the schemes were confronted when the local authorities and the Board of Works tried at first to put them into operation.&rdquo; He was amazed at the efficiency obtained. As reported in column 904, <Col N="1258" /> he said: &ldquo;I should like to say that the amount of efficiency that we have seen in connection with these schemes is extraordinary.&rdquo; Deputy Everett, as reported in column 914, said: &ldquo;Notwithstanding all the drawbacks, notwithstanding all the difficulties, notwithstanding the fact that the men have got no alternative but to accept, I say there is good value given in the circumstances.  I say that in urban areas you are getting 100 per cent. return at the present time.  In the rural areas you may not be getting it on the minor relief schemes.&rdquo;  Speaking as one who has seen, as I have told you, literally thousands of men engaged on minor relief schemes in the areas in the West, I say that the efficiency in the minor relief schemes is higher than in the urban areas.  I have actually had Deputies who have condemned the system coming to me and asking that schemes should be done under this system that the Local Government Department wanted to do on full time and contract work; and I have had such schemes carried out on rotation at their request.  The truth of the matter is that efficiency in this, as in all matters, is a question of the ability of the men carrying out the schemes.  It depends on the organisation.  With good gangers, with good engineers, with a proper lay-out of the work, you can get, under this system, as high an efficiency as it is possible to get on this class of work with the same personnel under any condition whatever.</P>
    <P>It may be thought that it is confined to works of an elementary character. During the summer I was very anxious to know what were the limits to which a scheme of this kind could be applied, having regard to the fact that there was a large capital State expenditure, on lines which were not of an elementary character.  I asked a certain engineer to what work he could apply it.  That man had had experience of it.  He said he could do any work which was done in the ordinary way by a local authority.  Greatly daring, I said: &ldquo;Can you do a public health work?&rdquo;  He said he could.  I said: &ldquo;How much more will it cost to do a public health work under this <Col N="1259" /> system?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I will do it at the contract price.&rdquo;  As a result of that, the particular public health work &mdash;a rather difficult sewerage scheme, containing a good deal of technical difficulty&mdash;which had had to be put aside last year on account of shortage of funds&mdash;was brought forward as an experiment.  The men on that scheme were employed on a strict mathematical rotation over the whole period of work.  The unemployment register of that town, and for three miles around it, over 5/-, was abolished for a period of about ten months.  Men were employed for anything from six to 16 days in four weeks.  There were only two men on the whole job who were not on rotation and off the register&mdash; the foreman and the pipe layer.  That job has been completed.  It has been completed in a thoroughly successful technical manner, and has been completed under the estimate.  I speak now not merely as an engineer anxious to see efficient work done; I speak as an administrator who has felt that the responsibility of his work required that he should be able to speak with full personal knowledge in relation to what is going on; and I am satisfied that, given good organisation, good engineers and good gangers, you can get out of this system, with ordinary labour, on every class of work to which it is possible to apply it, thoroughly efficient results.</P>
    <P>The next statement is that this was intended to intimidate the Agricultural Wages Board.  Imagination of that kind is a disaster.  The relief wages in every case were above the average agricultural wages of the district. My personal desire is to see agricultural wages rise.  I have never understood how anyone could, upon any ethical grounds, defend the idea that the skilled agricultural labourer should be paid less than any other skilled labourer.  I calculate that I could learn to do bricklaying very comfortably in a month, good enough to do the job.  There are lots of trades of that kind that I could do. There are a good many of them that I could do at one time or another, but I do not pretend to think that I could <Col N="1260" /> be turned into a trained agricultural labourer, or that I would employ any amateur agricultural labourer to do some of the work the skilled agricultural labourers do.  I am speaking now as one who thoroughly and deeply respects the profession of the agricultural labourer, and regards him as a skilled man.  I would like to see the level of his labour raised.  I have no intention of doing anything&mdash;and there is nothing in this scheme to do it&mdash; which will not help in that respect as quickly as possible.  Agricultural labourers supply certain economic conditions over which I have no control.  The suggestion that I or anyone else invented these schemes for the purpose of intimidating the Agricultural Wages Board is a diseased idea.  These are some of the pictures that were drawn by Deputies: &ldquo;Nothing has happened in my lifetime that has created such a feeling of indignation, and rightful indignation, as this rotational scheme.&rdquo;  That is Deputy Keyes.  Deputy Morrissey was a bit more gentle, describing it as &ldquo;the most fundamentally unsound scheme of that shape ever started.&rdquo; Deputy Pattison's words were: &ldquo;An abominable and a reactionary policy.&rdquo; If strong language and weak arguments were enough, the thing would disappear.  Deputy Norton's words were: &ldquo;It was fiendish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries to see what has been the effect on the lives of the men and the universal testimony is that it has been entirely favourable. Here is a report which was sent to me, signed by the parish priest and spiritual director, the president, the honorary treasurer, the vice-president and the whole of the committee of a Conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in relation to one of these schemes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, the members of the local Conference, beg leave to convey to you some impressions on the expenditure of the grant of £250 recently conceded by you in your bounty, for the relief of distress here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Demands on our funds (which are petty) have become much fewer; there are practically no unemployed in or about the town; we can notice <Col N="1261" /> an air of contentment where there was distress, and of comfortable clothing where often there were rags. We are happy to discover an added air of happiness and frugal comfort in the homes we visit.  This is also the experience of another organisation. The relief to our own funds enables us also to spread our attention to poor country folk, and to procure for these seed potatoes.  So your generous donation has brought a blessing on the community.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic aspects of the grant are beyond our province but, in common with all the people of this area, we rejoice to see a splendid town park rapidly coming into shape, thus fulfilling a long-felt need in the athletic and cultural life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Personally I do not recognise anything fiendish in an effort of that character.  I am perfectly satisfied that the universal testimony and experience of those who have lived with the job will be in its favour.  It was also stated: &ldquo;The men are forced unwillingly to work.&rdquo;  I have a return of those employed in the different counties.  On the 13th February, 46,146, were employed, viz.: Carlow, 385; Cavan, 1,626; Clare, 1,390; Cork, 2,567; Donegal, 6,749; Dublin, 1,122; Galway East, 378; Galway West, 2,295; Kerry, North, 5,685; Kerry, South, 2,654; Kildare, 1,414; Kilkenny, 768; Laoighis, 367; Leitrim, 1,459; Limerick, 1,139; Longford, 1,002; Louth, 596, Mayo, 6,824; Meath, 829; Monaghan, 443; Offaly, 526; Roscommon, 797; Sligo, 1,737; Tipperary, North Riding, 444; Tipperary, South Riding, 831; Waterford, 673; Westmeath, 751; Wexford, 430; Wicklow, 465.  The maximum numbers were in Kerry, 8,339; Galway, 2,673; Donegal, 6,749; Mayo, 6,824.  There you have four open quotas of men who were working on the schemes at the same time.  Let any man who thinks that I have forced these men unwillingly to work go and gather in one of these quotas, and he will go home without his deposit.  I have seen the men working.  I have seen them working willingly and gladly, men who were proud to feel that every penny they got was earned.  This <Col N="1262" /> House is not in a position to apologise to any one of these men, nor am I in the position of being in any way embarrassed in meeting any of them. I spoke to hundreds of them, and I know that they did not want the dole if they could get the money in the form of wages.  I am perfectly satisfied that they were not merely willing, but anxious to continue to earn their money instead of receiving it in the form in which they were receiving it.</P>
    <P>Certain detailed objections have been put up which have nothing whatever to do with rotation, but all of which have a certain amount of significance. There is distance, there is the question of unsuitable people being sent, and provision for wet weather.  There was a suggestion that schemes are left in the pigeon holes of the Department undone, and that schemes which might have been completed one year take several years.  There was complaint that there have been delays in payment and that there has been a burden on the boards of assistance.  There were complaints that high scale unemployment assistance men have been employed; that men on a low scale and single men have not been reached; that non-unemployment assistance men have not been included in some small areas. There were also complaints of the non-expenditure of money voted and about individual earnings being too low. There was a demand that useful works in non-poverty areas should be done, that summer drainage should be done, and that drainage generally should be tackled from this Vote.  Another complaint was that local authorities were contributing when they should not have to do so.  There was an amazing complaint about deductions for stamps. Two other amazing complaints were that men had been ill-treated by the exchange officers, and that there was political preference and corruption shown.  These are two charges with which, on our record, we do not need to deal.</P>
    <P>I am taking these up <i>seriatim</i> because I want to feel that when we are finished with this debate we have met in the gate all the objections which can be urged.  Firstly, as to the <Col N="1263" /> distance men have to travel, the map which is hung up outside ought to be the best answer to that.  There have been about 3,000 schemes done in order to get the degree of localisation which we have.  There is a limit beyond which we cannot go.  The total number of men who have been sent out by the labour exchanges to walk excessive distances is not, in my opinion, one quarter of one per cent. of the whole lot.  A case of that kind will loom up very large.  I have made a great deal of effort to get hold of a series of these cases, but all I have ever been able to get at a time is one. We do recognise that it is humanly impossible for the labour exchanges to avoid occasionally sending men distances which are much longer than they ought to travel.  These things will happen, but we are making administrative arrangements to see that so far as possible they do not suffer by that.  I think that, between now and next year, the arrangements which are being made will be watertight to the extent that no man will be harmed in that way.</P>
    <P>The same story is told of watchmakers and cobblers being sent out on minor relief schemes.  Such things will occur, and nothing we can do will prevent them.  The number of cases is negligible and arrangements are being made to deal with the matter. With regard to short time, due to wet weather, arrangements are provided whereby the men, if they cannot work on a particular day because of wet weather, get another day, but sometimes that is not easy to do, partly due to the fact that surveyors and those running these schemes have cooperated with us to the extent that they have put on the maximum number of men.  You can imagine that if in a scheme on which, say, 100 men are engaged, due to a wet day, it was necessary to put the whole of the other gang on, the scheme would be absolutely tied up and hampered.  There are certain cases in which you could not work 200 men.  To the extent to which we can deal with that, we will, and, while this year has been an extremely bad year from the point of view of an experiment of this character, <Col N="1264" /> I think we are over our difficulties now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin complained that some schemes were not completed in the year, but were carried over three or four years.  We have discussed that here before.  The question arises as between two schemes, one of which is a very good scheme which may require a larger amount than is available for the district for the year, and, in the interest of doing the best scheme, we sometimes divide it up over two or three years.  As a matter of fact, I have had a great deal more pressure in the direction of doing schemes by compartments than I have to the contrary.  We can only use the best discretion we can in the matter.</P>
    <P>We come now to what I regard as the real difficulty of the whole thing&mdash; delays in payment.  There is no question that that has been the real snag of the position.  The local authorities are accustomed to paying their men after an interval of two weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That refers only to the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know.  In the other cases it has not arisen.  In the case of relief schemes in the districts, the delay has been considerable.  That, of course, is a difficulty which arises only at the beginning of a scheme and which departs as soon as the scheme is in operation.  We are having a conference in my office as between the different Departments concerned to see what can be done to reduce that delay.  In certain cases, we have already got rid of the delay completely, but there was undoubtedly that difficulty, that where a man is in regular employment, or goes into regular employment, his credit immediately comes into existence and he can operate.  Sometimes that is not done in relation to relief schemes and to the extent to which that difficulty exists I will see that it is remedied as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are sometimes worried about the fact that they have left a scheme in my office for a couple of years and it is not done.  They generally put it that &ldquo;for one reason or another it is not done,&rdquo; but they do not, I think, really believe that there <Col N="1265" /> are any such reasons.  The reasons why schemes are not done are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Limited public utility (the number of families benefiting too few);</P>
    <P>(2)  Refusal by land owners whose lands are affected to sign consent forms;</P>
    <P>(3)  Claims for compensation by land holders for lands or other rights surrendered;</P>
    <P>(4)  Inspection discloses that the work is already in relatively good repair;</P>
    <P>(5)  Work would involve expenditure considered to be out of proportion to its public utility or the cost would be altogether excessive for the employment needs of the area even if the work were done by instalments;</P>
    <P>(6)  Works unsuitable for execution during winter months.  Summer drainage works are sanctioned in areas in which sufficient unemployment assistance recipients are available during the operation of the Employment Period Order;</P>
    <P>(7)  Drainage works situation in a drainage district or proposed drainage district;</P>
    <P>(8)  Drainage works which in our opinion would cause flooding further down stream;</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of trouble, as a matter of fact, as a result of drainage schemes we have done.  In every case, whether there is ground for it or not, there is a demand, founded upon flooding further down, for further works.  The other reasons are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(9)  Works that are maintained by other public authorities;</P>
    <P>(10)  Insufficient unemployment assistance men in the electoral division or within convenient distance;</P>
    <P>(11)  More suitable available work from the point of view of their utility and location in relation to other selected works in the area.</P>
    <P>In future, therefore, when Deputies say that &ldquo;for one reason or another works are not done,&rdquo; they will understand that there are at least 11 good reasons.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that in some cases a <Col N="1266" /> burden has been thrown on local boards of assistance, due to delays in payment. Again, such cases have occured. One occurred in Wicklow and two occurred in Cork.  Probably the number that have occurred altogether could be counted on the fingers of one's hand, but none of them represents a serious condition.  As one has been dealt with here to some extent in detail&mdash;the case in the area of the South Cork Board of Assistance&mdash;I think it better that the House should have the facts.  There were three cases in this case in which payments were asked for by relief workers from the local board of assistance.  The first was one in which the men had gone on strike, and it is worth while getting to the bottom of this strike. When this matter was brought up at the borough council, a certain representative said: &ldquo;The men are striking against rotation.&rdquo;  The city manager said: &ldquo;The men have no objection to rotation,&rdquo; and the leader of the men said: &ldquo;The men have no objection to rotation.&rdquo;  The strike was on something entirely different.  They struck over the method of paying wages, which might have arisen on any scheme.</P>
    <P>The second case was a case where, due to the intervention of the Easter holidays&mdash;the Good Friday and the Easter Monday on which the men could not work&mdash;the scheme was thrown out of gear.  As a result of that, a special instruction will, undoubtedly, be issued next year in relation to any scheme operating over holiday periods.  Here is the letter of the city manager in regard to the third case:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the week ended 10th April, one of the road gangs worked Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday&mdash;that is, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th.  The second gang only worked on the 9th and 10th&mdash;that is, Friday and Saturday.  They expressed the view they should not be paid until four days were completed and claimed home assistance on the ground they had not received any wages that week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The claim was refused by the home assistance authorities.  I do not think <Col N="1267" /> I need go any further than that. We do appreciate any help the home assistance authorities have been able to give us.  We shall put as little strain on them in the future as we did in the past, and we shall see that they are not burdened to any extent that is avoidable.  The next objection is that the men on the high scale of unemployment assistance are being employed to the detriment of the others.  The suggestion is that this is done in order to save money to the Minister for Finance.  As a matter of fact, it is done for the reason&mdash;which, I think, will be universally accepted&mdash;that those first to be relieved, where the whole of the people cannot be employed, must be the people in the greatest necessity. I do not think that anyone is going to question that.</P>
    <P>In the Unemployment Assistance Act there was set up statutory machinery for ascertaining, not merely who were in a state of distress, but their exact measure of distress, relative to one another, rendered in terms of money.  That test is the unemployment assistance scale they receive and, in employing the first men on the highest scale of unemployment assistance, we employ those who have a statutory right, ascertained under the law, to be regarded as the people in the greatest state of necessity. That the low-scale men are not reached, I recognise as a definite defect.  Until a system of rotation is adopted which will enable us to deal with the whole of the men on the register in proportion to their needs, as measured by their unemployment assistance scales plus some addition, I shall regard our task as not being finished.  My anxiety is to do everything I possibly can in that matter.  The difficulty is that we have to work under the Act as it is at present.  Men have to be employed for a certain period or they can take money out of both funds &mdash;the Employment Fund and the Unemployment Assistance Fund&mdash;which would be undesirable.  As Deputies know, a new Bill is in process of incubation&mdash;it has already had its First Reading&mdash;which will deal with <Col N="1268" /> these difficulties and which, we hope, will give us a system in which there will be none of these inequalities which are now necessarily present under the rule of thumb.</P>
    <P>It is complained that non-unemployment assistance men are not included. If I were to include the whole of the unemployment assistance men, it would mean that I would have to divide the money even further than I am doing now.  If, in addition, we had to include non-unemployment assistance men, the position would be more difficult, especially as we have no means of ascertaining non-unemployment assistance men. in the same way as we have of ascertaining unemployment assistance men. The unemployment assistance men come off the register in a mathematical and entirely impersonal manner. Neither I nor, I think, any other man had to be asked by any one of the 50,000 men employed this year to get him a job.  They are now perfectly free and independent, and they show it.  There was a time when you got a job through knowing the ganger or through a county councillor, or through some local official.  I think I may say for every county councillor, every local official and everybody who has had to do with that kind of work, that they are glad and thankful to be rid of it and to have it handed over in such a way that it can be dealt with impersonally. The actual position now is that I can be called to account in this House for every single one of these 50,000 men by name.  I should have to justify his employment or non-employment, and no preference, no act of anybody outside can affect that except the fact that the regulation, as laid down, does or does not apply.  The men have now become perfectly free and independent agents, earning money on work to which they are sent in an entirely impersonal and impartial way. While I myself should like to deal with men who are not on the unemployment assistance register and who can be shown to be in necessity, I see great difficulties in the matter.  We do meet it to this degree: we have the two standards, the standard of the total number of unemployment assistance men in an electoral area and the poverty map which gives the characteristic of every one of the electoral <Col N="1269" /> divisions in the Free State.  Where the unemployment assistance map and the poverty map contradict each other &mdash;in other words, where an area can be shown to have a low agricultural valuation per head of the population even though there are an insufficient number of unemployment assistance men&mdash; we do our best to meet that difficulty. That, at the moment, is the best, so far as I can see, that can be done.</P>
    <P>There is another objection which, I think, is a legitimate one, to the carrying out of our scheme.  That is, that certain areas which just happen not to have the quota of men which would entitle them to a scheme are excluded. It has been suggested by Deputy Smith that these areas will be in perpetuity in the position that they cannot get schemes.  The administrative difficulties of reaching upon these areas is going to be very great, but we do feel there is something in that case.  I think it ought to be met, but the administrative difficulties will be very considerable.</P>
    <P>It has been complained that we did not expend the whole of the money voted this year.  We have lifted the expenditure this year to about two and a half times what it was last year, and we have laid down the machinery by which we can spend in this financial year £2,500,000.  It is possible to start up a whole lot of works in a hurry if you do not mind what happens to the works and if you do not mind where the money goes or what is done with it. We had just to choose ourselves whether or not we could take those precautions which would enable us to set up a machine which would do the work properly in the future or whether we should get whatever kudos would belong to coming and telling the Dáil that we had spent the whole of the money without regard to those considerations. We have chosen to take the other course.</P>
    <P>Remember we are not doing the whole of these works ourselves.  We have to work not merely through different Departments, but through hundreds of local authorities.  They have to be consulted.  They have to get their schemes together, and there is the whole difficulty which is involved <Col N="1270" /> in hundreds of schemes.  However, we have reached the position that next year we will be able more effectively to do these things.  I will say this in advance.  If the Dáil in its wisdom is prepared to spend, say, six, five, or four million pounds, or whatever it was, on unemployment relief schemes of this kind, if we are given due notice that the money will be available by a certain time, and if we are given the staff and resources which would enable us to deal with it, then we will set up machinery to deal with it.  The machinery to deal with it is as economic as is humanly possible.  But I will not take responsibility for suddenly expanding a scheme of this kind, acting through all sorts of channels over which I have only partial control, unless I can do it under such circumstances as I can tell the Dáil that the money which has been given into my hands in trust for the poor&mdash;and that is the main consideration&mdash;has been spent economically for their benefit.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the earnings are too low.  Now let us face that.  I am asked whether I think 10/-, 16/-, 21/-, or 30/- or something of that kind is enough for a man on which to live. I think that is not the question that arises on this Vote.  That is the question which arises when the Minister decides that he will provide a certain amount of money.  On this Vote we are simply discussing its administration. If you can induce the Minister for Finance to give us, say, £5,000,000, well and good.  I will promise that every penny of that which comes into my possession will be evenly and honestly distributed in relation to the necessity of the people for which it is voted.  But I cannot get out of £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 more than is in them.  If we are to deal with 146,000 people who were on the unemployment register on the 3rd February last year, and deal with the whole of them, then the amount of money which is going to come to any of them is definitely limited.  What I have tried to do is to see that the whole of the money which we have to deal with does come to them.  We have set up machinery.  Next year we will spend on those people as near as possible <Col N="1271" /> the whole of that money.  If then the Dáil in its wisdom thinks it is not sufficient, it is for the Dáil to change the amount of money which is available. My responsibility is to see that whatever I do get is honestly and fairly spent.</P>
    <P>A big plea has been put up that useful work should be done in non-poverty areas.  I do not need to say at the moment that I cannot do that out of the employment fund.  The function of that fund is to deal with poverty areas.  But it is strongly held by a good many Deputies on all sides of the House that there are works of development, as distinct from works of poverty and the relief of distress, which ought to be attended to.  But it certainly ought to be done out of a separate fund, whether it is administered by the same people or not; the two classes of work should not be confused. So far as the employment fund is concerned, the position ought to be maintained by Deputies that they can criticise the distribution of the money and the question of the fairness of its distribution.  If you mix that up with the question of works which are desirable on other grounds, then you are getting into the area of opinion and preference and the rest of it.  While I would have no objection to handling a fund which was for development, I would strongly object to the two funds being mixed together.</P>
    <P>Summer drainage took place last year to the extent of about £30,000.  I think it is generally recognised that we can in drainage work get perhaps two or three times as much value in the summer as in the winter.  These works in which there is employment content are going on this year in every area, and wherever there is a proper scheme submitted we will try to carry it on. I hope with the programme that is actually in process of intensive organisation at the present moment, to see a start at this work by the beginning of this month.  To the Dáil that is not a definite promise, but I will undertake to do the best possible in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish and other Deputies raised the question of the local contributions to any of these schemes.  I <Col N="1272" /> am entirely in favour of local contribution, however small; even though it were practically negligible in amount I would enforce local contributions in every case I possibly could. I would do so on high State grounds, though it is the most inconvenient thing that could possibly happen in relation to my Department.  If we did not have these local contributions one of the big difficulties in administration would disappear.  I would simply have to make out a mathematical statement of relief plans available and send them out, and the only answer I would get would be a request to double the amounts.  Delay is due to the fact that the local authorities think they can get away with something by a little bit of pressure here and there.  Local authorities in thinking that a little bit of pressure might help their areas, cause a great many delays in the carrying through of these schemes.  If the local authorities can get into their heads that we do not send out these grants for consideration, that we do not send out the allocations of their contributions without at least as full consideration as possible it might save a lot of trouble to them and to us. What we are doing at the present moment is to divide the total fund available, in proportion to the necessity of each county and each area in each county.  This year we have tried to carry that one step further.</P>
    <P>In every individual area we will divide the money that belongs to that area amongst every necessitous individual there in proportion to his necessities. That decides how the money is to be sent out.  The method of deciding the contribution is exactly the opposite. We decide the amount each district will contribute in proportion to its capacity to bear the burden, in other words, in proportion to its incapacity to deal with its unemployed.  As a result, the contributions from the local authorities vary from 50 per cent. to 10 per cent. Every contribution of that kind is calculated on that basis, and it can be justified up to the hilt on that basis. That brings us down to the question that the local authorities can have no complaint as to the amount they are asked to contribute.  It is only a question <Col N="1273" /> whether they should be asked at all.  And why should they not be asked?  Why should they not be reminded that it is they who are paying for the relief scheme, not us?  It is not the Dáil that is paying for the relief scheme; it is not the Minister for Finance and it is not some abstraction called the central taxpayer.  Exactly the same people are taxed as are rated. When the local authority gets from the Government a grant of £20,000 subject to their paying a contribution of £4,000, it is time they knew, and it is time that the local representatives had the courage to tell them so, that not merely are the local authorities paying the £4,000 but they are paying the £16,000 as well.  It is merely a matter of convenience where that money was collected.</P>
    <P>I have given a case here to-day. Take, for example, the Borough of Cork.  So far as I know it is, roughly speaking, the average from an unemployment assistance point of view that we have in regard to the country generally.  The total amount of money which is spent on unemployment assistance and on relief schemes in the City of Cork for last year was equivalent to 14/7 in the £ on the rates.  The corporation is paying somewhere about 2/- or 2/6 of that, knowingly and openly; but they are really paying the whole lot, and it is time they recognised it.  I have said before that democracy is a hard faith, and the principal doctrine of it is that those who are democrats in relation to their people shall tell them the facts of the case.  It is for local officials and local authorities to know that they are getting nothing for nothing from the central authority, and it is good that they should be openly taxed for a part of that money in order that they may fully understand it.  I will admit it is inconvenient. Deputy Corish spoke of the annoyance of it.  In the course of the finance debate he said it was all very well and very easy for the Minister for Finance to juggle with millions, but it was a very different thing when a local authority had to put a tax of 9d. on the rates.  I do not see why all the discomfort of raising taxation <Col N="1274" /> should be here.  I do not think the fact that it is inconvenient and annoying is any excuse for not facing up to the situation.  Deputy Corish said that the amount the State provided was infinitesimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>By comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not infinitesimal by comparison.  The inconvenience of having to tax people yourselves instead of saying that somebody else taxed them is enormous.  It is very easy to say that the Minister for Finance raises the taxes and Deputy Corish spends them, or the Mayor of Wexford spends them, or the local authority spends them; but, as a matter of fact, in consenting to their being raised by the Minister for Finance every local representative is consenting to the equivalent of a rating on his own district to the same amount.  I am very often, in fact throughout the whole of this debate I am torn between love and duty.  I have to be inexorably just because I cannot be generous to one man without being definitely unjust to another; unless there is an amount of money which is more than sufficient justly to deal with the proposition, any unnecessary generosity to any individual or any district is a wrong.  I would be very pleased indeed to be able to say to a local authority: &ldquo;Here is all the money and you will have no trouble and no contribution whatsoever&rdquo;; but I do not think it is sound public policy to do so and for that reason I do not advocate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One objection that struck me as rather peculiar was in regard to the deduction for stamps.  I always understood stamps were part of the machinery of government by which the State to some extent looked after people who were not able fully to look after themselves.  Take unemployment insurance, for instance.  The employed man pays a certain amount of money, his employer and the State also paying a certain amount.  In the case of national health, a man pays a certain amount of money and the employer and the State pay a certain amount.  In the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, I think the stamps <Col N="1275" /> for those started at the beginning of this month.  The individual pays a certain amount and the State pays, and the result is that for every stamp for which a man pays he gets probably three times that value.  If you go on the principle that that is a benefit until a man is in receipt of wages, and then you deduct it, and if you say he is not getting anything for it, then anybody who believes that should have voted against unemployment assistance and against the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts and the other Acts.  The fact that we were all in favour of them means that we recognised that a man gets in a stamp a great deal more than he pays for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody as virtuous as yourself is responsible for it.  There has been one objection to the rotation system, the present scheme of unemployment works.  It did not come from any Deputy in the House; it came from a priest in the West of Ireland.  I only quote it because it seems to be fundamentally important. Complaint has been made that, due to the time over which relief schemes are now operating in certain districts such as Western Donegal, Western Galway, Mayo, and places of that kind, where the men are very largely small cottier farmers and to some extent fishermen as well, the actual work which the men ought to be doing &mdash;the fundamentally important work of looking after farms&mdash;is being neglected. I got complaints from very responsible people who would not make them without some justification. I do believe that is significant, and that we will have to go into the case carefully to inquire in regard to the system of agriculture and the actual <Col N="1276" /> condition of the different people on different portions of the seaboard.  We shall have to inquire as to the period in which employment on relief schemes, even for three days, shall not be allowed to interfere with the conditions affecting their ordinary, everyday life.  I think that will vary very much in districts.  In some of the eastern districts conditions may be entirely different to the western districts.</P>
      <P>It may mean that in certain districts we may abandon relief works over portion of the winter period, and we may transfer the money which belonged to that particular area for the winter to the summer period, and even if it meant employing the people in the period of the year which, normally, we have not regarded as an employment period, I think that would be a right and proper thing to do if, in fact, the present period of employment is interfering with preparations of that character.  I am only warning the Dáil in that matter because the question may come up as to how it is that in certain areas we are carrying on work at periods in which we would not do it in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before to the House, I do very greatly value, from a purely administrative point of view, and from the point of view of its convenience and everything else, as an administrative asset, the fact that there has been built up in the House a confidence in the administration of this Department. I mean, it is quite possible here at the present moment, I am glad to say, for a man to get up and attack anything we do.  They may have the lowest possible opinion of any particular and individual act of ours and of our policy and administration, but the fact that it is recognised that in everything we do we are doing the one thing in intention, and that is the carrying out of the trust that the Dáil gave us in relation to this money, to see that it goes for the benefit of the poor, is a very good thing.  It is for that reason that sometimes I explain things with more fullness, and perhaps use a patience and moderation, which may be foreign to my ordinary outlook, in a discussion of this <Col N="1277" /> character.  In other words, in this particular case I regard it as being for the purpose of seeing that good work is done.</P>
    <P>We have come to the end of this particular year in which we have administered £1,500,000.  We propose, as I hope, to administer a considerably larger amount next year.  We will follow on the lines on which we are going, and we will accept from any Deputy in the House any criticism and any suggestion of any sort or kind, however made or in whatever manner it is made, with the intention of regarding it as constructive.  What I mean is that, in the course of this debate, certain descriptive phrases have been used, such as &ldquo;abominable,&rdquo;&ldquo;dreadful,&rdquo; and so on.  I regard myself as bound to ignore the whole of them and to look behind any statement of that kind for what might be constructive.  I regard any heat that may be shown in it as a generous heat&mdash;in other words, I regard it as a resentment at what they regard as injustice&mdash;in the hope that we may between us hammer out a better system.  All I can say is that that spirit will continue in relation to this Department and that that cooperation which we have received, which we have asked for, and which we value, we are going to ask for and receive again.</P>
    <P>The work of the Department, in my opinion, at the present moment has reached the limits of the capacity of its existing organisation.  If the Dáil wants more work out of this Department, if it wants a higher perfection in it in the sense of distribution, if it wants to ensure against the odd incidents of the kind which come out in debate here, then that means that the organisation will have to be extended, not merely here, but in the country.  We have put upon the local authorities this year the onus of carrying out thousands of schemes.  I am amazed at the way they have responded to it.  They have been asked to do it under a new system, a system in which 20 out of 26 counties had no experience. Thousands of raw gangers have been asked to administer this scheme, and I would not have been a bit surprised, <Col N="1278" /> nor would I have been a bit apologetic, if it had broken down in two or three places.  All I can say is that they have responded to that. Speaking now of the administrative side of our Department, to which I am grateful and of which I am proud, they have done their work splendidly, as I think I said before; but if we are going to put more of a load on them, then we will require that they shall be helped in numbers.  I could not improve on the administrative staff which I have got, both in the country, in the field, and at headquarters. If the Dáil requires the things which the Dáil has required in the complaints they have put up to me, they will have to face the fact, and they will have to back the Department in seeing that it has adequate staffs and resources to do its work.</P>

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is possible that the Parliamentary Secretary has already dealt with the point, but I am sorry that I was not able to be here to-day before this, as I had to attend a funeral.  I do not know whether he dealt with the question of single men or not.  Perhaps he did?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I can answer it now.  The point is that married men and single men, as such, are not recognised under this scheme at all.  Married men and single men are measured under the Unemployment Assistance Act on the ground of their dependency, and we work from that register.  We have taken a census, as a matter of fact, in different places. The Deputy will remember that we used to have 25 per cent., single men, but we found that in the rural areas that 25 per cent. is considerably exceeded under the Act.  Apparently, it does not work as well in the urban <Col N="1279" /> areas.  However, we have behind us now a year of experience.  Up to the present, we have been so fully engaged in doing the jobs that we have not had time to go into certain other matters, but all the criticisms and all the objections that Deputies have had to urge in relation to the scheme, and all the experience we have had in this year, will be used to improve for next year.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to answer this question, or perhaps it is unfair to ask him at this stage.  The local bodies have just received intimation that a certain amount of money will be available very soon, and they have been asked to put up a rate.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to say whether that is the full amount they will get for the financial year ending March of next year or not? It may be unfair of me to expect him to reply at this stage.</P>

      <P>As far as this year's grant is concerned, yes.  In connection with this grant, ordinarily speaking, we have run on the principle of carrying on by a large re-vote.  This year, to meet the objection that we were putting down moneys that we were not spending, we have decided to run practically to a dead end, and that means that well before the end of the period a new arrangement will have to be made, and intimations based on that will have to be sent out in advance.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has dealt with quite a large number of questions, but there was one lacuna missing with which I should have liked him to deal.  He said nothing about the unemployment of women, or what was being done for them, and I hope he will extend the scope of his activities in that connection and that he will include in his schemes the taking of their needs into consideration.  Perhaps some scheme might be considered on the lines adopted by the London County Council to give them some sort of training. For that purpose there must be cooperation between the different Departments.</P>

    <P>Is beag iad na h-atharruithe ar na Fó-Mhírchinn D (2) go D (4) agus ní gá mórán do rá ina dtaoibh.

Leis an maisín seo beidh an Taisc Ionad Margaíochta in ann riachtanaisí an mhargaidh do chóimhlíonadh níos fearr.  Ceaptar go dtiocfaidh as an socrú san go ndíolfar níos mó earraí leis na sean-chuistiméirí agus go meallfai cuistiméirí nua chughainn chomh maith, rud a chuirfeadh ar chumas na Roinne tuillimh níos mó a thabhairt dos na h-oibrithe.

Athruigheann an t-árdú praghais sin, dréir an sóirt snáith, ó 20% i gcásanna áirithe go dtí 50% i gcásanna eile.

Táthar chun an tionnscal so do bhunú ag Cuan Éilighe in aice Béil an Mhuirthid, agus tosnófar air i bhFóghmhair na bliana so.  Tá socruithe á ndéanamh chun seanstáisiún na nGárdaí Cósta do chur in oireamhaint agus do ghléasadh i gceart mar mhonarchan, agus idir an dá linn, tá 35 buachaillí agus 15 cailíní ag fáil teagaisc anois ins na Scoileanna Gairm-Oidis i mBéal an Mhuirthid ionnus go mbeidís réidh chun obair do dhéanamh sa mhonarchan.

    <P>Is lughaide £3,585 an Fó-Mhírcheann E (3) i gcóir ceilpe etc., agus sé is mó fé ndear an laghdú san ná gan soláthar bheith ann i mbliana ach i gcóir 1,000 tonna ceilpe do cheannach i gcoinne 2,500 tonna ar deineadh soláthar na chóir anuraidh.  Ní misde a rá ná fuarthas ach timcheall an ceathramhadh chuid den mhéid sin.  Is cúis áithmhéala dhom a rá nár tháinig mórán athrú ó shoin ar mhargadh an íoghdain agus gur beag deallramh atá ann go mbeidh aon fheabhas ar an sgéal an bhliain seo nó an bhliain seo chughainn.  Is beag toradh a bhí ar na h-iarrachtaí a deineadh chun margaí oireamhnacha d'fháil do'n cheilp agus do'n bhfeamainn, ach táthar ag súil go dtiocfaidh rud éigin maith as an obair atá idir lámhaibh ag Comhairle na Taighdeachta Thionnscail. Ceapann an Roinn nach féidir go leanfaí de'n phraghas atá ar íoghdan fé láthair agus nach foláir nó go dtiocfaidh an gnáth-luach thar nais <Col N="1285" /> air luath nó mall, rud a h-árdóchadh go mór luach na ceilpe.  Is mar gheall air sin atá an Roinn ad' iarraidh an tionnscal ceilpe do choimeád beó agus bhí an t-ádh orra margadh i gcóir méid áirithe dí, timcheall 1,000 tonna sa bhliadhain, d'fháil chun a h-úsáide in ionad íoghdaoid potáis ins na h-abhair beatha do bheithidheacha. Chun soláthairt don mhargadh seo, tá socruithe ag an Roinn praghas do thabhairt dos na ceilpeadóirí ab' ionann nach mór le luach díolacháin an earra déanta tar éis a bhaint as na Fó-chostaisí is gá ar iomchar agus ar stórlannú, ar mheilt agus ar chriatharú, agus ar mhálaí, rud a fhágfadh ar an Stát na bárr-mhuirireacha ar fad a bhainfeadh leis an ngnó do sheasamh. Caithtear a admháil, gídh gur mó go mór an praghas atá le h-íoc i mbliana ar an gceilp ná an praghas a d'fhéadfaí thairisgint uirri mar adhar déanta íoghdain, nach leór é chun luach saothair réasúnta do thabhairt dos na ceilpeadóirí ag féachaint dos na coingheallacha fé na n-oibrighid siad ag cnuasach agus ag dóghadh na feamainne.  An praghas atá á thairisgint, ámh, sé an praghas is mó is cóir, dar leis an Roinn, do thabhairt uirri agus an sgéal mar atá. Tá an praghas san 20% níos mó ná an praghas a tugadh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is lughaide £760 an Fó-Mhírcheann E.4 i gcóir Carraigín.  Baineann an soláthar ar fad le Cairrgín Bídh.  Is bocht an margadh atá ann fé láthair don earra so agus sé fé ndear é, is dócha, ná an trioblóid a bhaineas le n-á ullamhú i gcóir an bhúird agus gur leasc leis an mbean-an-tighe ghnóthach mórán ama do chaitheamh leis fhaid a bhíonn biadhanna níosa so-ullamhuithe lo fáil.  Tá méid an tsoláthair bunuithe, ámh, ar dhíolacháin agus riachtanaisí na bliana roimhe, agus ní féidir a rá ina thaoibh ach go dtabharfar dá bhárr beagán oibre in áiteanna a bhíonn go mór ina cáll.</P>

Tá méid na bhFáltaisí sin bunuithe ar lamhadas airgid £39,000, ach meastar go n-íocfar as san £12,500 in aghaidh pá na n-oibrithe agus £2,000 in aghaidh coimisiúin agus muirear eile.  Ní misde a rá annso, ionnus ná beidh aon mhí-thuigsint i dtaoibh an tslighe 'na ceaptar praghas díolacháin na n-earraí a díoltar ag Taisc-Ionad láir na Margaíochta, go mbíonn an praghas san bunuithe ar luach an abhair (maille le diomailt) agus luacha na n-oibrithe, móide na céadchodán is mó is féidir gan cur isteach ar dhíol na n-earraí ar an margadh.</P>

'San ráiteas roimhe seo, thugas fé chunntas beacht do thabhairt ar obair na Roinne.  Gídh go bhfuil fhios agam go bhfuil a lán le déanamh go fóill, táim sásta go bhfuil caoi maith ar na tionnscail tuaithe agus ar obair choitcheanta sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil sin á dhéanamh, chó fada agus is féidir é laistig de'n chóras Rialtasamhail agus ag féachaint do shaghas na dtionnscal, ar an slighe is saoire agus is gnóthamhla.  Tá na h-earraí breise glanta amach agus h-ísáideadh cuid mhaith des na snátha breise chun earraí indíolta do dhéanamh.  Táthar ana-chúramach anois i dtaoibh abhair do dhéantúisí do cheannach, i dtaoibh gan ach an sórt ceart díobh do <Col N="1289" /> cheannach agus san dréir an mhéid a meastar bheith riachtanach. Scrúduightear go cúramach na h-earraí atá le díol ag Taisc-Ionad Láir na Margaíochta agus ní cuirtear i leith órduithe na gcuistiméirí ach earraí de'n chéad sgoth.  Tá mar thoradh air sin go mbíonn na h-earraí cearta dá dtabhairt dos na ceannathóirí agus go gcuirid sin i gcéill go bhfuilid sásta le cáilidheacht agus déanamh na n-earraí.  Is mór an rud é sin, nuair a cuimhnightear go mbaineann deacrachtaí móra leis an obair agus go ndeintear í i bhfad ón Cheann-Ionad agus gan an saoisteacht mhonarchamhla san is gá chun na cumasachta is fearr.</P>

      <P>I am very slow to offer any criticism of this Vote, because I feel that possibly the Parliamentary Secretary is in the position that he finds it difficult to get the Minister for Finance to agree to expenditure in regard to it.  It is rather on the grounds of being helpful that I should like to say a few words on the Estimate. It strikes me that there is something like an abandonment of the Gaeltacht.  Some of us who were connected with a commission which sat some years ago made several recommendations regarding the salvation of the Gaeltacht.  We suggested several things which we thought might help to extend the Gaeltacht into the Pale, and that might be helpful in saving the language within the Gaeltacht.  I find that there is a general reduction in practically all services under this Vote for the people who are endeavouring to exist within the Gaeltacht, and I suggest that the word &ldquo;exist&rdquo; is the proper one to use in that connection. The people in the Gaeltacht have a very hard existence.  We find that when an industry on which they are depending fails nothing is done to substitute another industry for it so as to provide them with the means of making a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do&mdash;in the course of his duties as Parliamentary Secretary he has contact with those places&mdash;that the west coast of Clare has suffered very considerably because of the failure of the kelp industry.  He knows that out of the kelp industry there was at one time a good deal of money made from Ballyvaughan to Loop Head.  That industry has now practically failed.  Travelling along the coast quite recently I was struck by the lack of employment there.  As late as last Monday I was through portions of that area and was struck by the number of people in need of employment and in need of something to sustain life. <Col N="1291" /> Not all of them, I admit, are Irish speakers, but I met a good number of them who are Irish speakers.  There is a general reduction in the amount for services under this Vote.  We find a reduction of £4,061 for &ldquo;marine products industries&rdquo; in carrageen and kelp.  That may be due to something that cannot be helped, but some other industry should have been substituted. The Parliamentary Secretary probably would be justified in asking me &ldquo;what would I do?&rdquo;  It is not my province to say what I would do.  It is the province of the Government to find some alternative industry in order to save the lives of those people, the living exponents of Gaelic culture and Gaelic civilisation.  They, surely, are deserving of some means of sustaining themselves.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should try to induce the Minister for Finance to advance more money for these services. What strikes one on looking through the Estimate is that while salaries, wages and allowances, travelling and incidental expenses amount to £17,015, the total expenditure is £33,517, so that for every £2 expended £1 goes in salaries and expenses.  This is largely an Estimate to provide for the maintenance of staff rather than to make suitable provision for the people for whom the service is intended.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to make strong representations to the Minister for Finance and see that this Department is not made the Cinderella of the services.  If this reduction in the amount for the Gaeltacht services continues, and if salaries are allowed to increase for their administration to a sum out of all proportion to that which goes to the people for whom the services were primarily intended, it surely would be a most lamentable thing.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Hogan, I would be anxious to assist so far as these services are concerned, but there is a proverb which says that you have got to be cruel to be kind.  At the outset I would like to say that we all realise that the Government are trying to help the Gaeltacht, and also that there are a great many people in the <Col N="1292" /> Gaeltacht deserving of help.  There is some criticism which I should like to offer on the Estimate, but I hope it will be in a helpful way.  We have to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the statement he made in introducing the Vote.  I would be glad if he would tell me what was the sum realised from the sale of goods from the depôt in connection with Gaeltacht industries for the year ending the 31st March last; what was the stock of machinery in the Gaeltacht industries on that date, and what was the stock of materials and goods in the Gaeltacht depôt.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to answer these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will be realised that it is difficult to criticise a statement from which certain figures have been omitted. It puts one much in the position of a shareholder invited to a company meeting at which there is no balance sheet submitted showing how the affairs of the company stand.  I do not know whether the Government regard the Gaeltacht services as a charity or a business.  If it is a charity there is too little business, and if it is a business there is too much charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to take some of the figures that are available.  But to follow up the analogy that I gave in connection with the affairs of a company, I can imagine somebody saying that it is an insult to this House to make a statement relating to these services from which important figures are left out. Under sub-head D (1)&mdash;salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;the figure for last year was £5,227; assistance to convent classes, £372.  I am leaving out sub-head D (2), because that deals with domestic instruction.  Under sub-head D (4) there is a sum of £530; D (5), machinery and plant, £800; D (7), £1,100.  Turning to the Central Marketing Depôt, there is the sum of £3,792.  Under sub-head F (2), there is the sum of £550, and sub-head F (3), £1,275.  These figures give a total of £13,656.  Taking the item for materials <Col N="1293" /> purchased, the figure last year was £16,500.  We are told that for last year the figure for production wages was £12,500.  I see that in the Minister's statement that has been altered to £13,000, but I am leaving it at the £12,500 as it appears in the Book of Estimates.  If you take the nonproductive wages of £13,656, to which Deputy Hogan drew attention, together with the production wages of £12,500, no one ever heard in a business concern of a proportion such as that&mdash;it is an absurd proportion.</P>
    <P>The next thing you come to is, materials, £16,500.  These, with the non-production wages and expenses, total £42,656.  The stock on 31st March, 1936, was given as £26,300. That totals £68,966.  The sales, if you add £12,500, would amount to £38,500. I suppose that would leave the stock round about £30,500.  The Parliamentary Secretary compliments himself on having reduced the stock, but it appears as if there is round about a year's stock.  I wonder how many years old some of these items are.  In the past criticism has been levelled at the way these industries are run. They have been run in direct competition with private enterprise.  Private enterprise built up a reputation for homespuns, which some people are cruel enough to say the Government are really proceeding to destroy by turning out obsolete patterns.  They are importing yarn, and at times they have to throw the stuff on the market at sacrifice prices merely because it has either grown obsolete or has been prepared without due consideration for the needs of the market to be supplied.</P>
    <P>I have referred to this matter before, and the reason I am bringing it up again is because in my opinion the Government are running it on absolutely wrong lines.  Either private enterprise should be encouraged to absorb workers and pay even more wages than they are paying, or the Government ought to determine that they are going to produce goods in a manner which will satisfy the ordinary needs of the market.  In the past we have heard explanations of old stock being carried over for years and statements that it was just about to <Col N="1294" /> be properly organised and put on a proper footing.  I see that the accounts for 1935-36 are just about to be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That would seem to show that they are practically a year behind.  The accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1937, of a commercial concern would be at present in course of preparation and would be out in a very short time.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, although it is a much smaller matter, to which I should like to refer, namely machinery. I see under D5 that the amount for machines and plant for 1936-37 was £800, and the estimate for 1937-38 is £1,050.  Not having got particulars of the stock of machinery&mdash;I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary has not got them either&mdash;rather hampers me in criticising it.  Take, for instance, the case of high-speed joinery machinery. The utmost depreciation allowed for such machinery by the Government is 10 per cent.  That is a machine which you can hear working a quarter of a mile away, and the wear and tear of that class of machinery is considerable. It is nothing to the wear and tear of the machines in the Gaeltacht, because the last time I got a return the stock of machinery was round about £4,000.  That would mean that those machines wore out in five years, whereas high-speed joinery machinery is supposed to last 10 years.  Either the Government are doing the joinery manufacturers in the eye, or the Gaeltacht Industries are doing the Government in the eye.  I do not know which is correct, and I leave the Parliamentary Secretary to work it out, because, apparently, the machines wore out in about five years.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the one fundamental error, namely, that this purports to be run as a business concern and the Government have not the courage to run it as a business concern. They do not seem to have the enterprise to approach private firms and get their assistance in modernising it and absorbing the labour content of the Gaeltacht.  If that were done, in my opinion a great deal more wages than £12,500 could be paid to the workers in the Gaeltacht and, after all, that is all the Gaeltacht people get out of it. <Col N="1295" /> They only get the actual production wages.  In order to produce that £12,500 we are asked to foot a bill for over £30,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has just finished an address about unemployment.  He spoke about the labour content of various schemes and welcomed criticism that was constructive. I am quite sure he would not think criticism constructive that would suggest that £1 should be spent for every 10/- paid to unemployed workers. I am sure if that proportion was adopted many more schemes would come into the limelight than he would be prepared to consider.  I merely mention that to show that from whatever angle these industries are viewed, they are being run on wrong lines.  We have been told that they were suffering from the sins of the past.  We never seem to be able to get away from the past.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he ought to consider the question of not presenting these accounts until he is prepared to give all the figures that would enable them to be adequately considered by the House.  From whatever point of view they are approached it is wrong that we should be asked to consider half a balance sheet.  This whole business of the Gaeltacht will require to be looked at from this point of view, whether the Government are going to back their own schemes or going to back private enterprise, because the two cannot flourish side by side.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider what I have said.  The remarks about these industries could be applied to others, and probably other Deputies will have something to say about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some surprise was expressed and, I think, rightly expressed by Deputy Dockrell at these extraordinary figures, showing the amount being spent on wages and salaries of officials, in comparison with the amount of money expended on this Vote.  On looking through the figures all, with the exception of what is going to housing, seem to be going on wages. Considering the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary there does not seem to be anything new done.  They cannot <Col N="1296" /> make carrageen succeed, they cannot make kelp succeed, in fact, they have made nothing succeed.  What are the gentlemen who are getting £17,000 at headquarters doing?  Why are these salaries being increased?  Why are more people to come in?  Undoubtedly, that question is being asked, as it was asked by Deputy Dockrell.  I wonder what the answer will be.  It seems that there is one answer possible, that the Gaeltacht is being depopulated.  I do not think anyone will deny that the general policy of the Government, which, is bringing up the cost of living, is hitting the Gaeltacht harder than any other part of the country, and that, as a consequence, emigration from there is heavier than amongst any other section of the community.  I was in the heart of the Mayo Gaeltacht recently.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary knows the country, but I went from Tourmakeady to Finny, which is in the Fior Gaeltacht, if there is any real Fior Gaeltacht, and on that long run I only saw two adult men between 18 and 50.  I did not see one girl of the same age.  I was in one house in which there were two old age pensioners.  The father could speak broken English but the mother had no English.  They had five children, but not one of them was at home.  The last of them went away a month ago.  All were working in England..  It is the same all over the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the policy of the Government, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is a member, has brought about.  That is the reason why we have got these enormous sums of money going to officials.  There are practically no people left there.  Seemingly this is going to be the effort and Government policy as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, to clear out the natives and to replant the place with Government officials or persons with wages.  As far as I can gather that seems to be the policy of the Gaeltacht department at present.  We are to have a new Gaeltacht then, and a new race of people living upon salaries, because the native Gaels would have long since been put out by the policy the Government is pursuing as it was made impossible for them to make a living.  Therefore, they had to go. <Col N="1297" /> When one comes to regard this Estimate as a whole one finds that nothing is being done by the Department for the health of the Gaeltacht.  They admit that within the last two years, whether through misfortune or not, they have allowed the carrageen industry to tumble down, while the kelp industry is gone, and there is nothing to take its place.  The Department may point to the housing schemes in the Gaeltacht, but there is a special compartment in the Department which looks after housing, and there are inspectors to carry out that work.</P>
    <P>What on earth are the others doing? What scheme and what hope is there for the future?  We are told of one toy factory upon which £1,000 may be spent, and that some boys and girls are being trained in a portion of the Gaeltacht to carry it on.  That is the only hope the Parliamentary Secretary has held out.  There is nothing else. Kelp has gone, carrageen has gone, the fisheries have gone, agriculture has gone, but, thank heavens, we have still the possibility of making toys.  That is the policy the Government has got, and that is the hope it holds out to the Gaeltacht.  Otherwise, there is no hope at all.</P>
    <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would awaken to the fact that the Gaeltacht is suffering much more than any other portion of the country from the high cost of living, that emigration is much higher than from any other part, and he should set to work and make some effort at some constructive policy which would hold out some hope to the people of the country who do not want to see the Gaeltacht depopulated.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any such scheme in mind, or has he any hope that there is anything his Department can do for these people?  If so, let us hear it.  If his Department is going to be, as it seemingly is, a sham, do not let us carry on the sham.  Do not let anyone say that we are spending £89,000 on the Gaeltacht when it is not being spent on the Gaeltacht, but on civil servants who are sent down there. Do not let us have a sham.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks he cannot do anything in the Gaeltacht, or that his Department is valueless, then let him have the courage to wind <Col N="1298" /> it up and not have it the sham it seems to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of developments in recent years, this Department is not at all as important to the Gaeltacht as it used to be, as the services that were of most advantage to the Gaeltacht have for some years been rendered by other Departments, including the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture.  With regard to such industries as kelp, marine products and things of that kind, I think that at least, as far as kelp is concerned, everybody who knows anything about the matter is aware that a fall in the price of kelp is not due to what happened here.  It is due to one cause. It is due to the fact that new sources of iodine supply were discovered and made available in other parts of the world.  That fact has reduced the price of kelp down to a figure at which it would hardly be worth while or even possible to make a living out of saving it.</P>
      <P>With regard to those knitting schools, I think there ought to be a change.  The Department ought to examine closely the results in those schools that were sold to private persons and compare the results there with the results in the schools which the Department itself has carried on. I think they would be able to point to an improvement in those knitting schools that were taken over by private individuals.  With regard to knitting generally, I think this class of training ought to be handed over to the vocational schools, as well as carpentry for boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was a great mistake to entirely kill the private enterprise of the instructresses and to take the initiative in the matter of marketing away from them.  Some of these instructresses did very well in their sales department.  Some of them used to go to London, and while that was permitted much better results in the schools were secured.  More money was brought to the district and better wages was paid to the pupils.  At all events, I am aware that that view has been expressed by instructresses of experience and long standing.  There is one other matter to which the <Col N="1299" /> Department should pay some attention, especially as the activities of the Department in other directions have been very much curtailed through no fault of their own.  I refer to the desirability of having small grinding mills set up in the Gaeltacht district. I urge that is a matter that should be considered by the Department. I know that at one time there was a scheme to provide small mills. I would urge the Department that it would be well worth their while to consider undertaking the setting up of a few of those mills and see how such a scheme would work out.  The expense would not be too great and the experiment would be worth while. I suggest that it would encourage the growth of corn and would very considerably reduce expenditure on flour and on mill stuffs generally as compared with the prices at which they are sold in the shops.  That is the opinion of some very progressive people who have spoken to me on this matter.  At the moment, as we all know, the price of flour is rather high.</P>
    <P>I think if the assistance of the new Industrial Research Council were more availed of, this Department might possibly be able to expand its activities with regard to marine products. Apparently little assistance is being given in the matter of marine products by the Industrial Research Council.  It does not seem that that council is going to produce any results within a reasonably short time.  As far as we can see, they have not been able to put up anything in the nature of a scheme that we could stand over and hand to the Department. If the Industrial Research Council could find other uses for marine products apart from the uses to which in the past we were accustomed, it is just possible that this Department would again become a fairly busy one.  It seems to me that, unless its former activities can be revived, its usefulness to the Gaeltacht is confined to something in the way of a co-ordinating arrangement. That is an advantage which might be got by the Gaeltacht through other Departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> The question of housing has been referred to but its activities in that matter have been confined to the Fior-Gaeltacht.  I think as a result of that, the Gaeltacht as a whole has suffered.  I am afraid that in what I am saying I am not putting forward any original ideas.  I just want to say that my remedy for the Gaeltacht is a very costly one of migration.  So far as the language is concerned, I think that if the Gaeltacht were in the middle of Ireland and if you had proper rural conditions, the language would have a much better chance of being preserved than where it is spoken now in the Gaeltacht.  Most people outside the Gaeltacht who speak about the preservation of the language there think that the Gaeltacht as we know it is the only place in which to preserve the language.  I do not at all hold with people who insist that the Gaeltacht must always remain on the western seaboard of the country.  I do not see why we should always associate the Gaeltacht and the Irish language with the most miserable agricultural conditions in the entire country.  I would prefer to see the Gaeltacht transferred and given some chance of developing in more prosperous parts where the agricultural conditions are more favourable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down is slightly too modest, because he told us he had no original ideas on this matter, and on the solution of the problem presented by this Vote.  On the contrary, I think he was quite original.  He tells us that the work of this Department has been taken over by the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture and he has a solution for this thing.  His solution is the supplying of grinding mills and, secondly, the removal of the Gaeltacht entirely into the midlands.  They are two very original ideas, but they are slightly contradictory, not just quite logical.  If you remove the people of the Gaeltacht into the midlands, I do not know what they will want the grinding mills for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, grinding the kelp or the carrageen with them.  The whole thing is a real tragedy.  I remember in 1932 standing on the outskirts of a meeting addressed by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was in the Gaeltacht, and the people there were making a decent living in those years out of kelp, carrageen and fishing.  He lashed himself into a fury at the treatment meted out to those people in the prices given them for kelp and carrageen. He said they were being robbed, and the moment that Fianna Fáil were returned to office they would give them £20 a ton for their kelp. That made them sit up.  That was what they were promised by Fianna Fáil.  According to the last Deputy, they are now going to get grinding mills.  I suppose they can dance to the music of the grinding mills.  What in the name of Heaven is the Deputy talking about?  He is merely making the absurd more absurd talking about grinding mills in the Gaeltacht where there is nothing to grind except rocks and kelp.  I suppose when the £20 a ton is not materialising, it is essential to talk about something to these poor people.</P>
      <P>Here we have a body of people whose history indicates to us that they were through the years a chronic problem.  If the present Government remain long enough in office, apparently that problem will be solved, because by that time a Gael will be as scarce on the western outposts of this country just as the saying runs about the Red Indian in Manhattan. There is nothing for them, according to the last Deputy, except the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture.  What has the Department of Agriculture been doing, what is it doing, and what does it purpose doing for the Gaeltacht?  The Minister promised to put the people in the Gaeltacht on the road to prosperity, and he was supposed to give them £20 a ton for kelp.  Why would not the Minister for Lands pay the £20 for kelp?  Why trouble the Minister for Agriculture about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main assistance that the Gaeltacht people are getting is in the form of relief works, and they get paid at <Col N="1302" /> the rate of 12/- for three days.  That is the compensation they are receiving for having cheered for the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Donegal to Cork along the Western seaboard.  These people have to spend their time three days a week on rotation work, or going on bicycles to the Garda barracks to sign their names on the unemployment book.  That is certainly a credit to the Government of this State.  That is a nice way to deal with a community that has been a chronic problem for centuries, even under the British Government.  When the British left this country there were parishes in the Gaeltacht holding as large a population as they had prior to the Famine.  The population to-day, under a native Government, under 15 or 17 years of a native Government, is reduced to working grinding mills, for what purpose I do not know.  The Minister for Agriculture is to be sent down to them, for what purpose I do not know, because they have neither land nor cattle nor sheep, or anything else, and they have no opportunities for tillage.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of buffoonery that has reduced these unfortunate people to their present status.  Perhaps I am rather super-sensitive or thin-skinned, but I wish to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that before I would come into this House or in front of any body of men to whom I would be responsible, with a Vote of this kind, I would resign.  It might be all right to call it a joke if it were not so serious.</P>
    <P>Take the two main items out of which these unfortunate people will get money.  For the purchase of kelp and seaweed there is a sum of £3,625 set aside.  That is the amount of money to be spent in the current year.  It will cost £3,915 to deal with the material afterwards.  The mills are certainly grinding.  The £3,915 will be spent on transport, storage, grinding, screening, packing etc.  The people of the entire Gaeltacht are going to get in the coming year the munificent sum of £3,625, and in order to give them that amount it will cost the State £3,915.  I think it is about time the dissolution was on so that Fianna Fáil Deputies can go back to the Gaeltacht. Take the case of carrageen.  We <Col N="1303" /> observe that £400 will be spent in connection with carrageen during the current year, and that is going to cost the State £500.  That money will go for curing, grading, transport, stores and equipment and research.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech on this matter.  He tells us that the decreased provision for kelp under sub-head E (3) is due to provision this year for the purchase of only 1,000 tons, as against 2,500 tons last year.  To give the House an idea of the infinitesimal amount of kelp that this is, down in my own constituency, in a shore-line of, say, four miles, you could put up more than was put up last year&mdash;that is, 2,500 tons. A coast-line of four or five miles would put up 1,000 tons quite readily. The Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The depôt succeeded in getting only about one-fourth of the amount provided for last year.  There is no improvement to report in the state of the iodine market, and there would seem to be little likelihood of improvement within the next few years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so on, and so on, and they are going, he says, to keep the industry alive.  The Department, he says, is desirous of keeping it alive, and they are going to keep it alive by giving the kelp burners the magnificient sum of £3,625 for the whole of Ireland.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary serious about that, or are the Government serious about it, or the Minister for Lands, when they know perfectly well that the thing is ridiculous?  Then the Parliamentary Secretary comes to the question of the market for food carrageen. I expect that that has reference to the carrageen used for domestic purposes.  He says that the market for food carrageen is disappointing. Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Commercial carrageen, however, has shown favourable results under a system by which its purchase is carried out by a company nominated by the Department.  All matters concerning price, condition, and amount bought, are scrutinised thoroughly by the Department.  The company has loyally fulfilled the <Col N="1304" /> arrangements entered into.  All carrageen on offer was bought if in good condition and at a reasonable price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder has this company, whoever they are, loyally fulfilled the arrangements were entered into, I wonder, and has it loyally fulfilled them?  I have been trying for years to study this kelp business with regard to its application and, of course, some considerable time ago I discovered definitely that, for example, so far as putting cattle or dogs into trim for show purposes is concerned, it is an enormous industry. I do not know how many millions of money are invested in producing pedigree dogs for shows in England. Of course, it is not so very big a thing in this country, because we are not so rich, but they can buy carrageen for these dogs for show purposes.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I can guarantee that there is no other ingredient that will produce an animal in better condition&mdash;either a calf, yearling, heifer, bull, bullock or dog&mdash; and which will give him such a good coat, as a small dose of carrageen every day.  I attend dog shows and cattle shows, and never yet, at any of these places, have I seen a solitary advertisement for commercial carrageen, and I have not seen it mentioned anywhere.</P>
    <P>What is this Research Council doing to which the last Deputy referred? Has the Parliamentary Secretary not discovered that?  I am not a member of a research council, and neither am I a chemist or an analyst, but I can vouch for what I have said.  No matter who said it, or where he is, he cannot deny that.  I can prove it.  I venture to suggest that I could come here to-night and prophesy to any man, to whom I recommended the use of carrageen for the purpose of having an animal in proper trim for the forthcoming show at Ballsbridge, that he would be able to produce the best animal at the show, due to the fact that once a day the animal has got a small amount of carrageen.  That goes for cattle as well as for dogs.</P>
    <P>What is this company doing, this company that has entered loyally into this?  What is this research council doing?  They are simply drawing <Col N="1305" /> salaries and passing on memoranda, I suppose; and I suppose that some officials are spending time piling them up and that ultimately they are consigned to the waste basket.  I venture to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if I were dealing with the commercial carrageen side of this matter, a very considerable trade could be done.  Take, for example, the number of very big manufacturers of dog-food products in England and elsewhere, but particularly in England, producing all sorts of dope for dog fanciers and people that breed pedigree dogs.  There is not a manufacturer in England who produces dog biscuits and things like that, which are essential for the dogs, who could produce any article in his factory that would be a patch on carrageen for the purpose of producing a good coat for a dog for show purposes; and the same applies to cattle.  Has anything been done?  Has any memorandum been sent from the Research Council with regard to that?  There is no use in saying that nothing can be done, because I have tested it and I can guarantee its success beyond any doubt.  Yet here we have this miserable sum to buy carrageen for the current year.  As I said at the beginning, this whole thing is a mockery.  It is a laughing stock. It is a disgrace to the Government, a disgrace to the House and a disgrace to the State that the electorate should tolerate a Department that produces a Vote of this kind.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the strictly industrial side of this thing&mdash;that is to say, the headquarters at Beggar's Bush and the manufacture of Gaeltacht products&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary's speech is the vaguest thing that one possibly could conceive, so far as it has a relation to anything of a commercial or business character.  It is well worth reading.  This is a speech dealing with the commercial side of the industrial branch of this Department. In this connection, he starts off by saying: &ldquo;Although much remains yet to be done.&rdquo;  Why, I wonder?  The Government are four years at this job. I remember a former Minister for Lands, ex-Senator Connolly, being terribly wroth in this House and <Col N="1306" /> coming in here, after he was appointed, and doing the new brush.  This master mind had come along and, of course, he was going to revolutionise the whole thing.  At last a magnate and a genius had come along who was going to remodel, revolutionise and modernise this whole thing and make it pay. Well, he has now gone up to comfort and security.  However, as I was saying, this report by the Parliamentary Secretary goes on as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although much remains yet to be done, the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that the rural industries and general work of Gaeltacht Services are in good shape, and are being carried on, as far as possible, under Governmental machinery and, having regard to the nature of the industries, on economic and businesslike lines.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House has heard Deputy Dockrell's criticism of that branch of it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Excess stocks of goods have been disposed of, and a large amount of excess stocks of materials has been utilised for the making of saleable goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Parliamentary Secretary there referring to excess stocks that were in store at the time he took charge of this Department subsequent to the departure of ex-Senator Connolly? I remember ex-Senator Connolly being in this House about a couple of years ago, and he was spitting vitriol about the mismanagement of this Department previous to the entrance of Fianna Fáil into office. You would think by him, on that occasion, that there would not be a speck of dust about Beggar's Bush that would not be sold after he got going.</P>
    <P>Apparently when the Parliamentary Secretary arrived on the scene after the departure of Senator Connolly there was an excess of stocks:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Excess stocks of goods have been disposed of, and a large amount of excess stocks of materials have been utilised for the making of saleable goods.  Care is now taken so that only the proper type and amount of materials are purchased. Goods for sale by the Depôt are carefully examined before <Col N="1307" /> being despatched for the fulfilment of orders.  This has led to a general expression of satisfaction with the goods produced, which is an important matter having regard to the difficulties under which the work is carried on and the absence of that factory supervision so necessary for efficiency.  Agents have been appointed for many foreign markets, and it is hoped that in due course it may be possible to report favourable results.  Last year the Minister in charge of the Estimate stated that he hoped to have the commercial accounts ready before long.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This gives you an idea of the efficiency of the Department:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those accounts for rural industries in respect of 1935-36 have already been prepared and sent to the Auditor-General for examination and audit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>for which may we express much thanks. Twelve months after the accounts were due they were sent to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister in charge of the Department think that either of them could dare to make a statement of that kind to a commercial concern from which he would be drawing the salary that he is now drawing from the taxpayers?  If he did so, what would be the result of it?  Apparently our public consciences can be quite different to what would be tolerated in an ordinary commercial concern.</P>
    <P>I feel rather sorry that a man like Deputy Dockrell should have to get on his feet in this House to deal with a Vote of this kind.  He turned his criticism, of course very properly and rightly, on the way the commercial side of this Department has been run.  One would think that for national reasons the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would consider it a national duty, having regard to the part of the country that is involved, to see that the Department was efficiently run. Suffice it to say in that respect that the accounts which were due to be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor-General on the 1st April 12 months ago are now only being sent <Col N="1308" /> to him.  I do not think that the House should pass lightly over that condition of affairs in this Department.  I think that the House should definitely say that the Estimates presented for this Department this year are of such a character that the House should in the name of the taxpayer demand that the Department should be immediately closed down.  I do not see any one item in the Vote that justifies it, housing apart.  That is a service that is rather tacked on to the Gaeltacht Services owing to the peculiar character of housing in the Gaeltacht.  Of course, the Housing Department has been very efficient and effective and has done much for housing in the Gaeltacht, but as I say it is an appendage to this Vote.  The entire work of the Department otherwise has been a failure and a fiasco from beginning to end.  Its functions have now been reduced to zero as far as any service to the community which it is supposed to aid is concerned.  Let me add that they are a section of the community&mdash; and this is a remarkable commentary &mdash;for whom the British Government found itself coerced to make special provision when they were here, and they did so.</P>
    <P>Certainly this Estimate makes an overwhelming case for the proposal that has been put up for a number of years by Deputy Dillon in this House. That is to say, that it is absolutely essential for the welfare and the future of this community that a separate board should be set up to look after their interests and to care for them. It is a special problem although many Deputies give lip service to it and use the Irish language side of the question for political purposes.  England although alien in civilisation, alien in language, alien in theological belief, set up a special board and gave it special funds to provide for these people.  If the members of that board could know of the meagre provisions that are being made for these people to-day they would turn in their graves. These great men, without fee or reward, gave their service to these people.  When I think of the prodigious services rendered by men like his Eminence the late Cardinal O'Donnell, when he was Bishop of Raphoe, <Col N="1309" /> and compare them with the £400 provided here for carrageen and the £3,625 for kelp by an Irish Government, I can only express my astonishment. The British Government made special provision for these people and set up a board composed of great Irishmen to cater for their needs.  No matter what may be said of the old Congested Districts Board, it was composed of men of outstanding ability, a number of them men of profound patriotism.  When I compare the work these people rendered, which enabled the people in these areas to carry on through all the phases and vicissitudes of the history of this country until they were handed over to an Irish Government, with the £4,000 that is now being handed out to them, I can only say, no wonder they shout &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up Home Rule.&rdquo;  It has certainly brought them something.  It has brought them a condition of affairs under which they gather up somewhere or from somebody the price of a ticket and a canvas bag to enable them to clear out with a few &ldquo;duds&rdquo; of clothes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say that we are going to liquidate this show, that we are going to close it down, seeing that it is not able to carry on its affairs more efficiently.  On the other hand, there is some hope for them.  The Minister for Agriculture, apparently, wherever the suggestion has come from, is going down to the Gaeltacht. There is one part of the Gaeltacht of which they have some experience.  At the last two general elections the Fianna Fáil candidates said that they were going to spend £1,000,000 on the fishing harbour at Downings.  £1,000,000 at Downings!  What a tide there would be at Downings if £1,000,000 were spent there!</P>
    <P>Now, six years afterwards, there has not been a penny spent.  As a matter of fact, the demands of the people of Downings are now reduced to asking for a small basin.  I take it that the basin is a harbour construction&mdash;not delph; it is a basin for the purpose of sheltering some boats, not for catching fish or anything like that.  The poor people of Downings, who were going <Col N="1310" /> to have a million pounds lashed at them without asking for it, are now reduced to being refused the small amount of money required to construct a small basin for sheltering fishing craft.</P>

They have been shamefully treated and shamefully neglected.  The Parliamentary Secretary has no defence on this Estimate.  He could do something constructive.  He could resign his position in charge of this Department and say to the Government: &ldquo;Very well; we have been a failure at this thing.  We must do something. Go and allocate a stated sum which will produce a certain amount of money annually.  Set up a board that will be independent, and free to put all its time and energy into promoting the welfare of those people, into providing work for them, providing a means of earning a livelihood by work.&rdquo;  If you do not do that, let there be no more of this clap-trap about preserving the Gaelic tongue.  The Gaeltacht must and will disappear.  If it were not for the fact that it would only be adding insult to injury, I would challenge a division on this Vote.</P>

It is all very well to make speeches criticising the Minister, criticising the Parliamentary Secretary, and criticising expenditure, but I always have a practical turn of mind.

      <P>I notice that there is here a sum of £49,000 towards the provision or extension of dwelling-houses, poultry-houses and piggeries. <Col N="1312" /> On this Vote I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the position in the areas in which this money is being expended. There is very little use in providing houses for the people, or for pigs, or for fowl, if the people in those areas do not get some encouragement to live.  A great portion of my constituency is in the Gaeltacht.  If I am not mistaken, I think the Parliamentary Secretary visited portion of that area at one time in connection with the demand of the people there with regard to the cost of feeding stuffs in that area.  Some time ago here a question was raised in the House on a Supplementary Vote.  I think the Chair said that was not the proper time to raise the question, but I submit that I am now justified in putting forward the views of the people in the Gaeltacht on this question.</P>
      <P>I should like to bring it home to the Parliamentary Secretary that his Department, who were interested in improving the conditions of the people in the Gaeltacht, should have this matter investigated once and for all. This did not come from Fine Gael or from Fianna Fáil supporters; it came from people of all Parties.  I will now read this statement which was sent to the Minister for Agriculture in connection with this question, so that it will be there for the Parliamentary Secretary to have it investigated, or at least to give those people a definite answer as to what his attitude is on this question. On 31st January, 1937, a meeting was held in Ballyvourney, and I will read for the House a statement which was forwarded to the Minister for Agriculture on that occasion:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Various speakers have referred to the apparently heavy overhead costs of this Department.  Deputy Hogan was the first to draw attention to it, and he was followed, on somewhat the same lines, by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. All the speakers seemed to overlook the fact that the overheads, to be properly charged, must be charged over the housing section of the Department as well as the industrial section. Some of the Deputies at least paid tribute to the housing section of the Department.  Their criticism was specially concerned with the industrial <Col N="1316" /> side.  Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies were critical of the lack of what we may call commercial enterprise in the running of the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin was very critical because of the fact that the Government are four years in power and have not yet solved the Gaeltacht problem. I doubt very much if any responsible Deputy in any part of the House would expect that a problem of this nature could possibly be solved in four years.  The Deputy ought to know, as well as any other member of the House or any person outside of it, that the Gaeltacht districts are by nature the poorest districts in the country, and, therefore, the most difficult districts in which to get either agricultural or industrial development going. If these were fertile lands instead of being barren rocks, it would be a simple and easy matter to solve the Gaeltacht problem.  But here you are dealing with districts remote from any marketing centre, that are by nature barren and, however beautiful these districts may be, they are not capable of supporting life to the same extent as life can be supported in the fertile plains inland.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dockrell was anxious to get some figures, and so far as they are available I shall give them to him.  He first wanted the sales for 1937 and the stock of machinery and materials.  The stock of machinery is approximately £4,500.  Some of this machinery from time to time becomes obsolete and has to be replaced.  There is also the wear and tear of these machines to be provided for, and repairs are necessary. With regard to the sales, contrary to the impression which a person listening to the criticism levelled at the Department during the debate would get, the sale of tweed in 1931-32, which was the end of the era of prosperity, according to some speakers in this House, the end of the period for which people on the opposite benches were responsible, amounted to £4,722, while during the past year the sales had increased to £13,360.  The sales of knit-wear in 1931-32, the last year of prosperity in this country according to the Opposition, amounted to £1,896, and in the year 1936-37 they <Col N="1317" /> had increased to £17,079.  After all, that is not such an awfully black picture as one would be led to believe when listening to Opposition speakers.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. I do not want to hide anything from the House.  I will read all the figures so far as they go.  The sale of rugs, which is only a small item and which is only in its infancy, last year was £58 as compared with nothing in 1931-32. Ties, which brought in nothing in 1931-32, in 1936-37 amounted to £25. The sales of carrageen in 1931-32 amounted to £1,255 and in 1936-37 to £913.  Deputies on the opposite benches may gain some comfort from that.  They seem to revel in anything which will show that this country is going downhill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am judging by the trend of the speeches made from the benches opposite and which are made on every occasion on which an Estimate or anything else is before the House.  Lest they may gain any comfort from that, I should like to point out that the purchase and sale of carrageen have been handed over in recent years to a commercial firm and in 1936-37 they purchased £3,700 worth. Now we come to the question of kelp. The kelp depends entirely on the sale of iodine which, as the Deputies are aware, is made from kelp and the price of iodine determines the price of kelp. Owing to world depression and the drop in the price of iodine many years ago, which has continued up to the present, it has not been found possible to pay to the people on the western seaboard, who have been in the past able to reap some reward from the gathering of kelp, anything like a remunerative price.  The price of carrageen, however, has shown a slight increase year by year and is still increasing.  In connection with this, I should like to point out that the firm concerned has purchased all the carrageen that offered along the western seaboard, provided it was of a suitable kind, and at a price considerably in advance of that which had been paid in previous years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The price varied in different parts of the coast and averaged about 2/6 per stone.  The prices were 2/6¾, 2/4, 2/1¼, 2/1, 2/8¼, etc.  In 1932-33 the prices were 2/4, 2/3, 2/5¼, 2/2, 2/-, etc.  There has been a slight increase and the market is growing. So far as commercial carrageen is concerned, there has been and there is an expanding market.  Deputy Bartley asked to have a comparison made to show the success or otherwise of certain of the smaller industries sold to private individuals.  I shall look into that and see if the comparison can be obtained.  It will certainly be very useful for the guidance of everybody.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stressed the apparent disproportion of the overheads to the total amount of the Vote.  I should like to point out for the information of Deputies that the appropriations-in-aid are net and do not include the wages paid to the workers in these industries.  Deputy O'Leary dealt principally with a meeting held in Ballyvourney in connection with the rise in prices of Indian meal and other foodstuffs for cattle and pigs, etc.  I can only say that that is a matter over which I have no control and that it could be more appropriately raised on another Estimate.</P>

He has not answered my question about the stock, but he told us that the value of the machinery was approximately £4,500.  I should like to know if that is the ascertained amount or merely an approximation.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us about some of the sales of various items, but he did not tell us the total sales.  Have the total sales been ascertained yet?</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the Deputy for overlooking that he asked that question.  I do not want to evade it.  The recent figures of the stock are not available, as stock was only taken on March 31st, which is not so long ago.  Even an up-to-date commercial firm would not be in a position, if it had branches as widespread as we have, to have all the articles priced, and the books brought up to date, so as to be in a position to have the figures published at the present time.  The Deputy will not disagree when I say that it is expecting rather a lot to think that it could be done as expeditiously as he seems <Col N="1320" /> to think possible.  If the Deputy is anxious to get the total sales, they are as follows: in 1931-32, £9,718 10s. 0d.; in 1936-37, £31,444.  That includes tweed, knit-wear and carrageen. In 1936-37, there is not included a large amount of carrageen that was bought and sold.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, an Order of this kind is made each year under the Sugar (Control of Import) Act.  A comparatively small quantity of sugar has to be imported each year to supplement the home production and to facilitate the distribution of that sugar, and at the suggestion of the wholesale sugar merchants, an exclusive licence to issue it is issued to the Sugar Company.  The company distributes that sugar without profit. If there is any difference between the price of imported sugar and home-produced sugar sold, that difference is secured for the benefit of the Exchequer by the device of charging a <Col N="1322" /> fee for the licence.  In fact, with the rise in the world price of sugar which occurred in the latter part of the year, very little, if any, difference will exist.  The quantity of sugar to be imported this year will be considerably smaller than last year, and only during portion of the year.  This Order is made to ensure that the same arrangement will operate for the importation of sugar as operated last year.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 33) Order, 1937 (No. 56 of 1937), made on the 23rd day of March, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might explain motions 3 and 2 together. For some years past, the importation of woollen and worsted cloth over 1/3 per square yard in value, has been subject to prohibition, and permitted only under the Control of Imports Act to the extent of the periodic quotas fixed.  During the course of the past few months, however, there has been a steady rise in the price of cloth, and, consequently, grades of cloth which were previously exempted from that prohibition because they were under 1/3 per square yard in value, have since come within that category, and, as a result, difficulties were experienced by the clothing and cap manufacturers in respect of importing that grade of cloth.  That difficulty could have been met by increasing the periodic quotas fixed, but that solution of the difficulty would not be satisfactory because, of <Col N="1323" /> course, the licences issued for the importation of cloth could be used for the importation of the much dearer grades of cloth, which are produced in the Saorstát mills, as well as for the cheaper cloths, the importation of which it would be designed to facilitate. Consequently, we have decided to meet the difficulty by amending the quota order so as to increase the exemption limit from 1/3 to 2/- per square yard, and, at the same time, have made a new quota order in respect of cloths between 1/3 and 2/-.</P>
    <P>That device enables us to meet the reasonable requirements of the clothing and cap manufacturers, while, at the same time, continuing the protection given to the woollen manufacturers here.  A comparatively small quota will be fixed for cloth over 2/- per square yard and a large quota for cloth under that value.  In fact, there will be for the present, at any rate, no restriction of imports at all upon cloth under 2/- per square yard.  In due course, that class of cloth may be manufactured here, in which case the quota order would be operated differently, but at the present time the Saorstát manufacturers are manufacturing cloth from 2/- per square yard upwards, and it is only in respect of that class of cloth that the quota restrictions will operate to limit imports.  In respect of the cheaper cloths, there will be no such limitations. This arrangement was entered into after discussion with the clothing manufacturers and cloth manufacturers, and I think it will operate to the satisfaction of both parties.</P>

      <P>Up to the present, all cloth over 1/3 has been subject to the restriction.  Because of the rise in price, however, cloth which we wish to come in has become subject to the <Col N="1324" /> restriction, and we have amended the original order to make it apply to cloths over 2/-, and have made a new order in respect of cloths between 1/3 and 2/-, so that there will be two seperate quotas.  In respect of one of these, the licences can only be used to import cloths over 2/-, and, in respect of the other, licences to import cloths under 2/- but over 1/3.</P>

We have been pressing the woollen manufacturers to produce some of the cheaper grade cloths, and they have, in fact, come down in the value of the cloths they are producing, until now they are producing many types suitable for the clothing manufacturers, but there is still a very substantial importation, amounting to 2,000,000 square yards a year, of cloths of types which the clothing manufacturers cannot produce.

Is it not possible for the Minister to induce these people to come together in a type of mill removed from their existing mills, and thus enter into production of the type of cloth which is bought by our people to the extent of 2,000,000 square yards per annum, and which the State recognises must continue to be bought by our people.</P>

Loans for building may also be obtained from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the county councils.</P>
      <P>As regards building operations by the Department of Lands, statistics are not kept in the form specified in the question, but returns are being compiled showing such particulars as are available.  These returns will be supplied to the Deputy as soon as they are completed.</P>
