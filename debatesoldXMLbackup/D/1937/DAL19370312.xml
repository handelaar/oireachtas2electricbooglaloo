    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1937&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Reading of the Central Fund Bill as usual has <Col N="1764" /> been availed of for the purpose of undertaking a national stocktaking in respect of the general policy of the Government.  In particular, the Government's policy in respect of industrial and agricultural development has been reviewed in the course of the discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I just want to travel some distance over that ground in order to mark here and there appreciation of what has been done by the Government, and at the same time to indicate that in my opinion sufficient advantage is not being taken by the Government of the opportunities which present themselves to-day for developing our industrial potentialities, and for conserving for our people the opportunities of manufacturing the commodities which our people require.  So far as the Government's policy has manifested itself in the form of an active development of native industries, I think that policy has everything to commend it.  After all, in a world which is now bent irrecoverably on developing a policy of national self-sufficiency, it would be the height of absurdity to imagine that a small State such as this could continue to exist by keeping its market open for the produce of every other land but its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, every effort that has been made by the Government to develop our industries, because I see in the development of our industries not merely the production of goods which our own people require, and not merely the provision of employment for our own people, but the provision also of a market for such raw materials as can be produced in the country.  When the Government's policy in respect of the development of industries is under consideration, I think those who are concerned with the provision of work for our people, those who are concerned with the provision of a market for our raw material, those who are anxious to maintain here a volume of work which was formerly given to other countries in providing the commodities which our people required, must feel satisfied that the development of our industries marks a very substantial step in the direction of building up an economically and <Col N="1765" /> industrially healthy nation here.  After all, the abandonment of an industrial development here must inevitably mean for our people that large scale emigration which we experienced from 1922 to 1932.  Emigration is deplored to-day and rightly deplored, but during the years from 1922 to 1932 this country exported 250,000 of the flower of its manhood, the cream of its womanhood, to make for the greatness of other lands.  When we think of that appalling drift of our people, when we think of that appalling exodus of the most virile of our people, we must welcome an effort to display here a balanced system of economy which is providing at home opportunities which our people were then forced to seek in other lands. If the drift of emigration on the large scale which we knew it in former years is to be stopped, then the development of industries must be welcomed in order to provide work for our people and to avoid the loss of our manhood and womanhood in the form of emigration to other countries, to seek there a livelihood which they were not able to obtain at home.</P>
    <P>What intrigues me in discussions on industrial development here is to ascertain what exactly is the policy of the Fine Gael Party.  That Party has voted against protection of our industries on almost every possible occasion, and if the speeches of Opposition leaders are to be taken as an index of their policy&mdash;they must not always be taken as an index&mdash;then one can only come to the conclusion that the policy of the Opposition is one of giving this country a mild and insipid form of protection, if in fact their policy is not one which embodies a very substantial measure of free trade.  Deputy Dillon has already described the schemes for growing beet and wheat as gigantic frauds.  Presumably, the Fine Gael Party, if they ever come to office again, will take steps to abolish beet growing and to abolish wheat growing, since Deputy Dillon is convinced that the production of beet and wheat is part of a gigantic fraud.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community, therefore, must, if Deputy Dillon's words are to be taken as indicating the policy of Fine Gael, prepare themselves for the possibility that, under <Col N="1766" /> a Fine Gael administration, wheat-growing and beet-growing would be abolished.  On the industrial side, Deputy McGilligan echoes that view, and his viewpoint on the development of industries as at present proceeding, is somewhat comparable with Deputy Dillon's view of wheat-growing and beet-growing.  If we take the two viewpoints, I think the only conclusion one can come to is that Deputy Dillon stands for a policy of free trade in agriculture and Deputy McGilligan for a policy of free trade in respect of industrial commodities, or, at most, perhaps, the Party might be induced to give adherence to a policy of insipid protection.  We are living, however, in the year 1937; we are living now in a period when every country in the world has found it necessary in its own interest to adopt a policy of national self-sufficiency.  I agree at once that a policy of national self-sufficiency has considerable limitations in any country, and I agree it has very definite limitations in a small country; but, in a world where mass-scale production is the order of the day, where markets are virtually closed to all exporting countries, and where the surplus products of mass-scale industry in one country are exported and sold at slaughter prices in the open markets of another country, it becomes utterly impossible for us to maintain here an open market for the produce of other countries.  Whether we like it or not, therefore, we are driven, as a matter of self-defence, to protecting our own industries, and that can only be done in existing circumstances by the imposition of substantial tariffs on commodities produced elsewhere and which are capable of being produced here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's viewpoint, as expressed in this House within the past fortnight, was substantially that we ought to let in here quite a variety of commodities simply because they cannot be produced here as cheaply as they can be produced elsewhere. The logical end of that policy is to allow in practically every commodity that could be produced here, because you can find, amongst all the countries of the world, certain countries <Col N="1767" /> which will produce goods much more cheaply than we can produce them here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Examples of that have been found in various directions, and further examples could be found if they were searched for.  The trade unions in the clothing trade in Dublin have been compelled to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that readymade suits were being imported here from Poland at a price which would not pay for 50 per cent. of the labour on the making of that suit in Dublin, apart from the raw material and the completed commodity which was included in the suit, so that a suit of clothes could be imported here from Poland and sold here at a price which would not pay 50 per cent of the labour cost if that suit were manufactured in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know what is the cheapest suit of clothes being made in this city at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the accuracy of the statement he has now made, and the Deputy presented statistics to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the matter and they could not be challenged by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy inquire of the clothing trade unions what the cheapest suit being made in Dublin at present is.  The Deputy may get a great surprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get no surprise in that respect.  A short time ago, chairs were being imported here from Finland.  The workers in the furniture industry, having examined the chairs and ascertained the cost of producing a similar chair here, found that the completely manufactured and finished chair being imported here was being sold at less than the amount which would pay for the labour on that chair if it were made in the City of Dublin.  We have the further example of sugar imports.  Czecho-Slovakian sugar is being imported here at an extremely low price, although the <Col N="1768" /> Czecho-Slovakian citizen must pay almost three times the price for that sugar in his own country.  In those instances, the export of commodities to this country at low rates is part of a policy by exporting countries of sending to this market the surplus products of their own market and selling them here at prices with which it is not possible for the native manufacturer to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know that the British are shipping sugar into this country at a penny a lb.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is coming from Vermont and from Trinidad in the West Indies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigate the Vermont conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy gave a number of places.  I am telling him <Col N="1769" /> of a statement I actually listened to by a sugar worker who was working on sugar plantations in Trinidad.  He described conditions there in such a manner as to revolt the feelings of those who listened to him.  That is the kind of sugar we import here at low prices.  Why produce anything at all here?  Why not let the world manufacture for us at these low prices, and let us arrange national parades and wait until such time as these commodities are imported; but let Deputy Dillon tell us where the money is to be found for the purchase of those commodities, even at the low price at which they are being imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks it right, then, to charge people here 3½d. a lb. for sugar at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks it right to produce in this country every single commodity we can produce at something like an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At something like an economic price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, because, of course, the price of Trinidad sugar is fixed on an economic basis.  The price is fixed by exploiting the sugar workers of Trinidad.  We can never hope to produce sugar as cheaply as it is produced in Trinidad; we can never hope to produce clothes as cheaply as they are produced in Poland; we can never hope to produce furniture as cheaply as it is produced in Finland.  We could do it if we were to allow our workers to be exploited here in the same unscrupulous manner as they are exploited in those other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that a fair summary of the viewpoint of the Opposition in the matter of industrial and agricultural production is that they want to get back to the agricultural position and to the industrial position that existed here during the ten years from 1922 to 1932.  I think that is a fair summary of the remarks made over a long period by Deputy Dillon.  In short, that means getting back to reliance on <Col N="1770" /> grass as the chief source of our wealth, to a reliance on raising bullocks as the chief source of our wealth and in endeavouring to secure from Britain a market for those products.  We can, of course, under a policy of that kind, maintain the ranching system that existed here.  We can concentrate, in the main, on the production of bullocks. We can neglect the development of our secondary industries and we can get back to a policy of exporting annually 25,000 to 30,000 of our people from this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a pretty good hand of that now.  We exported 35,000 last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Cosgrave deny that a quarter of a million people emigrated from the Free State in those ten years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the explanation of that is that having eaten New Zealand butter for ten years, and having been without it for five years, the Deputy has now got indigestion from eating it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You can, of course, get back to that industrial and agricultural economy which we had from 1922 to 1932.  But let there be no mistake about it that we will pay an appalling price for that industrial and agricultural policy.  We can maintain that policy by maintaining large ranches, by the export of large numbers of our population annually, and by the maintenance of an appallingly low standard of living for our people. Deputy Dillon, of course, will tell us, as an ex-Deputy of the Fine Gael Party told us recently, that the ten years from 1922 to 1932 were the most prosperous years in the history of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly, were it not for the destruction carried out in that time by the people now sitting on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that period the most prosperous period in the history of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it would be only for the destruction carried out during that time by the people now sitting on the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that those ten years were the most prosperous period in the history of this country.  If there was a shadow of justification for that contention, surely the country could have carried a much greater volume of social services than obtained at that period.  Yet, when we examine the policy of the Fine Gael Government from 1922 to 1932, the most marked feature of their <Col N="1772" /> policy was the most profound reluctance of the Government of the day to spend, on social services, even a fraction of the money that is being spent on them to-day.  So that in the midst of all the so-called prosperity to which the Fine Gael speakers refer, we find that the prosperity was never sufficiently great to carry on the social services which have been carried on for the five years from 1932 to 1937.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get back to the economy of the years 1922 to 1932, and concentrate on the production of grass as the main source of our wealth and neglect the development of our secondary industries, but an appalling price will be paid by the nation in existing circumstances for a reversion to that kind of policy which can only be maintained by keeping the ranches <Col N="1773" /> intact; by allowing the people to remain in a condition of permanent idleness; by allowing an appallingly low standard of living, and by the resumption of the massed scale emigration that we knew from 1922 to 1932. Emigration to-day threatens, I am afraid, to assume some of its former proportions, and it is here that I complain of the ineffective steps which are being taken by the Government to curb the tendency in respect of emigration which has manifested itself during the past two years.  Great Britain has now embarked upon a gigantic rearmament policy, a policy which will involve an expenditure of £1,500,000,000 on rearmament alone, during the coming five years.  Britain will spend a sum of money which is about 50 times our normal revenue, and in addition to embarking on that policy, in each of these years Britain will carry an enormous Budget of between £800,000,000 and £1,000,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That policy of spending £1,500,000,000 on armaments is inevitably going to create a condition of inflation in Great Britain.  The only possible safeguard is that the British, having to borrow the money, will be interested in keeping these rates of interest as low as possible.  But it appears to be almost inevitable with the expenditure of such a large sum of money on armaments, with the throwing into the money market such large sums for such purposes, it will be impossible to avoid the inflatory effects of that expenditure.  As a matter of fact, already there is evidence of the effect of that rearmament policy on the British cost-of-living index figure. With such a large scale expenditure on rearmament, Britain will inevitably attract to it persons in other countries who are seeking employment; and ours being a small country close to highly industrialised Great Britain, where there are large schemes of work in operation and where the Irish worker has such a natural aptitude for employment on these schemes, I fear that Great Britain is going to become such a considerable attraction for the unemployed Irish worker that it will be extremely difficult to stem the tide of emigration from the Free <Col N="1774" /> State to that country.  The Government ought to take cognisance of that fact.  If there were no industries here, or if we had a neglected industrial position such as we had from 1922 to 1932, I fear the exodus to Britain would be very much greater than it is.  We must remember that Britain has to-day very definite attractions for unemployed Irish workers. It ought to be the task of our Government to consider in what way our people can be provided with a livelihood at home instead of being forced to emigrate to Great Britain.</P>

In any event, if they are unemployed in Great Britain they can get, under the Unemployment Assistance Act, rates of benefit more than twice as high as they can get when fully employed in agriculture in this country.</P>

The exodus from Newbridge has been such that they have been able to establish a football team in London.  If the Minister cares to buy the paper each week, he will find periodic reports of meetings of groups of Kildare people in certain places in London.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no enthusiasm about it this morning.  I was making <Col N="1779" /> the point that, while there is a very definite drift of Irish workers to Great Britain, the Government seem to be oblivious of that fact and unconcerned about the consequences, and that nothing is being done here by the Government to counteract the pronounced emigration tendency which has been manifest for the past couple of years and is particularly manifest to-day.  Fianna Fáil Deputies may say what they like about there being no emigration.  We may be told that it is only female workers who are going to Great Britain, but those who are in possession of the facts of the case know that more than female workers are going to Great Britain&mdash; that adult workers are going there, and they are going because they can get the employment there which is not available for them at home.  I had a letter yesterday morning from a woman in the County Kildare who asked when was the Agricultural Wages Bill going to be introduced, and did I think there was a prospect of the wages in the agricultural industry being substantially increased. The woman added, by way of explanation for this inquiry, that a chap, who is a native of the district in which she lives, is home on holiday from England; that he is endeavouring to induce her son to go back to England with him and promised him regular employment; that he had told her son there is employment there at very much better rates of wages than this boy could get at the present time working in the agricultural industry in the County Kildare.  That is happening. Last year I paid a visit to South Galway and, in the course of my stay there, I asked where were two farm lads whom I had met there the previous year.  The farmer who employed them told me that they were now in Surrey.  When I asked what they were doing there he said they were employed on some big construction job in Surrey.  I asked him if many had gone, and he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Some, he said, went in the first instance.  After some time they wrote and told the unemployed lads at home of the conditions there.  A number of the other unemployed lads then drifted <Col N="1780" /> away, and he said that now there was quite a considerable number of local lads working on those jobs in Surrey.  What I want to ascertain from the Government is, what is being done to stop that drift.  Is there any feature of the Government's policy calculated to offer employment to our own people here, instead of compelling them to emigrate to Great Britain where work is going to be much more plentiful in the future than it has been in the past?</P>
      <P>We had a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance a few days ago to the effect that 45,000 persons were employed on rotational schemes of work.  In reply to a supplementary question, the Parliamentary Secretary admitted that many of those workers were employed for three days and four days per week, and that the average employment available to them was for three and a half days per week.  Now, let us examine the position.  Employment on three days per week on a rotational scheme of work in the County Kildare will give a man 15/- per week, less National Health Insurance contributions, and, if the work is in any way industrial work, less also unemployment insurance contributions.  So that three days' work per week in the County Kildare is going to give the man in receipt of that work the magnificent sum of about 13/6 per week.  If the man were unemployed and had a wife and five children to maintain he would be entitled to 12/6 per week under the Unemployment Assistance Act, but under the rotational scheme of employment, if he is employed for three days per week, he gets a net sum of approximately 13/6 per week.  That, therefore, is the kind of employment which we are offering to Irish workers in order to induce them to stay at home and to enable them to provide for themselves, their wives and dependents at home. Is it any wonder that employment of that kind fails to stop emigration to Great Britain?  If that is the only dam that the Government can erect against the tide of emigration to Great Britain, then I am afraid it is a particularly weak dam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These rotational schemes of employment have been devised, in the main, <Col N="1781" /> for depriving persons of unemployment assistance benefit.  A man getting three days' work per week on a rotational scheme of employment gets, as I have said, a net sum of approximately 13/6.  If he were entirely unemployed he would get 12/6 per week at the employment exchange, so that a scheme requiring him to work for three days per week has, in my view, been devised merely to deprive him of unemployment assistance benefit and, at the same time, to prevent his earning a decent week's wages.  A good deal of the work done under these schemes will last for a prolonged period.  Why not, therefore, give the workers employed on them at least a complete week's work instead of breaking up the week into two periods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend at all to argue the merits of this particular rotational scheme.  What I am endeavouring to do is to show that, if it is intended to be one of the fortifications against emigration, it is an extremely poor one, and not calculated to keep our people here.  I want to know whether this is the only effort which the Government is making to endeavour to retain Irish workers in employment here.  Is this the best effort that can be made?  Is this the plan in existence?  Is this all the Government can do to keep Irish workers at home instead of their being compelled to emigrate and seek elsewhere the employment that they cannot get here, or what is the Government's precise policy in regard to this emigration menace?  Large numbers of adult workers are unemployed.  In the agricultural industry they are being compelled to work for scandalously low rates of wages, and every member of the House knows that under the rotational schemes of employment they are getting work for three or four days at such miserable rates as to be incapable of sustaining them, and I want to <Col N="1782" /> know whether that is all the Government can think of doing in respect of providing work for our people.</P>
      <P>I know that many good things have been done and that many useful things have been done.  Industries have been established, and, to the extent that they have provided work, that is quite beneficial and everybody, I think, will welcome it; but my complaint is that not sufficient is being done and that the Government are losing opportunities for providing additional sources of employment for our people by their hesitant and half-hearted policy.  I see nothing whatever in the Government's programme or policy calculated to absorb into employment the 90,000 persons who are registered for employment at the employment exchanges, or the additional 50,000 workers who will be registered there as soon as the present rotational schemes of employment end, and while any kind of large schemes of public works have much to commend them in so far as they employ labour, my complaint is that there is no properly thought-out plan for providing regular employment for the tens of thousands of workers in the towns, in the cities and in the rural areas, who are craving for an opportunity to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in the House on Wednesday night, was frank enough to acknowledge that there was a serious unemployment problem to be met.  He was frank enough to acknowledge that there were flaws in the economic system and that the Government had not provided work for all those for whom work must be provided if the problem of unemployment was to be dealt with effectively.  In my opinion, however, the outward evidences of unemployment and distress indicate that there are not merely flaws in the economic system but that there are very serious cracks, and these cracks all indicate that the problem of unemployment, the deep vein of misery and poverty which exists for many of our people, will continue unless the Government bestir themselves and do something to deal with the problem of unemployment in a much more effective way than is being done to-day.  My complaint is that there is <Col N="1783" /> no planning behind the Government's industrial or agricultural policy. When in opposition, the President used to give lip service to the idea of establishing an economic General Headquarters, which would be the eyes, the ears and the brains of the nation, from the standpoint of economic planning.  The Government have been in office for five years.  The economic General Headquarters. which the President talked so much of when in opposition, has ceased to make any appearance under the auspices of the Government now that they are in office, and I say that a good deal of the development which has gone on during the past five years has been a thoughtless kind of development, that it has not been a co-ordinated and regulated kind of development, and that it has not been carried on as part of a systematic and well thought-out plan, and of course we are getting evidence of that fact already.  Boot and shoe factories have been established here.</P>
    <P>They have now reached saturation point, and the position is that there are large numbers of boot and shoe operatives now on half-time, and when some of the workers employed in those industries acquire a greater measure of skill, you are going to have here a regular quota of unemployed boot and shoe workers&mdash;proving conclusively that saturation point has been reached already even in that relatively new industry.  In the ready-made clothing industry, I think, the same situation is arising, and in the furniture industry the same situation is arising in respect of many articles of furniture&mdash; all indicative of the fact that there is no proper planning behind the Government's policy in respect of its industrial programme.</P>
    <P>I believed the President was right when he advocated the establishment of an economic council which, in other countries, has given such useful service in assisting in economic and industrial development.</P>

As I was saying, I believed the President was right when he advocated the establishment of an economic council, and I believe he is wrong now in failing to establish it so as to plan industrial development on proper lines and to prevent the kind of haphazard development which is taking place here.  However, we ought to have from the Government some definite indication as to when the large number of persons registered at the employment exchanges will be provided with an opportunity of work.  We ought to have from them, too, some justification of the rotational scheme of employment under which persons are limited to obtaining three and four days' employment per week when there is work available for them for complete weeks and for a number of consecutive complete weeks.  We ought to know from the Government what is the explanation of the refusal to give persons continuous employment on the schemes of public works.  We ought to have the admission from them, frankly and definitely, that this is merely a device for depriving those persons of unemployment assistance benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that there is no feature of the Government's present programme that offers a solution for the problem of unemployment.  What we are doing here is being done by conservative Governments in other countries, and we are not even doing as much as some of the conservative Governments in other countries are doing in the matter of relieving unemployment. I shall be told, I suppose, that there are more people in employment here to-day than there were last year or in 1932.  There are more people in employment in every country in the world to-day than there were in 1932. The International Labour Office at Geneva issues statistics from time to time, compiled from Government sources in the different countries, and <Col N="1785" /> those statistics indicate that since 1932 there has been an increase in the volume of employment in every country in the world.  The increase has varied from country to country, but an examination of those statistics will show that there is no particular reason why we should be terrifically proud of our achievement here, having regard to what has happened in other countries.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by asking the Government what is its programme in respect of the provision of employment: what it is going to do to provide for the thousands registered at the employment exchanges, and what is going to happen the 45,000 workers employed on public relief schemes when those schemes are finished, and whether the Government regard it as an adequate remedy for the unemployment problem to provide such workers with part-time employment each week and then at such miserable rates of pay as are unable to sustain them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, before coming to the general discussion that has ranged around the Central Fund Bill, I should like to deal with a few points made by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that, while I quite believe that Deputy Norton is anxious to get a greater push on with the work started by this Government since it came into office, he has been unfair in his speech to-day.  He has been unfair in making comparisons in the abstract and he has not given these comparisons to the House in detail. The main burden of his speech to-day could be brought down to three or four points.  On the one hand he dealt with emigration, chiefly to England. He stated that emigration from this country to England was due, firstly, to the hopeless position of employment here, the low rates of wages paid to people who get employment as compared with those paid in England, and as compared even with the handsome unemployment assistance they would get in England if unemployed there.  Deputy Norton knows that, when he is making these comparisons, he is making a comparison between an attempt by this Government to order employment, and to provide unemployment <Col N="1786" /> assistance when there is no employment in normal circumstances, with an abnormal situation in England.  Deputy Norton knows that for the past few years there has been an abnormal situation there, due to the race in armaments, and that technical men, who cannot be found over-night or made into technical men overnight, get very high rates of wages in such war conditions.  Consequently it is not fair to compare work of that kind with ordinary normal development which takes place in a country which is trying to order its affairs altogether apart from a war atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Deputy did not analyse the classes of people who emigrated. Deputy Norton knows better than most persons in this House the classes who emigrate to England.  He did not tell us how many of the persons emigrating were domestic servants who are being brought over there in very large numbers because of the shortage of domestics due to the situation there.  If he read last week's newspapers he would find that very high wages are being offered to domestic servants over there, and that there is an outcry against the number of Austrian girls who are being brought into England.  He has compared that abnormal situation in England with an attempt here to deal with development on a normal basis.  Another thing which Deputy Norton seems to ignore is that this Government is doing its best to bring about the development of industry suitable to the country's needs in normal circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say the Deputy was unfair in the comparisons he gave us. I accept that the Deputy had the best intentions in the statements he made, but I say that he was unfair in his speech in not giving the details that he should have given.  Deputy Norton forgets that we are out to develop industries in this country, not for the building of warships or the provision of arms and ammunition to be exploded at a moment's notice and, then, <Col N="1787" /> when it is all over, to look around to see what we are going to do next.  He forgets that we inherited from our predecessors in office a large number of men, and to a certain extent women, who had become what I might call the chronic-unemployed, who had done no work in many cases for almost a lifetime and for whom it was impossible to provide an industry which would give them any future.  In connection with that I have in mind the person to whom Deputy Norton referred, the person from 35 to 40 years of age.  We inherited a great number of such people who had been chronically unemployed, who had been unemployed for the best part of their lives.</P>

      <P>I was saying, before Deputy Mulcahy interrupted me, that we had inherited from our predecessors a large number of persons who had been unemployed for the major part of their lifetime, who had, as I have described, become the chronic-unemployed, who could not be absorbed into new industries because they were not persons who could be trained for the purpose of building up a future for themselves or for the industries.  For these people, either relief work or maintenance had to be found, and Deputy Norton did not give us the credit that he should have given, by pointing out that when we were faced with a serious situation in which we had to provide for these people, and also for the younger people who were growing into adults, we took the responsibility for the maintenance of them as best we could in the circumstances, in accordance with what the country could afford.  We had it from the Opposition over there that maintenance for the unemployed, extra social services, in fact the giving of free milk to the children of the destitute poor, was, in the opinion of Deputy Mulcahy, at any rate, Communism, and it was so described by him in this House.</P>

It is about time people should realise what has been suggested on the other side and what has been attempted over here in a practical way.

      <P>Deputy Dillon certainly made several interruptions and his interruptions were on occasions sufficiently long, with the permission of the person then speaking, to be interjections of the speech type.  We heard a number of Deputies on the other side.  We have heard them every year since we took office on the Central Fund Bill.  I should like to remind these gentlemen of some of the things they used to say and let them face the question themselves as to whether they are discussing the Central Fund Bill on its merits as it is before them, or whether it is a case of trying to get away from previous political attacks on this Party by the substitution of new ones.  At one time Deputy Mulcahy took great trouble to make inquiries about the industries which this Government was attempting to set up.  These industries were described by gentlemen over there, if I remember rightly, as being back-room shops, back-room factories, belowstairs kitchen factories and we were asked: &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Deputy Mulcahy put in this House, week after week, a series of questions to know where were these factories.  He could not see them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the reason is because everybody in the Twenty-Six Counties knows of the existence of those factories.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems always anxious to help, but let us have just one thing at a time.  As I was saying, Deputy Mulcahy described them as backyard workshops, but he has ceased to describe them as backyard workshops.  He does not now want to know where are the 500 factories.  The Deputy is well aware that the factories are there.  The policy adopted by the Deputy and his Party now is to do everything possible to undermine the success of these industries.  On every occasion when a Bill is brought in here seeking to give adequate protection to an industry that has started, it is suggested by Deputies opposite that all our factories are not being worked for the benefit of the Irish people but <Col N="1791" /> rather for the benefit of a lot of aliens. Nobody knows where those particular factories are, except Deputy Mulcahy. We are told that these factories have been established merely for the purpose of giving these people increased profits and that the workers are getting very little out of them.  I would advise Deputy Mulcahy to read the balance sheet of the Industrial Credit Corporation and to observe there how many industries that institution has helped to float, not alone for the benefit of the workers who get employment there, but for the benefit of the Irish citizens who have a certain amount of capital invested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Does the Deputy ask me not to read it too carefully?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Mulcahy to read it very carefully and not construe the plusses into minuses as he has construed felt hats into paper hats.  I would ask the Deputy to read it very carefully and digest it.  I believe there are still some Deputies on the opposite benches who would like to see this country developing normally towards a prosperous and happy future.  On the other hand, there are some Deputies there who do not want anything like that.  That was exemplified recently here when a Deputy said that if we could only settle the economic war he would fall into line with us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

Anything that might tend to bring us credit as a political Party is something that you people over there must oppose.  You try to destroy everything that we build up for the benefit of the people. Anything constructive we do, you endeavour to pull it down for fear it would give us an extra lease of life as a political Party, and, at the same time, render the possibility of Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael coming back as a Government less likely than ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton spoke a couple of days ago on this matter, and instead of discussing the existing situation in the country he brought in a lot of extraneous matter, including the Spanish war.  There is one thing to which I would like to make special reference.  The Deputy attacked the community who are of the same faith to which I belong.  He said that these people were all Communists, and if they were not actually Communists they were spreading Communist propaganda. I want to place on the records of this House a strong protest against any such suggestion.  I want to say that any person who professes any religion cannot be a Communist, and I want to emphasise that people of my persuasion cannot be and are not Communists. Any suggestion to the effect that they are is absolutely untrue, and it is also an absolutely untrue thing to say that they are spreading Communist propaganda.  The people of my faith in this country are good citizens who recognise their responsibility to the State and they are prepared to share the joys and the sorrows of their fellow-citizens.  They have shown that in the past when they have taken their part in the struggle for this country's independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who hold Unionist views and independent views. Deputies on the opposite benches have had the support of those people; the Deputies on these benches have not had that support.  I think it is most uncalled for that Deputy Belton should introduce such a matter into the debates in this House.  I want to express my appreciation to those Deputies who protested against it, <Col N="1793" /> especially Deputy Norton, the leader of the Labour Party.  I think it is a scandalous thing for any Deputy to try to introduce religious differences. The efforts of all the people in this country, no matter what their political views may be, should be directed towards building up the prosperity of the State and helping in every way towards the betterment of the conditions of people less fortunate.  We should see if we cannot get together to improve things rather than bring about the introduction of dangerous elements into the life of the country which might result in a situation such as exists at the present time in Spain. Having made my protest, I want to leave the matter at that and I will revert to the subject under discussion.</P>
    <P>Again I want to say that the Government have, as the Central Fund Bill shows, improved social services for the majority of the people.  It is not a Government, as has been stated by Deputy Dillon, anxious to strip the poor.  That expression on the part of Deputy Dillon typifies the mentality of Deputies opposite, who declare that we are out to strip the poor.  When we took office the poor were very poor; they had not even the maintenance they are having now.  The Government's efforts are directed towards normal developments with a view to absorbing people into the industrial and agricultural life of the country. They desire to give the people who have money to invest an opportunity of investing it in their own land and so contribute to the uplifting of the country in every way.</P>
    <P>The matter of emigration is thrown in our faces.  We admit there is emigration and we regret it, but there will always be emigration when you have abnormal conditions attracting people.  In the meantime it is our business to improve the conditions of the working man, to improve the conditions of the man in industry.  When Deputy Norton was speaking he forgot to mention that while there is a lot of agreement on all sides of the House that certain agricultural workers are getting very low rates of wages, in fact too low, a board is to be set up to inquire into all that and to regulate <Col N="1794" /> it on a better basis.  That board has not yet got to work, although I believe nominations have been made in practically every area and efforts are being made to deal with the situation as far as agricultural wages are concerned. Then we have trade boards to inquire into and suggest regulations to control employment in every industry.  The Government are not out to create what Deputy O'Leary interjected&mdash;sweat shops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In every country where there is industrial development you will find unscrupulous employers and it is up to us to find these people and to make them toe the line.  There probably have been sweat shops in this country; they were here before the existence of Fianna Fáil.  The elimination of them will become easier when the industries which are now becoming recognised industries are co-ordinated and regulated and rules laid down for them.  The Conditions of Employment Act will stop the sweatshop system.  We take credit for introducing that Act and we are prepared to enforce it.  Deputy Norton said he was aware as regards industries that very little, if any, employment was given to adult males.  I have had association with some and I have visited other industries which have been started and I must say that, in my opinion, a great deal of continual and good employment has been given to adult male workers between the ages of 30 and 50.  I am not going to go through the list but there are industries where only adult labour can be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is that when Deputy Norton spoke about the 45,000 men on relief work for an average of three and a half days at 13/6 per week, he must have been speaking of particular rural areas.  I can only speak of Dublin, and that situation <Col N="1795" /> does not confront us there.  I am satisfied that portion of the 45,000 men referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in that reply included men in Dublin City and County.  But in the city here the complaint is that a man who is receiving under 18/6 a week relief has practically no chance of employment on these relief schemes, because preference is given to men on the higher rate of relief.  Consequently, I cannot see a man drawing 21/-, 22/- or 24/- relief going to work for 13/6.  That could not apply to Dublin.  There is something wrong with the argument there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the Deputy was attempting to make a good political or debating point, but what he said was that there were 45,000 men on relief work and that an average of three and a half days per week was given to these men&mdash;some of them four days, and some of them three days&mdash;and that, therefore, the wages paid to these 45,000 men amounted to 12/6 or 13/6 per week.  I say the Deputy was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a correct interpretation of the point made by Deputy Norton.  The point he made in connection with the 45,000 was, what would become of them when the temporary part-time work is finished? He did not quote that number in connection with relief of 12/6 as against 13/6 earnings.  He might have answered himself by saying that they would be relieved by the Employment Period Orders.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes is dealing with two points.  Deputy Norton also made that point in his speech for the Minister for Finance to deal with, and I presume the Minister will deal with it.  I am talking of the point he made which gave me the impression anyway that the average amount of wages earned by men on relief work was from 12/6 to 13/6 per week.  I say that that is not the case in Dublin <Col N="1796" /> and I do not believe it is the case in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to deal with is that, as far as Dublin is concerned, and the Lord Mayor knows the position as well as I do, the great grievance is that there are a great number of men on relief who get under 18/6 per week and that there is no work for these men because preference is given to men getting higher rates of relief.  If these men could get work they claim that they would get 30/- and over per week&mdash;it goes up as high as 40/-.  As far as relief work in Dublin is concerned there is no question of the whole of the 45,000 existing on 12/6 per week.  It is quite possible that there are rural areas where it applies.  I should not like that to go without contradiction as far as Dublin is concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton has been accused of being unfair to the Government this morning.  To a certain extent he has.  The outstanding piece of unfairness to the Government on the part of Deputy Norton, in relation to people suffering from unemployment, is that he has not given them credit for proposing to give them in a week or two this new Constitution which is going to cure everything.  Of course, we have been informed by the Minister for Finance that this new Constitution is to be treated as a New Testament given to us at the hands of a new Messiah that will not only be acceptable to the newer natives of this country but, on closer acquaintance, will be acceptable even to Orangemen.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>To that extent, Deputy Norton has been unfair to the Government, but to the extent that the <Col N="1797" /> Minister puts a particular gloss on the Constitution, he may, perhaps, be excused.  I would advise Deputy Norton not to start describing the Fine Gael policy on industry.  There is only one man in this country capable of doing that.  Deputy Norton from time to time plays the part of the small boy to the Fianna Fáil leaders and Government.  In this particular case he would appear to be too small a boy entirely.  There is only one man able adequately to deal with the Fine Gael industrial policy on the lines which Deputy Norton would like.  Yesterday he was describing in an Irish court that Ireland was a province of Great Britain for the purpose of his industry, and he is the man who writes the leading articles for the Government Press so Deputy Norton ought to drop that. If he is taking an interest in statistics and serving up the Minister for Industry and Commerce with facts and figures relating to industry, it is time for him to take a broader outlook than that in reference to the one industry he refers to&mdash;the clothing industry. There are some things happening in that industry which it would be worth his while to ponder over, but he might go further and get at the root of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked a lot about emigration, and about improving the conditions, agriculturally and industrially of this country.  As far as we can understand by statements made long ago, Deputy Norton has been in close contact with the Government in the development of their policy, and has, no doubt, scrutinised what the results of that policy have been.  I want to refer one or two fundamental things to him which he might discuss with, say, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister spoke on the Central Fund Bill and made a comparison of what happened in the years 1929 and 1931 in relation to agriculture and industry, what is happening now, and he also dealt with the question of emigration.  When he spoke on the Vote on Account the Minister stated emphatically that there was more employment in agriculture last year than in the year 1931.  When I was dealing with a criticism of that statement he further reiterated that <Col N="1798" /> in agriculture there was more employment in 1936 than in 1931.  In contrast to that, when speaking on the Central Fund Bill he stated that between 1929 and 1931 the number of persons employed in agriculture decreased by 23,000.  We had rather full discussions on various occasions on the Vote on Account, on the barefaced misstatement of facts&mdash;quite a series of them &mdash;served up to this House in debate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I want to deal with the misstatement of fact that between 1929 and 1931 the number of persons engaged in agriculture decreased by 23,000, and the statement that, as compared with that period, there was an improvement in agricultural conditions and increased employment in 1936.  Public documents, the Agricultural Statistics for 1929 to 1933, and Parliamentary replies subsequent to the issue of that volume, give particulars of the males employed in agriculture, and, as far as we know, these are the only figures he has with regard to employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I take the various classes that he records.  They are divided into six classes.  The first class is that of persons 14 to 18 years old, being members of farmers' families, permanent labourers and temporary labourers; then those 18 years and upwards, members of farmers' families, permanent labourers and temporary labourers. In members of farmers' families, from 14 to 18 years, between 1929 and 1931 there was an increase of 1,326 in that class; between 1934 and 1936, to take the most recent period, and the same number of years, there was a decrease of 2,928; of permanent labourers, between 14 and 18 years, between 1929 and 1931, there was a decrease of 1,013; between 1934 and 1936 there was an increase of 190; of temporary labourers, between 14 and 18 years, there was a decrease of 661 between 1929 and 1931, and between 1934 and 1936 a decrease of 279.  If we take the total number of persons between 14 and 18 years, between 1929 and 1931, there was a decrease of about 350, and between 1934 and 1936 a decrease of 3,017.  We then come to those 18 years and upwards, members of farmers' families, and between 1929 <Col N="1799" /> and 1931 there was a decrease of 7,838, and between 1934 and 1936 a decrease of 13,285.  Permanent labourers, 18 years and upwards, between 1929 and 1931, increased by 1,082, but between 1934 and 1936 there was a decrease of 252.  Temporary labourers, 18 years and upwards, between 1929 and 1931 increased by 3,036, but between 1934 and 1936 there was a decrease of 2,404. Taking the total number of persons, 18 years and upwards, there was a decrease of 3,000 between 1929 and 1931, and a decrease of 16,021 between 1934 and 1936, so that we have a period from 1929 to 1931 during which the Minister claims there was a decrease of 23,000 persons in agriculture, when the figures recorded by him are 3,448, at a time when there was an increase in adult permanent employment and an increase in adult temporary employment in spite of the fact that there was a period of agricultural depression which is now being found out by the Fianna Fáil Party as having been the biggest agricultural depression in the history of the world.  During that period there was an increase in the number of permanent adult males employed in agriculture, an increase in the number of temporary adult males employed in agriculture, or a total decrease, including members of farmers' families, of 3,448; but in a similar period, 1934 to 1936, when the new policy with regard to agriculture that Deputy Norton was so enthusiastic about operated, the total decrease was 23,400.</P>
    <P>Imagine the circumstances in which this House is expected to carry on intelligent discussion on important subjects, and in an economic condition in the country that was painted by part of the speech of Deputy Norton when, deliberately, on the part of the Minister, misstatements are made with regard to the employing capacity of agriculture between 1929 and 1931 and now between 1934 and 1936.  If there was anything to be said for the industrial, the agricultural and the general policies being pursued by the Ministry at the present time, should we not expect that after having had three years to launch their policies, they <Col N="1800" /> would show an additional carrying power for males employed in the agricultural industry?  Instead of that, year by year agriculture is shown to be less capable of supporting a male population.  When the Minister comes to emigration he says that it is the females who are going out of the country.  Does not that imply that there is less female employment in agriculture to-day?  It simply means that if there has been a decrease in the last two years in the number of males who got employment in agriculture, there is if possible a bigger decrease in the number of females who are getting employment on the land.</P>
    <P>Then, we had the type of speech which we heard from Deputy Briscoe, and the type of speech which we heard from Deputy Norton.  On the subject of what?  On the policy of the Opposition. What can be said with regard to the years up to 1931 is that, when in the face of the seriousness of the world depression the League of Nations set up a special committee to examine the causes and the results, they found themselves after that examination compelled to write the following, as shown on page 13 of their report issued on 14th May, 1931:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has already been pointed out that Europe suffered less than most other parts of the world, especially up to the autumn of last year.  The national income of countries largely dependent on the production and export of cereals has been reduced more than that of manufacturing countries.  Countries such as Denmark and Ireland, whose principal exports are animal food products, were relatively slightly affected by the depression until the autumn of 1930.  The fall in the prices of animal foodstuffs up to that date was not great, and was largely offset by a reduction in the prices of fodder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They thought it necessary to report: &ldquo;Countries such as Denmark and Ireland, whose principal exports are animal food products....,&rdquo; so that this country, pursuing the traditional policy of its farming community here, and with that policy assisted by the Government policy at the time, got a certificate up to date in the year 1931 <Col N="1801" /> that the policy which was being pursued here at that time had protected the people of this country from being hit by the fall in the price of agricultural products as much as they would have been hit if a different policy had been pursued.  What better certificate could have been given for the position which existed at that particular time? Now, we have the leader of the Labour Party sneering at the Party which at that time pursued the policy which saved the people those extreme losses. He speaks as a person who has been a fortnightly collaborator, back to 1922, with the Government which is responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to trouble either the mind of Deputy Donnelly or of the Minister, or of you, Sir, by going back to that.  Deputy Norton has been a collaborator with the Government in his fortnightly conferences and in his support in this House back to 1932 in a policy which, between 1934 and 1936, reduced the employment in agriculture by those figures.  He now listens to the Minister for Industry and Commerce misrepresenting the position, and not only misrepresenting the position but giving figures here before this House which are untruthful with regard to agricultural employment.  I ask the Deputy to turn his attention to those figures in the first place, and to the causes that have brought them about, to see the Minister's prevarications and misstatements and the reasons why the Minister is forced to make those statements, because if he follows that line of thought he will do a lot more to assist the workers in the clothing industry and in the furniture industry than he apparently realises at the present time.  The Deputy speaks of the boot industry.  It is saturated. Not only is the boot industry saturated to-day but a large percentage of the people of this country who have to depend on the boots produced in this country have their feet saturated to-day. Boots in this country are getting dearer and worse.  The average price of boots in 1935, the last year for which we have been given figures from <Col N="1802" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce, was higher than it was in any year since Fianna Fáil come into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paying a higher price for fewer articles. Deputy Norton is concerned with the boot industry.  He says there was very serious unemployment in it this year. Those who know the industry, either from the retail or the manufacturing side, know that by this time next year there is going to be increasing unemployment in it.  There was very serious unemployment in the boot industry in January, and I would advise the Minister as well as the Deputy to go further into the position with regard to the boot industry, and the thoughts that are in the minds of the retailers and the manufacturers in regard to it. One of the reiterated untruths&mdash;reiterated barefacedly year after year by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; is that our people are better shod now than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1935 declared that the people of this country were using 500,000 pairs of boots and shoes more than they were using in 1931.  I want to draw the Minister's attention, as well as the attention of Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Norton, to the figures that have been published in xxiii of Trade and Shipping Statistics, 1935, showing that in spite of the reiterated statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that our people were better shod, were using more boots and shoes in this country than ever before, in the year 1932 we were down 47,000 dozen pairs on the previous year; 16,000 dozen pairs in 1933 as compared with 1931; 19,000 dozen pairs in 1934 as compared with 1931; and 14,000 dozen pairs in 1935 as compared with 1931, <Col N="1803" /> and it will be found, as I stated, that in the year 1935 the price the people were paying for the average pair of boots and shoes they put on was higher than in any of the intervening years since 1932.</P>
      <P>As I say, boots were getting dearer in this country and getting worse, and the tendency during 1936 has been to make them dearer and worse; the tendency in 1936 has been further to reduce the consuming capacity of our people, so that they are less able to meet their boot bill, less able to meet their clothing bill, their hosiery bill, their sugar confectionery bill, and a number of other items of which, as has been pointed out from year to year, the people are buying less.  If there is anything threatening the future of our industry it is the causes that are reducing the consuming capacity of our people, that are making them consume to-day less clothing, less boots, less of those necessaries of life than they were able to consume before Fianna Fáil and Deputy Norton together started to improve our agricultural and industrial policy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of emigration. Again, the subject of emigration was dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, again, barefaced untruthful statements were given to the House on that subject by him. In dealing with the Central Fund Bill, after his performance with regard to employment in agriculture, he stated that the total emigration in the five years 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, added together, was approximately 40,000 persons.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, on 11th November last, gave figures of the net migration inwards and outwards from 1927 to 1936, and for the four years ended June, 1936, the net outward migration was 53,790 persons, and the Minister tells us that for five years it was 40,000 persons.  If we look at the emigration figures as we looked at the position with regard to agriculture, comparing the periods 1929-1931 with the period 1934-36, what do we find?  We find that for the years 1929, 1930 and 1931 the total emigration was 33,100 odd.</P>

      <P>I want to compare the period the Minister for Industry and Commerce complained about, from 1929 to 1931, where he indicated there was a fall in agricultural and industrial employment here and the years we have just passed, when all the previous policies were, let us say, reversed.  For the three years ended June, 1932, the total net migration outwards, that is, the <Col N="1805" /> total emigration from this country, was 9,390.  Let us take the three years ended June, 1936.  The total emigration in that period was 50,512, and Deputy Norton, sneering at an alleged description of Fine Gael industrial policy, asks us what are we going to do industrially, or in any other way, to maintain and improve the magnificent state of affairs that exists here at present.  He admits that emigration is increasing.  He makes no attempt to examine the misrepresentations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the reasons for these misrepresentations are the fundamental facts with regard to what is wrong with the economy of this country at present, that is, the way agriculture is being destroyed.  The facts exist under his nose that, in the year 1933, emigration was 9,517; in 1934, 17,284, and in 1935, 23,711. The figures made available from the British immigration figures show that, as Deputy Norton says, the position is getting worse.  The fundamental thing that is wrong with industrial development here, its present-day condition and its hope for the future, lies in the fact that agricultural employment is being destroyed, that agricultural income is being wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put a final figure before the Minister for Finance and Deputy Norton which shows that, between 1929 and 1931, our export trade, which consisted mainly of agricultural produce, fell below the 1929 figure by £13,135,000. Of the countries we are associated with, New Zealand began to improve after 1931; Canada began to improve after 1932; Australia began to improve after 1931, and South Africa began to improve after 1932.  Our principal competitor in the British market, Denmark, in whose class we were from the economic point of view and in the eyes of the Economic Commission set up by the League of Nations to investigate world depression in 1931, began to improve in its exports after December, 1932.  In spite of that fact, we have gone along since the end of 1931 and whereas, in the depression period previously, we suffered from a cumulative fall in exports below the 1929 figure of £13,135,000, that fall has gone <Col N="1806" /> below the 1931 figure by £74,938,000 or approximately £75,000,000.  The policy that brought about that is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Benches combined with the Labour Benches.  Yet, the real trouble there, for all Deputy Norton's mouthings this morning, is contained in a single word.  Will the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce cease misrepresenting the position or are we to have these misrepresentations?  Are we to have these utterly untruthful statements made here in the House and in the country in the hope that people will be gulled or lulled into not realising them?  Deputy Norton spoke of national self-sufficiency.  Our national self-sufficiency is branded to-day by the fact that we are swallowing 12 months old New Zealand butter at 1/5 to 1/6 a lb. while our own fresh Irish butter is being sent to the people in Britain with whom we are supposed to be carrying on an economic war, at a price of about 6d. a lb., taking into account the subsidy that is being given to the shippers, and that butter is going down English throats at 9½d. per lb.  I often heard of people swallowing their own words, but when the Fianna Fáil Party go into the dining-room, as they do to-day, and feel the first effects of the New Zealand butter against their throats will they realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they are not only swallowing their own words but swallowing this butter at 1/5 to 1/6 a lb. while Irish butter is being exported from our ports at 6d. a lb.  The Minister for Finance can indulge in his levity but national self-sufficiency in Ireland to-day means swallowing 12 months old New Zealand butter and paying for it 1/5 to 1/6 a lb while sending our own butter across to <Col N="1807" /> Great Britain to the people with whom we are supposed to be carrying on an economic war, delivering it to them for 6d. a lb. and slipping it down the throats of the consumers there at 9½d. or 10d. a lb.  No wonder we are reduced to that condition when we have Ministers getting up in this House, twisting and prevaricating and making untruthful statements with regard to the economic condition of the people. Meantime every class in this country is suffering.  The industries, about which Deputy Norton speaks and that have been set up during the present régime, are suffering.  Some of the industrialists connected with them are getting a rich-quick touch and making exorbitant profits in the hope that when the rainy day does come and when the price of our prevarication, the price of our sins, is to be much heavier than swallowing New Zealand butter, they at any rate will have got the greater part of the money they put into Irish industry back.  They will have got it back from the people who have to live on a very considerably reduced income.  They will have got back these profits at the cost of tremendous loss and comparatively tremendous suffering to the people. But these industrialists, at any rate, may be safe, when the bad day comes for the industries about which Deputy Norton speaks.  All the seeds of industrial decay are contained in the figures before the House to-day.  That will mean not only industrial decay for the industries that have been pushed into existence while these losses were going on, but the seeds of industrial decay for the industries that weathered the rule of British government&mdash;the alien and unfriendly Government&mdash;we had in this country. The sooner Deputy Norton goes deeper into the situation than he did in these superficial figures with regard to clothing, the better he will help the clothing factories, the better he will help the capitalists who own these factories, the better he will help the workers in these factories and the better he will guarantee the future of the workers in these factories.  If we better he will guarantee the future of the workers in these factories.  If we are to continue with these misrepresentations <Col N="1808" /> and this lying nonsense, and if our people can be blinded any longer in this way we are going to have further depopulation of our countryside, a depopulation that will be expressed in deeper figures in the way of agricultural unemployment. There will be crowds of people further crowding around our labour exchanges, but the eyes of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be more and more shut to what is happening at these exchanges, and we are to have a fuller stream of emigration going on to build up industries in other countries if the Government's ruinous policy is persisted in.</P>

      <P>As the Minister's Department amongst its other activities is responsible for the financing of relief schemes, I would like to direct his attention, to the effect this policy is having on local authorities in the country.  Perhaps the better way to do that would be to give you an illustration of what is occurring in Cork City.  Under the scheme financed by the Minister who is present, certain sums of money are made available for the relief of unemployment.  That has been one of the outstanding features of the Fianna Fáil administration.  But the pill is slightly sugared, and indeed more than slightly sugared, because it has been the practice, so far at any rate, for most of those local authorities to accept those so-called free grants which are made conditional on the various local authorities levying on themselves to the extent of many thousands of pounds.  I would like to illustrate my point by telling the House what has occurred in Cork City.  In order to qualify for the first Government grant the Cork Corporation decided to borrow £9,800 on a ten years term.  The Department concerned were not satisfied with that term, and it was suggested by them that the term should be three years. Eventually that Department agreed to a five years term, which, I am sure the Minister will agree, is not sufficiently long for a local authority.  I will deal with the Department concerned on a more appropriate occasion when the Vote for that Department arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I was proceeding to give him a concrete example of the effects of the policy of his Department and of his Government on local administration.  I was proceeding to state that, in order to qualify for the first grant, the Cork Corporation decided to borrow £8,900.  On this basis, the Corporation struck a rate of 22/- in the £.  About a week or two after their meeting, a further offer of £26,475 came along from the Department to the Corporation and they were <Col N="1810" /> asked to add to that a sum of £8,000, for which, again, a loan must be sought.  The position of other local authorities is similar to that of Cork Corporation.  They do not wish to turn down any of these schemes, because, if they did, they would be charged with neglecting the unemployed and not making any effort to ameliorate the lot of these unfortunate people.  Even Christian feeling, alone, would dictate to them that they should do their best, even at some sacrifice, to relieve the abnormal amount of unemployment. At the same time, the local authorities feel that they are being made to pay twice.</P>
      <P>On these relief schemes, the practice is for the first preference to be exercised in favour of those persons who are drawing £1 per week dole through the medium of the labour exchanges. If we take it that 1,000 persons would be employed in Cork or Dublin&mdash;I use that figure merely to illustrate my point&mdash;the Central Fund would be relieved to the extent of £1,000.  In Cork City, as also in Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire, a sum of 1/6 in the £ is levied in order to meet the requirements of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The City of Cork alone contributes something like £17,000 per annum in this way.  No further illustration is needed to show that the ratepayers are forced to pay twice.  That is a position which the Minister for Finance must, at some future date, take into consideration. It is all very fine holding out this bait to local authorities at election times and saying that the onus is on these authorities to accept or refuse.  The Minister must know that that puts the local authorities in a very nasty position, indeed.  When the ratepayers are taxed to the limit of their endurance, along comes another offer from the Government of a so-called free grant to the local authorities.  The feeling in Cork is that that practice should be stopped or, at least, varied.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I do not propose to raise on this Bill because it can be more properly raised on the Local Government Estimate.  In the majority of cases, the material used for road-making under these schemes is mastic concrete&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention the matter merely in passing.  It should be one of the first considerations of the Minister for Finance and his Parliamentary Secretary, who is an engineer by profession, to find what is the most economic method of road-surfacing in the long run.  It is my considered opinion that a few years hence the problem will be to find employment for the persons who are now ordinarily employed on the roads.  I pass from that to emphasise a very important point which the Minister must be aware of.  I refer to the rather ominous figure which was not mentioned until this week but of which I had information some months ago&mdash;that the amount due by the various local authorities on foot of debts and borrowed money up to the 31st March, 1936, was the huge sum of £24,480,000. I am sure the Minister will admit that, for this small country, that figure is almost alarming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the boot industry, which was touched upon by Deputy Mulcahy a few moments ago. A couple of years ago, I said in this House, on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, that, even at that period, we were about to reach saturation point in the production of boots.  We have in Cork one of the oldest boot factories in Saorstát Eireann.  I was glad to read some time ago in the Press that the Minister for Industry and Commerce almost guaranteed&mdash;at least, he gave some kind of undertaking&mdash;at a meeting of the Federation of Irish Industries or some such body that, as far as he was concerned, no encouragement&mdash;I think those were the words he used&mdash;would be given to the establishment of any more boot factories in this country. I was very glad to read that statement because there would be no use in having a dozen factories producing boots when half a dozen factories would be sufficient to produce all the boots required by the people of the Free State.  It would be well if the Minister for Finance would indicate to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1812" /> that he should make that position quite clear in the country.</P>

      <P>We carried on on a 12½ per cent. or 15 per cent. tariff, and we were doing well.  It was the people who were not quite so efficient as the people in Cork who wanted a higher tariff, and they got it.  We were able to carry on in Cork with a very low tariff, due to the efficiency of the operatives.  The same cannot be said for Dublin.  I want, again, to direct the Minister's attention to the matter I have just raised.  I am sure that if he will indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary, who takes an interest in these things, and whose function it is to suggest these schemes to the Minister, that longer-term loans should be provided in such cases as I have mentioned, he will see that it is done.  As happened in Cork, meetings will probably have to be held in other places to meet the demands made because further loans are offered.  The rate-payers will be asked to raise further moneys, and the ratepayers are at breaking point so far as capacity to contribute is concerned.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that I will not occupy its time for more than three or four minutes. When Deputy Briscoe was speaking he made reference to the fact that I should know conditions in the City of Dublin and of how unemployment funds are administered here.  I just want to say that during all this week there was a deputation of the Unemployed Workers' Rights Association in the gallery.  They interviewed as many members of the Dáil as they possibly could.  They protested that the allowances which they are given to live on while unemployed are totally inadequate.  We had the Bray marchers to the City of Dublin during the week.  There was the question of a promised grant for Bray in order to relieve unemployment.  Those men marched here and held a meeting at which they stated their case.  They asked me to appeal to the Minister so that something may be done to speed up whatever work is to be carried out in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making an appeal to the Minister <Col N="1814" /> in the interests of the unemployed in Dublin.  People are coming from every area in the county, and from outside of it, seeking employment in the City of Dublin, employment that is not here for them unfortunately.  We have thousands signing up at Gardiner Street who have not yet got even one day's employment on the relief schemes passed since December. Grants are made by the Government on a 50-50 basis.  The corporation contribute 50 per cent. of the cost of these schemes, and Dublin is in precisely the same position as Cork to which reference has been made by Deputy Anthony.  In connection with these relief schemes, as Deputy Anthony said, it is only the men who are drawing £1 a week at the labour exchanges who are called on for this relief work. As soon as they get employment, they cease, of course, to draw £1 a week so that the national exchequer benefits in that way.  There is no corresponding advantage so far as the rates of the City of Dublin are concerned.  I should say that neither the rate-payers nor the corporation offer any objection to that.  Their one wish is that something more could be done to provide employment for those in need of employment in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>You have men in the city who have been unemployed for some considerable time&mdash;single men drawing 9/- a week, others drawing 15/- a week and others nothing at all, and not one of them has got a day's work through these unemployment relief grants. They are protesting strongly against that.  We saw in the newspapers the other day that the free beef vouchers which used to be given to those men are now being withdrawn from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a man with a wife in Dublin who is only getting 14/- a week he must have some other means as well, though <Col N="1815" /> they may not be very much.  The work on relief schemes, as the Deputy knows, is reserved for married men, and, preferably, for married men with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of a married man with a wife and no child.  He has not got one day's work through these relief grants, and now the beef voucher has been withdrawn. While that is so the cost of bread, butter, sugar, beef and potatoes has gone up considerably as was indicated recently in reply to a question put down by a member of the Labour Party.  As I have already stated, the people on behalf of whom I am speaking, were in the gallery all the week.  They ask that something should be done for them.  I hope that during the adjournment something will be done to relieve the hardship they are suffering from.  We all know what the position is during this very severe weather in the poorer quarters of the city&mdash;people there with no money to buy food, clothes or boots.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal said about emigration.  There is no use hiding the fact that there are thousands in the City of Dublin to-day who, if they got the chance, would emigrate.  Because of the hardships they are bearing at present, if they had the means they would go down to the boat to-night to get to England to take up work there.  With the help of some friends, and of certain institutions, I have made arrangements to provide a number of these men with their fares to enable them to get away.  Emigration is desired by the vast majority of our unemployed young men always, of course, with the desire to come back when things improve here.</P>

      <P>There is one feature of the discussion on this Bill that I regret, and that is the reluctance of members on the Government Benches to recognise the extent of the emigration drift amongst males as well as females.

      <P>The gist of the Deputy's remarks would seem to indicate that the departure of females from the country would not be a serious loss to the country.

      <P>Speaking for myself, I saw bus-loads of young people coming into the City of Limerick to avail of the cheap fares to London in connection with the rugby international. They travelled to London but did not return.  There is a very definite exodus of both men and women from this country to Great Britain to seek employment there.  That is a matter that, perhaps, the Government cannot completely cure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in this House is prepared to give more credit to the Government than I for the efforts they have made to deal with the unemployment problem, but I think it is a fatuous and futile attitude for the Government to take up, to say that because they have done certain things they are entitled to ignore the fact that the efforts they have so far made to solve the problem have not been successful in dealing with this menace &mdash;the biggest menace of all&mdash;of unemployment, and which is exemplified by this exodus of our employable men and women.  That is the best proof that their efforts have failed so far, and it is futile for the Government to ignore it.  That is the biggest problem before the Government and it is going to continue to be the biggest problem before the Government, and there is no use in the Government sticking their heads in the sand and refusing to recognise the writing on the wall.  Undoubtedly, they have made efforts, but I hold that some of their efforts are misguided and are calculated to lead to emigration.  I go the length of stating <Col N="1817" /> that, wittingly or unwittingly, they are driving people out of this country by the scandalous wages paid to men on these rotational schemes of work, schemes put forward as a panacea to try to help the workers over hard times.  I say that the effect of these schemes is merely to urge the people out of the country. It is an urge to drive them out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe was not fair to Deputy Norton, whom he accused of being unfair to the Government. Deputy Briscoe's views of Deputy Norton's statement, perhaps unintentionally, were a twisting of what Deputy Norton said.  Deputy Norton spoke of the hardships inflicted by a Government rotational scheme of work whereby a man is only able to earn about 13/6 a week because he will only be allowed to work three or four days a week.</P>
    <P>That is the general interpretation of the schemes throughout the country, so far as I know, and I hardly think that any member of the Government will express himself as being satisfied with a scheme in the country districts whereby a man is only allowed to work, for three or four days a week, at a maximum wage of 13/6.  I say that that cannot be more than a device to save the funds of the labour exchanges, and if the Government were sincere and if they had not sufficient money to meet the problem in its entirety, it would be very much more decent to give these men a stretch of work of three or four weeks' duration and then let them go to the labour exchange for the period during which employment could not be given to them.  It is not fair to send these men to work for a couple of days of the week so that you may be able to say that everybody is working and nobody is unemployed, but the net result of these schemes is that these men cannot go to the labour exchange. It is just a scheme for saving money, and it is causing endless dissatisfaction throughout the country.  Any engineer who has estimated for work in connection with these relief schemes, estimates on the basis of regular, normal work.  I have discussed the matter with engineers who have had to do with these schemes, and they cannot get 50 <Col N="1818" /> per cent. of a return.  From any angle you view the matter, I suggest that it is nothing more than waste of public funds and that it is an urge to drive people across the Channel when they hear of big wages being paid over there, whereas if they could get three weeks' continuous work here and could then go back to the employment exchange until work is provided for them again, they would remain here and would not cross the Channel in search of work.  They are not going over there in a spirit of adventure, as Deputy Moore or some other Deputy suggested.  They are being driven over there through sheer necessity, and that is one of the points I should like the Minister to deal with when he is replying. I should like him to deal in his reply with this matter which he and the Government Benches, generally speaking, have tolerated and allowed to creep in, and that is this indefensible scheme of rotational employment, and I would appeal to the Minister urgently to have the rotational scheme withdrawn and scrapped as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the county&mdash;in fact, there is no limit to the consideration which Deputy Byrne extends to everybody in this country.  At any rate, we have agreement in this: that he is speaking now for all the unemployed, not merely for those in Dublin City, but for the unemployed elsewhere, and he is protesting that not enough is being done for the unemployed, and that he is anxious that more should be done for them.  Now, what is the principle upon which the Government has proceeded in this matter?  The first thing to be considered is that when we asked the Dublin Corporation to put up schemes which could be undertaken during the current year and during next year, the first fact that emerged was that there was a very limited quantity of work available in Dublin.  And the principle upon which the Government went in allocating that work was that those who were in most need of it should get first preference. If you have to choose between single men, between those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and those who are in receipt of nothing at all, although it might seem paradoxical <Col N="1821" /> to say it, the fact is that you must of necessity choose those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, and the reason for that is that people who are unemployed and who are in receipt neither of home assistance nor of unemployment assistance, must be, almost invariably, people who can maintain themselves without the help of home assistance or unemployment assistance, except in very peculiar circumstances. The next thing is, if you are going to choose people in receipt of unemployment assistance, which of those people will you choose, if you have a definitely limited quantity of work available for that class of relief? Naturally if you have any concern for the interests of the people, you are going to choose those who are most in need of this work.  You are not going to choose single young men without dependents.  You are going to choose married men and, if you have to make a choice between certain categories of married men, you are going to choose married men with dependents.  That is the first principle on which the Government has operated in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whenever the work is limited in quantity.  It is definitely limited in quantity in Dublin, limited by mainly two or three considerations, limited, first of all, by the fact that you require a large organisation to undertake work of this sort and, secondly, by the fact that the amount of work that is required in Dublin City to-day is not so considerable as people think, and that so much of it as is required is definitely of a specialised character for the execution of which you require men with specialised training.  Of course, a third consideration is the financial one, the one which the Government has put last.  In Dublin City, I can say that our efforts to provide employment have not been limited by financial considerations but have been limited by the very definite insuperable fact that the amount of work in the city is limited and, in allocating that work, as I have said before, we have invariably acted on <Col N="1822" /> the principle that those who need it most must have it first.</P>
      <P>Why should this problem of employment in Dublin be considered as a national concern?  Surely the position of the unemployed man, if you are going to take first principles first, is first of all, the concern of that man's immediate neighbour.  If you extend that, surely the position of the unemployed man is of more concern to the community of which he is immediately a member than of more remote communities in other parts of the country.  As far as the position of the Dublin unemployed is concerned, it is first of all a consideration for Dublin City as a community and for the corporation which is responsible for the administration of that city.  It is only when the corporation has failed to do its duty, or has exhausted all its resources in that regard, that those who speak for the corporation are entitled to come to the central Government and ask for their assistance in dealing with unemployment in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne stated that he was concerned with the position of all the unemployed in this country.  What is the position of the State in regard to this matter?  That it has provided no less a sum than £1,500,000, which is provided by the general taxpayer. The great bulk of that money is provided by the indirect taxpayer of this country and the indirect taxpayers of this country are not the wealthy element in this country.  The richest community in this State is the community which inhabits the City of Dublin.  Inside the boundaries of that city you have the greatest aggregation of wealth that this country knows.  Inside this city there is spent out of the national taxes. I should say about £12,000,000 a year.  Inside this city there are the headquarters of the biggest industries in the country.  Inside this city you have grouped the wealthiest people of this country, the big ratepayers of Dublin City.  If there is an unemployment problem in Dublin City, are not the ratepayers of Dublin City in a better position to tackle that problem than the taxpayers of the Twenty-Six Counties who have to con- <Col N="1823" /> tribute largely to the upkeep of the Civil Service, the Guards and the Army, contribute money the greater part of which is spent in Dublin City?  When Deputy Alfred Byrne comes here and says that he is concerned about the unemployed of the whole country I would ask him when he next goes on the hustings is he going to say that Dublin City is going to discharge its obligations to the unemployed, that the ratepayers will have to contribute another 1/- or 2/- in the £ in order that Dublin City may do its duty to its own unemployed?  I trust he will not come here afterwards to urge that we should tax the farmers and the agricultural labourers, about whom we have heard so many moans from the Opposition Benches, in order that we may relieve Dublin City of some of its obligations to the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want you to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy gets up here and says that he does not want us to tax these people, I would ask him where are we to get this money if we are not going to tax the agricultural community?  The greater part of the £1,500,000 spent on the employment works and of the £1,121,000 which has been provided for the Unemployment Assistance Vote has to be taken from the agricultural community and from those who live outside Dublin City. Of the 3,000,000 people almost, who inhabit the State, 2,500,000 live outside the boundaries of Dublin City.  It is they who will have to provide the greater part of this sum.  If the Deputy's concern for all the unemployed is, as he said, so genuine, so sincere as he protests it to be, one thing he will do will be this.  He will go back and say to the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;We must do all that we possibly can for our people who are unemployed in order that the Government may be able to provide for the unemployed in other communities which are not so rich and wealthy as Dublin.&rdquo; That is what the Deputy would do.  Do we hear of his doing that?  Oh, no.  His stock-in-trade in this matter is cheap sympathy <Col N="1824" /> for all the unemployed.  He gets up here and smugly talks about the unemployed for whom his heart is so full.</P>
      <P>We have heard of the difficulties and of the deficiencies of the scheme.  Of course, the scheme has its difficulties and its deficiencies, but these difficulties and deficiencies are conditioned by the economic position of the community, by the fact that even in the most prosperous times we are a poor community, by the fact that even in the most prosperous times we cannot provide work for all our people, that even in the days when we were supposed to be wallowing and rolling in wealth, even in 1920 and 1921, there was emigration from this country. These are the inescapable economic facts which cannot be waived and which cannot be overcome by merely getting up and saying that more should be done for the unemployed.  Deputy Norton alleged that the Government was not doing its duty, because he said that men between the ages of 30 and 45 years were leaving this country and were finding employment in Great Britain.  I am very doubtful of that statement.  I do not think that, in general, men between the ages of 30 and 45, who had been unemployed possibly for a considerable time go to Britain, or that men within that category get employment in Britain or get it easily.  There may be, here and there, occasional exceptions&mdash;that will happen&mdash;but, in general, if the temporary efflux of population from this country to Great Britain is as great as we have been told, if people are going as freely as we have been told, if the efflux is as free in its flow as we have been told, then those who are going to employ our people in Great Britain are going to take the young, the vigorous and trainable men, who have not yet reached the category between 30 and 45 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked Deputy Norton, when he was on his feet, instead of talking merely about the problem of finding employment for men of mature years, men of settled habit of mind and body, such as those are who are between the ages of 30 and 45 years, to give the House the benefit of his wisdom and advice, and to tell us how he would cure it, what steps he or the Labour Party for <Col N="1825" /> whom he speaks would take to provide employment for men between 30 and 45 years.  He has told us by implication that the new industries, which he admits have been established in this State in very great numbers during the last four years, the new factories and workshops which have sprung up all over the country, and whose existence is no longer questionable, let alone deniable, are giving employment merely to the young men of this country.  I asked him what particular industries would he start that would give employment primarily to men between 30 and 45 years.  If the Government is to be criticised by Deputy Norton, if any importance is to be attached to the criticism of Deputy Norton in this regard, if he really believes that his criticism is justified, it can only be because he himself knows some plan and some industry in which employment would be given primarily to men between 30 and 45 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not say we would do it over-night.  It may be that eventually we will be able to give more employment to men between 30 and 45 years, but it will not be skilled employment&mdash;let us be clear about that.  It is very well known that ability to acquire skill and knowledge in an industry decreases very rapidly as one grows older, and when new industries were being established here, established at some cost to the people, it was only natural that those who were going to be responsible for the success of these industries would take into their employment persons who could be most readily trained in the trades with which the industries were associated.  That is why, at the outset, these new industries are giving employment to young people generally, to the younger men in this generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> There is no harm in giving employment to the younger men in this generation, because the very nature of our population trend indicates that it is the wiser course to ensure, if one can, that employment is given to our younger men in preference to those of more mature years.</P>
    <P>We want to give them an early opportunity to establish themselves in those industries, to give them employment where that employment is likely to be permanent, where they are likely to mature as tradesmen and skilled operatives, so that they may be able to build a home for themselves at the earliest opportunity.  It is easier to train them, in the first instance, and they can acquire additional skill once they have qualified themselves for permanent employment in the new industries. The time may come when these industries will be giving employment which is distributed over a very wide range of ages.  The older men will stay on, continue.  I hope there will be men of 30, 40 and 50 years, and maybe a little more, employed in these industries. It all depends on whether or not social conditions in this State are such that they can retire from active labour at an earlier age than now. None of us can forecast the future, but I hope the time will come when men will be employed in those industries up to the very time when they are able, due to better social services or better social positions, to retire from active labour at a much earlier age than now.  And as they retire, their places will be taken in those industries, not by men of 30 and 45 years, but by young men who have the aptitude to learn that trade or that particular industry.</P>
    <P>How does Deputy Norton, who is supposed to have some knowledge of economics, think&mdash;to touch on another point which he himself raised in the first instance&mdash;he would be able to deal with the problem created by the fact that Great Britain has declared that she is prepared to spend £1,500,000 inside four years upon a particular policy?</P>

      <P>What has been put up to us is this, that we should counteract the pull, in the words of Deputy McGilligan, which this spending policy of Great Britain will exercise upon our young and active population.  We cannot control British policy in regard to rearmament. That is something which arises in Britain's own interests and from Britain's own fears and we cannot possibly persuade her not to spend that £1,500,000,000 or control or curtail her activities in that regard by one farthing.  She is going to spend that money whether we like it or not.  Does Deputy Norton or any other Deputy wants us to enter into competition in what Deputy Norton described as inflationary expenditure?  Is that the remedy which the Labour Party are offering the country to cure the conditions which Deputy Norton admits may be created in this country by reason of the fact that Great Britain is going to spend £1,500,000,000 on rearmament?  Are we going to start spending pound for pound with Great Britain in order to keep our people here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Deputy any realisation of what our actual resources are?  What is our actual capacity for spending, if we had the objects upon which money could be spent?  What is our actual capacity for spending upon any object, or upon any policy, or for any purpose?  I say that the total capital resources which we have abroad may not amount to more than one-tenth of what Great Britain proposes to spend in four years on rearmament. I certainly would say this&mdash;it is a guess in any event&mdash;that our capital investments abroad would not amount to more than one-sixth of that.  Does Deputy Norton suggest that we should take the whole of our investments abroad and the whole of the savings of our people?  Because, remember this, anything which our people have <Col N="1828" /> not invested abroad they are using here.  In so far as our people have savings, they either put them into industry here or put them into industry abroad.  The capital resources which they have here have already been fully employed.  Does Deputy Norton suggest that we ought to take whatever steps we can to bring back that £250,000,000 which is abroad, and spend every penny piece of it in an attempt to counteract the pull on our population which will be exercised by the spending policy of Great Britain in regard to that £1,500,000,000?</P>

      <P>They are supposed to be students of economics.  Has any country in Europe, even those countries whose Governments have the most dictatorial powers, been able to keep in the country any liquid capital which its inhabitants wish to get outside it?  The one thing you cannot do, no matter how you try it, is to prevent the flow of liquid capital.  Here is between £150,000,000 and £250,000,000, which is not under our control at all, which is outside this country.  Does Deputy Norton suggest that we should try, by some sort of legislative process, by some process of law, by some coercion, whatever the instrument of coercion may be, to bring back that sum of between £150,000,000 and £250,000,000 and then start spending every penny of it in order to keep our people at home? Will he tell us the works upon which it is to be expended if it is to be expended on reproductive work?  Will he tell us the works upon which it is to <Col N="1829" /> be expended if it is not to be expended on reproductive work?  I do not believe that you can possibly spend anything like that sum upon the creation of new capital goods in this country which could be usefully employed in the manufacture of consumption goods.  I do not think that you can possibly spend that sum, and if you cannot spend it, is Deputy Norton's cure for this problem that we should start in, like the drones in the hive, consuming it ourselves and importing from Great Britain the wherewithal to enable our people to live in luxurious idleness at home?</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said that the rotational schemes were devised mainly to deprive workers of unemployment assistance.  He wants to know if that is the best effort that can be made.  What are the facts?  I do not know whether Deputy Norton has taken the trouble to look at the figures which express the facts as they are set out in the volume of Estimates for the coming year.  There in Vote 69 he will see that this year we are providing £1,500,000 for employment schemes. If he turns to page 275, he will see the figures for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance and he will find that we are providing £1,121,000 for unemployment assistance as against £1,500,000 last year.  Those are the facts upon which Deputy Norton basis his contention that the rotational schemes are devised mainly to deprive workers of unemployment assistance.  We are spending £1,500,000 on work the main purpose of which, according to Deputy Norton, is to secure a saving of £379,000 in unemployment assistance.  That is the sole purpose, according to Deputy Norton, of spending £1,500,000.  Not a word about the fact that we are anxious to provide, and that all we ever contracted to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was clearly recognised, and I made it clear in the debates which have taken place on this question of the provision of employment for the unemployed, that it would take at least five times as much to keep a person fully employed as to provide him with unemployment assistance or maintenance.  So far as we can, and within the capacity of this State, we are substituting, in regard to the greatest possible number of people, the provision of work, and of useful work&mdash;useful from the social, from the moral as well as from the economic point of view&mdash;the greatest possible amount of work for the greatest possible number of people, in substitution for unemployment payments. Remember that every man we take off unemployment assistance is costing us five times as much.</P>

In most of the areas, the number on the unemployed register is not sufficient to compel us to pay even so little as that.  We heard about Dublin City.  What is the position there?  A person who has 16/- or £1 a week unemployment assistance will get three or four days' work at 10/- a day.</P>

The amount of employment which they were able to suggest to us that should be helped, assisted and financed out of the unemployment schemes, was not sufficient to do more than to provide work for married men with dependent children.  If the Deputy wants to deal with the other categories, married men without dependent children, or if he wants to deal with single men without dependents, it is his job in the first place to go and expand the Dublin Corporation staff, and to put his thinking cap on and to think out schemes, such as slum clearances, sewerage improvements, public health schemes, and schemes to improve the general amenities of the City of Dublin, which will absorb not merely married men without dependents, but single men without dependents.

      <P>I desire to raise a question concerning Questions 18 and 20, which were on the Order Paper yesterday.  I could understand the Minister for Finance being lighthearted about a matter like this, but I was certainly surprised at Deputy Keyes intervening and saying that anyone who attempted to throw light on the subject would be talking through his hat, because I am drawing attention to a very important and a very serious matter.  I want to get some more information, and I want to point out the great distinction there is between the delicacy with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce treats his side of the matter and the want of delicacy with which apparently his organisation treats unfortunate people who go to the exchanges looking for work.  The facts are that a representative of an English firm applied to the employment exchange, or, to use the official statement used by the Information Bureau, stated &ldquo;they might have permanent employment for a considerable number of new workers.&rdquo; My information is that 300 were to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Bureau states: &ldquo;a considerable number of new workers.&rdquo; The Minister stated yesterday that no number was mentioned.  Those who were interviewed by the officials in the labour exchange state 300.  The official statement also says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No offer of employment in the manufacture of paper hats or any <Col N="1833" /> other class of goods in England was made through the Dublin Employment Exchange to anybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No girls have been sent by the Dublin Employment Exchange to take such employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, the Minister has no information as to whether a number of girls have gone as a result.  The general attitude of the Minister on the subject of this employment was disclosed yesterday when he was asked for information with regard to applications received from labour offices in England or Northern Ireland.  He said he could not say how many were received in six months, or how many persons were now in employment without references to these labour exchanges, so that approaches from outside firms through the official machinery here for workers to go abroad are unnoticed or unrecorded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts, and in the case of this definite application we have outside girls going to the labour exchange, signing up and being offered work in England on February the 23rd if they interviewed a person upstairs on the manufacture of hats.  I asked the Minister for the terms on which that employment was offered, and he would not say what they were.  The terms were 26/- a week, that they were to refund 2/- weekly until their travelling expenses were paid, that they were to pay 16/- weekly for board, and that they would be engaged from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on week-days, and from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays.  That was the information conveyed to them through the officials, and pressure of an implied kind was certainly brought to bear on persons to go over to England for that employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What pressure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The pressure which reflects itself in this particular way, that when one young girl went home to her mother she said: &ldquo;I am afraid there is a lot of us going to be <Col N="1834" /> cut off.  They are sending girls to England.&rdquo; The mother could then say: &ldquo;I hope you will not have to go.&rdquo; There was only this girl and her brother to assist the mother.  The next day that girls came in to sign some of them were sent for interview.  At least one girl could go home after that and tell her mother that she was afraid the money would be cut off as they were sending girls from the Labour Exchange to England.  A young girl who was in receipt of insurance payments was asked to take this work and to go for interview.  She was told that she had no sense when she would not go for the interview. A docket was then pinned to her card and she was sent to the referee the following Saturday.  She was questioned by the referee as to whether she was seeking work or not and was given another chance.  The referee told her that she could go on signing. When she came on the following Thursday to get her money she was told that the supervisor wanted to see her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  She was told that she had no sense when she would not attend.  When she did not attend, her card was marked, and she was told on the following Thursday&mdash;two days afterwards&mdash;that she would have to go to the court of referees on the following Saturday.  She went to the court of referees, and was questioned as to what she was doing to obtain employment.  She was given her last chance and was told that she could go on signing, which implied that she could still go on receiving unemployment insurance.  On the following Thursday she had to interview a supervisor, who told her that she had no more stamps.  She then went and saw another supervisor, who referred to her files and told her she had stamps for two or three months. <Col N="1835" /> That is one case of a girl treated in that particular way.  The other case is that of a girl picking up the atmosphere outside, and telling her mother she was afraid the money was going to be stopped.  It was the general opinion spread among the girls at the labour exchange that if they did not agree to go to England they were liable to have their money stopped on the grounds that they were not seeking work.  On the question of the 300 vacancies, the 300 vacancies in England were mentioned freely by the girls around the labour exchange, and by girls who had not anything to do with being offered this work because they were not in the class that would be offered it.  Definitely then outside you have such a want of delicacy and such a want of scrupulousness in dealing with this particular matter that the impression could be conveyed to girls that their unemployment insurance money was likely to be stopped if they turned down an offer to go to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who made the offer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They were given particulars through the hatches of the labour exchange, and asked to go up for interview.  In one case the girl was told that she had no sense if she would not go.  We asked the Minister how many girls were sent to employment in England as a result of this offer, and he told us that no offer of employment was made, and no applicants were sent to England.  Girls have gone to England to obtain this employment; other girls are prepared to go, and are expecting to be called.  If the Minister will refer to the labour exchange to-day he will find that there is one particular hatch in the women's part of the employment exchange where a girl can go if she wants to be transferred to England for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the industrial situation what it is here, we would expect that through the machinery of the Minister's Department he would keep a watch on the number of girls and the type of girls that were going to work in Great Britain, on the class of work they were going to, and on the terms of their <Col N="1836" /> employment there.  The only point on which he is able to correct our information is that this is a question of felt hats; that it is permanent employment. That is all.  He goes no distance to inform the House as to what the pay is, or as to what the general conditions of work are, although, as I say, those particulars are available and are known to be what I have stated.  That extends apparently not only to girls, but extends to men throughout the country. But the Minister stands completely back.  He is very scrupulous, very delicate, with regard to that particular kind of information.  He is going to shut his eyes completely to what is going on.  Representatives of an English firm may come over here and may apply at the labour exchange for persons to go abroad.  They will be given accommodation in the office of the labour exchange in order to interview people.  In this case, although accommodation was provided in the labour exchange for this lady to conduct the interview, the Minister says: &ldquo;The lady was not permitted to take the names of applicants, nor were the applicants informed of the name of the prospective employer.&rdquo; Squeamishness is certainly carried to the extent of ridiculousness, and is carried beyond the point at which we could believe that that statement is true.</P>
    <P>I want further information from the Minister as to what steps he proposes to take in future to see that girls will not be induced to accept employment of this particular kind in Great Britain through fear of losing the statutory payments they are entitled to here. That is one thing.  Secondly, I want to know from the Minister why&mdash;if there are applications to his Department of this particular kind or of the kind that he implies he would receive from the Labour Department in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;he does not keep a record of the vacancies that are offered, a record of the class of work, the terms of employment and the number of people who go?  Surely if any plea of sincerity is to be attached to some of the statements that the Minister and his colleagues make with regard to the development of industry here and the necessity for getting people here employed in industry, the Minister <Col N="1837" /> will keep a watch on what is happening to people of the class in regard to which the outside firm which approached him in this particular case have written so appreciatively of their capacity and qualities for engaging in industrial occupations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that Deputy Mulcahy would have had the good sense to let this matter drop. He discovered a mare's nest and is now frantically searching for some eggs in it, or, having regard to the Mutt and Jeff cartoon in the <i>Evening Herald</i> the other evening, perhaps I should say that he has discovered a cow's nest and is now looking for bottles.  Neither eggs nor bottles are to be found, and the mare itself is turning very rapidly into the shape of a rabbit.  The whole purpose of Deputy Mulcahy's speech now, and of his raising this question on the adjournment at all, is to convey the impression that he has got hold of something, namely, that there is no record kept of applications to the employment exchange for workers, but that was not his allegation last week. He wants us to forget the allegation which he made last week.  That allegation was that an offer of employment in England was made to certain girls through the Dublin Employment Exchange, and that because they refused to go they had their unemployment assistance benefit stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that one girl had; I said that the offer was definitely made and that one girl had her unemployment assistance stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read what the Deputy said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One girl was offered this and she declined it, and the lady at the hatch asked her was she declining to take on this work, and she said she was; and the normal payment that girl expected to get that week, having got it in previous weeks, was withheld from her.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan butted in and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Here is a question of forced emigration from the labour exchanges through the cutting off of the girls' unemployment money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> He went further; he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have other evidence&mdash;not so direct as that, perhaps, but bearing out that that is what is happening.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not what is happening, and, as I pointed out to the Deputy, there is not a single iota of truth in the story that he reported here.  There was no offer of employment made through the Dublin Employment Exchange in connection with this matter.  As the Deputy was informed, no offer would be made except at the request of the British Ministry of Labour.  That is the normal practice in operation between the two countries.  If an employer here wants a worker from Great Britain, the application is sent through the British Ministry of Labour.  The British Ministry of Labour would not send a worker over here except at the request of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Our practice is the same.  It is not true that there is no record kept of the offers of employment to Irish workers which are received through the British Ministry of Labour. That is not the question the Deputy asked.  The question asked about approaches to the Department by employers.  Any employer who approached the Department with an offer of work would be informed that that offer would not be entertained unless received through the British Ministry of Labour.  In this case there was no offer of work, and certainly there was no offer of work to engage in the manufacture of paper hats. Where the Deputy got hold of the paper hats for the Coronation story I do not know.  He got quite eloquent about it.  &ldquo;The attitude of the Saorstát was one of detachment and protest to the Coronation,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Is this detachment and protest?  We are going to send girls over to make paper hats for the Coronation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In this case, a firm in England, for reasons of their own which I have not mentioned and which appeared to be quite good, were anxious to employ a certain number of Irish workers.  They sent a representative here, but that representative was informed, as I have said, that no offer of work would be considered unless it was received through the British Ministry of Labour.  No offer of work was made to anybody, and nobody was sent to take that work through the Dublin Unemployment Exchange. People may go to England in search of work other than through the instrumentality of the exchange, but so far as the Deputy's statement is concerned that girls signing for work at the exchange were offered work in England, were sent to England to take that work and were refused unemployment assistance if they did not take it, there is no foundation whatsoever for it.</P>
      <P>In the case of the one girl whom the Deputy mentioned, I had a search made of the records of the exchange and was able to identify the girl to whom the Deputy referred.  Her name is Mary Lennon.  That girl was not sent for this interview at all.</P>

      <P>The whole allegation that the Department is forcing girls to emigrate to England, and that the machinery of the employment exchange is being used to exercise economic pressure on unemployed girls in Dublin, to make them go to England, is based on this case&mdash;the case of a girl who was not approached at all in connection with this employment, and the stoppage of whose unemployment assistance was entirely due to the fact that, under the Act, she is not qualified to receive it.  I do not know whether Deputy Mulcahy expects the Dáil ever to take him seriously again, in view of the wild story he apparently accepted from somebody in this connection, and to which he gave immediate publicity without undertaking the slightest investigation into its accuracy.  Nobody has ever had unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance stopped because of a refusal of an offer of work outside the Saorstát.  Deputy McGilligan alleged here that it was our policy to encourage emigration by stopping benefit payments in these circumstances. It has never happened, and I challenge Deputy Mulcahy to produce any case in which it has happened, and I certainly challenge Deputy McGilligan to produce here, or elsewhere, the other evidence that that is the policy of the Government to which he made reference in the debate. This whole story is a flop, Deputy. Forget about it&mdash;it is the best thing you can do.</P>
