The period which elapses between the date of the official representation of the medical officer of health, which certifies premises in an unhealthy area to be unfit for human habitation, and the date upon which action can be taken to have the area evacuated to enable new dwellings to be erected thereon is at least 12 months.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the housing conditions in the Sneem and Tahilla districts and the need for providing new houses in these areas.  The Deputy is aware that it was necessary to withhold sanction to housing schemes in County Kerry owing to the unsatisfactory position of the collection of the cottage rents.  The position had improved somewhat at the end of September last and I informed the board that the prohibition on schemes in Cahirciveen and Castle-island was withdrawn.  Since then, the arrears of rents have increased and further schemes will not be sanctioned until the position in regard to the collection of rents has considerably improved.</P>

I have taken the matter up with the Galway Board of Health and Public Assistance and called their attention to the need for repairing the boundary wall and providing efficient internal fences.

It appears that portion of the site requires to be drained.  Plans and specification for the development and fencing of the land attached to the cottages have been approved, and the board's engineer has been instructed to have the work carried out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to these two questions relating to the work of the County Galway Board of <Col N="1126" /> Health and Public Assistance, the Deputy is aware that that board of health is an elected body: that it has its own rights and its own powers. The Deputy asked to-day, and put the same question at other times, that the Minister should use his powers to force this body to do this, that and the other.  I take it that the Deputy, as a member of the Labour Party, stands for democratic government.  Therefore, it does not look well, coming from such a source, to be asking the Minister to use what would seem to be a sort of dictatorial powers towards an elected public body.  I could understand such a request coming from other sources, but I do not think it comes well from a Labour Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to arrange the expenditure of money on the improvement of estates on a county basis, though the Land Commission do try to deal with necessary works each year in every area.  Expenditure provided for under sub-head I of the Land Commission Vote is incurred in connection with the improvement of the estates, whether tenanted or untenanted, purchased under the Land Purchase Acts; but expenditure in particular counties is largely related to the area of untenanted land available for division in those counties.  The amount spent during the current financial year in County Kerry does not compare unfavourably with expenditure in such congested counties as Clare and Donegal though for obvious reasons it falls far below the similar figures for Galway and Mayo.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will remember that we had a debate on the subject of widows' and orphans' pensions on the 12th November last arising out of a motion by Deputy Peadar Doyle and an amendment proposed, I think, by Deputy Davin or Deputy Norton.  I told the House, in the course of the discussion on that occasion, that a Bill to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act of 1935 was then practically prepared, and I told the House what, roughly, that Bill, when introduced, would contain and what it proposed to do.  All Parties in the House were interested in the discussion, and Deputies of all sides took part in it, and there was a view expressed on all sides that it would be more satisfactory if a new Bill would propose to make pensions available for all necessitous widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After I had outlined the Bill, the following week I was met by a lot of the Deputies of my own Party who expressed that view to me pretty forcibly, and I took note of the statements made by Deputy Dillon in the same direction, urging me and urging the Government to provide, if possible, the necessary finances to cover, in the proposed amending Bill, pensions for all necessitous widows and orphans, as I have already said.  The same claim was put forward and strongly stressed <Col N="1140" /> by the Deputies who spoke from the Labour Benches and, I think, the Independent Benches as well.  Accordingly, having heard such a strong volume of opinion expressed, and feeling it was the right thing to do if the money could be found, I took the matter up again with the Minister for Finance and with the Executive Council, and I am happy to say that the money has been found and the Government has agreed to withdraw the Bill that was practically ready for introduction, and to substitute for it the Bill that has now been circulated, which does make provision for pensions for all necessitous widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, 1935 and 1936, and is in fulfilment of a promise I have made several times in this House that the earliest opportunity would be taken to extend the number of necessitous widows and orphans who would benefit under the non-contributory scheme of pensions established by the Act of 1935.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that the Act of 1935 provided two classes of pension, contributory and non-contributory, and was framed on the principle that in dealing with the question of necessity arising amongst the widows and orphans of the wage-earning classes, through the premature death of the breadwinner, the best results would be obtained by adhering to the principle of compulsory contributory insurance. Such a scheme of contributory insurance would ensure that, for the future at any rate, the classes for whom protection was in the main desired, would be adequately covered.  The system would provide for the payment during working life of contributions to a fund, which with the aid of a subvention from the State would guarantee pensions to the widows and orphans of wage-earners, without the imposition of a means test.  The type of scheme established corresponds to similar schemes established in other countries, where the experience has been that they are of very great benefit indeed in meeting the hardships which arise through the death of employed husbands and fathers of families.  We <Col N="1141" /> have now had something over a year's experience of the working of the contributory scheme in this country and I can say emphatically that, even in that short time, it has proved of very great benefit.</P>
    <P>It was estimated that, in the first year of its operation, an average of 700 widows whose husbands would die during that year, would become entitled to contributory pensions at a cost of £30,000 for the year.  The position as at 31st December last was, that there were 702 widows and 1,174 children (including orphans) in receipt of contributory pensions, the pensions amounting to £554 8s. 0d. per week, i.e., at the rate of £28,829 per annum. Since the 31st December these figures have increased as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Number of widows, 795.</P>
    <P>Number of children and orphans, 1,370.</P>
    <P>Weekly cost, £636 6s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Annual cost, £33,089.</P>
    <P>The cost of the contributory scheme will increase rapidly from year to year until the ultimate stage is reached, when it is estimated that there will be 23,000 widows and 18,500 children, including orphans, in receipt of contributary pensions.</P>
    <P>Where the employment of the late husband or father was not agricultural employment, these pensions are at the rate of 10/- per week for the widow, 5/- per week for the first dependent child, 3/- per week for each other dependent child and 7/6 per week for each orphan child.  The lowest pension in this group is 10/- per week and the highest is 42/- per week.  In cases where the late husband or father was employed in agricultural employment, the pensions are at the rate of 8/- per week for the widow, 4/- a week for the first dependent child, 2/6 for each other dependent child and 6/- a week for each orphan child.  The lowest pension in this group is 8/- per week and the highest, 32/- per week.</P>
    <P>Though the Bill now before the Dáil does not make any important or radical alterations in the contributory scheme, I think it desirable to impress on Deputies that the system of pensions to widows and orphans is, in <Col N="1142" /> the main, a scheme of compulsory contributory insurance, which is relied on to meet, as far as possible, all cases of necessity arising in the future amongst the widows and orphans of the insured class, that is the great majority of wage-earners.  The adoption of the contributory principle does not, however, deal with the case of the existing population of necessitous widows and orphans whose husbands or parents were already dead when the contributory system began, nor does it deal adequately with cases which might arise in the future where a man who was insured under the contributory plan failed to have sufficient qualifying contributions to his credit at the date of death.  In order to meet that position (which to some extent is transitional, since the number of cases should begin to decline as soon as the contributory scheme is well established) the original Act provided for a scheme of non-contributory pensions in addition to the contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>The non-contributory scheme of pensions set up by the Act of 1935 provided pensions under certain conditions to the widows and orphans of certain classes.  These classes are, firstly, persons who would have been insured under the contributory scheme if it had been in force when they died and, secondly, small working farmers to whom schemes of compulsory contributory insurance cannot be applied.  The first class referred to is defined by the test of insurance under the National Health Insurance Acts, i.e., a non-contributory pension is payable to a widow of a man who, when he died, was insured under these Acts.  The second class referred to is defined by reference to the valuation of the holding occupied at date of death and comprised only small-holders whose valuation did not exceed £8.  Further, in both classes, payment of pension is limited to widows who have dependent children and to widows aged 60 and over who have no dependent children.  The pensions are smaller in amount than the contributory rates and, subject to the other conditions, are paid only to necessitous widows; that is to say, all non-contributory pensions are payable subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> The experience of the working of the non-contributory scheme has disclosed certain anomalies and inequities which have already been referred to in this House.  For instance, many widows who are in fact necessitous have failed to qualify for pension because their husbands were not insured under the National Health Insurance Acts.  These include the widows of independent tradesmen such as blacksmiths, bootmakers, jobbing carpenters, painters, carters, slaters, etc., etc.  Another type of case under which hardship arose was where the husband, when employed, was normally insured under the National Health Insurance Acts, but where prolonged unemployment before death resulted in the termination of his insurance. Among small holders instances of a similar nature occurred as, for example, where the holding was just over the valuation limit of £8 or where the holding had been assigned to a son before death, or where, after death, the widow had ceased to reside on the holding.</P>
    <P>The whole question has now been reconsidered in the light of the experience which has been gained in the operation of the Act since January, 1936, and the Government has arrived at the decision that, so far as non-contributory pensions are concerned, the most logical and equitable course is to remove all the tests regarding the nature of the occupation of the deceased husband or parents.  The Bill accordingly provides for the repeal of those sections of the 1935 Act which limited the classes of deceased persons to whose widows and orphans non-contributory pensions would be payable. Further, under the existing statute, a non-contributory pension cannot be paid to a widow who has no dependent child, unless she is aged 60 years or over.  The Bill proposes to reduce this to the age of 55.  The effect of the new proposals is, therefore, that non-contributory pensions will be payable to all necessitous widows who have dependent children, to all necessitous widows who have no dependent children but who are 55 years of age or over and to all necessitous orphans, irrespective altogether of the nature of the occupation of the <Col N="1144" /> deceased husband or parents.  These are the main proposals in the Bill now before you and they are of farreaching importance.  As I will explain later on, these proposals will considerably increase the number of beneficiaries under the non-contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>The next most important change which is proposed, is to modify the means test in favour of claimants.  In assessing income under the Act of 1935 special exemptions from earned income were allowed to widows who had dependent children.  These exemptions were at the rate of 2/6 for each child in the case of a resident in a county borough, 2/3 in the case of a resident in an urban area and 2/- in the case of a resident in a rural area, with a maximum exemption of 7/6, 6/9 and 6/- respectively.  The Bill proposes to apply these exemptions also to cases where the income is unearned.  Consequently, the necessity for distinguishing between earned and unearned income disappears and provision is made for the necessary amendment in the First Schedule to the Act of 1935.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is proposed to exempt up to an amount not exceeding £6 10s. 0d. a year or 2/6 a week, any charitable donations or voluntary payments made by organisations or institutions or by relatives or other persons not contributing towards their own board and lodging.  In addition, it is proposed to exempt income received by way of bonus or grants made to persons residing in Gaeltacht areas by the Department of Education, in cases where Irish is used as the language of the home.  In order to remove doubts, provision is also made that home assistance, if received, will not be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The effect of these proposals will be that, in the first instance, in assessing income, no account will be taken of home assistance, Gaeltacht grant or the first 2/6 per week of charitable payments.  Any income still remaining after these deductions have been made will further be reduced as follows: in county boroughs, by amounts varying from 5/- in the case of a widow with no children to 12/6 in the case of a widow with three or <Col N="1145" /> more children; in urban areas, by amounts varying from 4/- in the case of a widow with no children to 10/9 in the case of a widow with three or more children; in rural areas, by amounts varying from 3/- in the case of a widow with no children to 9/- in the case of a widow with three or more children</P>
    <P>The only income which will be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the pension payable will be any income remaining after all these deductions have been made.  It follows that a widow with three children residing in a county borough might have a total income, apart from home assistance, of 15/- a week and still get the maximum pension, applicable in her case, of 14/- a week.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been directed against the payment of low rates of pension in certain cases.  It will be obvious that, in such cases, the widow is in receipt of other income.  The fact that a low rate of pension is payable is very often an indication that the widow concerned is better off than the widow to whom the maximum rate of pension is payable.</P>
    <P>Further minor alterations are also proposed, of which the following may be mentioned:&mdash;Under the existing statute, a dependent child is a child who is under the age of 14 years, or a child who is under 16, but who, on attaining the age of 14, was under full-time instruction in a day-school and continues thereafter under such full-time instruction.  Some doubt has arisen as to whether, under this provision, a child whose period of instruction is interrupted after the age of 14 qualifies for an allowance.  In order to remove this doubt, it is now proposed to treat a child as dependent during any periods between the age of 14 and 16 while he is attending school. Power is also taken to make regulations to include certain periods as periods of attendance at school, as, for example, periods of recognised school holidays or periods during which the school is closed on account of an epidemic, etc.</P>
    <P>Cases have also arisen where orphans' pensions claimed in respect of <Col N="1146" /> illegitimate children had to be refused because the death of both parents could not be proved.  In such cases it is proposed that a pension will be payable if the mother is dead and if the father is unknown.  Under the existing provisions, a claimant is given one month after the death of her husband in which to make a claim.  If the claim is made within the period of a month, the pension is payable as from date of death.  If the claim is made after the expiration of a month, the pension is paid from date of claim. Experience has shown that this period of a month is too short, and it is proposed to extend it to three months.</P>
    <P>Contributory pensions are payable at present outside Saorstát Eireann in cases where the pensioner is resident in an appointed country.  An appointed country is a country with a similar scheme of contributory pensions under which payments of pension are made in the Saorstát.  Great Britain and Northern Ireland are appointed countries, because they have schemes of pensions to widows and orphans which are substantially the same as the contributory scheme in force here, and under these schemes pensions are payable in the Saorstát.  Accordingly, the existing statute provides for the payment of contributory pensions to persons going to reside in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, subject always, of course, to the conditions regarding insurance in the Saorstát having been satisfied.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that when a widow, who is in receipt of a contributory pension, reaches the age of 70, she becomes entitled to an old age pension of 10/- a week under the Old Age Pensions Acts without any test as to means.  A difficulty arose here, because old age pensions are not payable outside the Saorstát.  It is accordingly proposed in the Bill that where a woman becomes entitled to an old age pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts because she was in receipt of a contributory widow's pension, then the old age pension to which she becomes entitled may be paid to her if she becomes resident in an appointed country.  Under similar conditions an old age pension payable under the British or Northern Ireland <Col N="1147" /> Old Age Pensions Acts is payable in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, certain minor amendments which are of an administrative character, or are intended to clarify the provisions of the 1935 Act. It will be observed also that the principal amendments will not come into force until a day which is to be appointed.  It will be appreciated that some time will be required to reexamine all the claims which have been rejected under the Act of 1935 and also the large number of new claims to be expected as a result of this Bill.  Every effort will be made to deal expeditiously with these cases, and it is hoped to have the new pensions paid within a few months after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the effect of the proposals will be to increase considerably the number of persons entitled to non-contributory pensions and, as a consequence, the annual cost of these pensions.  Under the present scheme the number of persons in receipt of pensions, the weekly cost of these pensions and the corresponding annual cost are as follows&mdash;the figures relate to the 31st January of this year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Contributory scheme&mdash;Number of widows, 795; number of dependent children (including orphans), 1,370; weekly cost, £636 6s. 6d.; corresponding annual cost, £33,089.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory scheme&mdash;Number of widows, 13,797; number of dependent children (including orphans), 13,065; weekly cost, £4,567 19s. 0d.; corresponding annual cost, £237,533.</P>
    <P>The figures for both classes combined are:&mdash;Widows, 14,592; dependent children and orphans, 14,435; weekly cost, £5,204 5s. 6d.; corresponding annual cost, £270,622.</P>
    <P>The new proposals will not affect the cost of the contributory scheme, which, as I have already mentioned, will increase steadily from year to year. When the Act of 1935 was before the Dáil, I stated that in making estimates of cost considerable difficulty was experienced, as full material was not always available on which to base calculations.  Although considerable experience has been gained, the extension <Col N="1148" /> to include all necessitous widows makes it very difficult to make firm estimates.  Taking all the facts known to us into consideration, the best estimate, so far as the non-contributory scheme is concerned, is that under the new proposals the number of beneficiaries in the first year will be 41,500 widows and 29,000 children (including orphans).  These numbers will be subject to reduction in future years as the number of persons entitled to contributory pensions increases.</P>
    <P>The principle adopted in financing the scheme under the Act of 1935 was to estimate the income and expenditure over a period of ten years and to set off the surplus arising in the early years against the deficiencies which will normally occur in the later years. The resulting excess of total expenditure over total income for the ten years was then met by an equal annual subvention from the State in each of these years.  The 1935 Act accordingly provided for an annual State subvention of £250,000 for each of the first ten years.  Of this ten-year period, two years have elapsed, and two annual payments of £250,000 each have been made.  It is now estimated that the new proposals will require an additional subvention of £200,000 for each of the remaining eight years of the period, and in arriving at this amount regard was had to the surplus already in hand as a result of the first year's working of the scheme.  The Bill accordingly proves that for the remaining eight financial years of the ten-year period the State subvention is to be at the rate of £450,000 instead of £250,000 as originally provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill, which, I must say, is certainly a very generous measure.  The class to which it is applied are the most deserving of all the classes we have in this State and the most hard-working.  From experience we have had all over the country, it can be said that no other class were really as worried or as hard wrought as widows to try and find some means of subsistence for themselves and their families.  The Minister has certainly met their cases very fairly and very well, and, as he <Col N="1149" /> has referred to the criticisms offered in the House on previous occasions, I may say that he has gone into every one of them, as far as my recollection takes me.  It certainly is a great relief to know that the cases of all necessitous widows and all necessitous orphans are now about to be met.  It has been with local authorities, particularly boards of health, a cause of constant worry as to how these people's claims could be met.  The decision of the Minister not to take into calculation under this Bill whatever local authorities are prepared to give to widows by way of home assistance is a right step, and particularly is that true of what they might receive by way of assistance from friends and charitable institutions and bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, I think that the situation has been very well met indeed, and I compliment the Minister on meeting it in this particular way. While the estimate the Minister has given of £450,000 is in itself a large sum of money to provide annually, it is, at the same time, a consolation to know that the State is doing the right thing by the most necessitous people in the country.  I do not know exactly whether the widow with one child is being treated just as fairly as she might be, as distinct from the others.  However, I think the Minister, as far as we can gather from his statement, has dealt very fairly with all the classes.  I am particularly gratified that the Minister has taken note of the criticism offered from, I think, every Party in the House with regard to the cases of orphans between 14 and 16 years of age.  After all, a child between 14 and 16 years is often a greater worry and a greater load to a widow than younger children, and the Minister certainly has done the right thing in deciding that those children between 14 and 16, if they are still going to school, will be entitled to receive benefit.  That will not alone be a help to the widow, but it will ensure that the education of the children will be looked after so that they will be better fitted for the battle of life than they otherwise would.  On the whole, we welcome the Bill, and I take the opportunity of congratulating <Col N="1150" /> the Minister in meeting, I think, all the points of criticism offered in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated not only on the very substantial amendments of the main Act, but on the very comprehensive speech which he has delivered in explanation of the provisions of this new Bill which, when dovetailed into the main Act, will become an extremely complicated piece of social legislation. I am glad that many of the provisions of the new Bill will remove some obvious cases of hardship which manifested themselves under the main Bill.  The removal, in particular, of the insurance qualification represents a very distinct advance, because many of the claimants for widows' and orphans' pensions were persons whose husbands died many years ago, at a time when national health insurance was in its infancy, and when it was not possible to obtain the reliable information about national health insurance membership that can be obtained to-day. The removal of that requisite from the main Act will enable many deserving persons to obtain widows' and orphans' pensions which were denied them because of the rather rigid provisions of the main Act in that respect.  Similarly, I think deletion of the provision that a person must be a small holder and must continue to reside on the holding removes another rather irksome provision, with which it was found extremely difficult to comply. In the course of my handling of widows' and orphans' pensions claims, I came across one case where a widow lived on an island off the Donegal coast.  She was compelled to evacuate the island one night by reason of a high Atlantic tide, and next morning when she went to the mainland to see if it was safe to go back to the island, she had considerable difficulty in locating it.  The Atlantic had often come in and gone out but did not do so on this particular occasion.  The widow made application for a widows' and orphans' pension, and was refused on the grounds that she had not continued to reside on the holding.  I am glad, in that particular case, that that very obvious anomaly will be <Col N="1151" /> removed, and that widows in such circumstances will not be accountable for the misconduct of the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some features of this legislation upon which I should like the Minister to ponder.  One is the limitation of the scope of the legislation to persons in receipt of an income at a rate not exceeding £250 per annum. In interpreting that £250 per annum, it must not be assumed that it relates to the entire income of £250.  Persons receiving less than £250 may be excluded from the scope of the Act, because there are periods when they are earning in excess of £250.  It is desirable that the legislature should make provision for widows with dependent children where the father was in receipt of an income not exceeding £250, but it is also desirable that it should make provision for widows and children where the income is more than that, because it is often extremely difficult in these cases to determine the degree of distress among the families.  A person with an income of £300 might, having regard to family responsibilities, be in a really worse position than a person with an income of £200 or £250.  I know that it may be said that a line must be drawn somewhere, but I wonder if we are right in drawing the line at £250, seeing that in other respects such as under the Workmen's Compensation Act we extended the provisions to persons in receipt of an income not exceeding £350 per annum.  Of course, the rates under the Workmen's Compensation Act can be much higher than £350 per annum where the person was engaged in manual work.  I should like to know if it is possible, under the amending Bill, for the Minister to consider, in respect of contributory pensions, an extension of the scope of the Bill to bring in persons who are in receipt of an income in excess of £250.  It may be necessary under the Bill to draw the line somewhere, but I suggest to the Minister that in these days, when £250 per annum goes relatively such a short distance, it is a rather low figure at which to draw the line for purposes of widows' and orphans' pensions.  If it is not possible to meet the matter in that way it might be possible to consider <Col N="1152" /> it from the standpoint of allowing such persons as so desire to become voluntary contributors under the Act where the income exceeds £250 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that in assessing the claims of applicants for pensions under the amending Bill the home assistance received by them would not be taken into consideration. That is a wise and a reasonable provision, and indicates that the Minister does not desire that the rights of applicants under the Bill should be refused merely because they are drawing income from the local authorities.  But I am sorry to say that the Minister's generosity in this respect is not reciprocated by the local authorities, and I know dozens of cases where persons who are in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions, even at non-contributory rates, find it almost impossible to get local authorities to give them any home assistance. Formerly these persons were entitled to home assistance, and in fact actually received it, from the local authorities.  This Legislature passed the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and the local authorities promptly seized upon the enactment of that legislation to deprive necessitous widows and children of the amount of home assistance they formerly required. I have no hesitation in telling the Minister that, on quite a large scale, local authorities are now refusing to discharge their responsibilities to necessitous people because they are in receipt of non-contributory pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  The Minister who introduced that Act was the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and he objected to have to ask local authorities to do anything in that matter.  I suggest to the Minister that it is not unreasonable, and not even undemocratic, to direct local authorities to do the right thing where it is obvious they have been doing the wrong thing.  The Minister does not desire in this amending Bill that they should take into consideration what persons receive in the way of home assistance, but his generosity will be rendered nugatory by reason of the fact that the local authorities take into consideration the widows' <Col N="1153" /> and orphans' pensions which these people received, and consequently deprived them of home assistance.  If the Minister believes it his right to leave the persons concerned with home assistance, and with the widows' and orphans' pensions, then, as the Minister charged with the administration of local government, he should ensure that the generosity under this measure is not set at nought by the action of local authorities who may refuse home assistance in such cases.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of this legislation to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.  It is possible under the main Act for a person who ceases to be insurable under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme to pass into employment of an insurable kind but yet not be of a kind to come within the scope of the Act to continue as a voluntary contributor. For instance, a person with an income of £240 per annum is eligible to come within the scope of the main Act.  If that person received £260 he is excluded from the scope of the main Act but could within 12 months exercise the right to become a voluntary contributor provided he remains in insurable occupation in the meantime. There are cases where persons who may have an income of £240 per annum may be compelled to relinquish their employment through ill-health.  By reason of the fact that they did not continue in insurable employment these persons are completely outside the scope of the main Act and lose any contributions that may have been standing to their credit.  A person might not be able to continue in insurable employment because his health becomes impaired and it might not be possible to obtain any kind of employment, insurable or otherwise.  I wonder if the Minister would look into that aspect of the matter, with a view to allowing such persons, if they so desire, to continue under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act as voluntary contributors in cases where, owing to ill-health, they are unable to continue in insurable employment, but yet out of such resources as they have they desire to cover their widows and children under the main Act.  I cannot imagine that <Col N="1154" /> an option of that kind would throw any particular burden on the State, because I presume it is calculated that voluntary contributors will not become a liability on the State, since they are required to pay the entire contributions as actuarially obtained in order to maintain the solvency of the contributory side of the fund.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I desire to refer is the rates paid to non-contributory beneficiaries under the main Act.  The Minister has improved the provision somewhat by deleting certain sources of income which were formerly taken into consideration in calculating the means of an applicant for the purpose of a non-contributory pension, but there are cases and there will continue to be cases where widows are unable to obtain any sort of income as a result of their own efforts, either because of their family circumstances or because of physical or mental disabilities of one kind or another.  In those cases the widows are not likely to have any source of income as a result of their own exertions, and may find it extremely difficult to secure an income from any charitable source.  In those cases the rates of benefits provided under the non-contributory scheme are small.  I think the Minister will willingly admit that fact.  I should have liked, therefore, if the Minister had found it possible to increase the non-contributory rates, particularly in the cases of persons who have no income whatever, because in those cases the benefits are extremely small and purchase very little nowadays in view of the rising cost of living.  If it is not possible to meet a plea of this kind on this Bill I certainly should like to stake a claim with the Minister that any further expenditure in respect of widows' and orphans' pensions should be in the direction of improving the non-contributory rates, particularly in respect of persons who have no income whatever, and consequently cannot avail of the beneficial amendments to the main Act which have been made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the whole, Sir, taking the lean with the fat, I think this is a generous measure.  It removes many anomalies which existed in the main Act, and it <Col N="1155" /> brings in new classes of benefit in what I have always considered to be a very valuable piece of social legislation.  I think that the minimum the State can do is to look after the nation's widows, and to look after the nation's fatherless children.  Social legislation of this kind is one of the best means by which the State can show the individual citizen that, while he or she has responsibilities to the State, the State on the other hand recognises and will meet to the limit of its capacity its responsibilities towards the individual citizens of the nation.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been received with considerable congratulation. I am always a bit sceptical when I hear this flow of congratulation for a measure in this House.  I remember when the original measure was introduced, it sort of terrified everybody in the House; they were so delighted with it that they would not open their mouths about it.  While this Bill goes a considerable distance to improve on the parent measure, Deputies will come back here before very long to find that this Bill does not go quite so far as they thought, more particularly when you come to the overwhelming number of widows who will come under the non-contributory part of the Bill.  They are situated in the rural parts of this State, and the provision with regard to cash allowances will be nil in the main.  There may be an exceptional case where a widow gets a small sum of money from somebody; I am not talking about money from public assistance or from charitable organisations. There is an allowance of 15/- a week which a widow can receive with regard to the contributory part.  What is the experience of Deputies who have handled a large portion of those claims with regard to the non-contributory part of the parent measure?  I stated it here before, and I am going to repeat it to-day.  In practically every case where a widow is living in a cottage you will find attached to that cottage a very small piece of ground.  It is probably less than a rood; it is not more than a rood in any case and much less than a rood in <Col N="1156" /> many cases.  There are a few heads of cabbage stuck in some part of this piece of ground at the back of the cottage, and the assessment on that is such as to bring her down 5/-, 3/-, or 2/- A widow in a cottage is generally brought down to about 3/-.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is going to be applied in that manner I have no welcome for it &mdash;none whatever.  It is useless to deceive ourselves that, with the increased cost of living to which Deputy Norton has referred, 3/- a week is of any use to a woman in that position.  The Minister, of course, has very humanely made provision here that certain moneys will not be taken into consideration in assessing the means.  What is the practice, and what is going to be the practice in those cases?  There are a lot of widows now getting perhaps 6/- or 7/- a week in the way of public assistance, or from the St. Vincent de Paul Society or some other organisation. The moment she applies for a pension under this Act and is awarded any sum, irrespective of the amount, she will be immediately told that she is getting the widows' and orphans' pension, and will cease to receive any assistance from public funds.  For her, it would have been much better if this Bill were never passed, because if she is otherwise qualified the local authority will cut off whatever money they have been giving to her, and ask her to apply for a pension under this Act.  We get that sort of situation under various Acts.  A case was brought to my notice the other day where a man was receiving public assistance because he was blind and unable to work.  The local authority intimated to him that they would no longer pay him that sum because he was entitled to get a blind pension.  The curious anomaly was that he applied for a blind pension and did not get it.  Between the Blind Pensions Act and the Home Assistance Act the man is now destitute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister with regard to the administration of this Act.  It is not fair to apply the means test in every case on the same basis as if you were awarding 10/-; there should be a proportionate <Col N="1157" /> reduction in the assessment of means when you are only giving a 5/- pension. I would suggest to the Minister that instructions should be given that in the case of a woman living in a cottage, where there is only a plot of ground less than a rood, most of which is utilised as a run for a few chickens, with a few heads of cabbage in some corner of it, there should be no means test applied.  In the rural parts of the State my experience is that an enormous number of those widows are placed in those circumstances.  This allowance provision, of course, looks very humane on paper.  Again I repeat that in practice it is nugatory. Deputy Norton has referred to the practice of the local authority the moment they find that a woman is entitled to get a widows' and orphans' pension.  Of course, if she is getting more from the local authority than she knows she can get under this Act she will not want to apply, but they will make her apply or she goes without anything.  I am glad that the Minister has seen his way with regard to the extension of the allowance to children from 14 to 16, and also that he has included&mdash;though he did not refer to it here in explaining the Bill&mdash;orphans between the ages of 14 and 16 who are in any way, by reason of mental or physical disability, incapable of working.  They are a problem not only up to 16, but ever afterwards, and some machinery will have to be devised to deal with that problem, because they are generally a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the provision with regard to the widow of a small holder has been amended.  As the original Bill stood, it should have been obvious that the thing was completely anomalous, because the widow who was able to remain on the small holding was able to eke out some sort of existence out of the land, but the widow who did not reside on the holding was the widow, in most cases who, through ill-health and utter incapacity to tackle the job of working a small farm, had to depend on the charity of a married brother, sister or other relation.  She and her children had to be maintained by some of these persons and, under this part of the Act, this class of persons was completely <Col N="1158" /> prohibited from getting a pension. The thing was unreasonable and illogical, and I am glad that it is amended here because it caused serious hardship to a class of widow that should have benefited.  The widow who was fit to remain on the farm was in the position that her children were growing up and were coming to an age at which they were capable of doing something on the land, but in the other case, the poor widow was unable to remain because she was incapable of doing anything in regard to working the land.  In some cases in rural Ireland we know that neighbours are very helpful and very charitable, but in other districts that does not prevail.  You get different types of people with a different spirit of neighbourliness and where a widow was unable to do any farm work she got into such a state economically that she had to clear out and live with some relation.  In many cases, they lived under very miserable conditions. I am glad that will disappear when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>As to more generous treatment under this Bill, the financial aspect of any matter is a big problem.  It is quite easy to be generous if you have the money, but I am not at all satisfied that this State could not do more than give 5/- to a widow and her orphans. I ask the House to consider what that 5/- is worth to a widow with one, two or three children and no other income in respect of produce from a small farm or anything like that.  What is its purchasing power?  It is practically worthless.  I ask any Deputy if he could provide coal, clothing and food for himself and two or three children if the weekly amount he received was 5/-.  The thing is really fantastic.  Can the finances of this State bear any more generous provision in this regard?  I submit they can if the Government really applied itself to the problem.  Facts are blunt things and it is as well always to face them.  There is no use in asking the Minister to do something which one could not do if one were in the Minister's position, but I have been looking for some means by which money could be got to make more generous provision with regard to the non-contributory part of this Bill, and <Col N="1159" /> I notice that last year England collected in penal tariffs £250,000 over and above what was due.  I have examined the British accounts for the current year and I find that the estimate there is for a surplus of £750,000.  In justice, I think that some machinery should be arranged by which a wealthy nation like England would not take that amount over and above the amount due to her from us.</P>
    <P>There are also enormous sums being spent in making it possible for England to collect that money and, considering the enormous increase in the cost of living, arising from these facts, we should be more generous than we are being in respect of the non-contributory side of this Bill.  I think the Minister, when approaching this matter, should have kept that in view and should have been stern when the arrangements&mdash;and they are now definite arrangements&mdash;were being made between this State and Great Britain in regard to the moneys she is collecting and more rigid machinery should have been created whereby, when England had received the amount due, the balance would be returned.</P>

I do submit that it will be found when it is put into practice that the Deputies will not have quite as big a welcome for it as they have to-day.  Deputies and the country will find that when the machinery is set going and the means test applied, the Bill will not have gone very far at all.  It may give 1/- or 2/- a week to help the old people to pay for the bus going to church or chapel on Sunday, but in the main it will be found that what they will get in the way of additional payments will not very much increase their purchasing power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McMenamin, I welcome the Bill, and I welcome <Col N="1160" /> it despite what may happen later.  We all know that when a Bill is put into operation complaints will arise in its working, but these drawbacks will only encourage the Minister to improve the Bill.  I have one particular complaint to make, and I do not think that any remedy is being provided for that in this Bill.  That complaint is in connection with the proving of the death of the husband in certain cases. To get a declaration of presumption of death by the court is a very expensive proceeding.  I have in mind one case where a man suffering from a nervous breakdown got away from the hospital.  His body was never found, but the Guards were of opinion that the man had been drowned.  The widow made an application for a pension, and the reply to that was that she would have to prove the death of the husband.  I quite appreciate there may be a doubt in some cases of that kind where people, in the belief that the husband may have died, may make a claim for pension.  But in this particular case the Guards were satisfied that the man had been drowned. There was no inquest because they could not find the body; the woman was without resources sufficient to bring the case to court asking the judge to presume death.  We all have heard of a case recently where, though the body was not found, a relative of the missing person was found guilty. In the case to which I am referring there is a widow with seven children, and the board of health are making a weekly allowance to them.  All the evidence in the possession of the Guards was submitted to the pension authorities.  This evidence showed that the man was seen within a few yards of the sea front, and the presumption now is that he was drowned.  I submit that is the sort of case in which the State should provide some machinery for proving death.  It should not be necessary to compel the widow or children to go to the expense of an action in the courts.  I appeal also to the Minister to increase the amount payable in the case of the non-contributory section.  The Wicklow Board of Health find it costs 10/- to maintain patients in the county home. Now in the county home all the necessaries <Col N="1161" /> are purchased in bulk by contract. Still it costs 10/- to maintain one person.  In the face of that, how can a woman in the non-contributory class maintain herself and her three children on 9/- a week?  I know that the board of health in Wicklow is not of the type that I have heard described in this House.  They granted an allowance of 5/- a week to maintain the widow and children even where the woman is getting 9/- a week pension for herself and the children.  I am referring now to a case where the husband died in 1933.  That man was not insured and he never drew one penny from the National Health Insurance. There are a number of cases of that kind, and I appeal to the Minister to take a note of them with a view to increasing the allowances.  I again appeal for some machinery so that the pension people would be in a position to presume death in a case like that to which I have referred&mdash;that is, say, a case where the Gárda authorities would be in a position to give very convincing evidence.  Without any concession at all the Bill is very welcome to those poor people who are looking forward to it, even though the Minister has not seen his way to bring in a Pension Bill of a non-contributory class the same as is being operated in the North of Ireland.  I do submit that we here in the South should give similar benefit to the widows and orphans.  That would be great encouragement to these people, who would then be able to say that they are not treated in a less generous fashion than their comrades in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I could not help thinking, while listening to Deputy McMenamin, that if the Minister brought in the most generous measure in the world, the Deputy and the Opposition would still say that he should have gone much further.  The people of this country have been looking forward for ten or 15 years for a measure of this kind.  Deputies opposite, and the Government for which they stood, made no move and no effort to meet the wishes of the widows and orphans of the country in this regard. I welcome this measure, for not alone <Col N="1162" /> will it be appreciated by the Deputies, but it will be appreciated by the community generally.  The people recognise the helpful action of the Government in introducing this measure, amending the Bill previously brought in.</P>
      <P>I would like now to draw the attention of the Minister to the question of the means test.  Some anomalies have been removed, and in view of that I would appeal that a liberal interpretation be put on this question of means. In my experience, the assessment of the values of the applicants' assets is entirely too rigid.  That has been shown by the decisions arrived at.  In other words, the values put on the commodities and on the applicants' holdings are rather too high.  I suggest to the Minister that these calculations should be made by the investigation officers on a more liberal basis than that on which they are being made at present.  In rural areas, especially, the values placed on these things by the investigation officers would seem to indicate that a very rigid means test is applied.</P>
      <P>That, I think, is the only matter to which I need refer.  I am making this appeal to the Minister in the hope that he will give some intimation to the investigation officers that the assessment of means will not in future be as rigid and drastic as it has been heretofore.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Dillon, Deputy Norton, and the other Deputies who received this Bill so well.  Deputies have offered congratulations to the Minister and the Government for the excellence of this measure.  That is a very unusual thing, but, in this instance, it is true.  From the very start, we were anxious to make the provisions of this measure as liberal as possible.  The first Bill was introduced in 1935.  My own Party, as a whole, and the Government itself, were very keen on seeing that the Bill should, if possible, include every necessitous widow and orphan in the country.  Not having at our disposal statistics which would give us an exact <Col N="1163" /> idea of what the cost of such legislation was likely to be, we had to move slowly and carefully.  The Bill introduced by me in 1935 on behalf of the Government did not go as far as the Government would have wished.  We have had a year's experience of the working of that measure, and, as a result of that experience, we have been able to introduce this Bill.  As I have already said, from now on a total sum of at least £450,000 will be devoted to this purpose.  That estimate may be exceeded.  The Department of Finance will have to see that we keep, as far as possible, within our estimate, but I am inclined to think that we shall have to go beyond the limit fixed.  The sum of £450,000 is a large sum, but, as Deputy Brennan said, it is by no means too large when we consider the people who are to be the beneficiaries.  The amendments contained in this Bill alter the terms of the original Act in a fundamental way, but the alterations are in the right direction, as all the Deputies, with the possible exception of Deputy McMenamin, are agreed.  I do not think that Deputy McMenamin would, notwithstanding his criticism, refuse the Bill.  I should not expect Deputy Norton or Deputy Everett, or their colleagues, to say that they were entirely satisfied with the Bill.  It would be unnatural to expect them to take up that position where social legislation is concerned.  On these matters they have to take up an Oliver Twist attitude.  Taking what they can get, they have to ask for something more, in order to let the people know that they are the guardians&mdash;they would like us to believe the only guardians&mdash;of the poor and working classes.</P>

      <P>We could not expect these Deputies to adopt any other attitude.  It would not be in their own interest, from the point of view of Party politics, or any other standpoint.  To give credit where credit is due, Deputy Norton did join with Deputy Brennan in congratulating <Col N="1164" /> the Government on the measure now before the House.  I am sure he was sincere when he made these remarks.  Deputy Everett and every other Deputy who examines this Bill must admit that the Government have gone a long way to meet&mdash;to use a hackneyed expression&mdash;a long felt want.  We are not as wealthy as the people of Great Britain.  There is no comparison between our resources and their resources.  It is very hard for us to enter into competition with them on matters such as this.  Generally speaking, however, I think that the Government have done well.  I would not attempt to say that it has made up its mind that it has done all that is necessary or that it would like to do.  As I stated when introducing the original measure, I knew that the provisions of that Bill did not satisfy a great many people.  They did not fully satisfy myself or other members of the Government, but I knew that, at frequent intervals, amending legislation would have to be introduced so as to improve the provisions of that measure.  We have the first evidence of that here now and it is quite on the cards that, in another year or two, I or some other Deputy representing the present Government, will be bringing in a measure to improve still further this piece of social legislation and other pieces of social legislation for which this Government and, perhaps, its predecessor were originally responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a few points as to certain aspects of the Bill.  One point was as to making the original Act applicable to the widows of persons who were in receipt of incomes of over £250 a year.  I do not think that that can be done.  One of the difficulties is that that limit of income also applies in the case of national health insurance, unemployment insurance and, perhaps, to other pieces of social legislation.  Therefore, amendments would be required in all these Acts if the maximum of £250, as fixed by the existing law, were to be altered. I do not think that there is any tremendous demand for such an amendment at the present time.  If there is, I have not had any evidence of it.  Even if the demand were there, it is one that would require very <Col N="1165" /> serious consideration because of the reactions it would have on other pieces of social legislation.  So far as I know, there is no great demand for such an amendment at the present time.  There will always be cases where widows, whose husbands had an income of £250 a year or over, become necessitous.  I know cases of that type myself.  Irrespective of what the husband's income had been, these necessitous widows will come within the ambit of existing legislation, same as any other necessitous widows.  That will be the case no matter what the social standing of the widows and their families may be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to local authorities who, in some cases, reduced the allowances which they had been in the habit of giving to widows and orphans before the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act came into operation.  There are such local authorities that have taken advantage of the moneys received from the Widows' and Orphans' Fund by these beneficiaries to reduce their own liabilities, or at any rate to reduce the sums that they had been paying to these poor people.  I think that is a mean advantage to take, and that local authorities ought not to do that. This measure was introduced for the purpose of benefiting a most deserving class in the community.  If widows had been getting allowances from boards of public assistance they got them because they needed them.  Therefore, I think that a local authority ought not to take away from them any benefit that they have been in the habit of giving them up to the present.  The Act was not intended primarily to relieve local authorities of their obligations. I would like to repeat to Deputy Norton the words that I used to Deputy Hogan to-day: that my personal attitude towards local authorities is that I would like to see the elected body functioning, and functioning properly.  I would like to see it do its work well and accepting its own responsibilities.  If I were a member of a local authority I would not like to have directions sent down to it maybe every week from the Minister.  I would resent it, and I am surprised at Deputy Norton and Deputy Hogan, and at other members, <Col N="1166" /> calling as often as they do on the Minister to order a local authority to do this and to direct a local authority to do something else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Corish has ever done that, so far as I am aware.  That certainly is not my attitude towards local authorities. I would like certainly to give them my opinion.  I have said what, in my opinion, local authorities should do on this question of the allowances that they have been in the habit of making to widows and orphans.  But, while expressing my opinion on that, I personally would not think it proper to send down orders or directions to any of these local authorities.  Even though it would be distasteful to me to have to do it, I would rather wipe out a local authority than be constantly sending down directions, orders and instructions to it on matters entirely within its own province to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will look into the matter that was mentioned by Deputy Norton about voluntary contributors.  I do not think that there is much that can be done in that way, but I will have the matters that he referred to examined.  Of course, the non-contributory rates are necessarily lower than the contributory rates.  It may be true that they are, perhaps, not over-generous, but within the limits of our resources here, I think it will be admitted that we have done well.  I think the House will recognise that.  I know, judging by the correspondence that I have received since the Act came into operation, that the widows recognise it. I am talking now particularly of the non-contributory part of the scheme. That, I know, has meant a very big change in the lives of many poor people whose resources were very modest indeed.  The 6/-, the 8/- and, in certain cases, the 10/- and 12/- additional going into many homes all over the country, by reason of the non-contributory pensions, has meant a very much improved standard of living for those poor people.  It was long wished for, and it has now been realised. I have received, I will not say <Col N="1167" /> from all parts of the country, but I have received many letters from poor widows telling me of the great advantage these pensions have been to them, and of how grateful they are to those who were responsible for introducing and putting into operation this pension scheme.</P>

Deputy Everett raised a point about a woman who found it difficult to prove the death of her husband.  There is a difficulty there. It is unfortunate for the woman that she is unable to prove the death. Death could be presumed in that case; but if that were done in one case you would have other cases arising, thereby establishing a precedent that it might be difficult for you not to follow, although you might not be satisfied with the evidence forthcoming that in some particular case the husband was dead.  In dealing with social legislation of this kind you will always find these extraordinary cases arising.  It is unfortunate for the individual unquestionably, but at the moment I cannot see any way of meeting the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;This grant will be paid over to a deposit account from which advances will be made to the Peat Fuel Company, Limited, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in such sums as he may from time to time determine.  The amount advanced will be secured by a debenture charged on all the assets of the company and will be repayable at such times and on such terms and conditions as the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may determine at the date of the advances or subsequently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, desirable to make it clear to Deputies that the Peat Fuel Company, Ltd., referred to there, is not the Turf Development Board which was established by the Government and which is financed annually by moneys voted here in the Estimates. The Peat Fuel Company, Ltd., is a private company which was formed in 1934 for the purpose of engaging in the production of a particular type of peat fuel by certain original methods&mdash; original both in respect of the harvesting of the peat and of the manipulation of it&mdash;which it had the right to use under licence from the patentees. It was financed with a capital of, approximately, £57,000, and made an application for, and received, a trade loan guarantee for £90,000.  At the time that the question of the application for the trade loan guarantee was under consideration I went very fully into the question of the practicability of the method of working which this company proposed to operate, and arranged for an expert examination, both into the plans of the company and into the actual working of a factory in Denmark where the same method of operation was being tried.  On the basis of the information supplied in the report of these experts as well as on <Col N="1170" /> the general conclusions I have reached from the plans submitted by the applicants, I decided that the object was one worth supporting.</P>
    <P>It was obvious, of course, that their plans were very experimental in nature and that the particular method of operation which they proposed to adopt might or might not prove suitable in the conditions prevailing in this country, even though they did appear to be working satisfactorily in Denmark and elsewhere.  In fact, the company found that the particular machinery which it had designed for an operation here was not altogether suitable.  The bog at which they were operating, situated in County Kildare, was a very wide and deep bog and different in its nature to the bogs existing in other countries, and the machinery, although in the opinion of these experts satisfactory in principle, was too heavy for successful operation upon Irish bogs, which involved the redesigning of that machinery to a very considerable extent.</P>
    <P>The process which the company, apparently, is operating is divided into two parts: first, the winning of the turf, and, secondly, the manipulation of that turf and its manufacture into briquettes.  So far as the briquetting plant was concerned, the company were successful in their operations.  The plant was created and, as a result of working on the amount of material that had been harvested, it produced satisfactory briquettes.  In any event, the company were secured by a guarantee from the designers and directors of the plant as to its efficiency.  The difficulties which the company encountered all arose in connection with the particular process of harvesting&mdash;a rather elaborate process involving the use of machinery to a great extent.  The company, as I explained, found that the machinery which had been designed by their experts, and which was put into operation, was unsuitable.  It was unsuitable mainly because it was too heavy, although in certain other respects it had to be redesigned and additional equipment was considered necessary.  In any event, the company were involved in considerable expense as a result of the necessity for changing <Col N="1171" /> their plant, and early in last year they approached my Department to explain that their liquid resources had become exhausted and that, if the experimental and operating work of the company was to continue throughout 1936, certain additional financial assistance would be required.  After consideration of the case they then made, I agreed to the creation of a new debenture which would rank in priority to the general debenture which the Government had secured upon all the assets of the company, and which was the security for our trade loan guarantee.  Unfortunately, however, 1936 proved to be a very unsatisfactory year for this company.  As Deputies will remember, it was exceedingly wet throughout the whole of the summer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what was the amount of the new debenture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>£20,000.  As I was saying, it was exceedingly wet throughout the whole summer, and the amount of material harvested was far short of that required for the economic working of the briquetting plant.  Furthermore, all the difficulties which the company had experienced in relation to its methods of harvesting peat were not fully overcome, and some further adaptation of the plant and equipment is apparently necessary.  At the end of 1936, therefore, the company found themselves in the position that once again their resources had been exhausted and they were facing a new season without the wherewithal to enable them to carry on their operations, and they placed the facts of that situation before me.  It was with very great care that I went into all the circumstances relating to the enterprise.  Of course, there are two Government directors on the board of the company and I had the benefit of their advice as well as having an opportunity of studying the very careful reports prepared by the company's own experts and those whose opinions it had sought upon the nature of this enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in conclusion, that the enterprise is one worth continuing with. <Col N="1172" /> The progress made gave good reason to believe that the difficulties which the company had encountered in the past could be overcome and, having regard to the very great importance in this country of perfecting a suitable method of working peat bogs in the particular manner it is doing, I felt we would be justified in granting the company further financial assistance. It is not practicable to give that further financial assistance by way of trade loan guarantee and, consequently, this procedure of coming to the Dáil for a Grant-in-Aid has been adopted.  We are proposing to ask the Dáil to agree to making £35,000 available, to be advanced from time to time, as I may consider it necessary, for the purposes of this company; each advance to be secured by a debenture upon all the assets of the company and to be repayable with interest at such rate as the Minister for Finance, in consultation with myself, may determine. It is proposed, however, that the Government will have the right, at its option, at any time after 1st April, 1939, to convert this new debenture into 35,000 A ordinary shares of £1 each, fully paid-up in the company. Each A ordinary share carries two votes per share; otherwise, these shares will rank <i>pari passu</i> with ordinary shares at present issued which will in future be designated as B ordinary shares.  The effect of that provision is that if the Government should choose to exercise that option, it will have complete voting control in the company.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary to say more to Deputies at this stage.  I think a number of Deputies are familiar with the particular enterprise to which I have referred.  It is one in which I take a personal interest, because I saw that, if successful, it offered very considerable possibilities for expansion.  The fuel produced is a very satisfactory fuel.  It has a high calorific value.  It is very easily transported, very clean, and will be very suitable for particular uses to which coal is put in this country.  It may be that the particular patented process which this company is operating will not prove successful, but I have come to the conclusion that there is <Col N="1173" /> at least a very good prospect of success and, that having regard to that, we are justified in advancing this money, in other words, in not allowing the experiment to collapse at this stage until it has been fully tried out.  If, at the end of the present year, the difficulties have not been overcome, and the financial difficulties have not been eased by the production of a marketable commodity which can be sold, then a new situation will arise.  But in the circumstances now existing, having regard to the climatic difficulties which prevented the company operating to the full extent last year, the nature of other difficulties with which the company have met, and which engineers and others assure them can be overcome, I think we ought to allow the experiment to proceed and to make available this money for the purpose.  If the enterprise is a success the money will be repaid, or, alternatively, we shall be able to take control of the enterprise, which is at present in the hands of a private company, and carry it on The reason why, in my opinion, that alternative course of action should be open to us is that whereas the private company interested in this process might be satisfied with the successful operation of one unit, certain national considerations might justify the expansion of the industry on a wide scale if successful.  We should be in a position to ensure that that will happen, having regard to substantial financial assistance which the State is giving to it.  On the other hand, if it is not considered desirable to promote such expansion, the full security of the assets of the company will be available to the State as against any advance which may be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company acquired in the first instance the full range of machinery it considered necessary. Some part of the machinery proved unsatisfactory in operation in Irish bogs and had to be scrapped entirely. New machines to carry out the particular operations for which the original machines were designed were <Col N="1174" /> then planned and constructed.  Some of the other machines which the company was operating, although apparently satisfactory in principle&mdash; in other words, the design and purpose of the machine proved all right&mdash;proved too heavy upon the bog on which they were operating.  The bog is very deep. It has a depth of from 20 to 25 feet, and the machinery had only previously been operated on a commercial scale on a much shallower bog at the factory in Denmark where the process was tried out on a large scale.  Various alterations were made in the machines in order to suit the conditions on Irish bogs, some of which were satisfactory and some of which were not.  I could not say that at the present time the company is satisfied that it has got all the machinery necessary for successful operation.  There is still a certain amount of experimental work in the designing of machines to be done, but we are assured by those who are our advisers in the matter that the task of designing that machinery is not a matter of any insuperable difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it was bought in Great Britain, some of it on the Continent, and some of it was constructed here.  The machinery at the factory itself was constructed by Babock &amp; Wilcox, who are financially interested in the project.  They are the firm who are guaranteeing the efficiency of the factory.  There is no difficulty as regards the machinery there.  The difficulty is in relation to the part of the work that precedes the operations in the factory.  Part of the machinery had to be specially constructed, and various engineering firms were called upon to do that.  I think I am right in saying that some parts were constructed where the personal supervision of the manager could be given, as everything seemed to depend on the designing of suitable machinery.</P>

I cannot guarantee in any way that this company is going to be successful in its operations, but I have reasonable grounds for believing that it will be successful.  In any event, having regard to the considerable advantage it would be to this country if it were successful, I think we are justified in giving this financial assistance to enable the experimental work to be concluded.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes to this House and asks the House to vote a sum of money for an industrial enterprise, the first thing he should endeavour to do is to establish confidence in the enterprise.

It is certainly very hard for anybody having listened to the Minister's introduction of this Estimate to feel any confidence in the enterprise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supposed to have the power to take over full control eventually.  When, after we have paid the £35,000 and received our A ordinary shares, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Government of the country, whatever Party will be the Government at the time, are looking forward to getting anything out of the company, they will be disappointed, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>I do not at all agree that the development of peat is of such grave national importance; I think there is entirely too much being made about it from that point of view.  When the Minister tells us that, owing to the climatic conditions, those people could not make good last year, that makes me rather sceptical that they are ever going to be able to make good.  When they started to use machinery they might have made some effort to select the type of machinery that would be able to overcome climatic conditions. We can all save turf, hand-made turf or machined turf, if we get the climate. So far as this proposal goes, the Minister asks us to make a further grant to a company that apparently has not succeeded in overcoming climatic conditions in the making of turf briquettes.  I do not think that is a fair proposition, and I do not think the Minister has made any case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has told us that the whole scheme is largely experimental.  That is the only justification offered for asking the House to make another advance towards this enterprise.  Is an experiment of this type, carried on by a company that is not able to overcome climatic conditions, of such grave <Col N="1177" /> importance to this country that we ought to expend this large sum of money on it?  Personally I do not think it is.  The Minister has made no case for the advance of £35,000 except this, that there are certain people who apparently made a mistake in bringing over machinery that is of no use to them now and they may have to scrap it; they have, in other words, squandered their own and a good deal of our money.  It is a very poor case.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not even tell us what they did produce when they were working.  What are they able to produce? He mentioned that the briquettes had a high calorific value. Possibly they had.  When this business is established what will it turn out and what price will be charged to the public?  What relationship will the product bear to ordinary turf or coal? We ought to be told what the company is capable of doing, provided it has the right machinery and is able to go ahead.  The Minister has not given us the information we require.  All he tells us is that here is a company that has been a failure, and, because it is regarded as being in the experimental stage, it should be given some further assistance.  I think the Minister has made a very poor case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan said that the only case made for this grant is that the production of peat briquettes is purely experimental.  He does not think that that is a good case. I wonder what he would consider a good case in the way of an experiment? He does not think the development of our peat resources is of great national importance.  What would he consider of great national importance in the way of industrial enterprise? If there is one thing we have that might be a special asset, it is our peat resources.  If they are not found to be an asset, then, apart from our land, we are poor indeed, because I think we recognise by this time that we have not any very considerable mineral deposits.  The one hope with regard to raw material for industrial development, for a definite and special industrial development, is that our peat resources would turn out to be <Col N="1178" /> resources that could be utilised on a wide scale.</P>
      <P>This experiment is on trial; it has not been long on trial.  This company has already turned out a splendid article, an article considered by those who use it as ideal from the point of view of household fuel.  In my opinion it was put on the market at too high a price, but I understand that that price is not to be considered the normal price as soon as production is normal.  So far as the quality of the fuel is concerned, it could hardly be improved upon.  Those who use it say that if it could be made available in unlimited quantities, and at even a slightly lower price, there would be no excuse for burning coal.  An experiment that has resulted in creating that opinion amongst the general public who have actually used the product is an experiment that at least deserves sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>It is the first experiment in the case of peat briquettes that I know of.  At all events, the House approved of the experiment and of the Government supporting the experiment originally.  Now we have the position <Col N="1179" /> where success has not yet arrived, but there is still the possibility, and even to some extent the probability, of success.  If the Government said: &ldquo;Enough of that; since you have not been able to make good within the year or two that you have been in operation, we are having nothing more to do with you; you can do what you like with your plant; you can, so far as we are concerned, clear out to-morrow,&rdquo; would the House welcome that action on the part of the Government? Surely, if the Government have any function with regard to industrial enterprise it is in relation to experiments, and particularly where such experiments are connected with such a big natural resource as peat. I think there is a very good case for this money being granted, and I hope the House will accede to the Minister's request.</P>

      <P>I regret to learn of the misfortune of this company.  To me it seems incredible that £76,000 has been entirely lost in the process of winning turf, particularly when we take into consideration that the three years preceding last year were record years for the winning of turf, even hand-made turf.  The Minister's case is that last year was substantially unsuitable from a climatic point of view.  He asks the House to believe that this company incurred considerable loss as a result of the weather last year.  The Minister is a city man and perhaps he does not know very much about this job.  Would he be surprised to hear that the rural population last year succeeded in saving their entire requirements of hand-won turf?  Let me tell the Minister that while last year was something of a handicap and was not everything that might be desired, not entirely comparable with the three preceding years, at the same time last year was not at all a bad year.  There are plenty of Deputies who can confirm that the entire requirements of hand-won turf were saved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was £19,000.  Give me £167,000 and I will get hand-won turf of the best quality, suitable for burning anywhere.  I will produce the value of the entire £167,000, and make a profit on it, and I will not want any machinery, only turf-spades and barrows.  This House is asked to vote another £35,000 to be dumped into these men, whoever they are&mdash;engineers, directors and machinery experts to inspect the machinery. They want another £35,000 after losing that.  I want to be frank for the reputation of a country where turf production should be developed, because it has got those resources.  The fuel is there.  If we are going, simply because we have turf deposits, to dish money out to incompetent people that give us that result, I say that this House is putting a premium on incapacity.  No business man would do it.  He would not listen to such a proposal for two minutes.  I think the Minister is going very far in asking the House, in face of these facts, to vote these people, whoever they are, an additional sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing clear from this, that the board of the company, whoever they are, who are managing this, have proved themselves incapable of doing their business, and before this money is voted, the board should be entirely abolished.  Apparently, they are completely under the control of this House, <Col N="1181" /> so far as the major portion of the money they have got has been given by this House or by the Government. It is time that the House should conduct a thing like this in a business-like way.  Surely, the Minister will not suggest that any body of business men, or any bank or financial house, would give an additional advance to a company with that record?  Let me tell the Minister that last year, while it was unfavourable for turf production, was far from being highly unfavourable&mdash; very far from approaching years I have seen during the last 45 years.  That is no apology or excuse for this company. Apparently, they thought they had this House and this State behind them to vote money, and all they had to do was to squander and slash money about wherever they are in the County Kildare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore tells us about the quality of the briquettes.  You can produce anything, of course, at a price. Simply because this is taxpayers' money, is he satisfied to produce briquettes at this price?  Is he prepared to go on at this price?  If it were his own money, after the history of this, would he be prepared to put an additional sum into it.  I think the whole thing is discreditable.  It shows gross incompetence that people with that huge amount of machinery could not produce turf last year.  In other years no machinery was wanted.  The weather was so good that the turf dried itself. All you had to do was to scatter it about and it was saved.  Last year was slightly unfavourable for the winnowing of turf, but not highly unfavourable even for hand-won turf.  Now we are told that £167,000 has gone west, and another £35,000 is asked for.</P>

      <P>The old story of &ldquo;Every man to his last&rdquo; applies in this case.  Perhaps it would be better to put the Deputy on the board of this company so that its efficiency will be completed.  Of course I can appreciate the apologetic way in which the Minister asked the House to vote the money.  Really, it requires a good deal of brass to face the House and ask for this additional sum.  I would be very glad to vote this money if there were anything in the history of this company to indicate success, but I cannot see it.  I regret to have to say it, but I cannot see any of the ingredients of success there.  I should like someone to tell me where they are.  Deputy Moore, of course, wants to remain indefinitely up in the experimental air.  It is quite easy to go on with experiments in the air <Col N="1183" /> while thousands are being voted.  But it is the people's money we are voting away.  Some of the people contributing this money have saved all their turf by hand, and when to-morrow they hear that we are voting these thousands of pounds to a limited number of men to win turf, after having lost that much money, they surely will have a grin on their faces. They will be wondering what sort of mentality Deputies have when they vote money to a company to lose it in this manner and still not produce any turf.  Deputy Moore complains that the cost of the turf might be too high. If anything was charged for it it would be too high, considering the amount of money that has been lost.  Yet Deputy Moore comes along and passively says: &ldquo;Carry on the good work; let it remain in the air during the experimental stage.&rdquo;  That is his justification. No one would be more delighted than I would be to see the development of turf on a mass production scale.  It is a thing that I always thought might be possible, but if this is the result of the scientific production of turf it would certainly blow any opinion I had in that respect sky-high.  I suggested many years ago that there were enormous possibilities in the development of the bogs of this country, but apparently there is very little prospect of that being the case.  It is only a question of how long the purse will remain open so that experimental work will be carried on.  Deputy Moore will favour experiments as long as there is a penny left.  I think this is a very discreditable history, and, conscientiously, I cannot concur in voting further money for this company.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that £35,000 will suffice to give an adequate trial to this process for one full year?  I do not think we ought to vote this money unless the Minister is satisfied.  I think part experiments are the surest ways of frittering away money, and that if we are going to finance further experiments at all it should be to carry them through 1937 on an adequate scale.  Is there any possibility of giving us some sort of expert report <Col N="1184" /> on the fuel actually produced, the briquettes&mdash;whether they are as good as coal for domestic heating and cooking, for commercial purposes and for railways, and to what extent they have been tried?  Can we not get some kind of expert report on their capabilities?  That is one side of the company's activities which we are told has been satisfactory.  I agree that it is a very important side.  If these briquettes are really good, my whole instinct would be to support the Minister's request for this further amount now, but I think we ought to be satisfied with a really authoritative pronouncement.  We ought also to be satisfied that the money we are asked to vote will really suffice for a further year's full experimentation.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed us that the machinery had been guaranteed by some firm.  What is the nature of the guarantee that was given by this firm?  I would also be glad to know what is the approximate value of the assets of the company.  It is important to know these things, because £160,000 has been already sunk in this venture, and there is no use sinking any more money in it unless we have some indication, something like what Deputy MacDermot mentioned, in the way of an expert's report on the products that have been turned out.  The House should know if these products are saleable and are up to the standard, as well as their advantages over coal in the market.  Experts should be able to advise on these matters.  If experts advise that further money should be sunk on the enterprise, I would be interested to know the reasons.  Peat is not by any means in the experimental stage in this country.  I have heard people saying that more money has been sunk in the bogs of Ireland, trying to make peat an economic factor, than any other enterprise.  I knew of several companies some years ago that engaged in the making of peat fuel and gave it up.  With that experience before us, surely the Minister could get some expert to advise whether the venture is worth spending more money on, and whether it is likely to prove of commercial value.  If there was such a report, the House would be with the <Col N="1185" /> Minister, but, in the absence of experts opinion, I do not feel justified in incurring further expenditure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan complained that I did not introduce the Estimate in a manner which would suggest that I had any great confidence in the enterprise.  In a sense, that is correct.  I cannot say with certainty that the experimental work the company is engaged in is going to be successful. I have good reason to believe that it is having regard to the progress that has been made so far in overcoming difficulties, and to the reports which have been available to me from persons who are acknowledged experts in this matter, as well as the nature of the representations made by the board of directors of the company. The board of the company comprises persons who are very well known&mdash;if not the best known&mdash;in the financial and commercial life of this country, and any recommendation they would make would have to be taken very seriously indeed by a person in my position.  They are engaged in this enterprise, and they have invested a substantial amount of private money therein.  They have met with unexpected difficulties, but they are confident these difficulties can be overcome, and, if overcome, that an industry with very great potentialities would be made possible, and considerable national advantage derived therefrom. It is entirely incorrect to talk of the money already utilised by this company as being lost.  It is not lost.  It has been invested in visible assets. There is available a large area of bog, thoroughly drained and thoroughly prepared for the class of work that the company proposes to do.  There is also a substantial factory, equipped with very efficient machinery.</P>

      <P>That some part of the capital has been lost is undoubted; but not all of it; in fact, only a very small proportion of it has been lost in that particular way.  The company started originally with the £57,000 invested capital and the £90,000 obtained on loan.  That amount was, in my opinion, somewhat less than&mdash;even on the basis of our original plans &mdash;might have been required.  It would have been sufficient if everything had worked out precisely according to plan.  The margin of working capital in the total was small and insufficient to cover any period of delay arising from unforeseen causes.  There was a delay; there was a delay, in fact, during the whole of 1935.  The factory was not completed; machinery could not be delivered; the operations on the bog proved much slower than had been anticipated.  In fact, a substantial part of the drainage work on the bog had to be done by hand, where it was originally intended to do it by those large draining machines.  The result was that the company was not in a position to contemplate commencing operations until 1936.  By that time, its working capital had become exhausted, and additional working capital had to be provided.  It was provided by its bankers on the security of a first debenture to the amount of £20,000.  I do not know whether Deputy McMenamin is serious when he talks about the climatic conditions that existed last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will content myself with saying that they were unusually wet months.  Undoubtedly, they did not prevent the company from operating, and would not in the ordinary course have had any serious effect on its production.  The company's plans were based on successful operation in a year where the rainfall would be worse than the average.  They had all the information they could get about the climatic conditions in this country, and planned their production upon the basis of a certain number of fine days in each year.  They had good reason to believe that, with the exception perhaps of one or two very unusual years, they would get that requisite number of fine days.  I am not saying they did not get them last year, but they were not in a position to start off at the beginning of the season as an established company and get into production straight away.  They were still experimenting; the factory was not completed; the drainage of the bog was not completed; and the fact that the three summer months were unusually wet was a handicap for them. Undoubtedly, if this enterprise is to be a success it must be one that works one year with another, and that is part of the experimental work that is being done.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Brennan in his contention that peat development is not worth while.  Apart from agricultural land, the greatest natural resource we have in this country is our bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, in fact, spending substantial sums in various directions in research as to the possible utilisation of our peat resources for <Col N="1188" /> commercial purposes.  I have been contemplating and I have, in fact, agreed in principle to the establishment of an organisation financed by the State for research into peat alone. We have subsidised experiments which are being carried out in Cork in the extraction of wax from peat.  We have also encouraged the Industrial Research Council and provided them with the finance to carry out certain further researches in relation to peat, all on the assumption that if we can succeed in making a valuable commercial asset out of our peat resources we will have solved 99 per cent. of the economic difficulties of this country.  It is worth our while to lose a million if at the end we get to the position where we can contemplate large-scale industrial development based on our peat resources.</P>
      <P>At present this company is engaged on experimental work in the matter of producing a particular form of fuel. Our big effort in relation to the development of our peat resources for fuel purposes is being done by the Turf Development Board upon different lines, but this particular project does offer very considerable possibilities if it can be made a success. It is worth our while, having regard to its nature, risking the loss of the sum of money contemplated here in order to enable the experiments to be completed.  My personal opinion as to whether or not it is going to be a success is not worth very much. It is my personal opinion, based on the information supplied to me, that it will be a success.  The opinion of the members of the board, of the experts in the employ of the board, and of the Government representatives who have been engaged to report upon this matter, is that it can be made a success, and that with the financial assistance now available it will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy MacDermot's first question, £35,000 is the amount which is considered adequate to enable the board to complete its equipment, and to meet all its operating expenses until next winter, when it hopes to be able to carry on from the revenue it will derive from the sale of fuel. <Col N="1189" /> The amount was estimated by the board of the company.  It was submitted in detail, showing the various items of expenditure that the company anticipated it would have to meet.  On that basis they thought they could carry on, complete their experiments, and get a stock of saleable fuel which would enable them to finance their own operations in future.  We have not got an independent report upon the fuel itself. I, personally, have used it and a number of other people have used it, and we are satisfied that for ordinary domestic purposes it is satisfactory. It has in many respects an advantage over coal.  Its calorific value is about 80 per cent. of the calorific value of coal, but it has, of course, the tremendous advantage of cleanliness; it can be stored much more easily than coal, and is in many respects more attractive as a household fuel.</P>

      <P>Only about 8,000 or 10,000 tons were produced in 1936, whereas the normal output of the factory is estimated at 50,000 tons. To some extent those briquettes were made from the peat which was secured as a result of the drainage operations upon the bog, and not from the harvesting of the bog in the manner in which the company will do it as a permanent method of work.  I do not think there is much more that I can say.  If I were in a position to say with absolute confidence that this is going to be a success I would have said so.  I am not in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say it is going to be, but I myself have good reason <Col N="1190" /> to believe that it will be.  We have got very competent advisers on the board of the company, the representatives of the private investors and the Government directors, and they have in their employ also persons who are very competent.  All their reports, both collective and individual, have been available to me and to the officers of my Department.  Upon the basis of these reports, we felt that we had, in fact, no option but to enable the work of the company to be proceeded with for another year.  The alternative was to shut the whole thing down at a point where it appeared to be about to succeed, and that, we felt, would not be justifiable in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>That is why we propose to make this sum of £35,000 available.  The money will not be paid over to the company. It will be put into a deposit account from which amounts will be paid from time to time, as I authorise, on the requisition of the company and to meet the expenses of the company.  It will be secured by this debenture on the assets of the company.  I do not say, and I think it would be foolish to convey the impression, that, if the experiment was a failure, we would be able to get from the sale of these assets a sum equal to the amount we had advanced to the company.  That is not so, but, in the event of the enterprise being a success, in consequence of these arrangements, we are in the position that we would be able either to secure repayment in full of the amount advanced or take full voting control of the company itself.  There is at least as much prospect of the thing being a success as otherwise, and in these circumstances, I think this expenditure by us is justifiable.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. V, c. 26; The Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928, etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The anticipated excess on the expenditure subhead of the Vote amounts to £17,280, due chiefly to increased provision for the development of the telephone service, civil aviation and meteorological wireless services and superannuation charges.  Against this, there will be an estimated increase of £17,270 in the appropriations-in-aid, mainly because of extra receipts for pensions liability in respect of the savings bank staff.  The consent of the Dáil is, however, necessary to offset one against the other, and consequently a supplementary estimate for what is really a token vote of £10 is required.</P>

      <P>Recently, when the Minister had before the House a certain Bill with regard to the evasion of stamp duties, he made certain statements with regard to the progress which the Post Office had been making. He endeavoured to show, and he did show, to the House that great progress had been made in that Department and that certain profits were now being made.  In that respect, <Col N="1193" /> I think the Post Office, if it is making a profit, ought to utilise at least a portion of that profit to meet the needs of the rural districts.  There are districts in my county where, if you post a letter, say, on Friday, it will not be delivered until the following Wednesday.  I think that when the Minister asks for this additional money, he ought to be prepared to tell the House that the Department over which he presides is prepared to stand by the people and that it has obligations to the people.  There is a matter which came to my notice the other day and possibly Deputy Norton will know something of it.  It came to my notice accidentally.  We have seen from time to time newspaper controversy with regard to the manner in which certain sub-postmasters are treated in the matter of salary, and, to my mind, at least, they seem to be in receipt of very poor allowances for the work they have to do.  It came to my notice the other day that there is a vacancy in my immediate neighbourhood for a sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress.  The salary, I understand, was £28 per annum, but in the new appointment it is going to be reduced to £18 for the same work.</P>

      <P>There is provision made here for certain expenditure in connection with civil aviation and meteorological wireless services.  There is a sum of £2,960 provided in respect of salaries, wages and allowances for this service.  I would like to inquire from the Minister whether it is proposed to recruit all the Irish staff for the maintenance of wireless services at Rynanna or whether any representations had been made to the British to loan the British staff for that purpose; or has any definite decision been arrived at in that matter?  I am interested also in the provision which is made under sub-head A.3 which provision is made for certain improvements in the pay of temporary officers. I would like to inquire from the Minister whether he has now got some remorse of conscience as to the wages paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is not correct. It should be described as an increase in the total expenditure rather than as it actually is described.  A larger number of members of the temporary staff were brought on for the Christmas period and they were also taken on for a longer period than usual.  That brought about the increased expenditure.  As to the query about the wireless operators, with the exception of a few experts employed at the beginning, the wireless operators are Irish.  If possible the staff will be an all-Irish staff.  It is possible that some technicians may not be available except persons who are not Irish nationals.  We may not be able to get Irishmen in respect of a particular appointment.  I am not certain about that but it is only in such circumstances that we would go outside Ireland to get them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was before the House on the Second Reading Stage I pointed out what I thought was a very great defect in the Bill.  I think the matter was raised on the Committee Stage also.  That was in regard to firms outside this country having their head office also outside this country being given an opportunity of availing of a cheap postage rate which the people inside the Saorstát have not.  The Minister apparently said he could not meet the situation. It is very questionable if a great injustice <Col N="1196" /> will not in this way be done to Irish firms who will have to compete with British firms; and we have got a number of firms in this country who have head offices at the other side. They could very easily take advantage of the cheap postal rates in Great Britain.  These firms are in competition with the people on this side of the water.  But the Minister could not tell us that there was any very serious evasion of stamp duty.  I do not think there is any person in the House who would certainly stand by a deliberate evasion of stamp duty.  If non-Irish firms can be put in a position to secure advantage over Irish firms, I am afraid we are, in that way, going to penalise our own people.  The Minister says he does not see any way out of it.  I am very sorry he does not.  The injustice is there.  The matter might be tightened up.  If firms outside this country want to advertise their business they ought to be tied down so that they will not be able to send out their advertisements to people here from their head offices across the water.</P>

The Deputy referred to alien penetration of Irish industry and talked about the capital that could be made out of this Bill by those who are frightened at such penetration. Then he went on to make this funny, this extraordinary remark: &ldquo;A boot factory which has a branch here&mdash;and we have a lot of that&mdash;and which has its main house in Nottingham, can send out what stuff it likes at the cheap rate in reference to its Irish business from Nottingham.&rdquo;  I wonder of what boot factory he was talking.</P>

      <P>Apparently Deputy Brennan thinks that wherever there are foreign directors attached to Irish concerns, the Irish concerns become merely branches of the English firm; or does he mean to say that the Irish directors agree to the business of the Irish establishment being done from an English office?  Does he not know that there must be a majority of Irish directors under the Control of Manufactures Act?  Did he intend to suggest that these Irish directors, in collusion with the English directors, agree to the business of an Irish industry being done from an English office with which some of the directors are associated?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, it would be a very strong argument against the passing of the Bill if the argument were correct which was made by the principal Opposition speaker during the Second Reading debate on the Bill. If Deputy Brennan's argument were <Col N="1198" /> correct and sound, I could not vote for the Bill&mdash;the argument that an industrial concern here which is associated with a similar manufacturing concern in England becomes automatically merely a branch house of such English firm.</P>

He will, doubtless, be able to find an opportunity to refer to it on an Estimate or on some other occasion.  This is not the time to discuss the directorate of the company or whether it conducts its business from a head office which is alleged to be in Great Britain or from some other place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what exactly Deputy Good means by the statement he has just made.  I take it that when a Bill is introduced by the Government for a certain purpose, the Government will, as far as possible, see that it effects that purpose. That is the intention in respect to this Bill.  As regards the statement made by Deputy Brennan, I think he is suffering under a misapprehension in regard to the position of English concerns.  There cannot be deliberate evasions by English concerns, as suggested by him.  The English concerns are respecting the law of their country. The people against whom we are legislating are our own nationals who make use of the cheaper postage in Great Britain and, thereby, avoid paying to this State the revenue to which it is justly entitled.  Although those letters are posted in Great Britain, they have to be delivered here by the postal staff of the Irish Free State.  There cannot be any deliberate evasion by foreign concerns.  They are obeying the laws of their own country and that is what we are endeavouring to get our own nationals to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was under consideration for a very long time and I understand that many efforts were made to induce people who were evading the law to comply with their obligations.  In some cases, those efforts were successful. Unfortunately, in the other cases, there was no response.  Because those efforts failed to bring about the results we desired, we had to bring in this Bill.  I sincerely trust that the necessity for using the powers the Bill gives us will not arise.  In conclusion, I want to repeat that the general statements made regarding the things <Col N="1200" /> which could take place under this Bill are not correct.  The suggestions made regarding the violation of the secrecy of the post are due to misapprehension. These things could not possibly happen because we are operating the laws which have been in force since the Saorstát was established. These laws have operated right down to the present time and they will continue to operate under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>These outside firms with Irish competitors in the same trade can take advantage of the cheaper post by posting on the other side. They can, under this Bill, as I pointed out, still take advantage of the same method.  The Minister simply prevents the Irish competitor from taking advantage of the system which the English trader in the same business can take advantage of.  That is all this Bill does.  Instead of stopping the English competitor, you stop the Irish trader.</P>

On that occasion we had the rather unique experience that while the motion was moved and seconded, the Minister, although in the House, declined to reply.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I now formally move the motion.  I want to call the attention of the House to the developments which have taken place during the past three years in respect of Employment Period Orders.  This Order relates to persons who have holdings with a valution of over £4.  In 1935 the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a similar Employment Period Order depriving such persons of unemployment assistance benefit for the period 17th April to the 21st May&mdash;a period of <Col N="1203" /> five weeks.  He made a subsequent Employment Period Order in respect of the same class of persons, the Order to be operative from the 17th July to the 1st October of the same year, a period of 11 weeks.  In all, the Minister's Employment Period Orders deprived small-holders with a valuation of over £4 of unemployment assistance benefit for a period of 16 weeks during the year 1935.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Minister issued a new Employment Period Order of a much more extensive and comprehensive character than that issued during the previous year.  The effect of the 1936 Order was to ensure that persons with a valuation of over £4 would be deprived of unemployment assistance benefit for a period of 34 weeks in 1936, compared with 16 weeks in 1935.  For the year 1937 the Minister has issued another Employment Period Order, the effect of which is to continue to deprive persons with a valuation of over £4 of unemployment assistance from the 3rd March until the 26th October.  Again, those persons are deprived of unemployment assistance benefit for a period of approximately eight months out of the 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On previous occasions I asked the Minister if any investigations had been made by him to ascertain whether employment was available in the areas in which those persons lived such as would ensure their being employed in a remunerative capacity in the period during which they will now receive no unemployment assistance benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  On that occasion the Minister indicated that no such investigation had been made, and, presumably, no such investigation has since been undertaken or has been specially made in connection with this Employment Period Order, so that we find, when we approach the consideration of this Employment Period Order, that it has been issued by the Minister without any previous investigation as to whether employment is available for those who will lose benefit during the currency of the Order.  I presume that I am also right in stating that no inquiry of any kind has been conducted by the Minister, or by persons acting under his instructions, to ascertain <Col N="1204" /> the capacity of the land represented by a valuation of, say, £4 1s. to sustain a man, his wife and four, five or six children, during the currency of the Employment Period Order.  The Minister, therefore, has made no investigation to find out whether employment is available, and has made no investigation to ascertain the capacity of the land to sustain a man and his dependents in those circumstances for the eight months which is prescribed in the Order.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, must know &mdash;everybody who has any contact with the rural areas knows&mdash;that there will not be available in the rural areas during the period set out in the Order employment for all those, or even for a substantial proportion of those, who will be affected by the issue of this Order.  If employment were available, the persons who are affected by the Order would not have to seek employment at the employment exchanges. They would not have to register at the employment exchanges and would not have to tolerate the degrading rotational system of employment which is being administered through the employment exchanges.  We may take it, therefore, that so far as those persons are concerned, no employment is available to them in the rural areas.  If it were, they would be only too glad to accept employment rather than to accept even the rotational schemes of employment which are being administered by the Minister's Department. So that the Minister, therefore, is not concerned whether employment is available or not.  He must know, although, presumably, he is not prepared to admit it, that many of the persons concerned will not be able to obtain employment during the whole period covered by this Order.  Many of them, in fact, may be able to get employment only for a fragmentary portion of the period covered by the Order</P>
    <P>If the assumption of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is that persons affected by the Order are capable of sustaining themselves by husbandry on their own lands, we get a strange mentality in the attempt to justify the Order.  The assumption, is, apparently, that a man with a holding of a valuation of £4 1s. is able to get out of his land, during the currency <Col N="1205" /> of the Order, after putting in labour and seed and manure into the land, a profit of £39 net.  When you consider the kind of land that often carries a valuation of £4 1s., I think it will be obvious to Deputies who have contact with agricultural conditions that it would be quite impossible for a man with a valuation of £4 1s. to be able to make, each week, a net profit of about 14/- or 15/- by operating upon the land; and when we remember also that the man's house and piggeries and outhouses are taken into consideration in determining the valuation of his premises, we find that the actual land held by the man may be relatively small indeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire from the Minister as to what he visualises will be the position of those affected by the Order during the period of its currency. Up to yesterday, the 2nd March, persons in the category set out in the Order were entitled to unemployment assistance benefit, and the bulk of the persons, of course, are in the rural areas where the maximum unemployment assistance benefit is 12/6 per week. It is on that miserable pittance that they have been endeavouring to sustain themselves during periods of unemployment. One can imagine, in those days when the cost of living is so high and when it is continuing to soar, the plight of a man endeavouring to sustain himself and his wife and family on an income of 12/6 per week.  However, that represents the income of the persons concerned up to the 2nd of March.  It may be, of course, that the Minister will say that the man had some land, but even if he had land, he was not getting 12/6 a week.  The fact remains that he could only get that amount per week according to the valuation of his means; but if the valuation of his means was 10/- a week, 3/6 is all the unemployment assistance benefit he would get.  However, on an all-in income represented by a maximum of 13/6 a week, these persons were expected to sustain themselves up to the 2nd March.</P>
    <P>On the 3rd of March the Employment Period Order becomes effective, and that person, if he had a valuation of £4 1s. 0d. or over, is deprived of unemployment assistance benefit until the 26th of October next.  How is it <Col N="1206" /> expected that that person can sustain himself in the meantime?  What is going to happen on the 3rd of March? What is going to happen in the second week; what is going to happen in the third week or the fourth week of this Employment Period Order?  If the land is capable of sustaining the man, presumably he is expected by the Minister to set about and plough the land and even, presumably, to set about and sow it; but ploughing and sowing land are not operations that bring in cash.  They represent expenditure, not merely of labour, but of money for manures and seeds, and instead, therefore, of being precipitated into a period when he can get some other source of income from the land, the man is really compelled to forgo his claim to unemployment assistance benefit at a time when, in fact, his expenditure is higher and will tend to be higher if he is to operate on the land which the Minister, presumably, expects to sustain him.  So that, if those persons who are affected by the Order in the main are expected to live by tilling the land, the actual tillage operations will cause them further expenses and, during the period that that expense must be met, there is no income in the form of unemployment assistance benefit provided under the Act.</P>
    <P>I said on a previous occasion that these Employment Period Orders had been issued without any thought, without any consideration for the hardships which would be inflicted on those who will be the victims of the Order, without any investigation as to the availability of work in the areas to which the Order applies, and without any proper regard to the conditions under which small farmers are living as a result of long continued unemployment followed by a current Employment Period Order of this kind, and the fact that the whole of the rural portions of the country are affected is the clearest possible evidence that the Minister, in issuing this Order, has issued a blanket Order, hoping to catch everybody in the blanket, and not concerned at all with the particular situations which exist in particular areas.  This year there is a special reason, in fact, why, if any Employment <Col N="1207" /> Period Order is issued, it should not be made as effective as in former years.  Everybody is familiar with the widespread flooding which has taken place all over the country.  As a result of that flooding, land which might be available in a normal season is not available for tillage this year.  Yet, notwithstanding the flooded condition of their lands, small farmers are now expected to be content with the position where their unemployment assistance benefit is withdrawn from them and where they can look upon flooded lands to sustain them for the eight months during which the Order will be effective.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere surrounding this Order is conclusive evidence to me that it is not so much an Employment Period Order as an economy Order.  The whole object of the Order is not based upon any evidence that work is available or upon any evidence that there is no actual need to provide unemployment assistance benefit for the persons affected by the Order. In my view, the underlying motive for the issue of an Order of this kind is to save money to the Exchequer, and the Minister this year is continuing the Order for a period of eight months, which is the same period over which last year's Order operated. That period, this year and last year, represents an increase of well over 100 per cent. in time from the standpoint of the currency of the Order. Although the Minister has spoken at many functions recently. we have not had any indication from him that it has been found unnecessary to provide unemployment assistance benefit during this period of eight months for persons with a valuation of £4 1s. and over.  We had no indication from the Minister, and certainly no evidence from him, that it is unnecessary to provide benefit in the areas affected by the Order and to the persons in the categories prescribed in the Order.</P>
    <P>This motion, therefore, has been put down in order to protest against that blanketing kind of Order by the Minister, and to give me an opportunity of explaining to the House how persons who are affected by this Order are expected to sustain themselves <Col N="1208" /> during the eight months which is the period covered by this Order. The Minister has not previously explained to the House how it is expected that persons of that kind can sustain themselves.  We ought to know from the Minister, and the persons concerned ought to know, what exactly they are expected to do during the next eight months in order to make good in some form the unemployment assistance benefit which they are going to lose, and I hope we shall hear from the Minister on what grounds he seeks to justify an Order of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can dispose very easily of the point that has been made by Deputy Norton.  In each year, since the Unemployment Assistance Act came into operation, persons who are owners of land exceeding £4 in valuation have been excluded from the receipt of unemployment assistance over certain months in the year.  We are making this year an Order similar to that made last year-I do not think anybody who has any knowledge of the subject will contend that any hardship was caused by the Order in previous years.  It is reasonable to assume that persons who are owners of land exceeding £4 in valuation will be either occupied upon the working of that land or will be in a position to obtain employment with other farmers during this period of the year: In fact, the information which is at my disposal indicates that the comparatively small number of persons affected by this Order are either not available for employment elsewhere because they are employed on their own land or succeed in getting employment elsewhere.  I gave Deputy Norton earlier on other occasions the information upon which I based that contention.  That information, of course, is of a dual nature. The Department of Industry and Commerce is able to trace the employment history of individuals who are registered at the exchange, and the reports which I have received from the officers of the various branches throughout the country all indicate that the small number of persons who are excluded from unemployment <Col N="1209" /> assistance in consequence of this Order do, in fact, get employment or do not register for employment because they are employed on their own land during the period in which the Order is current.  If these persons were not employed on their own land or did not obtain employment elsewhere, either one of two things would happen.  If Deputy Norton's assertions are correct, either these persons would be destitute and would have to apply to the home assistance authorities for relief or else they would register at the exchanges for employment&mdash;bearing in mind that under our regulations they are entitled to preference in employment on works financed from central funds.</P>
      <P>We find that last year the corresponding Order came into operation on the 3rd March.  On the last Saturday of February, 1936, the number of able-bodied persons receiving home assistance was 4,965.  Instead of that number increasing in consequence of the operation of this Order, it had decreased to 4,636 by May.  There are three classes registered at the employment exchanges&mdash;those receiving unemployment assistance, those receiving unemployment benefit and those not receiving either.  If the persons affected by this Order were available for employment one would expect that the number receiving unemployment assistance would be reduced by the Order, and the number not receiving unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit would be increased.  In fact, the number of persons registered at the exchanges who were not entitled to receive unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit decreased from 5,170 on the last day prior to the date on which the Order was made to 4,851 by May.  These facts prove conclusively that the persons affected by the Order, numbering only 5,000 or 6,000 upon a register of 90,000, are not registered for employment during this portion of the year because, in fact, they are in employment.</P>

If we take the agricultural labourers employed in Leinster, whether from the ages of 14 to 18 or from 18 upwards, and compare the figures for June, 1936, with those for June, 1935, the number shown as being in permanent employment reveals a fall of 437, while the number in temporary employment shows a fall of 1,279. Therefore, so far as paid labour was concerned there was a fall of 1,716 as compared with 1935.</P>

Taking Munster, the number of labourers permanently employed on the 1st June, 1936, as compared with June, 1935, shows an increase of 528&mdash;some achievement.  On the other hand, there were 1,401 less temporarily employed at that date as compared with June, 1935, so that paid labour, permanent and temporary, in the province of Munster, showed a fall of 873 as compared with June, 1935.

      <P>I have given the figures for Leinster.  I am now giving the figures for Munster, and I propose also to give the figures for Ulster and for Conuaught.  The figures for Munster, as I have said, show an increase in permanent labour of 528 persons, but the number of temporary labourers shows a decrease of 1,401.  The decrease, therefore, in paid labour in Munster as between 1935 and 1936 was 873.  If we take the total number of males employed in agricultural operations, there was a fall of 4,839.  Previously it was only Leinster, and then it was only Munster.  Take Ulster.  There is a fall in permanent labour of 50 last year as compared with the year before. There is a fall of temporary labour to the extent of 461.  The total fall in paid labour in three of the counties of Ulster comes to 511.  In all there was a fall of 1,596.  I am prepared to hear the Minister say that these figures are not right.  I admit I am putting them together rather hurriedly, but nevertheless, even in a hurried gathering of <Col N="1212" /> these figures from the Minister's own return, that is the position.  That is only Ulster, the Minister will say.  Let us come to Connaught.  The fall in permanent labour was 22, temporary labour 363, so the total fall in paid labour in Connaught last year as compared with the previous year was 385.

      <P>What does the Minister mean by circulating on the 7th of February, 1937, in the Official Reports, a statement that the total number of males engaged in farm work, etc., permanent males 18 years of age and over, was 85,875?  If he wants to correct that figure now, he may do so.  I can only carry on this discussion on the basis of the figures already supplied, after, no doubt, very serious consideration by the Minister. The figures the Minister already quoted for employees 18 years and over were these figures, which show an increase of 959.  On the other hand, we have temporary paid labour. I take it that the people who are now being marked out as coming under this Order are people who appear on these schedules as temporary paid labour.</P>

      <P>It is the last thing I want when I am dealing with figures and when I am dealing with so important a subject.  The important subject is that the people being dealt with under the Minister's Employment Period Order, and who are being regarded as in employment now, or will be regarded as in employment for the period of that Order, are people who appear on the Minister's lists as temporary males, 18 years of age and over.  On the 20th February, 1936, the Minister gave the House information to the effect that on the 1st June, 1935, the number of such persons employed in the whole of the Saorstát was 60,982. On the 17th February, 1937, he informed the House again that on the 1st June, 1936, the number of such persons was 58,642, which means that in June, 1936, there were 3,340 persons of the class with which we are now dealing less employed in agriculture than the year before, in spite of what the Minister would claim, that there was a great increase in tillage in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an astounding thing that the Minister would deal with this <Col N="1215" /> Order without making some reference to these things, and I also think it is dealing rather flippantly with the House that the Minister would intervene and would try to mix up these figures in the way in which he tried to mix them up.  His answers are there on the parliamentary records and the figures are given plainly there and, as I say, do show that decrease. The previous figures I gave referred to general employment throughout the country.  That has a bearing on the present situation but, if the Minister wishes, I will confine my arguments entirely to the fact that the people he is regarding as going into employment now automatically by the stroke of his pen belong to a class that had less numbers employed in the country last year than they had the year before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made such a very unconvincing case that it is not necessary to spend much time replying to the few futile arguments he used in justification of this Order.  There are, however, one or two misconceptions which ought to be cleared up.  The Minister said that these people are encouraged to register during the currency of the Employment Period Order because of the fact that they get preference for employment on public works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can mend his hand if he likes, but that is the statement made by the Minister.  He knows well that preference of employment is given to those in receipt of the maximum amount of unemployment assistance benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, a man who has 12/6 a week will get preference before a man with 10/- a week; a man who has 10/- a week will get preference before a man who has 5/-; a man who has 5/- a week will get preference before a man who has 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who has 1/- a week will get preference before the man who has nothing.  So that these people, whom the Minister thinks are tumbling over themselves in their desire to register at the employment exchange, can only get work when every other man registered in that exchange and drawing money has been exhausted.  That is the kind of preference they get.  They get a preference when there is a famine for men and only in that circumstance can they get any preference.  Of course, the Minister knows, if he cares to examine the statistics of his Department or to consult the managers of employment exchanges, that there are still large numbers of persons on the employment exchanges books drawing 5/-, 6/- and 7/- in a variety of areas&mdash;Deputy Corish says up to 10/- in areas he knows&mdash;who are not getting any work at all, because there are other people on the books of the exchange drawing higher rates of unemployment assistance benefit, and these have to get the preference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case one might understand an Order of this kind being applied in that area, but why apply it in areas where those in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit are not yet absorbed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from his argument.  If there is any prospect of work, surely an unemployed man will keep registered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that. I wanted to lay the old story that the Minister told, that the man would get preference for employment.  The Minister now wants to deny that he will only get preference when every <Col N="1217" /> other person registered has been put into employment.  In other words, he will only get preference when there is a famine for labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is now saying something in absolute violation of the instructions issued by his own Department.  I say, and I challenge contradiction of the statement, that a man affected by an Employment Period Order, while he may register at the employment exchange, can get no work there on a relief scheme until such time as every man drawing unemployment assistance benefit at that exchange has been put into employment.  That is the truth of the matter and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice that works out, because these are the people getting the least amount of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a statement in the Press the other day from an ex-Deputy of the Minister's Party in Roscommon to the effect that they would not go to receive this unemployment assistance benefit under the conditions in which it was being made available and preferred not to receive the benefit, and because they were not registered at the employment exchange the Department would not give a grant there, although this ex-Deputy of the Minister's Party said that there were plenty of unemployed in the district. The fact remains that there is no preference for these persons at the employment exchange.  The only time they can get a preference is when there is a famine for labour.  That hare is run to earth, in any case.  There is no preference at all.  The Minister wonders why people do not register, why they do not go to a Civic Guard barracks to register, or write to the Department and say they are idle, and why they do not trudge a couple of miles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that you have always people in receipt of unemployment assistance registering at the employment exchange and claiming benefit right through the whole year, notwithstanding your two Period Orders, is evidence of the fact that at no time is there anything like a scarcity of labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This applies over the whole country and not to particular parts where there is a scarcity of labour.  This applies where there is a superabundance of unemployed labour. The Minister said, of course, that one of the reasons why this Order is issued is because all the persons affected by the Order can get employment either on their own land or with some other farmer.  If that is true, what is the need to issue the Order?  They would not claim benefit if they could get work. <Col N="1220" /> Who would prefer to walk a few miles a couple of times a week and, after all the difficulties he has to encounter to get benefit, be content to accept 12/6 a week?  They would prefer if they could work their own land remuneratively, or to work with another farmer, rather than to be dependent on employment assistance benefit.  If the Minister says they can get work with other farmers, or that they can work on their own land, and, in fact, do not register, why then issue an Order of this kind? Surely these people will not then go near the exchanges looking for benefit, and there is no need to deprive them of benefit in this automatic way?  The Minister knows that if this Order was not there, these people would go to the exchanges, because it is known that they cannot get employment with other farmers, and it is also known that their own land is not capable of sustaining them.  While they may get an income during harvesting, they certainly do not get an income when preparing and ploughing the land, and it is during that period they are forced to seek unemployment benefit.  If that were not so, there would be no need for an Order of this kind.  It is because the Minister knows that in the absence of remunerative employment they would be clamouring at the exchanges that this Order is issued, so as to deprive them of unemployment assistance during that period.</P>
