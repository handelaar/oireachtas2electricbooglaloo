      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if and when the annual trade agreement with Britain comes up for renewal he will arrange to have the negotiations carried out by one or more of his Ministers so as to ensure that the greatest possible benefits will be secured for this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The question whether trade negotiations with other countries should be carried out by Ministers or by civil servants acting on behalf of the Government is for determination according to the circumstances of each case.  The Government is always willing to arrange for the conducting of such negotiations by a Minister, or Ministers, provided that there is reason to believe that that course will lead to more satisfactory results than would otherwise be achieved.  When negotiations are conducted by civil servants, the officers taking part act on behalf of the Government and are given full instructions as to the Government's wishes and intentions, which instructions, of course, they are careful to observe. Moreover, provision is made for consultation with Ministers, at any stage, during the course of the negotiations at which consultation is considered necessary or desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Deputy had attended to the latter part of my statement, I think he would have realised that Ministers are constantly in touch, and that whether Ministers or civil servants are in negotiation depends on the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state (a) the reasons for nonacceptance by the President, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries of the full amount of salaries passed on June 9th in the Dáil during the period between 1st April, 1937, and July 20th, 1937, and (b) to give the reasons for the acceptance of same since July 20th, 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period between the 1st April and 20th July last the President and others concerned continued to accept the voluntary reductions in salaries which had been in operation since 1932.  The nonacceptance during that period of the full amount of the salaries passed by the Dáil was in accordance with the statement which I made on the 25th February last, when the volume of Estimates was being circulated to Deputies.  On that occasion I drew attention to the fact that the sums provided in the Estimates for the salaries of the President of the Executive Council, Ministers, and others, for the current financial year, were those fixed by law &mdash; not the lower sums which had been taken since 1932.  I explained that, although the statutory rates were provided, it was not the intention that they should be accepted pending the general election and the assembly of the new Dáil &mdash; the idea being that the existing position ought not to be changed until a general election had intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory salaries have been accepted since the Government was reconstituted on the 21st July last because the sums previously taken had <Col N="757" /> been found insufficient to meet the expenses arising out of the official positions held, and because the Government was satisfied that it would not be in the public interest to allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I desire to take advantage of this opportunity to refer to certain statements which have appeared recently in the Press.  In June of this year a Committee, comprising representatives of all Parties and a number of independent persons, who are not members of the Dáil, was set up to consider and report on the remuneration of Ministers and other officers of State.  Statements which have been published purporting to give the recommendations of this Committee are completely unauthorised.  No report has yet been received by the Government from the Committee. When the Committee has reported, the Government will have to consider, as in the case of every other report received from a committee or commission of inquiry, what action it is desirable to take in regard to its recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President wish to convey to the House and to the country that he got a mandate from the country at the general election to increase those allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish simply to convey what I have said, namely that when the Book of Estimates was being distributed here in February last I indicated that the Dáil was being asked to make provision for the current financial year not for the sums which had been voluntarily accepted by Ministers during the previous five or six years but for the full statutory sums.  As I have said in my reply, I indicated at the same time that those statutory rates were not going to be accepted during the interval, pending a general election.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any deductions from housing grants for the purpose mentioned.  Private persons or public utility societies that <Col N="759" /> intend to erect dwelling-houses in a particular area with the aid of grants must submit plans to the appointed officer for that area.  Under the Housing (New Houses) Order, 1932, such appointed officer may require applicants to pay him for his services a fee not exceeding £1 1s. (one guinea) for each type of house for which separate plans are submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that the Housing Committee, which apparently does absolutely nothing, would provide a useful forum in order that people who might differ from the Minister's experts could make their opinions known and urge their case that the vital necessity for a working-class family in this city is one decent living-room rather than a whole rabbit warren of dark small cubby-holes such as are at present being provided in some of the flat buildings in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to allow the Deputy to get away with the statement that rabbit warrens or dark small cubby-holes are being built in Dublin.  That is not the case.  No later than last week I visited some of the flats about to be occupied on the south side of the city and I can say that they are as good as any buildings I have seen in different cities in Europe that are regarded as setting a headline.</P>

Incidentally, it will help to relieve unemployment in the area, and it will avert the danger that threatens the town, according to the report of the county medical officer of health.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to give an answer to that?

      <P>As regards the first and second parts of the question, I have not yet received any recent representations concerning the water supply to Hacketstown.  A recent report of the Department's medical inspector drew attention to the need for the improvement of the water supply, and the attention of the board of health was drawn to the matter.  At their meeting on the 23rd August last, the board stated that the water supply at Hacketstown was engaging attention.  I understand that they received in January last a report from their consulting engineer on the provision of a water supply for Hacketstown.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he will alter the existing regulation requiring dispensary doctors to reside within their dispensary areas by introducing a provision into it leaving discretion with local authority to permit such doctors to live in the immediate vicinity of their districts where transport and communication facilities make it desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, is he aware that a regulation made long prior to the existence of motor cars and to the ubiquity of telephones, now operates to make the doctor less accessible than he would be if he was residing in a centre immediately adjacent to his dispensary district, where he could have the telephone in his house?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that this archaic regulation, instead of achieving its purpose under modern conditions, actually defeats the purpose for which it was originally made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 26 of the Dispensary Regulations, the Minister has power in exceptional circumstances, on being satisfied there is sufficient ground for such a course of action, to dispense with the condition of residence within the dispensary district. He already has the power, if he is satisfied the circumstances warrant the exercise of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does not the Minister consider giving such power to the local authority, the body responsible for the public health of the area?  Political pressure has, in certain cases, been brought to bear against doctors to force them, at great personal inconvenience, to live in the centre of the dispensary district when the local people knew perfectly well that if the doctor were only allowed to continue to live where he had been living he would be much more accessible to the sick poor of the dispensary district with the care of which he was charged.</P>

      <P>The development of these slate deposits is a matter for private enterprise.  My Department has been prepared on three occasions, in 1932, 1933 and 1934, to contribute towards an investigation of them.

      <P>No.  As I have already informed the Deputy I was prepared on three occasions to make grants for the purpose of enabling an investigation of these deposits to be made.  In 1932 an offer was made to a company operating another slate quarry in the neighbourhood, but that company was unable to come to terms with the owner.  In 1933 an offer was made to a committee to contribute towards this investigation.  Finally, in 1934, a committee was formed with which the owner was associated and a grant was made subject to certain conditions as to the particular persons to be employed and other conditions of that kind but after some portion of the grant had been expended the balance had to be withdrawn because these conditions were not being observed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply is somewhat lengthy and contains a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been taken in regard to publication of the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to (b) and (c) in the Deputy's question it is necessary to state that the individual employment schemes carried out were not schemes specifically recommended by the Inter-Departmental Committee, which was concerned rather with types and categories of schemes suitable for the relief of unemployment.  Statistics are not available with regard to the number of men who have been employed respectively on three days and four days per week on rotational schemes in operation since the 1st January, 1937, nor of the average daily rate of pay of men employed on these schemes.  To obtain these particulars would entail the examination of all the wage sheets in connection with some 3,000 separate works, and the public value of the information would not, in my view, be commensurate with the time and expense involved in the investigation.  I append, however, a statement showing the total number of men employed each week since the 1st January, 1937.  It may be taken that approximately 75 per cent. of the workmen employed on a rotational <Col N="772" /> basis have received three days' work a week, 5 per cent. less than three days' work and 20 per cent. four days or more.</P>
    <P>The rate of wages paid to workmen engaged on minor employment schemes, which in point of cost represented about one-seventh of the moneys provided for employment schemes in 1936-37, is 4/- per day and is related to the wages paid to agricultural labourers, for the reasons that the workmen are in the great majority of cases recruited from agricultural labourers and farmers of uneconomic holdings and that the works carried out are for the benefit of agricultural lands.  In every other case the rate of wages is the recognised rate for analogous work in the same locality.</P>
    <P>As regards (d) in the question, National Health Insurance cards are stamped for all workmen engaged on employment schemes, and unemployment insurance cards in the case of all classes of work except minor employment schemes which are exempted on the ground that the work is for the benefit of agricultural land.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that on July 8th, 1931, the Commissioners of Public Works informed the Monaghan County Council that they had instructed their engineers to prepare a drainage scheme for the Dromore area, and, if so, whether this is the same scheme as that which he stated in the Dáil on October 6th, 1937, was being investigated at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>On July 8th, 1931, the Commissioners of Public Works informed the Monaghan County Council that they had instructed their engineer to make a detailed survey of the Dromore district with a view to the preparation of a drainage scheme.  This survey revealed that a satisfactory scheme for the area would necessitate works on a much larger scale than was previously envisaged following the preliminary engineering inspection.  The scheme at present under investigation is accordingly a development of the original proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right then in inferring that the investigation of the Dromore drainage area has continued from the 8th of July, 1931, until the 6th of October, 1937, and that it was still going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to state that this inquiry has gone on for the past six years, and that it is still continuing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a perfectly straight question, a question to which I think I am entitled to a categorical answer.  I asked whether inquiries have been going on since the 8th of July, 1931, with regard to the Dromore drainage area, and if these inquiries are the same as those that are going on now; have these inquiries been going on for six years, and are they still going on. <Col N="774" /> I asked this question because the general inference from it is that an inquiry of that kind continued for over six years must give a general impression that the whole business is a fraud, and that nothing effective is being done.</P>

      <P>I.  Roads Improvements Schemes in Urban and Rural Areas: The daily rates are those paid by the local authorities for analogous work.</P>
      <P>II.  Public Health Works: The general rule is that the rates of wages are fixed as between the contractor and the men employed on the basis that they shall not be less advantageous to the workman than the rates fixed by agreement for the same kind of work in the district where such agreement exists; or, in default of such agreement, by the most suitable criterion derived from analogous work in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>III.  Peat Development Schemes and Minor Employment Schemes: (All counties), 4/- per day.</P>
      <P>IV.  Miscellaneous Schemes: The daily rate paid for analogous work in the same vicinity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that acting on the assumption that all subsisting contracts of employment between farmers and agricultural workers were automatically terminated when the Agricultural Wages Board began to function, farmers have, in fact, repudiated yearly contracts concluded some months previously; whether he is aware that when questioned in regard to the matter inspectors of his Department intimated that the cancellation of such contracts was implied in the Act establishing the board; whether the instructions to <Col N="777" /> this effect were issued or given verbally to the inspectors in question; and, if no such instructions were given whether he will state what steps he intends to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as indicated in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>As regards the other parts of the question, it is no part of the duty of the inspectors of the Department of Agriculture to concern themselves with the administration of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.  As the Agricultural Wages Board have their own inspectors, the Department's inspectors were not instructed to express opinions or give advice in regard to wages contracts between agricultural employers and workers, and I am satisfied that they have not, in fact, done so.</P>
      <P>The Order fixing minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers was made by the Agricultural Wages Board, which body is responsible for the enforcement of the Order and the settlement of any questions arising in connection therewith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be news to the Minister that I have a concrete case of this kind?  A man who was under contract since December was dismissed from his employment, through no fault of his own, on a week's notice following a visit from an inspector. The inspector, on being questioned by the solicitor acting for this man, said it was implied in the Act that there was cancellation of the contract.  The Minister said that he did not believe that such a thing had happened.  I can prove that it did.</P>

      <P>The British subsidy applicable to fat cattle reared and fed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is paid at the rates, in terms of liveweight cwt., mentioned by the Deputy in the first part of the question.  In respect of cattle imported from the Irish Free State which have been in Great Britain or Northern Ireland for a continuous period of at least three months immediately prior to their submission for grading, the corresponding rates of British subsidy are, however, 5/- and 2/6 per liveweight cwt. respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>ask the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that in making an Order under Section 3 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, prescribing wages districts for the purposes of the Act no wages districts were prescribed to conform to the areas of the dairying districts of the country which precluded special consideration of the needs and conditions of the dairying industry by the Agricultural Wages Board in the making of Orders under Section 17 of the Act, and whether in the circumstances and to remove the dissatisfaction that exists amongst dairy farmers he is prepared to make an amending Order prescribing such wages districts as would cover the dairying areas or counties to permit of reconsideration by the board of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing Order declaring agricultural wages districts for the purposes of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, each administrative county forms a separate wages district, but it does not appear to me to follow that this precludes the Agricultural Wages Board from giving consideration <Col N="779" /> to the question of fixing minimum rates of wages to suit the particular requirements of the dairying industry.  The Act empowers the board to fix minimum rates of wages for any special class of agricultural workers in any agricultural wages district or in any special part of a district.  In these circumstances, and in the absence of any recommendations from the board, I do not see any necessity to make the amending Order suggested in the question.</P>

I should prefer to see no costs put on anybody, but, as the Deputy is aware, we must get the land annuities.

      <P>The House will have learned with great regret of the death of Deputy Eamonn Rice who had been in failing health for some months past.  Deputy Rice was associated with the movement for Irish independence from early manhood and gave devoted service to the movement in time of difficulty and danger.  He was deservedly popular amongst all Parties in this House of which he was a member since 1932.  I ask you, A Chinn Comhairle, to convey to Deputy Rice's widow and family the sincere sympathy of Dáil Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point affecting the rights of Private <Col N="802" /> Deputies.  A number of questions were submitted&mdash;as is their right&mdash;by Deputies for appearance on the Order Paper about a fortnight ago, at least. Some of them might have been submitted a little earlier.  Many questions which appear on the Order Paper were sent in more than a fortnight previously, and in ordinary circumstances ought to have appeared in time for the last sitting of the Dáil.  For some reason these questions did not appear on the Order Paper on that day.  Some appear to-day, but other questions have not yet appeared and, if the House is not going to sit to-morrow, these questions will not be asked until next week.  I think that arrangement is a most unsatisfactory one for Private Deputies, and that something might be done whereby a longer time would be allowed for the answering of questions submitted by Private Deputies. The position is particularly unsatisfactory when the Dáil is asked to meet one day in the week, and then adjourn, notwithstanding the fact that there are a number of questions awaiting answers, and that there are a large number of motions by Private Deputies on the Order Paper.  I think this is a matter in which the President of the Executive Council would be interested.  If the Dáil will only meet one day to deal with Government business, a second day, or, if necessary, a third day should be given to the consideration of Private Deputies' motions, and the time for answering questions should be substantially extended so as to prevent the accumulation of questions and motions, because the Dáil only sits one day in the week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have observed that to-day, and at the last sitting of the Dáil, questions continued up to 3.45 p.m., a quarter of an hour over the usual time.  If the pressure of business is not great extra time might be given to questions and a further number allowed on the Order Paper.  I might suggest, without making any invidious selection, that at least a dozen of the questions on to-day's Order Paper might have been &ldquo;starred&rdquo; in order <Col N="803" /> to save time.  On the other matters it is not for me to pronounce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No &ldquo;starring&rdquo; of questions is likely to get over the difficulty that has arisen.  When Deputies ask questions they often find it necessary to ask supplementaries, which is not possible where they are &ldquo;starred.&rdquo;  I should like to know if it is intended that the Dáil shall sit to-morrow or Friday or, if it is proposed to adjourn if this day's business is disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear about this.  There is no suggestion, implied or otherwise, that any restriction will be placed on the right of a Private Deputy to put down a question in his own absolute discretion provided it is within the rules of order.  I consider that to be one of the most valuable constitutional safeguards that citizens and Deputies have.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the question whether the Dáil will sit for the remainder of the week, that depends exactly on how we get on with the business.  There are Government Bills to be dealt with, and afterwards, if there is any desire on the part of Deputies to get on with Private Deputies' Business, I am sure they can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement that has been operative for the past four or five weeks has been that we met only for one day, and the expense of bringing.  Deputies up for one day's sitting will be obvious to the President. When Deputies arrive in Dublin to transact Dáil Business on Wednesday, if it is not possible to provide Government measures for consideration on Thursday, I suggest that Private Deputies' motions should be dealt with.  These are Parliamentary matters and should get attention.  When Deputies are brought to town they might as well be asked to deal with these motions instead of being allowed to return home after having spent only <Col N="804" /> one day here.  Can the President say if it is likely that the Government will dispose of the Government measures to-day and, if so, is it likely the House will be sitting to-morrow?  Can the President arrange if no business is available to provide time for the other motions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what time will be taken by the House on the business before it to-day.  We will not know how long it will take to finish the measures before the House.  The Rules of Order provide that at certain time Private Deputies' Business will be taken.  That was arranged to enable the Executive work to be continued at the same time.  If there is a reason for altering the rules I think we would have to consider it very carefully.  I could not give an offhand reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What situation is likely to confront us to-night?  If the Dáil deals with the items up to No. 23 then we reach 9 o'clock.  Is it likely that by 10.30 p.m.  Private Deputies' Business will be concluded, or will it be decided that the House will not sit until Wednesday of next week?  In the meantime will some effort be made to meet Private Deputies to-morrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no Government work ready to occupy the Dáil during the period provided in the Standing Orders, the usual rule is to adjourn the Dáil until business is available.  If there is any suggestion or desire on the part of Deputies to alter that, it would have to be very carefully considered before we could agree to it, because the Standing Orders have been arranged to make it possible for Executive work to continue while the Dáil is sitting.  We have to make sure that that is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion does not interfere with Government Business. The Dáil met last Wednesday and Deputies were brought to Dublin for one day's sitting.  If there is no Government Business on Thursday to justify a sitting I suggest that there should be no difficulty whatever in allowing the Dáil to devote time on Thursday for the consideration of Private Deputies' Business.</P>

      <P>I am aware, of course, that the same rule applies to <Col N="810" /> returning officers in the case of ordinary elections, but as the Minister well knows some papers get through without the official mark.  Apparently, nothing is being done here to ensure that that will not happen in this case. I have seen quite a large number of papers declared invalid at elections because they had not got the official mark on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  In connection with Clause 30 of the Second Schedule, I raised a point with the Minister on the last day about the possibility of a ballot paper falling into hands other than those of the voter who was entitled to vote, even though the paper was properly marked, and so on, and I pointed out that that vote must be counted.  For example, a voter, let us say, in the County Kerry, having learned that his vote was seized by another person and duly returned, then sends word to the returning officer or makes an affidavit about it, but the returning officer is bound to deal with that vote even though it is a stolen vote.  That is my point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, <Col N="813" /> Sir, might I ask that the Minister should consider, between now and the Report Stage, the question of the amendment he has introduced as a result of a suggestion by Deputy McGowan.  I am referring to the addendum that was put in as a result of Deputy McGowan's intervention, and which lays down certain conditions for being on the register.  I think the Minister should think the matter over between now and the Report Stage. For instance, what is the position of people who are on the register but who are not citizens of the Twenty-Six Counties?  Physically, they are on the register, but what is going to happen? Are they entitled to vote?  I take it for granted that the University authorities cannot revise the register from that point of view.  I suggest that, between now and the Report Stage, the Minister should think over the effect of his amendment.</P>

      <P>I take it for granted that there are.  I imagine that there would be quite a number of people in the Six Counties or, possibly, in England, who may be on the register, and how are these authorities to decide who is and who is not a citizen?  I do not see how they can do it, nor do I know of any machinery by which they can do it.</P>

      <P>On Section 9, I am surprised and disappointed that, notwithstanding the discussion on the Committee Stage and the Minister's promise to look into this matter, he has not submitted an amendment dealing with the objection made to nominations by commissioners acting as county councils.  I understood that the Minister undertook to consider the matter and I gathered that he was to submit an amendment which would satisfy the case that had been made. There was a good deal of discussion on this point and a rather strong feeling expressed by a number of Deputies that it was never contemplated, when county councils were given the right to nominate, that commissioners acting as such would have the same right.  I think it was further pointed out that we have had cases where a certain commissioner administered the affairs of two county councils and that there was nothing to prevent such a commissioner administering the affairs of four county councils.  He could, therefore, secure one nomination and he could, in fact, nominate himself. I understood the Minister felt the force of that criticism and would <Col N="818" /> bring in an amendment limiting the right of nomination to elected county councils and depriving a commissioner acting as such from making a nomination himself.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy says as to the feeling expressed on this subject of commissioners administering the affairs of county councils and allowing them to use the power of county councils for nominating a presidential candidate is quite correct. It is also correct that I expressed myself as generally in agreement with the view given voice to on different sides of the House on the matter. The Deputy will also remember that there was a difficulty properly raised, I may say, in the House to certain amendments which were submitted. I have examined the matter very carefully with my legal advisers and we are forced to the conclusion that it is not possible to amend this Bill in that way.  I have received positive advice that the only way to get over the situation is to amend the Local Government Act, 1925.  I have a Bill drafted to amend that Act so as to secure that the power of county councils in this matter will not go to commissioners appointed to exercise the functions of county councils and I hope to be able to introduce that Bill tomorrow.</P>

We have not discussed it as a constitutional amendment, but we have power to amend the Local Government Act, which gives the Minister power to transfer the functions of a county council to a commissioner&mdash;to transfer the powers in whole or in part&mdash;and we propose in the Bill, which I hope to introduce to-morrow, to eliminate the power of nominating.</P>

      <P>Are we, either by administrative Order or by an ordinary Bill in this House, entitled to run counter to the direct purpose of the Constitution?  I think a point of view that was urged the last day was that under this Bill we cannot amend another Act, on a side issue, so to speak, such as the ordinary Local Government Act.  I think, however, there is this precedent, and I wonder if the Minister has considered it.  One of the commonest things that happened with Bills of which I had charge was that when you had done something that was prohibited by another Act, by the Local Government Act, for instance&mdash;say to extend the borrowing powers given under the Act&mdash;you put in an amendment to the Local Government Act by saying: &ldquo;The moneys borrowed under this particular Act shall not count for the purposes of Section so-and-so of the Local Government Act.&rdquo;  Would not a similar amendment be in order here, providing that the power so conferred on the county council shall not operate so far as the commissioner is concerned or shall not be regarded as a power conferred on the commissioner under the Local Government Act.  Therefore, I think we can achieve the desired purpose by inserting an amendment to this Bill.  I wonder whether, if the House passed an amendment taking this power from the commissioner without amending this Bill, the commissioner would not still have the power under this Bill, when you take the purpose of the Constitution into consideration?</P>

I would ask him to beware of introducing an amendment deliberately overriding the purpose of the Constitution, which primarily is to give to each county the right of nomination.

      <P>In regard to Section 23, page 11, again I should like the Minister seriously to consider his machinery.  I cannot now discuss the wisdom&mdash;I cannot even raise it&mdash;of having a President appointed in this way; that has been decided by the Constitution.  I cannot even discuss the powers of the President.  I am not going to discuss these things, but the Constitution having laid down that the President will be elected by the people, I think that in the implementing legislation we should see that this election is not a farce.  It is difficult enough&mdash; as I pointed out to the Vice-President, and I think he will agree&mdash;to see that ordinary elections are properly conducted, that is, where there have been fierce election campaigns, where everybody's interest has been whipped up, where big Party organisations have been active, and have been trying to get agents to see that the elections are properly conducted.  It is difficult enough, as I say, when there is all the heat and interest of a general election. Now, I take it for granted that the Government wants this to be a serious election, and not merely a farce, but, if the Government relies on the ordinary machinery to secure a proper election in this case, I do not think they will get anything except a farce.  I do not know how many booths there will be throughout the country&mdash;possibly 6,000; it will be something like that in any case. Supposing we take it that there will be 6,000 booths.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite enough.  This election is for the purpose of electing a man who we are told will be, to a large extent, the ceremonial head of the State.  From the Minister's experience of politics, and from everyone's experience of politics and elections, can it be argued that it will be possible to get proper election agents and polling agents to attend at <Col N="826" /> those booths?  It is extremely difficult to do it at the moment.  I am raising this because it seems to me that unless there are very effective regulations to see that this election is properly conducted, then the election becomes a farce.  The Minister himself pointed out that there were cases of personation, so he alleged, in the Seanad election&mdash;which many people would think more important than the election of a ceremonial head of State, the election of a man who, we are told, at all events, is largely to be a ceremonial head of State.  We were told his other functions were comparatively slight. You cannot, in that election, work up the interest to get people to go and act as personation agents for individual candidates.  You cannot prevent what may be an entirely sham election by the ordinary machinery that we employ under different circumstances at the time of a general election.  We cannot discuss now the desirability of this method of election.  That is settled, but at least I think, if we continue to retain this as portion of the Constitution, that much more effective machinery will have to be provided in order to make the election a real election.  I do not think that under this machinery you will get anything except a sham election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we cannot discuss the method of election.  That has already been fixed for us.  Good or bad, that is settled. On the question of personation agents and the desirability of having them, I am with the Deputy, but other than getting the Civic Guards to act I do not see how you can in this election make any further arrangements for having personation agents.  You have to leave it to the good will of the people who want to see&mdash;and I am satisfied that Deputy O'Sullivan wants to see, and I know I want to see&mdash;a properly conducted election in this case. I am most anxious to see that it should be so, but I cannot see what machinery you can devise to get personation agents to act&mdash;machinery that would not be open to grave question from a political point of view.  I said here on the last day&mdash;I said it on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage&mdash;that the <Col N="827" /> Gárda Síochána were entitled on their own initiative to arrest people for personation or for suspected personation. I will read for the Deputy Section 25, sub-section (4) of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any police constable may, without any warrant, arrest any person who is found by such police constable committing the offence of personation or who is believed by such police constable to have committed such offence.</P>
      <P>If the police have reason to believe that a person is guilty, there is power there to arrest that person.  I do not see what machinery&mdash;other than political appointments, which I do not think the Deputy contemplates in this case&mdash;is available for the appointment of personation agents.  If the Deputy has any suggestion in mind, I should be glad to consider it.  I am as anxious as anybody can be to secure that personation, where attempted, should be stopped, not alone in this election but in any other election.  I do repeat what I said here before that I believe personation is not as common nowadays as it used to be.  I think the activities of everybody concerned, the activities of political parties on all sides, and the further powers exercised by the Gárda Síochána and rigidly enforced by the courts, generally speaking, when persons have been caught, have reduced personation, at least as far as my observation has gone, in recent years to a very small degree indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personation may or may not have been reduced in recent years as a result, as the Minister says, of the activities of different political parties, but you will not get that same activity&mdash;you cannot expect it&mdash;in an election like that of the President.  That is the matter to which I am really directing the Minister's attention.  It is unreasonable to expect anything of the kind from political parties.  Political parties find it difficult enough at general elections to provide proper election agents and personation agents.  Personation may have decreased as a result of the activities of those political parties, but my whole point is that you cannot get <Col N="828" /> your election agents for this election. The political parties will not be able to get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President may know the difficulty that there is very often of getting suitable election agents, even at a general election.  I suggest that even in the election of a man who is proclaimed to be mainly the ceremonial head of the State, you may not be able to get people to come in and act for the whole day and waste their time.  It cannot be done.  The Minister says he cannot think of any other machinery, but that will not prevent what I have indicated; the fact that machinery cannot be thought of will not prevent the election being a farce.  That is the difficulty.  I do not know what arrangements they have in continental countries for preventing personation. I have not heard much complaint in any continental country that I have been in on the question of personation. I admit their whole system of government is different and, therefore, there may be other modifications.  All I am urging is that, as the provisions stand in this Bill, the election is going to be a sham.  The Minister says he cannot prevent it, and possibly we are at one there.  I do not put that forward as another argument against this method of electing a President.  I merely submit that under this measure you are going to get a sham election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Gárda Síochána, let us assume that the Guard arrests one personator.  While that arrest is proceeding, what is to prevent any number of people coming in and carrying on personation?  That is one of the difficulties.  The Minister points out that the Guard has the right to prevent the offence of personation.  I am not aware that it is set out as a specific duty.  I can tell the Minister, so far as the country districts are concerned, that I have never seen it&mdash;<Col N="829" /> that is, the right of initiative on the part of the Guard.  In any election that I am familiar with, the initiative has always been taken by the personating agents who are there to represent the different candidates.  They challenge the person, then the presiding officer may come in and then the Guard will act.  All the personating agents I have spoken to in that connection have agreed with me on that point.  I am not questioning the law as set out by the Minister, but I am telling him the practice that is in vogue.  The general impression of the law is that the Guard can do nothing until the case is pointed out to him. That may be wrong in law, but then the general practice has given rise to that wrong view of the law.  In this instance I submit you are not going to get anything but a sham election. The fact that the Minister says he cannot do any better will not prevent the election being a sham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is overlooking the high ideals that we had in mind at the beginning as regards this head of the State, this ceremonial officer.  It was expected that we would be able to elect a man above politics&mdash;I think that was the expression used.  Now, the Minister's only hope for this appointment lies in the political parties.  That seems to be his only check, together with the Guards.  I have had the view all along, and I venture to prophesy that this election is going to be a sham and nobody is going to bother his head about it.  I do think, however, that we ought to try to avoid getting back to the rut of political parties.  If the Minister can suggest anything along that line, we would welcome it.  I do not know what means he can provide, but there ought to be some method provided if we are to have that ideal of a non-political head of the State, a ceremonial officer. There should be some method devised with regard to personating agents instead of having them appointed by the existing political parties.  If we cannot do anything better than that, then I am afraid the high ideals given expression to at the beginning are going to go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> As Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, I do not think the public interest will be keen enough in those elections, even to secure personating agents. Just visualise some non-political aspirant being faced with the task of appointing personating agents in all the polling booths in Ireland.  It would be a formidable task and no man could be expected to do it.  In the end we will simply go back to the political parties and have an ordinary political battle over the appointment of the ceremonial head of the State, and that will not get us anywhere. Some effort should be made to avoid that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before Section 33, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Each candidate at a presidential election shall, subject to regulations made under this section by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, be entitled to send by post, free of any charge for postage, to every person registered as an elector in any register of electors for the time being in force, one communication relating only to the said election and not exceeding two ounces in weight.</P>
      <P>(2)  A candidate shall not be entitled to exercise, in relation to a presidential election, the right of free postage under this section unless or until he and at least one other person have been declared by the presidential returning officer to stand nominated as candidates at such election and such election has been adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may permit a candidate at a presidential election to exercise the right of free postage under this section before he has become entitled under this section so to do upon his giving to the said Minister security to the satisfaction of the said Minister for the payment, in the event of his not becoming so entitled to exercise the said right, of the postage on all communications sent by him in pursuance of the said permission of the said Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> (4)  Regulations made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under this section may make provision in regard to the post office or several post offices at which communications sent in exercise of the right of free postage under this section shall be posted and, in particular, may require that communications so sent to persons in a particular constituency or other area shall be posted at a specified post office either in or outside such area.</P>
    <P>The last time we were discussing this Bill the question was raised, I think by Deputy McGowan, about giving the privilege of free postage.  That was not provided for in the Bill as originally drafted.  This amendment proposes to give that privilege under similar terms and conditions as are given in the Dáil elections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a very dangerous precedent. It would be very dangerous to give these powers to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or to anybody. You have here a provision which gives a certain right to a wealthy person, because no other person could do that; no other person could give that guarantee that he would pay, and possibly if he did give that guarantee the Minister would not accept it.  So far as the candidates are concerned, whether they are wealthy or otherwise, they ought to start from scratch, and I do not think there is any disability placed on a candidate by having that done.  If there is more than one nomination, then let the free postage start from that particular date.  Setting out that any person is entitled to free postage before there is a second or third candidate nominated, if that person gives a guarantee that he will refund the <Col N="832" /> money to the Post Office if there is not a contest, to my mind gives an unfair advantage to someone and I am definitely opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any advantage given to anybody. It is possibly a power that may not be called for; the Minister may not be called upon to exercise it; but it is, from the practical point of view, a useful power to give to the Minister if we consider a contested election in which there might be a number of candidates. If each of three or four candidates had a right to send out 2,000,000 letters, because there are almost 2,000,000 voters on the register, taking the country as a whole, some arrangement would have to be made so as to have the system operative.  There would have to be some understanding as to when these letters and circulars would be accepted and delivered.  They could not all be accepted at the one time and delivered at the one time.  It would help the Post Office and make things smoother and easier to have some system of free postage, where persons would give a guarantee of a refund in case they were not entitled to exercise the right of free postage. It would be all the better if persons were allowed to use these facilities at an early date.  The time would be short and, if there were four candidates, that would mean 8,000,000 postal packets to be delivered and that would be a big proposition for the Post Office.</P>

      <P>I think it would be much fairer if there was an arrangement made between the candidates. That might be arranged easily enough. Personally, I think it is not fair to give facilities to a candidate who can furnish the security for the repayment of those moneys.  It would be unfair to give him an opportunity of sending out his letters at an early date.  Perhaps there may be candidates who would prefer to send them out late. There is a certain advantage in being able to do a thing like that.  I do not agree with the Minister that it is not conferring an advantage on a candidate. If a man has security enough to offer to the Minister, he can have certain facilities, whereas another man may be prevented from doing that. <Col N="833" /> The Minister has not given us any real reason why this sub-section should go in.  So far as the postal arrangements are concerned, these can be arranged between the candidates at any time and I think it would be much fairer than giving a person with wealth and able to offer the security the right to send out these things in this way.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 35) Order, 1937, made on the 24th day of August, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This quota order, No. 35, relates to sparking plugs, that is to say, sparking plugs for motor engines.  These plugs and their main component parts are at present being manufactured in the Saorstát by two firms, one located in Dublin and the other in Drogheda. The plugs which these firms are producing have been subjected to very searching tests by Government Departments and by firms engaged in the assembling of motor cars, and they have been found to be of good quality. They are being produced in sufficient <Col N="835" /> quantities and sizes to meet the demands of this market.  Originally we thought it would be sufficient, in order to encourage the manufacture of these articles, to protect the firms engaged therein by imposing a customs duty.  A customs duty of ? per plug with a preferential rate of 1/-, was imposed in 1932.  The preferential rate was subsequently abolished.  In fact, we found by experience that an import duty had no effect at all upon the price of the plugs.  The reason is obvious. The cost of the sparking plug has no relation to the cost of a motor car.  Persons running motor cars will be influenced to purchase well-known and well-advertised brands irrespective of the price of them.  In fact, it can be said that the cost of manufacturing the plug has little or no relation to the price at which it is sold.</P>
    <P>There has been little relation between the sale price and the manufacturing cost.  The manufacturers, in fixing the price, found it was better for them to have the goodwill of the customer, and consequently a very substantial margin of profit was allowed.  It has now been thought well to restrict these imports by means of a quota order.  That quota order was made and is now submitted for ratification to the Dáil. Under the quota order the quantities of sparking plugs permitted to be imported have been substantially reduced, but there will be no difficulty in procuring adequate supplies.  Before the quota order was made a guarantee was secured from those engaged in the sale and manufacture of these plugs that their prices would not be altered following the passing of this motion. The number of persons engaged in the manufacture of sparking plugs last March was approximately eight.</P>

    <P>Both these orders relate to the same thing.  Quota Order 31 relates to electrical filament lamps and prohibits the importation of electrical filament lamps &ldquo;with a voltage at not less than 100 volts nor more than 250 volts and consuming not less than 20 watts nor more than 500 watts and fitted with a bayonet cap or a screw.&rdquo;  Subsequently the range was extended and, consequently, it was considered necessary to extend protection to lamps that consume not more than 1,500 watts It was found more convenient to divide the quota order into two parts, one relating to the ordinary type of lamp used in houses and offices and the other relating to lamps used in motor cars.  Hence, we have here two orders&mdash;one amending the original order and the other a new order designed to effect that change.  The net effect of the two is to extend the scope of the protection to these other classes of lamps, now being made here, and to provide that, instead of having one quota covering all types, there will be two quotas, one relating to household lamps and the other to motor car lamps.</P>

      <P>It was stated some time ago by the manufacturers that the importation of a very cheap lamp had affected their sales, that they did not mind the importation of a certain number of lamps from Great Britain, but that these cheap lamps, which, I understand, come from Japan, were a very serious menace to their trade. Incidentally, I dare say the Electricity Supply Board would be glad to see these lamps imported, because I imagine they use considerably more plugs than a better quality of lamp of similar type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there would be very much point in asking the ordinary distributors of lamps for their opinion, because most of them, I think, foresaw the possibility <Col N="838" /> of a duty and imported so many lamps that they were completely stocked up, and have not yet reached the stage of ordering Irish lamps in any quantity.  I do not think that there is an obligation on us to go out and seek opinions upon these goods when the tests we have made appear to indicate that they are satisfactory and when there is a general absence of complaint.  It is our experience that, if there is the slightest ground of complaint about any commodity manufactured here, we hear all about it, and the absence of complaint is a general indication that the quality is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no restriction upon the importation of lamps by country of origin.  The total number of lamps that may be imported is limited.  When Deputy Benson referred to the complaints of manufacturers, he had, I think, something else in mind.  The quota is fixed in accordance with our estimation of the requirements of the country as against the productive capacity of the manufacturers.  As a general rule, we make an estimate which will, at least, ensure that there will be no scarcity, and we frequently get complaints from manufacturers that the quota fixed is too large.  That is not, in itself, a thing that need cause perturbation, because most of the articles subject to quota orders are also subject to Customs duties so fixed as, in our opinion, to afford reasonable protection in any event. Some very cheap types of lamp were imported, and consequently the power of importation allowable by quota order was exercised to the full.  In the course of last year a fairly liberal quota was allowed.  That quota has since been reduced, and by this No. 34 Order the scope of the quota has been extended.  Prior to the making of that order, the manufacturers had to rely on the Customs duty only for protection in respect of the types of lamps not covered by the earlier order.  They have found that their sales have considerably increased since this new order was made, and, according to the information I have received, the number of persons employed in the manufacture of lamps <Col N="839" /> has also increased in the course of the past year.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 12) (Amendment) Order, 1937, made on the 24th day of August, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
      <P>This resolution relates to an Order amending Quota No. 12 Order, which restricted the importation of silk and artificial silk hose.  The main purpose of the amending Order was to alter the definition.  The original Order referred to &ldquo;hose and half-hose wholly or mainly of silk, artificial silk or a combination of silk and artificial silk.&rdquo;  It was found, in practice, that the definition was defective, and that the restrictions of the Order could be evaded by putting some cotton or worsted threads through the articles. Consequently, it was considered desirable to alter the words in the definition from &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; to &ldquo;wholly or partly.&rdquo;  That is the sole change made by the amending Order, except that half-hose was excluded from its scope.  The trade in silk half-hose is small and no substantial injury was done to Saorstát manufacturers by the exclusion of silk half-hose from the scope of the Order, while its exclusion facilitated considerably its administration and made it possible to adjust the quota more evenly to the requirements of the situation.  The quota for the present period is 240,000 pairs of articles, and the period extends from 1st October to 31st January next year. That represents, of course, a very considerable reduction upon imports in earlier periods.  In fact, the imports during that period will be only 24 per cent. of the imports during the corresponding period of 1934, that is, the period immediately prior to the making of the quota order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Production of silk and artificial silk hose in the Saorstát has, of course, <Col N="840" /> expanded very considerably.  It was negligible in the year 1932.  In that year the total number of pairs produced was 39,000, and in 1936 the production had increased to 3,286,000 pairs.  I have not got the exact figures for the number of persons employed in the production of silk and artificial silk hosiery, but the total number of persons employed on 1st March this year in all the hosiery factories of the Saorstát, irrespective of whether they were making silk hose or other classes of hose, was 4,475.  I notice that Deputy McGowan, in the course of a speech recently, referred to the size of the quota and indicated that he considered it too large, that the goods which will be imported in consequence of it could be produced in some factories in the Saorstát.  I do not think that is quite correct, but, apart from that aspect of the matter, the Deputy possibly overlooked that goods which are imported under licence have nevertheless to pay duty which at the present applies to these goods at the rate of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, with a minimum of 6/- per dozen pairs. That duty should, in itself, be sufficient to protect the manufacture of these goods here and make it possible for Saorstát manufacturers to get the whole of the market, were it not for the circumstances in which certain well-advertised brands secured a place in the public taste and were favoured by shopkeepers for one reason or another. The reason it was necessary to supplement the customs duty by a quota order was to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>As I explained when the Control of Imports Bill was passed, in the ordinary course a customs duty should be sufficient to protect any industry, but we recognised that there were certain industries where existing trade connections and the widespread advertising which was done in the past, and can still be done here through the medium of English papers circulating here, would result in imports continuing, despite the duty, and it was to deal with difficulties of that kind that this power to prohibit imports was taken, subject to such quantity as might be permitted to come in under licence.  In the case of every quota order, some <Col N="841" /> nominal quantity will always be allowed to be imported, because there are people who may have special tastes or who desire to get some special type of article and who are prepared to pay for it irrespective of the duties charged, and I see no reason why they should not be allowed to exercise that individual preference provided that the total quantity which may come in is not sufficient to upset seriously the prospects of success of a native industry.</P>
    <P>In the case of silk and artificial silk hose, however, I do not think it can be said that all the varieties which traders and the public demand are yet being produced here in sufficient quantities. No doubt the existing factories are quite capable of producing a sufficient number of pairs of silk and artificial silk stockings to meet the requirements of the country, but there are many differences of quality and design, and not all the qualities and not all the designs are as yet being produced sufficiently to meet what appears to be the public need.  In fact, we consult regularly with the Association of Hosiery Manufacturers and the organisation representing distributors, and endeavour to secure that the quota fixed for any period will be sufficient to stimulate production in the factories, while at the same time ensuring that the distributors will have a reasonable supply of all the different qualities and varieties they require.  For each period the quota is reduced and will continue to be reduced as production increases, until we reach some stage where a fixed number will be allowed in, subject to payment of duty every year and not liable to further reduction.  That stage has already been reached in relation to a number of articles, but it has not yet been reached in the case of silk and artificial silk hose, although, as the Deputy will notice, the quota permitted is in fact only a very small proportion of the total production of Irish factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that after hearing the Minister's explanation the situation has been eased considerably, but my remarks were simply to be <Col N="842" /> taken as what I might term locally. The Minister and everybody else is aware that the hosiery industry in this country is not one of the recent industries which have sprung up inside the last ten years.  The hosiery industry in Ireland is well over 100 years old, and it is considered that that hosiery industry is quite capable of competing with foreign importation, as it has done in the past.  When notice of this quota order was published in the Press some considerable time ago, employees of hosiery firms got together and definitely came to the conclusion that not alone could that amount mentioned by the Minister in his order, 240,000 pairs, be made in this country, but considerably more could be produced inside the three months period. Their simple grievance is that here you have imported into Ireland, during a period of three months, 240,000 pairs of articles which can be made in this country, and, at the same time, you have in the country, and in one particular town which is the home of the hosiery industry in this country, practically four-fifths of the hosiers walking the streets and one-fifth actually employed in the concern.  That is the situation that has to be met.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that it is the fault of the Minister or his Department, but there is something very seriously wrong, I suggest, with the management of the concerns engaged in this industry, or perhaps with the imposition of tariffs.  That is the sole reason for my remarks, and I definitely think, by way of suggestion to the Minister, that before he produces a quota order of this nature he might make inquiries into the productive capacities of the factories, and particularly a factory not very far from Dublin.  I admit there are certain varieties on the market in which the Irish firms are unable to compete.  If the Minister inquires further I think he will find more than meets the eye.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that hosiery is not a new trade, but the business of making silk and artificial silk is, in fact, new.  As I mentioned, the total production was 38,000 pairs, representing about 1 per cent. of the number of pairs used in that year.  In <Col N="843" /> 1936 the home production represented about 80 per cent. of the total number of pairs used, which means that there must have been a very remarkable expansion in the production of these goods.  That expansion has not been evenly distributed amongst existing factories, as some were quicker to take advantage of the new situation than others.  In fact, some of the older factories have not got the share in the new business that they might have got, whereas new factories that did not exist in 1932 have flourished and got a larger proportion of the market.  It is necessary to ensure that there is a reasonable prospect of all the goods produced here being sold.  We ensured that by a Customs duty.  Every pair of artificial silk stockings that comes in pays a Customs duty of 40 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, with a minimum of 6d. per pair.  Further, we provide that if people are prepared to pay the Customs duty, the total quantity that can be imported is limited to the number mentioned.  For that reason we make it possible for people who want a special variety or cut of these goods to get them, subject to payment of the duty.  It is necessary to do that, because all these varieties are not being produced in sufficient quantities here. It is only a matter of a short time until the quota fixed in the order becomes merely nominal.  I do not think we should bring that quota much lower than 5 or 10 per cent. of our requirements. That margin should be always allowed to ensure that people with odd tastes can satisfy themselves to whatever extent does not really interfere with the efficiency of the industry, and to enable some comparison to be made by the buying public between the goods that they can get from Irish factories and goods imported from abroad.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 15) <Col N="844" /> (Amendment) Order, 1937, made on the 24th day of August, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 2) (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1937, made on the 24th day of August, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 1) (Amendment No. 4) Order, 1937, made on the 24th day of August, 1937, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937.</P>
    <P>Quota Order No. 15 relates to inner tubes for cycles and motor cycles. Quota Order No. 14 relates to inner tubes for motor cars.  Quota Order No. 12 relates to covers for cycles and motor cycles and Quota Order No. 11 to outer covers for motor cars.  Deputies will remember that we amended these orders more than once.  When the production of these goods was commenced here a quota order was made which operated to restrict imports of the sizes then produced at Cork.  As the Cork factory went into production and started the production of other sizes the quota order was amended so as to bring other sizes within the quota.  Now we propose to make these quota orders apply to all these goods, irrespective of size. It is desirable to do that because, by various devices, some people might import, as they have succeeded in importing tyres, but not to a great extent, and also because we have what we had not in previous orders, power to impose certain conditions in licences, to ensure that these licences are not, in fact, used to import sizes or classes of tyres that cannot be procured at home.  Our difficulty in the past was that when a quota was made, and licences issued, these licences could be used to import any goods of the description <Col N="845" /> to which the quota order applied, irrespective of whether they were made here or not.  We have amended the Act to impose certain conditions. It is much better to facilitate the importation of a few odd sizes and designs of tyres, not made here, and the issue of licences in relation to these, rather than have a general quota which might be used to import any size of tyre.  We made the order to apply to all sizes of tyres, and the quota will be fixed at such a figure, in each case, as we consider necessary, to enable whatever requirements in unusual sizes are likely to arise, when the licence will be issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a second time.  The object of the Bill is to protect under-sized and immature fish from the ordinary methods of fishing. Numerous complaints have been <Col N="847" /> received from time to time from fishermen all over the country that under-sized and immature fish were being caught and sold at a cheap rate, and in that way were bringing down the price of fish generally, thereby depriving our fisheries of a fuller supply of fish later on.  Regulations of the nature provided for in this Bill are already in force in most Western European countries.  Measures similar to this will, it may be assumed, be adopted by all the countries adhering to the International Convention signed on the 23rd March of this year by the representatives of this and nine other countries, namely, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Sweden.  All the signatories undertook to enforce provisions similar to this within their own fishery limits and in their own boats.  The regulations made relate to the effective size of the mesh of the net, and impose limits on the size of the fish landed or offered for sale.  The fishes dealt with are: cod, haddock, hake, plaice, witches, lemon sole, black sole, turbot, brill and megrims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an enabling Bill.  It empowers the Minister to prescribe the minimum size of the mesh of nets, and the minimum size of the fish to be landed or marketed.  The size to be so prescribed will be based on the recommendations of the International Council for the Study of the Sea whose headquarters are at Copenhagen.  The regulations will, of course, be applicable to all our own sea fishing boats, as well as to any others found within our exclusive fishery limits.  The sections of the Bill are, I think, self-explanatory. Perhaps I should explain that Section 8 adopts certain provisions of the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933, and tell Deputies what these provisions are.  Under that Act a sea fisheries protection officer has power to stop any ship within our fishery limits for the purpose of identifying that ship or of boarding that ship.  Our protection officer may board the ship and may require the master or crew to produce its certificate of identity, and also the log book or any other documents which may be kept that he is concerned with.  He may ask for an explanation <Col N="848" /> of anything that he may find in these log books or documents.  He may take the name and address of any person on board.  If he suspects the ship of being engaged in any illegal practice, he may take the ship to the nearest or most convenient port, and may use force in doing any of these things. That Act also provides for fine or imprisonment on any person obstructing or impeding the protection officer in the exercise of his duty, and it indemnifies him against legal proceedings in respect of anything he did under the authority of the Act.  The Act further authorises the protection officer to hold the boat at port pending the institution of legal proceedings before a justice of the District Court, or a peace commissioner, and authorises the hearing of the case by a district justice.  It provides for the detention of the boat pending the hearing of an appeal.  The Act provides for the recovery of fines and for the prosecution of any person at the suit of the Minister.  Section 9 of the Bill is taken substantially from the 1925 Act.  Section 24 of the Fisheries Act of 1925 is almost the same as Section 9 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The first essential of good legislation is that it be enforceable. I have no doubt at all that the provisions of this Bill are excellent, but will its purpose be achieved?  At the moment one of the greatest suppliers of matter for the humorous journals of this country is our fishery protection vessel.  Now we are being asked to pass another Bill which seems to provide additional scope for the operations of that vessel.  I would like to know whether the Minister proposes to take any steps to make the present operations of that vessel more effective, or to employ more vessels so that the protection of our fisheries may become effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with what the previous Deputy has said and to point out that what he has said is really true&mdash;in other words, that this question of fisheries in this country has become a sort of a joke.  I suggest that, if the Minister will look over the statistics relating to the fish industry&mdash;or what was at one time an <Col N="849" /> industry in this country&mdash;he will see that it has practically disappeared, and that, as I have stated in this House before, the disappearance of the industry is becoming more rapid as time goes on.  From time to time, the Minister has been urged to do something to protect the fish industry that we have, or had, and nothing whatever has been done in connection with it.  There is no form of activity for the protection of the fish industry except the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; coming along now and again and catching a foreign trawler, having a fine imposed and having the trawler's gear confiscated.  As a matter of fact, latterly, we have not been very successful even in that.  I am sure it will have been observed by Deputies that there was a very peculiar case recently in Bantry in which, owing to some legal technicality, or something in connection with the bye-laws, the boat concerned got away; and yesterday, in Waterford, there was a case of a boat also getting away, under somewhat similar circumstances.  I suggest that this makes this question of the protection of our fisheries ridiculous.  This Bill is not a Bill to deal with the protection of fish, but to deal with the protection of immature fish.  The trouble is, however, that there are no fish in this country to be got at all, either mature or immature, and I think we should lay down very stringent rules &mdash;rules which, perhaps, may not be enforceable&mdash;to deal with this whole question, and that something should be done to provide our people with some proper way of catching the fish and also protecting our fisheries from the depredations of marauding foreign trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question affects the hardest-working and poorest of our people.  It affects, particularly, the maritime constituencies. I have brought all the influence on the Minister I could bear, with the object of seeing that something should be done for these poor people, and nothing is being done except what has been done through the very belated efforts of the Sea Fisheries Protection Association.  So far as I can see, nothing has been done through the Department itself.  If the Minister will look at the recent Statistical Abstract he will see that since his Party <Col N="850" /> came into office we have had a decrease of more than 25 per cent. in the number of people engaged in the fishing industry and that the number of boats has correspondingly decreased.  I think that the maximum number of people engaged in the fishing industry in this country is 7,000, and it must be remembered that this country has the largest coast-line of any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that we are not serious in this country about this question of the fishing industry.  If we were serious about it, we would try to do something to remedy the situation; we would try to bring some kind of knowledge to bear on the matter; and I accuse the Minister of doing nothing in connection with this very important matter.  I make that accusation against the Minister with the reservation, of course, that I know he has other problems&mdash;particularly on the agricultural side&mdash;which take up too much of his time and which, therefore, do not give him the time to deal with this important question of the fishing industry.  Nevertheless, I think the Minister should know that that industry is, or at least should be, very important.  Important as it should be, however, it is worth scarcely anything to this country at present.  We land something like £130,000 worth of fish in this country ourselves and we import twice that amount.  That is a very serious matter, and I suggest that something should be done in the Minister's Department with a view to getting hold of people who would be really serious about the fishing industry and who would tackle the problem in a broad spirit and in the proper way&mdash; people who would infuse some imagination into the Department.  From the point of view of that industry, I suggest that the Department is becoming moribund.  So far as this Bill is concerned, it looks to me as if we will have to bring in a Bill to put some life into the Fisheries Department itself.  From that point of view, I look upon this Bill as so much waste of time.  I understand that the Bill is being brought in in accordance with a convention arrived at between other European countries.  It may be very good for these other countries because, probably, they have fish to deal with, <Col N="851" /> but it is a bit of a farce to draw a distinction in this country between mature and immature fish when you have no fish of any kind to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fionán Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that I find myself rather more in agreement with Deputy Mongan than with Deputies Benson or O'Neill in connection with this matter.  After all, this Bill is an enabling Bill, and the provisions, as set out in the Bill, deal with matters that have been asked for by the fishermen themselves in this country and by the Sea Fisheries Protection Association.  The Bill enables the Minister to make Orders in connection with the seizure or the catching of certain types of fish, and so on, and I think that, at least, the Bill, does not deserve to be spurned.  The provisions in the Bill are good provisions and, for what they are worth, the House ought to give them a fair reception.  Now, the Minister pointed out that Section 9 of the new Bill has been taken more or less word for word from the 1925 Act.  I forget the provisions of the particular section of the 1925 Act concerned, but there is just one point in connection with this Section 9 of this Bill which struck me as important. I thought it was rather ridiculous that, according to sub-section (d) of Section 9 of this Bill, a sea fisheries protection officer should be authorised and empowered to stop, enter, and <Col N="852" /> search, on any part of the sea or the shores thereof, any boat used for certain types of fishing, and so on.  Now, the Fisheries Act of 1925 dealt with inland fisheries, and I take it there are no provisions there for any searches on the sea.  Even if there were any provisions dealing with searches, I take it they were confined to our own territorial waters.  I think, therefore, that there must be some oversight in sub-section (d) of Section 9 of this Bill in connection with this authorising or empowering a protection officer to make such a search &mdash;for what that power would be worth&mdash;of a ship on any part of the sea.  No sane fisheries officer would attempt to exercise that power outside our own territorial waters, I know, but at the same time, I suggest, there should not be anything in the Bill which would seem to be absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I think it should be remembered that it is providing for something which has been agreed upon by a great many of the European countries, and that is that all the countries concerned should bring in similar measures to try to protect immature fish so far as that can be done.  It must be remembered, also, that the Minister is only falling into line with other countries in this regard, and he should not be attacked because he has fallen into line in this matter with these other countries.  Apart from that, it must also be remembered that there has been a demand from people in this country for the bringing in of such a measure.  It is well known that it is not only foreigners coming to our shores who kill immature fish. It is known that amongst the offenders in that connection are some of our own fishermen&mdash;some of whom have absolutely no regard for our own or their own future welfare, because they are shortsighted themselves in that regard and take immature fish. While such people make great outcries against the foreigner for taking immature fish, they are quite prepared to do the same thing themselves, and the object of this Bill is to try to stop our own fishermen, as well as the foreigners, from doing so and, <Col N="853" /> so far as the Bill does that, I think it should be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the first Deputy that there is not very much use in passing an Act unless we can enforce it.  The inference, I think, in the Deputy's speech was, that we were not in a position to enforce these Acts because our protection service was not what it should be.  There has been talk from time to time, both in the Dáil and in numerous journals, about the inadequacy of our protection service.  Although I have held here, on some occasions at any rate, that our protection service was not altogether to be despised, I did think that it would be better if we could get a second cruiser.  We have been trying to get a cruiser, and I think we have now succeeded in getting one in addition to the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo;; and if no legal or engineering inspection crux should arise, we should have a second cruiser in our service in a very short time.  That is an answer to the question as to whether we intended to increase our protective service.  I think, however, that we should say that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; has been very successful, even though she is all alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill complains that we lost two cases recently owing to legal technicalities.  Naturally, these legal technicalities would not have been discovered were it not for the fact that the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; had captured two vessels and brought them in.  Of course, she did bring in many more, and fines were inflicted in these cases. Deputy O'Neill more or less disparages that sort of thing.  He said he did not see the use of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; going out, bringing in a vessel, having a fine inflicted, and then letting her off again.  What does he want us to do?  Does he want us to declare war on the country concerned?  We cannot go very much further, and we never intended to go further than to capture a poaching vessel, inflict a fine, and let her off again.  We have, of course, power to confiscate a vessel if we catch her two or three <Col N="854" /> times, and that may be done.  For the present we cannot do any more.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill talks of these poaching vessels coming in and taking our fish.  He complains at the same time that there is no fish being caught by our own fishermen.  If it is a fact that these poaching vessels can come in and reap a rich harvest, and that our own fishermen are not catching any fish, I think our own fishermen must be somewhat to blame.  I do not think it is a fact.  I do not think these trawlers are getting such a rich harvest at all.  They are not very often within the fishery limit, I believe, and on the few occasions on which they were there, perhaps they have not done so well as some people imagine.  However, I agree with Deputies that we should do something to improve the lot of our fishermen so far as we can.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Neill is right or not in his figures as to the decline of fishing.  I know that fishing has been declining, but I do not know that his figures are correct&mdash;that it has gone down 25 per cent. in the last five or six years.  That may be, but that would not be the beginning of the decline here&mdash;on that I am quite definite.  I do not know if the blame can be laid upon either the present Minister for Fisheries or any of his predecessors, because, as Deputy O'Neill says, they have bigger things to occupy their minds, such as agriculture and other matters.  The same trouble appears to be confronting Ministers in all other countries.  I do not know whether we can give a very easy explanation of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Neill points out that, while we are catching a certain amount of fish, there are big imports coming in.  I agree with what that argument would appear to indicate&mdash; that we should keep out these imports and supply the demand with our own fish.  I have been making great efforts for the last few years to try to get a trawling company going here, because I think that we could not possibly at the moment shut out the imports of fish and then wait while we were building up our own inshore fisheries. If we had a good trawling fleet, we <Col N="855" /> could undoubtedly shut out the imports of fish.  I have announced in the Dáil and elsewhere on many occasions during the last few years that there is an opportunity there for a commercial company to come in and take over the trawling, and if that were done, I think we would be perfectly justified in protecting our market then for our own fishermen, including our own trawler company.  There has been some progress made in that also, and I hope, if successful in getting this company going, that it may be possible to come before the Dáil with the necessary legislation to do what Deputy O'Neill has in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say off-hand.  That is one of the matters that will take a good deal of consideration in detail before it can be decided.  They must fish on separate grounds, and provide for the different varieties of fish required, and for the landing of that fish in the different centres as required.  All these details have to be gone into.  I think it is possible to deal with all these matters and to get a trawling company going that will make it possible to protect our market, and then I believe we will be in a much better position to give a better market and more protection to our inshore fishermen.  I do not think there was any other point raised.  I only say that the matters which do not strictly arise out of the Bill, those big matters of protection of our fisheries and protection of our market, are matters that have been engaging my attention for some time, but they are by no means easy matters to solve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, might I ask a question? In the interim while his plans are maturing, will he consider this plan?  He may find in it a permanent solution of most of his difficulties. That is simply to say to the inshore fishermen with whom I am concerned &mdash;I am not interested in trawling; I am only interested in our inshore fishermen&mdash;&ldquo;Go out and fish, and I <Col N="856" /> will take all the fish you can catch from you, at a modest price&rdquo;; and then bring that fish to Dublin, Cork, and the other centres where there is a market for fish, sell as much as he can, and, if necessary, give away the balance? The Minister is subsidising sugar beet at an immense sacrifice. The total annual sum necessary to put that plan into operation would be microscopic, and, in the course of five years, it would quadruple the number of men who could make a living out of inshore fishing.  That is a simple plan.  I admit the Minister would suffer a loss.  I am prepared from this side of the House to support the Minister or the Minister for Finance in raising whatever money is necessary to meet that loss.  If that is done, it will employ every unemployed inshore fisherman in this country within six months.  There is a concrete suggestion. Will you consider it?</P>

      <P>I do not know if I would be in order in going into the question of financing beet-growing on this Bill.  The plan suggested by the Deputy is so simple and obvious that it has been considered by every Minister for Fisheries in this country, by every official in the Department, and by everybody who has anything to do with the Sea Fisheries Association, I am quite certain.  Nobody could escape examining that plan.  Without going into all the intermediary arguments, I say that the plan is not possible until we can first assure our consumers that we are going to have sufficient fish for them.  That will be the next step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I should like to make a brief reference on this stage, in the hope that the Minister may bring it to the notice of the appropriate Ministry. One of the Bills in the Schedule has to do with labourers' cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this point to be considered.  Under the legislation which we recently passed for the provision of additional labourers' cottages there is a provision that when the cottages are built they must be allotted to tenants in a certain order of suitability, and that in the event of the local authority failing to do that, the Minister can intervene to upset the allotment of cottages, point out that a more deserving applicant for a cottage has been turned down, and require the local authority to reconsider the allotment of the cottage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That provision, in my experience, works admirably and is very necessary, but, oddly enough, it only applies to cottages built under recent legislation. It only applies to new cottages.  There are in the country hundreds of cottages built under this Act, and in the case of one of these cottages, even if the allotment is manifestly improper, the Minister has no power to intervene and direct the attention of the local authority to the mistake that has been made.  I would suggest that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should invest himself with the same discretion in regard to the old cottages that he at present enjoys in regard to the new.  I think every member <Col N="859" /> of a board of health would endorse what I say in that regard except such members as happen to be corrupt persons. In regard to the new cottages, the Minister, as I have said, can intervene and override the allotment made by the local authority.  I am satisfied that the same system should be extended to the old cottages.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me for a moment I should like to correct a misapprehension under which he apparently labours at the moment.  When the Deputy had <Col N="861" /> finished speaking I was going to point out that this matter had already been discussed on the Committee Stage, that no amendment was down on the Report Stage, and that therefore any discussion which there might be on the matter would more properly arise on the Fifth Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the Minister's duty to move in the House that the Bill be read for the last time on the Fifth Stage, and doubtless observing the ordinary rules of Parliamentary procedure, he would comment on whatever observations I thought fit to make on the Fifth Stage.  That is a matter for the Minister and not for me.  I want to direct attention to a development in the situation since the Committee Stage was taken.  On that stage I directed the attention of this House to the scandalous situation precipitated by the introduction of the firm of Pepper Lee into this country for the purpose of competing with established Irish industries, and of requiring those established Irish industries to buy their yarns from Pepper Lee and Company. No such grotesque arrangement has ever been sponsored by a Minister for Trade in any country in the world. Following that, apparently, we are now confronted with an order under which all imports of cloth over a certain weight are to be prohibited as from 1st December, and all the cloths over that weight are to be manufactured in this country out of yarns purchased from Pepper Lee and Company.  Now, in that connection I think the time has come to speak out quite clearly.  I hear a lot of captious and unreasonable criticism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to this matter. I hear a lot of people who are shouting at every street corner in favour of the policy of national self-sufficiency; who are exhorting the Minister for Industry and Commerce to push forward with a vigorous tariff and restrictive policy in order to benefit what they are pleased to call Irish industry, and I hear those very same people, the moment that policy touches their interest, loudly lamenting and deploring the awful tragedy that the implementation of the policy which they advocated for everybody <Col N="862" /> else is going to bring upon themselves.</P>
      <P>Now, the sooner the people of this country face those issues squarely, the better it will be for everybody.  If they want a policy of national self-sufficiency, Seán Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is going the best way about it, and all the extravagances of which he has been guilty in the past are nothing to the extravagances of which he will have to be guilty in the future if the policy of national self-sufficiency is to be brought to a logical conclusion, and the people ought to face that.  There is no use in going on deputations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, asking him to do this and not to do that, and then shouting from the house-tops that it is his duty as a patriot and a loyal servant of the State to push forward with the policy of national self-sufficiency.  If we are going to have national self-sufficiency, then the people of this country are going to have a lower standard of living, and if they do not like it they will have to lump it. There is no escape from that.  A policy of national self-sufficiency means that the wages which the people earn are going to go a shorter distance; they are going to buy less.  There are some people in this country so foolish as to imagine that by raising wages indefinitely in an attempt to catch up on the rise in the cost of living they will preserve the standard of living which the working people in this country have been in the habit of enjoying in the past.  That is a complete illusion, because, if the costs of production are sufficiently raised in industry in this country to get out of all relation with the fundamental industry of agriculture in this country, the inevitable consequence is that we will be pushed off the sterling standard, and we will have a fierce period of inflation in Ireland, and the Minister for Finance knows that. The result of that will be misery and suffering for all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of which this duty on woollen yarns is a part is going to raise the cost of clothing to everybody in this country substantially.  The scheme of which this duty is a part is going to <Col N="863" /> restrict immensely the variety of clothes which the women in this country will be able to wear.  Now there may be patriots in this House who take the view that they ought to be glad to wear Irish tweed and proud to turn out in it.  Nevertheless, if they were going to a dance with any of those young ladies, and she arrived in a pair of brogue shoes and a tweed dress, they would send her home again and tell her to go and get a good dress. Why should our people be constrained to wear clothes that they do not like? Is it not part of a decent standard of living that the people should be able to buy for their earnings the things they enjoy having?  Is it necessary to be an ascetic in order to be a good citizen?</P>
    <P>Does living in this country in the future mean that anyone who stays here must hope for nothing better than a standard of living equal to that of the poorest peasant in middle Europe?  If there are men so lost in folly as to think that a policy of that kind can be pursued, they are going to get a dreadful disillusionment, because what is going to happen in this country is that the people will not stand for it, and they will fly out of the country as they are flying at the present time.  Why do you think girls are going to Manchester?  Why do you think girls are going to domestic service in London?  Why do you think girls are flying out of rural Ireland into the industrial cities of England every day?  It is because with the money they earn in Ireland they cannot get the things they want to have, and with the money they earn in England they can get them and do get them.  How are you going to keep the people in this country if you are going to require them to accept in Ireland a lower standard of living than they can have for the asking in Great Britain?  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>If you are going to reduce the population of this country indefinitely, are not the very firms that you are seeking to help with this duty going to be destroyed, because by your policy of raising costs to those firms, by your policy of raising the price of the raw materials of those industrialists, you are making it impossible for them ever to dream of exporting any of <Col N="864" /> their produce?  You are taking from them any chance of getting an external market.  You are ordering them for all time to depend on the home market.  You are saying to them: &ldquo;No matter how high we force your primary costs we will put up a tariff or prohibition on imports which will enable you to get from the Irish people an economic price for your product.&rdquo; But suppose the Irish people fly out of the country?  Suppose the domestic market contracts and dwindles?  There is not going to be room here for the old industrialists, never mind Pepper Lee.  When that time comes, do you think it is Pepper Lee who are going to clear out?  Not on your life.  Pepper Lee have machinery that was manufactured within the course of the last 12 months.  Pepper Lee have a guarantee of permanent protection and patronage from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Pepper Lee have a Minister for Industry and Commerce who says in this House that certain of the old industries may have to go. What we are really doing is this: We are bringing an English firm into Ireland and we are inviting that firm to charge our people 50 per cent. more for an article inferior to what they are producing in England, and we are patting ourselves on the back and declaring that we are the greatest economists and patriots that ever emerged in this country.</P>
    <P>Pepper Lee and Co. are at this moment engaged in the manufacture of textiles in Great Britain and they are manufacturing in Great Britain every cloth that they are going to manufacture in Ireland.  They manufacture ten times as many cloths in England as they will ever manufacture in Ireland and if they had to sell us the cloths they make in England they would have to take 2/- to 3/- a yard less for what they produce there than for what they produce here.  They are going to give our people a dearer article and a smaller selection and in the course of the next ten years they are going to destroy a considerable number of well-established Irish mills. Some people will say that if the Irish mills cannot meet the demand, let them go.  That is not what we were <Col N="865" /> told was the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil.  This country was never led to understand that the industrial policy of the present Government was to bring in foreign firms to wipe out the Irish firms.</P>
    <P>These old Irish woollen textile mills had a good export trade.  In 1929 we exported to the open markets of the world, in competition with the Scotch, the English and the American mills. We exported, and profitably sold, 1,000,000 square yards of woollen textiles. The wages for making these textiles were paid to Irish workmen and the profits derived from the sale of the 1,000,000 square yards went into Irish products.  We have now reduced our exports to 450,000 square yards, and when this instrument passes into law you will wipe out the old-established mills completely.  You are going to bring in Pepper Lee to strangle the established Irish mills and, in an endeavour to obscure the imminence of disaster consequent upon that, the Minister makes an order prohibiting the import of all cloths over 7ozs. in weight which cost 3/9 per square yard.  How far is this Government prepared to go in beating down the people's standard of living?</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate my impatience with the captious critics of the Government who are continually asking them to impose tariffs and howling when they put them on.  Our position is entirely different.  We have taken up the position all along that the tariff instrument, as used by the Government, is doing infinite harm to this country.  We have believed, and still believe, that in the existing state of the world a moderate use of tariffs can be defended on empirical grounds. Theoretically&mdash;and I emphasise the word theoretically&mdash;the ideal to aim at is universal free trade.  But that is a theoretical ideal and, in the existing state of the world, it is an ideal the realisation of which one cannot contemplate in the immediate future. Nevertheless, it is an ideal towards which every sane country should be working.  In the imperfect state of the world a country like our country, of which it may be said that it is industrially backward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I was saying, in a country which may be described as industrially backward, you can defend the use of a modest tariff in order to provide our own industrialists with a stimulus to achieve so high a degree of efficiency in that particular line of business that not only can they cater for the home trade, but develop an export trade as well.  We are satisfied that an informal use of the tariff instrument can achieve that end, and can achieve that end without placing upon the backs of the consuming public an undue burden.  But it must be an informal use.  It must be a use made of the tariff instrument after appropriate consultation with interested parties and after expert estimates of the burden which it may be expected to impose on the consuming public. Unless use of that kind is made, you are going to have the ridiculous situation which we have had in this country for the last five years, in which a tariff put on on Monday is completely negatived by another tariff put on on the following Friday.  You are going to have a situation in which one industry is stimulated to-day by a tariff and slaughtered later by another tariff with which the Minister hopes to stimulate another industry.</P>

      <P>I know only too well. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has announced his intention to prohibit the importation of woollen textiles over 7 ozs. in weight which cost 3/9 per square yard.  These are the textiles manufactured from certain yarns and rovings referred to in the reference to the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 125) Order in No. 132 of 1937&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister interrupted I was just distinguishing between the captious critics of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who clamoured for tariffs and then criticised the Minister when he put them on, and our position.  We believe, and always did believe, and indicated our beliefs in moderate tariffs.  If one surveys the horizon of Irish industry <Col N="868" /> to-day one finds that every decent industry, every industry that is producing goods at a reasonable price, paying good wages and making a solid contribution to the national welfare is an industry founded under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Standing on that, we are prepared to consider moderate tariffs.  The imposition of tariffs of the class covered in this Bill can lead to nothing but economic ruin for this country.  I hope at a later stage or on another occasion to direct the attention of the Dáil to the steady disappearance of our people's resources and their inability to buy anything much less commodities the price of which has been raised to unreasonable heights by a tariff policy of this kind.  In the meantime, taking the view, as I take it very strongly, that the reference 2 in this Bill combined with the forecasted order which the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to make, will destroy the woollen industry of Ireland, I shall certainly oppose this Bill at every stage, and I sincerely hope that even at the eleventh hour the Dáil will decide to reject it.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say anything in reply to what Deputy Dillon has just said.  The House is in a tolerant mood this afternoon.  The Deputy has been, for the Deputy, comparatively silent to-day.  It is customary for him to unburden himself at great length once every day. This is the time when the House can see through the Deputy's very lengthy efforts.  But as the Deputy has admitted in his concluding efforts that he would oppose this Bill even now at the eleventh hour I take it he felt he had been speaking on the Fifth Stage of the Bill, but this is merely the Report Stage.  It is not the eleventh hour.  The eleventh hour will come in due course on another day, and I suppose we shall hear Deputy Dillon at great length repeating over and over again the erroneous statements to which the House has listened this afternoon.  No doubt they will be contradicted, but again at the twelfth hour Deputy Dillon will come up smiling and repeat them.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Standard of Living&mdash;Abolition of Duties on Footstuffs&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.&mdash;(Deputies McGilligan and Morrissey).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in dealing with this matter on two occasions, went to a lot of trouble to defend the Government and to show that, so far as the high cost of living and the ability of the people to meet the existing situation were concerned, the Government was not responsible.  The Minister is generally very interesting and he is a very good barometer as showing the way Fianna Fáil is feeling in regard to certain questions.  Whenever you see the Minister taking up the aggressive attitude he took up on this motion, losing his temper and his voice about it, you may be perfectly sure that he has a bad case.  These are his tactics.  Notwithstanding all that, I am becoming more and more convinced that the Minister knows perfectly well that he and his Party are responsible for the present state of affairs.  His bluff will be called some fine day, not by his opponents in this House but by the condition of things in the country, which neither he nor anybody else can ignore.  There is no use in hedging this country around with tariffs, quotas, licences and duties and, at the same time, saying that all these things are not responsible in some degree for the high cost of living.  No sane person would say that.  It does not matter what pains the Minister takes to impress on the House that his tariffs, quotas, duties and licences are not responsible for the high cost of living, he will not get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very unfortunate for this country that Fianna Fáil, the Government <Col N="872" /> at the moment, have lost sight of the main industry in its efforts to build up an industrial arm.  There is no use whatever in endeavouring to build up an industrial arm unless you have a thriving main industry&mdash;in this country, a thriving agricultural industry. Everybody agrees on that.  The Minister does not say that in the House, but whenever he goes out to open a factory, he always takes the opportunity of saying it.  It is a great truth which nobody can get behind. We all pay a kind of lip-service to agriculture, but the unfortunate thing is that while the Government do that, they seem to forget it so far as legislative action is concerned and so far as any thought for putting agriculture in a position in which it will be able to meet the demands made upon it by duties, quotas, tariffs and everything else is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate also that in this country we have at present a system of tariffs, or a tariff policy, which is not at all the result of legislative action, but is the result of Executive action.  There was an Act passed here which gave the Government certain authority in respect of those matters, gave them the right to put on tariffs for certain periods and to bring them before the House afterwards for approval.  If one takes up to-day a list of the articles tariffed and tries to pick out the articles tariffed by legislative action as distinct from Executive action, one would be amazed that this House at any time handed over to the Executive the right to tax in the way in which it has.  We all admit that the Government have a responsibility towards industrialists in this country, as Governments have in others, and it would be no use trying to build up industry in this country if our markets were to be flooded with the products of cheap world labour; but in endeavouring to build up that side, the Government has apparently forgotten the other side altogether.  I think, however, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he gets a chance to mend his hand, will do so. I do not know that he will get the chance, though.</P>
    <P>In volume 69, No. 4, at column 544, the Minister makes two statements <Col N="873" /> which, I am sure, will be read with astonishment by many of his supporters in this country.  This, mind you, is the Minister who has gone out on a policy of self-sufficiency and has hedged this country round with tariffs, quotas and licences in order to achieve that self-sufficiency. Speaking on this motion, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The standard of living of our community would be increased if the national income were increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The national income will be raised when we get higher prices for our exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two astonishing statements from the Minister.  They do not bear out his anxiety for a policy of self-sufficiency in this country, but in that the Minister is simply bearing witness to the truths which have been recognised in every country in the world.  I want to quote from the speech of an Australian gentleman, quite recently, in the Commonwealth Parliament in Australia.  Speaking on agriculture, the Minister, the Hon. Sir Henry Gullett, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Failure to expand the overseas demand for their goods must mean restriction to the present volume of production, which in turn, unless the home consumption market was to be glutted and prices broken, must mean the abrupt cessation, of all scientific advancement in every branch of agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not much difference between the two statements.  In fact, there is none, except that he simply mentioned agriculture, while the Minister for Industry and Commerce was dealing with exports which, in the main, represent agriculture, so far as we are concerned. The Minister should act upon the principles he enunciated there, that the standard of living will be increased when our national income is increased, and if he goes back to the Statistical Abstract which he recommended to us and to the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> which he also recommended, and gather from them what were the chances of an increase in national income, what were the chances of an increase in our export trade, he will <Col N="874" /> not find much hope or much encouragement in either of them.  The extraordinary thing is that the Minister stands up here and plays a game of bluff.  He suggested that Deputies opposite should read the volumes which his Department publishes.  I am going to read one of them.  In the light of what the Minister said about our national income being increased if we increased our export trade, it makes very doleful reading.  On page 198 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for September, we have the Saorstát crops and live stock returns of 1937, and the extraordinary thing about it is that notwithstanding the fact that the Minister apparently believes what he said in that statement, he has no regard whatever for the facts which are published by his own Department.  He always goes out of his way to say that notwithstanding everything else, this country is flourishing.</P>
    <P>This is not, I must say, a complete return; it is a partial return from the Department.  As far as it goes, it discloses that tillage has dropped by 19,000 acres, milch cows by 38,000, cattle of all kinds by 50,000, pigs by 60,000, sheep by 73,200, and poultry by 916,000.  These are not my figures. They were published by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Government have gone out on a supposedly tillage policy.  If these figures are any way correct; that policy is not a success.  What we must aim at, no matter to what Party we belong, because we have all to live in this country, is the ability of the people to pay their way.  As far as I am concerned, I do not want to gain any political or party kndos in this matter. Let us deal with the figures as we find them.  If the Minister says that these figures are to be relied upon, let us judge them accordingly and, to some extent, be guided by them.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I started by saying that you cannot hedge in any country with a system of tariffs, duties and licences without raising the cost of living.  As this matter-was dealt with by other Deputies, I intend to deal with it on the same lines.  They dealt with the whole economic policy. If the Chair says I am not entitled to follow them, I will quit; but if somebody is allowed to ramble, the rule has been that someone else rambles after him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion deals with levies, duties and so forth.  Some figures that I read in the Statistical Abstract will prove this contention, that these levies and duties must, of necessity, be instrumental in raising the cost of living.  For instance, we have figures relating to customs. The extraordinary thing about Government policy is that while they claim to have established a large number of factories under a system of tariffs and protection, and while they have gone in for a policy of self-sufficiency, they maintain that they have succeeded in supplying many of the things that were previously imported. If that is true, is it not extraordinary that we had this situation last year, that despite the reduced amount of imports as against 1931&mdash;before Fianna Fáil came into power&mdash;over £2,000,000 more was collected in customs duties. The natural conclusion is that if certain things are imported over very high tariff walls they must carry the tariffs.  If they are still able to get into this country in competition with articles manufactured here, the conclusion is that the price of the home article is up to that of the others. Everyone knows that is true.  To that extent the people have to pay, not alone the excess price on the articles <Col N="877" /> that come in, but on every article they buy.  When the Government came into office there were 60 or 70 articles dutiable.  The number has been increased by hundreds.  There is not a single thing that one could think of, whether manufactured here or abroad, that is not carrying a tariff at present.  The only excuse for some things carrying tariffs is that they were tariffed for the purpose of giving an incentive to home manufactures. Have they done that?  To what extent have they done it?  If they have not, is it not time the Government took stock of the situation? The Government puts on high tariffs on certain articles that are imported, in order to give a chance to local industries to expand.  If the local industries, instead of expanding, simply put up prices, while imports continue to increase, is the Government to stand idly by?  That is what is happening to-day.</P>
      <P>Take the years 1936 and 1937.  The contribution the Government made towards agriculture is this, as far as tariffs are concerned: In 1936 the Government collected £8,000 odd in tariffs on agricultural machinery.  That is a bad way to help agriculture.  The year before they collected £6,000.  In my part of the country, Irish agricultural machinery is used almost exclusively, and what has been our experience?  That when certain tariffs went on foreign machinery we had to pay a higher price for the parts we required for the Irish-made machinery we are using.  That statement can be corroborated by the hardware merchants in the West of Ireland.  It appears, from the returns before me, that instead of the Irish manufacturers of agricultural machinery extending their business&mdash; taking off their coats and capturing the whole of the market&mdash;we have had a higher import of foreign machinery this year than we had last year.  At least, we have collected more, because the import duties this year amount to over £8,000, while last year the sum the Government collected was £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item which appears in the <Col N="878" /> customs list is agricultural implements &mdash;forks, scythes, spades and shovels. These are essentially agricultural implements.  The Government are entitled to put a tariff on the import of these articles, and thereby give somebody here the opportunity of manufacturing them.  At the same time, the agricultural community are entitled to some protection from the people who do manufacture them. When this tariff was put on, if our home manufacturers had extended their business, we would not have had to pay this year over £9,000 in import duties on the items I have mentioned as against £8,000 last year. It is a rather sorry state of affairs that a Government, which puts itself forward as a tillage Government, can make no better contribution towards helping the agricultural industry than to put a tariff on spades, shovels and forks, and after doing that not to insist that our own manufacturers engaged in that line of industry would manufacture the articles required in the country.  The sums that I have mentioned were collected off our farmers on the items mentioned, because, of course, in the end it all comes down to this, that the user must pay.</P>
    <P>If we relate those tariffs and import duties to the ability of the farmer to pay up to the price that he is getting for what he has to export, what do we find?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce definitely related the price that we are getting for our exports to our ability to meet the cost of living. I know that if a stranger coming into this country took up this list of customs duties and found amongst them items of the kind I have mentioned, and then turned to our export trade, which consists absolutely and entirely of live stock and live-stock products, he would come to the conclusion that the Government that was acting as our Government is, and that has at the same time this balance against the country, had not any interest in agriculture.  The result of all those tariffs, quotas and licences is this, that we have got the cost of living here pushed up and our people put into the position that they are not able to <Col N="879" /> buy because their returns from what they have to sell are not what they used to be, all due, of course, to the policy that is being pursued by the Government.  We have got an increase in taxation, an increase in the adverse balance against the country, everything in fact which tends to show that things are not in a healthy condition here.  Now if we are to be expected to meet high tariffs and duties, we must be put into such a position that we will be able to pay.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, our exports must be put into such a position that the standard of living here will go up: that our ability to pay will be based upon the income that we derive from our export trade.  At the present time can we look forward with any confidence to that?</P>
    <P>If we relate the things disclosed in the Statistical Abstract from which I have been quoting with what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said about the income that we derive from our exports, I think we will be forced to the conclusion that we are not travelling on the right road, and that there is not in this country a true regard for the capabilities of the people to pay.  If we are to be expected to meet the demands made on us by industry, we must be placed in a position to do so.  Are the Government endeavouring to do that?  The whole economic policy of the Government appears to be directed at the present time towards the development of the industrial arm.  That cannot succeed if agriculture, our main industry, is not prosperous.  If the Government go out for a tillage policy there is no use in their sitting down and waiting when that tillage policy is only returning what is disclosed in this book.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to tillage in this country?  That, notwithstanding the fact that we have had an increased acreage in wheat and beet since 1931&mdash;we have had an increased acreage of practically 300,000&mdash;the total increase, so far as tillage is concerned, was only 153,000 acres.  That is what this book discloses, so that, in the main, we have had two-thirds or three-fourths substitution.  Has that substitution been beneficial?  Does it <Col N="880" /> help, what the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke of, our export income, because he said that we must increase that if we are going to increase our standard of living.  There is no use in running away with the idea that 100 acres of land or 1,000 acres of land, subsidised, are going to give the same return as 100 acres or 1,000 acres not subsidised.  Now, as I said, we have had an increase of 153,000 acres in tillage; but the acreage which had to be subsidised amounted to 300,000 acres.  By whom?  By the same people that have to pay the tariffs.  There is nobody else to subsidise them.</P>
    <P>This whole book, from beginning to end, would lead the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any student who would sit down and study it, into the knowledge that we have been going on the wrong track, and that, no matter what happens to industry in this country, the one thing that must be maintained on a paying basis is agriculture.  We have here page after page showing us that, as far as live stock is concerned, as far as the value of anything is concerned, we are on the down grade&mdash;gradually on the down grade&mdash;and we have disclosed here in this book, in one page, an extraordinary figure with regard to bacon.  Bacon is one of the items that is carrying a levy at the present time, and it has been contended by Government supporters that, were it not for the fact that this levy is on bacon, the people would not get the price they are getting for their pigs.  It is extraordinary, however, that this volume does not bear this out, for this volume gives us much information that is valuable&mdash;very valuable information.</P>
    <P>For instance, on page 71 it shows us what our production of bacon was, say, in 1931 and in 1935&mdash;our total production. It gives what our imports of bacon were in 1931 and to-day&mdash;of course, they are practically nil to-day&mdash; and it gives our exports and the value of our production and of our exports and re-exports.  Those are very illuminating figures.  In the year 1931 our production amounted to 736,000 cwts. of bacon, and we imported 733,000 cwts.  In 1935, which is the last year given here, our production was <Col N="881" /> 1,114,110.  Now we come to our exports, and here is what is disclosed by these figures.  If you add our production of 1931 to our imports of 1931, you get the total amount of bacon that was then in this country.  If you do the same with regard to to-day, you get the total amount of bacon here to-day. Then you have the export figures, which you can subtract from the other figures, and they disclose an extraordinary situation.  They show you that for some cause&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;we are consuming in this country to-day 26 per cent. less bacon than we consumed in 1931.  Is not that extraordinary?  I wonder what accounts for it.  Has any member of the Government Party ever thought about this?  A tariff was put on foreign bacon with the object of keeping foreign bacon out, and the purpose of the tariff, naturally, was&mdash; to give everybody credit for the best intentions&mdash;to keep out foreign bacon and to fill the gap thus created by means of the Irish people feeding more pigs.  What has happened, however? Certainly that is not one of the things that happened.  We are feeding many less pigs to-day than we were feeding in 1931, 1929 or 1928.  What has happened? The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that we are exporting much more bacon now than at that time.  We are; but the extraordinary thing about it is that the people in this country are consuming 26 per cent. less bacon than they consumed at that time.  That is what the figures disclose. I wonder is it that the people in this country are not able to purchase bacon, or is it that they have switched on to lamb and chicken?  Have they lost their taste for bacon?  Whatever be the cause, I recommend the Fianna Fáil people to study that book which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he has placed in their hands, and see what they are going to get out of it.</P>
    <P>Now, if to-day we are eating 26 per cent. less bacon than in 1931, there must be something to account for it. Since we are dealing with the question of pigs at the moment, I want to show that the tariffs or the levy, as far as this is concerned, have not helped pig production.  I will give the House the <Col N="882" /> figures with regard to the number of pigs in the country.  In 1931 the total number of pigs in this country was 1,227,003; in 1936 the total number of pigs in the country was 1,016,512&mdash;a drop of over 200,000 pigs&mdash;and we have, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated, increased our exports of bacon.  Besides that, we have stopped from coming into this country over £400,000 worth of foreign bacon.  We have increased our exports of Irish bacon and we have less pigs.  How did it all happen?  I wonder is there any relation between that and the inability of the people to buy bacon, or what is the cause?  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is serious when he tells us that, if we want to increase our incomes and if we want to increase our standard of living, we will have to increase and get a better price for our exports&mdash;if he has any belief in the statement he made on this very motion before the House&mdash;I will refer him to page 27 of this book, which deals with exports of domestic produce and so on. In 1931, live animals accounted for £18,000,000 in exports, whereas in 1936 they accounted for £8,000,000.  That is very sad reading.  Our total exports in 1931&mdash;taking everything into account &mdash;amounted to £35,000,000, and our total exports in 1936 were £21,000,000.</P>
    <P>Here is what I am coming at.  Of the £35,000,000 worth exported in 1931, £27,000,000 was accounted for by live animals and foodstuffs of animal origin &mdash;in other words, agriculture.  In 1936, out of the £21,000,000 worth, £15,000,000 worth was accounted for by live animals and foodstuffs of animal origin. That is rather a sad commentary on the way in which agriculture has been treated in this country.  If that is any reflection of the state of affairs in this country, if it reflects properly what the Minister was endeavouring to tell this House when he spoke on this motion, that our standard of living will go up as our export trade goes up, it is very sad reading for the Minister.</P>
    <P>In addition to that we had at that time other factors which helped to swell the private exchequers of the people of this country.  We had other exports and we had re-exports.  People may think that imports into this country, even though some of them were reexported, <Col N="883" /> were not of any use to the country.  That is not so.  Any time there is trade doing, any time goods are coming into the country and going out again, even the same goods, there is something remaining; there are labour, employment, and wages; there are the carriers being paid; and, on the whole, it helps to keep matters going.</P>
    <P>In 1931, as far as re-exports are concerned, we had them to the extent of £1,177,000.  Last year they dropped to less than £500,000.  I find here that for home consumption we had white oats and black oats.  In the year 1931 we had white oats at 7/3 per cwt. and last year at 7/3 per cwt.  In 1931 we had black oats at 6/2 per cwt., and last year at 6/2.  Barley went up from 6/11 to 7/11.  First year's hay dropped from 69/- to 59/-.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I have been endeavouring to show, on the lines laid down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that our ability to pay and our incomes will depend entirely upon the price of agricultural produce.  It is obvious, of course, that agriculture, being the main industry of the country, must provide the wherewithal for purchases.  I maintain that when these duties, quotas, licences, levies, and other matters were put on certain articles they depressed the people in this country to such an extent that they are not now able to buy.  I think it is immaterial to a person in this country whether an article is too dear or not if he has not the money to buy it.  If we are going to have in this country a continuation of quota orders, and of tariffs, a collection of £10,000,000 from Customs, as we had this year, and of £8,000,000 from Excise, and this £10,000,000 in Customs collected on a very small amount that came into this country in comparison with what was coming in before, we must at least be provided with the ability to pay for them.  There is only one way in which they can be paid for&mdash;we must foster the main industry of the country; we must put it on lines on which it would pay.  The smallest child going to <Col N="884" /> school would have learned his lesson better with regard to these matters than some of the Fianna Fáil people have.</P>
      <P>Is it not obvious to any person that you cannot switch the main industry of the country into channels which do not pay without a subsidy, without levies, and without protection, without losing money on it?  Suppose this was a new country and that the 2,900,000 people in it to-day were brought into it and scattered over it, what would they turn their hands to?  Would any person say that they ought to turn their hands to items that have to be subsidised, provided there were other activities which do not need subsidisation?  I am a wheat grower and have always grown wheat for my own farm and for my own use.  But why do we think it necessary to have wheat in this country if we can make more money at something else? The only reason that we think we ought to have wheat is, apparently, that we, too, in this country have been bitten by the war bug.  We want to be like all the big countries and make some provision for war times.  Suppose we thought all along peace lines, if this was a new country, as I say, what would we engage in?  We would undoubtedly engage in that which would pay us best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be, of course, and there possibly always will be, a necessity for subsidising something that you cannot do without.  But, in the main, there is only one thing to do with the people of this country, and that is, mostly, let them alone.  Once you get Government control, once people get into a rut, you cannot get them out of it unless the Government shows them some way out of it.  They are always looking for something for nothing.  That kind of control which the Government has at the present time by way of levies to certain departments of the agricultural industry is leading the country into a rut.  I think the Minister for Agriculture knows that and that there is no person in the country who does not know that it is leading into a rut. What this country really wants is some person who will study the resources of the country so far as agriculture is concerned; some person or party who will regard the potentialities of this <Col N="885" /> country from that point of view, see what is the most that can be made out of it, and lose no opportunity of making it.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad commentary on the people who are at present managing the affairs of the country that while, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us, so much importance attaches to our exports and while a country like Australia in the last four years could increase her exports to the British market by £28,000,000, our exports diminished by £9,000,000. There ought to be some kind of stocktaking by Fianna Fáil.  There ought to be some kind of stocktaking by the Government at the present time. They ought to look back on the last four years and ought not to be afraid to take their courage into their hands even now.  They ought to take up these volumes and read them.  They ought to take up that very serious question of our adverse trade balance. That was dealt with very fully here the other night and I think a certain statement was made by my colleague, Deputy Dillon, in which he predicted a falling off in certain assets.  I am sorry to say his prediction has come true, according to the latest publication, so that there is every evidence, as far as our adverse trade balance and our ability to met it by invisible exports are concerned, that that ability has declined.  That is a very serious state of affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of Fianna Fáil is that the Party suffers from a kind of superiority complex in regard to patriotism.  I do not know why that should be but it is true.  Members of that Party think that no person can think honestly about this country, in patriotic terms, except themselves. When other people try to show them the dangers which surround this country, when we try to show them, for instance, that an export trade can be very beneficial, that it ought to be fostered and husbanded, they try to make out that because of that attitude we are un-Irish, that we are Anglicised and that we are Imperialists.  Mind, I do not care what you call me tomorrow, provided we have in this <Col N="886" /> country, as we undoubtedly have, the right to make our own laws and make them in our own way.  We have the right to add to our customs duties and nobody outside bothers about them. I would not mind what you called me to-morrow if I could do what Australia has done, if I could double my exports to the British market and if, by doubling them, I could increase the income of our people so that they would be in a position to buy the articles upon which we have imposed tariffs here.  I would not care what you called me after that.  You will have to get rid of that complex.  You will have to recognise that the people have got to live and that the only way they can live is by being put into a position to enable them to purchase the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>If we are going to be so surrounded by tariffs, by levies, duties and everything else in our pursuit of that programme of self-sufficiency, God forbid that we should ever attain it because, should we succeed, what would happen? If we ever attained to what appears to be the ideal of the Government, or at least the ideal of some members of that Party&mdash;it is not the ideal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; he has moved away from that&mdash;and if we ever came to the stage when we had acquired that self-sufficiency for this country, I tremble to think what the standard of living would be.  What do you think the standard of living would be if the agriculturists of this country had nobody to buy from them except our population of 3,000,000 odd?  Where do you think it would land them?  What would our purchasing power be?  This motion has possibly, as the Ceann Comhairle remarked, rambled somewhat far afield but that it is not a bit of harm if the Government will only take heed of the things that are being spoken of and of the things that have appeared in those Government publications. The Government must take stock of the situation, get their feet on the ground and realise that agriculture in this country must be made prosperous.  You cannot make the people on the land prosperous by diminishing live stock.  The only result <Col N="887" /> a diminution of live stock can have is to rob the land of its fertility. It is doing that already.  If you want a tillage policy of any kind for any purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You will be late then; the people will not be able to recover. Even with our adverse balance soaring, with our Government expenditure soaring and our ability to meet it diminishing, as all these publications show, there is yet time to think.  Now is the time to consider the situation. The Government must sit up and take stock of the result of their administration for the last five years, as far as our assets are concerned.  They must come to a halt with their present programme and take the advice of the people on this side of the House. To some extent, at least, they will have to mend their hand if the people are to be enabled to exist at all.</P>

      <P>I think I may quote the conditions which exist in the Beara Peninsula in the West Cork constituency, and I am sorry that <Col N="889" /> Deputy Murphy and Deputy O'Sullivan &mdash;the Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;are not in the House.  I do not want to use any argument here&mdash;I have never done so&mdash;which I am not prepared to stand over, but I say that there must be something wrong when the poor people in this particular area are in the position that, for amounts as low as 10/-, they have been driven to allowing the &ldquo;Flying Squad&rdquo; to come and seize their property.  On 9th August of this year I got a letter from a constituent of mine in which he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The bailiffs are still busy.  In fact they visited Reentrisk, the very poorest little fishing point in the Free State, yesterday.  In this particular place, there is no such thing as land, but just little patches of from 10 to 20 square yards between rocks, and from two to four cows each; no such thing as a horse or plough.  They lived on fishing at one time, but that is now gone as well. One of the unfortunates they visited is a poor woman with six young children, and her husband is in England.  Those parties I mentioned in my last letter who were visited before the election and got time until 8th July were again raided on 15th July.  They had to pay something on account and got a month for the balance.  Of course, if they can manage to square this they will be tapped again straight for the balance up to the present.  There are sheriffs' warrants in circulation for the last December gale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 18th October the same constituent wrote to me and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Excuse delay in supplying information re visits of bailiffs to the district, but as the district is wide it is difficult to get accurate information from all angles.  They are still busy; in fact, they pay a visit every week. They visited, as nearly as possible, 40 in the Allihies parish&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and I would say that this is one of the poorest parts of this country&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;30 in the Eyeries parish and 11 in Castletownbere.  The amounts vary from 12/- to £13, except in one case, that of William Harrington, Castletownbere, who owed over £80. <Col N="890" /> They came to three parties in my neighbourhood who are living on home assistance.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It shows the conditions to which those people have been reduced as a result of Government policy, and if the Ceann Comhairle wishes evidence of that fact he can refer to the Minister for Agriculture, who was taken down there within the last two months, according to the Press, to investigate conditions there.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will come into the House this evening and tell us of his experiences in that district. The letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Two of those have only one cow each, and the other has about two cows in a little barren holding.  They also visited a fellow who is living on the blind pension, and had the grass of one cow, but sold it over a year ago.  Another very outstanding case is that of a man who is in England himself; his wife is dead, and his five children&mdash;the eldest a cripple of 16 years&mdash;are at the mercy of the waves. The amount they owed was about 30/-.  Those visits started about the middle of June and still continue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I said, a Chinn Comhairle, I do not want to take any advantage of the Government, and as the Minister for Agriculture has been in the area I hope that before this motion is decided he will come into the House and give us his experiences of the conditions existing in the particular area.  If there is any doubt as to the conditions which exist in this country one has only to refer to the statement in this day's Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the President's Vote this year, after he had finished his reply, I put him a question.  I asked him if he had made any effort during his period of office to find out the number of young men and young women who had left this country to work in Great Britain. The President's reply was that it would <Col N="891" /> not be worth while; that he would have to go into every little village and townland in order to get the figures. To-day we have them from the British Government, and we can see that over 16,000 people have emigrated this year more than last year.  What is responsible for that?  Must there not be some cause for that emigration from this country?  There is no good in going back to 1930-31 because at that time emigration had practically ceased in this country.  The point about it is that the farmer's son and the farmer's daughter in this country to-day have no hope of getting suitable wages for their work.  As Deputy Brennan has pointed out, on every article that goes into the houses of those people and on every implement that they use there is a tax. Yesterday I was told that there was a tax as high as 40 per cent. on an agricultural machine which I myself required.  This year I had to pay in rates £35 more than I paid last year.</P>
    <P>I ask, then, is this not a question that should be gone into?  Is there not such a thing as the capacity of the people of this country to pay?  When taxation was under £20,000,000 in this country, I remember the Minister for Finance saying in this House that the country could not stand the burden of taxation.  To-day he is evidently convinced that the more he spends the more prosperous the people will become. Does anybody in this House consider that, by piling up debts, you are going to help prosperity?  Is it the wish of any father or mother to pile up a debt in their business and leave their children to pay it off or get out?  That is the kind of gerrymandering we have in this country to-day. There is evidently something wrong.  I have spoken on this matter over and over again, and I do not wish to take up the time of the House for long now, but I would again appeal to the President and the Government on this matter now that they have set up a Commission to investigate the question of their own allowances.  Two years ago anything over £1,000 was too much, but to-day they have helped themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We must consider what effect a levy or a tax will have upon the well-being of our people.  We must consider whether it is for good or ill that each burden is placed on the community.  It is true that there has been a marked improvement in the standard of living in this country for the past few years.  More money is in circulation, as a result of the tariff policy introduced by the Government, to purchase goods for the household, and, even though prices may have increased in the case of certain commodities, I hold that the increases for the most part have been justified by the increased wealth that has accrued to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition place no value on the higher standard of living.  They make no allowance for the extra employment given to our people.  Neither do they make allowance for the fact <Col N="893" /> that we are growing wholesome food, and that the health of our people has improved as a result of that wholesome food.</P>
    <P>When he was introducing this motion Deputy Morrissey spoke in very general terms.  He did not analyse any of the figures for us.  He spoke generally about the amount of tariffs collected at our ports.  There is one matter he did speak about to which I would like to refer.  He is reported in column 212 of the Official Debates as having said: &ldquo;...if the actual cash prices of boots and shoes in this country are being kept down, the quality is not being kept up.&rdquo;  There we have an admission that there has been no increase in the price of boots and shoes.</P>

      <P>It is implied, if not actually stated.  The Deputy said: &ldquo;If the actual cash prices of boots and shoes in this country are being kept down.&rdquo;  I do not speak for the boot and shoe industry of the Saorstát, but I do speak from my own knowledge, and I can inform Deputy Morrissey, and anyone who thinks with him, that the boot and shoe trade has improved wonderfully here since the advent of the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak for the shoe factory in my own county, in Kells. The shoes have come into my own household, so I can speak from my own knowledge.  I can say that the shoes there give longer wear and they are cheaper to purchase than what we formerly purchased from across the water.  I can speak from my own knowledge of the Mocassin Boot Company in Kilkenny, because I wear the shoe, and there again the boots and shoes are more durable, they have better material and are more comfortable than any that I got from across the water heretofore.  I can speak for Donaghy's and Woodington's shoe factories in the town of Drogheda, and I can say that the shoes produced there are a credit to any Irish factory, and the quality is kept up; not alone is the <Col N="894" /> quality equal to what we got heretofore, but if anything it is much better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes no mention of the better materials that are being used, the better wearing stuff, and the consequent economy to the household by purchasing these shoes which wear longer.  When proposing the motion Deputy Morrissey said: &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, the acid test of the value of any industry to this country is the improvement it will make in employment of this country, and, unfortunately, so far as we can see, there has been no improvement in that respect.&rdquo;  Of course, if Deputy Morrissey does not want to see, it is not in my power to make him see, but no matter where I look for figures I find there has been an improvement and a great improvement. If we turn to the report dealing with the production of the 23 industries, we find that between 1932 and 1935 the net output increased by £4,345,000; the wages increased by £1,707,000, and the persons employed increased by 23,185.  The report states that although production increased, the price of the goods increased by only 2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preliminary figures for 1936 are also available, and they show the same rapid progress.  They show an increase of 12 per cent. in the net output of the 23 industries, 9 per cent. increase in the persons engaged, and 11 per cent. in the wages paid.  I give an invitation to Deputy Morrissey to apply his acid test to the figures I have quoted.  Of course, if his political bias will not prevent him seeing the improvement that is there, perhaps when he next speaks upon a subject such as this he will own to the facts. Of course, the Deputy objected to anyone on this side saying that he was trying to sabotage Irish industries. But I do not know of any other name <Col N="895" /> or fancy name that we could use to describe accurately the attitude he has taken up with regard to Irish industry. Sabotage is the only name that fits in, and I believe that sabotage it is and sabotage it will remain.</P>
    <P>When we purchase foreign goods for our households, it stands to reason we are sending money out of the country and that we will have no money at home to purchase these goods.  By purchasing Irish goods we are keeping money at home, and consequently we have more money in circulation.  When speaking on this motion Deputy Dillon said that every other country was booming, or that it was right high on a wave of prosperity, and that this was particularly so in the case of Britain, with whom we have the closest contact, as he said.  Very well, here again we have a mere statement, but a statement that does not convey facts. The official returns for England, if we look at the Board of Trade returns, show that food is now 18½ per cent. dearer than it was in 1933.  Potatoes are up by 43 per cent.; tea by 21 per cent.; eggs by 20 per cent.; bacon 29 per cent., and bread 31 per cent.  There is a great boom of prosperity in England. Of course it has brought high prices in its trail.  But all is not so rosy in England as Deputy Dillon painted it.  We have soaring prices there, and according to a leading article in the <i>Daily Express</i> of yesterday's date we read that for every man in Britain now living on the soil, there is another man now living on the dole. We read the comment of the <i>Daily Express</i> on that.  That was written by an Englishman in an English paper for English readers.  Deputy Dillon will not say that that is not correct, yet that is what we are expected to join in with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now compare prices here in our own country.  With regard to prices, the most important item is food.  We have here a return given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a question published in the Dáil Debates on the 27th October.  We find that household flour <Col N="896" /> and baker's bread have increased in price.  I do not intend to discuss that matter, because it is quite obvious to everyone that an increase has taken place there.  The Minister has stated that it is his intention to investigate the matter.  The knowledge that he has taken it in hands is sufficient to induce me to say that the position in that particular matter will be improved. I am not denying that there has been an increase in the price of baker's bread.  But when we examine other figures we find very illuminating reading indeed.  We find that in Dublin there has been no increase from 1931 to 1937 in the price of tea.  There has been no increase in the price of sugar, hen eggs, beef or mutton. There has been a reduction in the price of milk, potatoes and creamery butter.  There has been an increase in the price of Irish streaky bacon and coals.  If we turn to the country areas and take the town of Drogheda, adjacent to which I live, we find that, while the price of household flour and of baker's bread has increased all over the country, in Drogheda there has been no increase in the price of coal from 1931 to 1937; no increase in the price of sugar, hen eggs, Irish bacon, beef or mutton.  There has been a reduction in the price of creamery butter, potatoes and fresh milk. Deputies who are interested in Tralee, at the other end of the country, will find there a reduction in the price of mutton, beef, creamery butter, fresh milk and coals.  These figures go to prove that many of the items which go to make up the family budget have not increased to the extent claimed by the Opposition.  Making a statement is one thing, but proving it is another. We have here before us statistics and they are accurate statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon told us that steps could be taken over-night to restore the national economy and bring down prices of foodstuffs and other household requisites.  He said there was a formula that would save our faces and save the faces on all sides if we would merely compromise with England.  It was on that he fought the general election and it was on that he brought back 48 Deputies here.  A settlement of the question with England would <Col N="897" /> not bring down the cost of living.  The cost of living is high in England, higher than it is here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of living has increased by a higher percentage during the past year in England than it has here.  That being so, we would if we compromised with England, if we believe Deputy Dillon, have a high figure for the cost of living in England, while for love of us here in this country, England would allow us a low figure for our cost of living.  It is nonsensical to argue that one figure could operate in England and another here if we were to compromise with England.  Of course, the restoration of our national policy does not mean the restoration of Empire policy nor Empire economy. Now, what do we find in the North of Ireland, where they enjoy all that is to be got from friendship with England, where they have the national economy of England?  We find statements made there during the past few days and reported in the <i>Daily Express</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not against the Deputy.  At present Belfast is building a 10,000 ton ship, and it happens at the same time that a 23,000 ton aircraft cruiser is being built there also.  On the cruiser £2,000,000 is being spent, and on the aircraft carrier the expenditure is £3,000,000.  More than 13,000 men are now steadily employed at shipbuilding work in Belfast.  So there the shipbuilding trade is in full blast, and 13,000 men have constant employment in shipbuilding.  Yet what do we find? We find when Parliament was being prorogued there last week, Mr. Henderson, an Independent member, stating that he did not want to create any dissension there, because that would not be for the benefit of the House, but he protested against the number of starving people who are left unprovided for, and he demanded from the acting Prime Minister a ray of hope for the unemployed people of Belfast.  He said there were thousands of young men <Col N="898" /> with no opportunity of finding employment. Mr. Beattie said that England was enjoying temporary prosperity due to the re-armament boom, but the Six Counties had not enjoyed any of that prosperity.  He added that they cannot certainly be called upon to take part in the depression when it comes as a reaction to the present boom.  To show that the Government was doing all that was possible, Mr. Andrews, the Acting Prime Minister, said the Government was spending money on relief schemes, grants to new industries, and everything that was possible for them to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One would imagine that we were the only nation in the world which was adopting this system of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on our foodstuffs.  There is hardly a nation in the world which is not, in some way, protecting the interests of its own people.  We are putting on these taxes, levies, and duties with a certain object&mdash;to foster the industrial and agricultural interests of our country.  Deputy Dillon told us that our industries were not contributing to the wealth of the people.  Is it not gratifying to find that the investing public do not share Deputy Dillon's views as to the prospects of our industries?  During the past few months we have had evidence of what the Irish investing public think of our new industries.  All these industries are being established with one object&mdash;that is, when they come into full production later, to keep down the cost of living.  The issues of capital made by certain companies during the <Col N="899" /> past few months have been subscribed seven or eight times over a few minutes after the opening of the lists.  That, in itself, proves that the Irish people believe in the future of our industries, because the investing public are not fools.  Of course, our industries must be protected by taxes and duties.  If we are to go ahead with our industrialisation, we must have that protection. In that, we are at one with other progressive countries at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Opposition say that we are proceeding too fast with our policy of industrialisation.  I suppose they believe we are going too fast to permit them even to hope that, at some time, they will be able to stand up and tell the Irish people that they will change the whole system.  The Irish people will not stand for a change of the system.  They know that the duties, taxes and levies imposed by the present Government are for the people's benefit and are imposed to help Irish industry.  Deputies spoke of the numbers who are going over to England.  They taunt us with the number of migrants going to that country.  We have to prepare for the day when these men and women will come back.</P>

      <P>We know that this wave of prosperity in England, which Deputy Dillon and other speakers have told us about, is transient.  We know that it is brought about not by any increase in the fundamental industries of England but by the re-armament race.  There is no better way to prepare for the return of these people than to produce our food and manufacture our own materials.  Heretofore, when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office, the people emigrated to America and did not come back. Many of them were lost in the slums of New York.  They had not the money to bring them back.  Those people who have crossed to England will come back, and it is up to us to prepare the way for them.  We are not going too fast with our policy of industrialisation and it is up to Deputies on the opposite side, instead of trying <Col N="900" /> to find little items they can throw up against our industries, to lend a hand in trying to meet the situation.  It would be better for them to throw their weight in behind the effort that is being made to industrialise the country.</P>
      <P>We should remember that our industries cannot reach their maximum output in a year.  Neither can they give maximum employment in that time. Perhaps, some of them will not be able to pay the maximum wage in that time.  It is our duty as Deputies, and it is the duty of the Government, to assist them in every way possible. The Government are to be commended for what they have done.  They have done a great deal for Irish industry and they will do a great deal more. They are only starting in regard to this matter.  We have not touched upon the raw materials of this country. There are much greater possibilities in the exploitation of our raw materials.  A great deal remains to be done and Deputies should be willing to assist in the doing of it.  If we were to take off these duties and taxes, what would happen?  We should have this country the dumping ground for the subsidised surpluses of all the countries of the world.  Are the people going to stand for that?  They are not.  Are the people going to stand for what the Opposition Party would bring upon us if the Dáil were to pass this motion?  They would bring about the ruin of our agricultural and industrial activities.  They would bring about desolation and starvation.  The people will not stand for that.  They gave their answer at the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to say much on this motion, because no attempt has been made on the part of the Government Party to answer the case which has been put forward from this side.  The Deputy who has sat down went over the same old, beaten track.  He told us about the good intentions of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Nobody denies that they meant the best when putting on these tariffs and other impositions.  I do <Col N="901" /> not grudge them the credit due for good intentions.  They are, however, beginning to find out that things are not working according to plan and that their hopes are not coming to fruition, as we all desired they would. Unfortunately, it was easy for people who had an understanding of economics to foresee the result.  These efforts could not be successful so long as the principal industry, which was able to stand on its own feet, was being crippled.  Not only was it able to stand on its own feet but it had to help to carry the others.  They are all in the same boat now.  We have no industry able to stand on its own feet at present.  Each is leaning against the other and all must sooner or later give way.  It is like a house of cards; some day it must come down.  It is all very well for Deputy Kelly to tell us about the improved standard of living and about the increase of employment.  If a test of that is wanted, it is to be found in the fact that people are running away from this high standard of living, that they are running away from this great employment and seeking work elsewhere which they did not do in the years preceding the change of Government.</P>
      <P>Before that time they had America, a great country, a country where there was extraordinary prosperity for some years previous to 1929, to fly to.  They have not that great country to fly to now, so they are flying&mdash;where?  They are flying to the country with which we are supposed to be carrying on a war, the country which we were told was unable to buy our produce and the country which we were told we had beaten to her knees in an economic war. They are flying there in their thousands at a rate which is increasing from month to month.  The figures must be abnormal because we who live near the Border know that there are more going across to Northern Ireland and Great Britain at present than there are going out of half the rest of the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also told us that he knew from his own knowledge the value that was to be got in buying shoes and other things in this country.  I, who live within a mile or two of the <Col N="902" /> Border, have some personal knowledge also.  I am every day in the week communicating with the Revenue Commissioners and asking them to consider the terrible circumstances of some unfortunate creature who has been captured smuggling second-hand clothing from Northern Ireland and smuggling second-hand shoes and other necessaries of life, which they are unable to buy in their own country, across the Border.  Will somebody on the Fianna Fáil side tell us why these people are taking such risks if they can get better value and cheaper prices here and if they are so prosperous that they can buy them here?</P>

Anybody near the Border knows conditions as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon went into the economic position and dealt with it very clearly.  He dealt with the imports and exports, both visible and invisible, and with the adverse trade balance in a very clear and exhaustive manner. He showed very clearly the indications of decreasing prosperity and the melting away of capital and wealth in this country.  He pointed to the adverse trade balance growing from year to year, and pointed out that the external assets of this country, which were something comparable to the bullion kept by the international banks of other countries, were melting away.  He furnished the figures and yet his facts have not been answered.  Deputy Moore got up immediately after and made an attempt to answer them. What was his answer?  He said: &ldquo;If that is so, how is it that nobody has come along to tell us until Deputy Dillon told us?&rdquo;  That is it; it does not do for an Irishman on this side to point out the facts, to open the map and let them see the facts.  Deputy Moore, who above all men on that side understood what Deputy Dillon was at, was the man who got up and asked why, <Col N="903" /> if that was so, did somebody from England or elsewhere, or the <i>Daily Express</i> as Deputy Kelly mentioned, not tell us before this?  If Deputy Moore would read <i>The Economist</i>, he would find it pointed out time and again and <i>The Economist</i> is a paper whose authority nobody on that side will question.  He could have seen it in <i>The Economist</i>, a British authority, and could also have heard it from people who were competent to speak on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spends a good deal of time in the Library, like Deputy Corry, but his purpose is to find something to prove that black is white and white is yellow and not to find facts.  Deputy Moore reminds me of the man who came up from the country and was brought by a friend to the Zoo.  He saw a giraffe and his friend said: &ldquo;Paddy, what do you think of that animal?&rdquo; and the man said: &ldquo;I think there is no such animal as that.  I do not believe it.&rdquo;  So it is with Deputy Moore.  The things were put plainly before his eyes and yet he did not believe them.  That is the attitude of a great many Fianna Fáil Deputies. They will not acknowledge the facts and will make no attempt to meet the position.  Deputy Moore went around the world instead of looking for facts in his own country.  He took an excursion over to Canada and gave us a statement of some gentleman from that or some other country with regard to the conditions in Canada and with regard to the weeds and pests that had got into Manitoba because of wheat growing.  If, instead of sitting in his armchair listening to the radio, the Deputy had gone to the farmers' meeting in Wicklow, to which he was invited, he would have got people who could tell him about similar conditions here and give him first hand information. That was the place to which he should have gone to hear something from the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also took an excursion over to France and he told us how they had to suspend the 40-hour week there because of soaring prices, claims for increased wages and strikes.  He told us of conditions in France exactly the same as we have in the Free <Col N="904" /> State.  We have a lower standard of living due to the increase in the price of our manufactured articles and the scarcity of money to meet it; and the fact that people are unable to buy the necessaries of life owing to the increase in prices is equivalent to a reduction in their wages.  Therefore, they strike for higher wages.  You have every class in the State looking for an increase in wages or salaries. What is the case they put up?  The case is that it is due to increased cost of living.  Who can deny that there is an increased cost of living? It is admitted, of course, by the Fianna Fáil members themselves that there is an increased cost of living, that there is a justification for such strikes and that there is a justification for claims by every section of the State, no matter of what class.  If we look even at the Front Bench opposite, we find that they are looking for an increase and setting a headline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir; I make only a passing reference to it. I am dealing with the general standard of living, and with the position of all classes in the State.  I do not want to refer to that any further. They are looking for an increase and they must get it, in some cases.  For instance, agricultural labourers must get an increase, because they could not live on their wages.  When the increase is given the position will be that those who are manufacturing under high tariffs, amounting to 75 per cent. or even 100 per cent., will have the right and the privilege to increase their prices, in order to compensate themselves and to meet the increased cost of production arising out of the higher wages.  That will increase prices, which will then go still higher.  There will be another strike for still higher wages to meet the increased cost of living, which really amounts to a reduction in wages, and so the vicious circle works and prices and costs keep chasing each other. As Deputy Moore pointed out, that <Col N="905" /> is what they were doing in France. The difference is that in France they have some statesmen of experience. France is an old country.  It built up its wealth and has been governing itself for hundreds of years.  Unfortunately, we have not had that experience. France with that experience, and with its statesmen, could see what was coming and rose to its responsibilities.  They saw that they made mistakes and that they must try to remedy them, as otherwise the franc would go down, just as our pound would go down if it was not pegged to the British pound.</P>

      <P>France had to turn to the United States of America and to England in order to get stability in the franc.  The French made some effort to change conditions that were bringing about the collapse of France and driving it downhill.  Deputy Moore by pointing to France and what happened there has strengthened the case for this motion.  The motion shows that we want to do something.  That is outlined in the motion.  It is the only thing that we see the Government is able to do with any hope of bringing about a change for the better.  We were told about the prosperity there is in England, and how that prosperity is due to the borrowing of £80,000,000 to be spent on rearmament.  Although we have not an army or a navy &mdash; only the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo;&mdash;are we not borrowing? On the ratio of 55 to 1, £80,000,000 to England represented less than £1,500,000 to us.  Are we not borrowing more than that every year, and spending it on various schemes, merely for the purpose of giving employment to our people?  We are spending more in proportion to our position than Great Britain, who is spending on her army and her navy in order to be prepared for a world war, if necessary. We have hardly any army and no navy, yet 80,000 people left the country, and we have a decreased population, discontent, and everyone complaining.  People are striking everywhere because conditions are unbearable, yet we are told from the <Col N="906" /> opposite benches about the prosperity that is here.  The thing is too ridiculous and too absurd.  The country cannot to bluffed much longer.  As the people are beginning to realise the truth, I do not think it is necessary to stress that aspect any further. There was no speech made on the opposite benches that did not strengthen the case for this motion.</P>
      <P>Last week I listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking for about an hour and a half, during which he raised the smoke screen of tariffs in order to conceal facts.  In spite of the smoke screen the facts came through for all who wanted to see the truth.  There is no use trying to conceal the truth, because it will find a way out somewhere.  I will quote what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, and if that does not prove what Deputy Morrissey and Deputies on this side set out to prove, I will sit down.  If they do not disprove what the Minister for Industry and Commerce wanted to prove, then I give it up.  The case made for the motion was that the standard of living had been lowered.  Speaking here on October 20th, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, according to the Official Debates, page 543, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A reduction in the price of commodities, particularly for a community like ours, one half of whom get their livelihood from the land, might mean a very serious diminution of the standard of living of those people employed in agriculture and the average standard of living for the whole country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could anything be plainer than that? A reduction in the price of agricultural produce will mean a very serious reduction in the standard of living of the people in the industry and a reduction in the standard of living of the whole community.  When trying to prove another point the Minister trusted to the shortness of the people's memory, as he stated in the same speech:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as food is concerned, I can say in respect of beef, mutton, milk, pork and potatoes that the national average retail prices now <Col N="907" /> prevailing are lower than they were in 1931.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have it proved out of the Minister's own mouth that the standard of living has been reduced.  He told us earlier in his speech that if they were reduced in price, it would mean a reduction in the standard of living of all engaged in agriculture and of the whole community.  The Minister tells us that prices have been reduced, and he boasted about it in that speech. Is there any need to say more?  I leave it at that.  He has proved our case.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to speak on this motion, because I do not believe that the Deputies opposite are serious.  If they were I must be suffering from some kind of mental aberration.  (Motion quoted).  If all taxes, levies, duties, impositions on foodstuffs, and other necessaries of life are to be reduced, I should like to hear the position explained by some of the Deputies on the opposite benches. I have not yet heard from them what that would mean.  If they mean to abolish all duties on the necessaries of life, will Deputy Morrissey tell us if it would be lowering the standard of living of the people if they were deprived of their &ldquo;half-one.&rdquo;  I take it that the duty on whiskey is to be abolished under this motion.</P>

If all these duties are abolished forthwith we would have a great country!  That is what this motion means.  I have not heard any other explanation. Many people would then consider that their standard of living would be reduced.  Yet the duty, the tax, or the levy on articles in which they are interested is to be abolished forthwith! I am sure you would get a lot of people to say that a drop of whiskey was a necessity of life for them, and if that were found to be so then you would get Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Linehan over on the other side to say that there should be no duty on <Col N="908" /> whiskey.  It all depends on what you consider to be a necessity of life.</P>

They are working full time as a result of that action taken by the present Government.  Is Deputy Linehan prepared to go back to the flour-mill workers at Clondulane and tell them that he is supporting a motion in this House the purpose of which is to nullify the action taken by this Government which led to the reopening of those two mills?  Those two mills, remember, which were closed down in 1931 owing to the action of the previous Government, have since been reopened by the action of this Government.  Is he prepared to go down to the flour-mill workers in Clondulane and tell them that he is supporting a motion in the Dáil the object of which is to withdraw the facilities which led to the reopening of the Clondulane and other flour mills in this country?  Is he prepared to go down to the flour-mill workers in Mallow and tell them that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are working overtime. They are working the full six days and over time.  With regard to the Clondulane flour mills, I remember seeing five different questions on the Order Paper by the late Deputy John Daly for East Cork, at the time they were closed down, making an appeal for their reopening.  Is Deputy Daly's son, who is now a member of the House, going to walk into the Lobby and vote for the closing down again of those flour mills which have been reopened by the action of this Government? Is he prepared to support this motion and vote in the Lobby for the removal of the levies, duties or other impositions that have enabled those flour mills to be reopened?  I hope to hear the Deputies opposite get up here and justify their action, and then go down to the workers in Mallow and Clondulane and tell them point blank that they walked into the Lobby to make them hungry men again.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite are well aware that flour cannot be imported into this country now except under licence.  If this motion were passed by the House it would mean the removal of the prohibition.  The authors of this motion did not know what they were doing when they drew it up.  I think it must have been drawn up some time after midnight.  I do not think that Deputy Morrissey knew what it meant until I told him.  I am surprised that people who talk about wasting money and wasting the time of this House would put down on the Order Paper such an idiotic motion.  All that I can say is: &ldquo;God give them sense.&rdquo;  There ought to be some house built for people such as we have on the opposite side.</P>

      <P>I can assure you that I am not the least annoyed.  I have given certain figures to the House and the figures were never contradicted.  I pointed out that the Irish farmer had got for his pigs in the year 1935&mdash; which was the nearest year I could come to at the time&mdash;over £2,000,000 more than in 1931.  Deputies can go down now to the Library and find out that for themselves.  I am amazed at Deputy McGovern's statement here to-night, and I suggest that if he would only spend one half-hour in the Library downstairs, and study his figures before <Col N="911" /> he comes up here, he would not come up here and speak at all on these matters, because he would be afraid to do so.</P>

That is why I appeal to Deputy McGovern and other Deputies on that side to go down there to the Library and study the figures.  I suggest to Deputy McGovern that, if he does so, he will come back a sadder and a wiser man. That, however, is the trouble with Deputies opposite.  They will not study anything.  They just come in here and &mdash;God help us!&mdash;well, there is no use in talking about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, what about the hens?  There were £10,000 worth of hens brought in here in 1931.  If Deputy McGovern will study his statistics in the Library he will find that out.  However, as I have said already, that is what is wrong with Deputies opposite.  They come along here and speak without having studied the problem about which they are speaking.  For instance, they want to remove the tariff or licence, or whatever it is, that is preventing the free importation of foreign maize, and they want the Irish farmer, who got 18/- for his barley the other day, to go back to the former conditions when there was that free importation and where, as a result, he could not get a decent price. They even want him to go back a step further and be in the position where he <Col N="912" /> could not sell his produce at all.  That is what they want.  That is what they are looking for.  They want to get back again to the position that obtained in 1931 and 1932, when every Deputy in this House, whether from my constituency or anywhere else, saw the unfortunate farmers with their carts lined up at Ballinacurra and other such places and where they were told that they could bring their produce back again because there was no market for it.</P>

      <P>Those are the matters Deputies are dealing with, and they are the materials that Deputies are drawing out here for us to consider&mdash; the lowering of the standard of living, and so on.  I wonder where the standard of living is lowered?  Evidently they are blaming the high cost of foodstuffs on the Government and saying it is due to Government action.  Some of it, probably, is due to Government action, but I had to give another object lesson to Deputies here a few weeks ago, when I pointed out to them that, when the foreign wheat was being imported here, at 30/- per barrel, there was a complaint because the price of flour here, made from that foreign wheat and home-grown wheat, was 51/6, and I had to point out to Deputies that the price of the 4-lb. loaf was 1/-.  I had to point out that, in 1926, which was the last time where I could find anything in that connection, the price of foreign wheat was 30/- and the price paid to the foreigner for flour was 62/6 a sack, and the price of the 4-lb. loaf then was 1/-.  Those are circumstances that no Deputy can get behind.  That was the time when you paid the foreigner £1,555,000 for flour, or rather £1,662,000, and that is why I say Deputies over there have no case whatever, because, according to the report of the commission which sat at that period and out of which I have read extracts for Deputies, if the baker in this country worked the same number of hours and gave the same return for his work as the baker, for instance, in Northern Ireland or England, the price would be reduced by a farthing per 4-lb. loaf.  That was one instance.  I gave another instance, when I pointed out that more was paid in this country to the mill workers than in England, and that, despite the fact that we were paying more to our mill workers than the mill workers <Col N="914" /> were being paid in Liverpool and other places in England, the fact remained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that in 1926, the last period in which the price of foreign wheat was 30/- a barrel, the foreigner imported flour at that time at 52/6.  You are getting it now at 51/6, I understand&mdash;that is, 1/- less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing what it is in England at the moment, but I can say this much at the moment: that if there is profiteering at the present day on the part of the flour millers, what kind of profiteering must there have been in 1926 on the part of the foreign flour millers?  And that was the period when the previous Government left the people of this country at the mercy of these people? There may be profiteering now, but what kind of profiteering must there have been then?  If the Irish mill worker is being paid more than 6/- a week over what the mill worker is paid in Liverpool, and if, despite that fact, there is the same basic price for wheat, then undoubtedly there must have been terrible profiteering at that time, and Deputies opposite who were the Government at that time were definitely responsible for allowing that profiteering to go on and for making no attempt to rectify it.  It only shows what would happen if Deputies succeeded in passing this motion and in wiping out the flour mills and putting us again at the mercy of the foreign flour millers. If foreign wheat came in at 30/- or 20/-, it did not matter what the price was, you would have to pay whatever the English millers liked to charge you for the flour.  These are facts no Deputy can contradict.  That was the condition of affairs for a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an arraignment from Deputy Dillon last week in connection with the woollen industry.  His complaint was that 600 Irish people were going to be paid for working in a mill at Tullamore instead of paying 600 English workers for preparing the yarn <Col N="915" /> for us.  Then, if we let that state of affairs continue, we will have Deputy McGovern telling us how the people were running to England for employment.</P>

      <P>Under that proposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce there are going to be 600 people employed here; that is 600 people off the dole and kept at home who, otherwise, would have to go abroad for employment.  Deputies cannot see that, or at least will not see that. Perhaps they think it would make better capital for them to be able to say that there are 600 more unemployed; that they would rather have that to use as political propaganda than have the people working.  To my mind that is the truth of the story. Deputies opposite have got to that frame of mind that they would prefer to be able to say, for political propaganda purposes, that there are so many unemployed here, rather than see an industry started here that would give employment to our own people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to make more of it.  The Deputy is not satisfied with the unemployment figures to-day.  The Deputy wants to drive the flour mill workers out to walk the streets where he had them in 1932. We know the kind of tariffs that were imposed at that time and the way they were worked up and down.  I had to give an instance here to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce on one occasion when he put a 25 per cent. tariff on waterproof clothing and a 50 per cent. on the cloth required for making that clothing, which was not made in this country at all, and let the unfortunate manufacturers pay <Col N="916" /> 50 per cent. on the cloth they brought in and, with a 25 per cent. tariff, enter into competition with the foreign manufacturers of the articles.  That is the kind of tariff that closed down the factories and which the Deputies evidently want again.  I do not know really what they want.  No sane man, reading the notice of motion, could know what they want.  They complain of the lower standard of living through the operation of taxes, levies, duties, and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life.  Foodstuffs are not the only necessaries of life.</P>

      <P>No, but we can visualise what some people would think they are. I should like to hear either Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Morrissey, who claim joint responsibility for this motion and put their names to it, tell us in plain simple language what they want before they discuss this motion further.  Let some of them get up and tell us what they want, what necessaries of life are to be included in this as being free of duty and taxes.  They should let us know if the brewing industry is to be free of taxes and if the distilling industry is to be free of taxes.  They should let us know if the duty on tobacco is to be wiped out.  They should let us know all these matters and then the Dáil will know what it has to face up to, and will know where it is going to get its revenue to run the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Deputy has done that he can go down the country and tell the people where he is going to get the £5,000,000 which he is going to pay England annually when he gets back; what particular revenue he is going to get that out of.  The Deputy can do all these things.  He can tell the national teachers where he is going to get the money to increase their salaries and the Civic Guards where he is going to get the money to increase their pay.  He can tell the people where he will get the money for the other motions fathered by various Deputies; where he will get the increased salaries arising out of <Col N="917" /> arbitration for the Civil Service, for instance.  He can tell them were he is going to get this money when all the duties have been wiped out.  I should like to hear this motion definitely and properly explained so that we may know where we are.  Anybody reading it would say that it was written at midnight by some man who was by no means sane.</P>

      <P>It is evident that the Deputy had not the least notion of what he was signing.  If he had he would not have done it.  If the Deputy had any notion of what he was signing his name to, he would not have signed it.  It is the most ridiculous motion ever brought before the House, and I am amazed that the Deputy, who thinks he is a responsible Deputy, should have signed his name to it.  I am sure that Deputy Morrissey, if anyone said he was not responsible, would get very sore, and still he signed his name to this.  What else do Deputies want to do?  The Deputies are now going to tell the farmers who are growing beet that they are to grow no more of it.  They are going to go a step further and tell the four beet factories established in this country that they can now close down.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is fond of red elephants.  That is the trouble. That is definitely contained in this motion, and these are the things I want Deputies to think over in their cooler moments.  Whoever was foolish enough to send such Deputies into this House, I am sure they did not send them here to vote for a motion of this kind.  One of the taxes, levies, duties and impositions which the Deputies want abolished is that which enables the farmers of this country to grow beet.  I am very glad to see Deputy Morrissey looking at the motion.  Apparently he never saw it before, although he signed his name to it. <Col N="918" /> That would be one of the results of this motion if it were passed.  I wonder would Deputy Morrissey call to Thurles on his way home and tell the workers in Thurles beet factory that he had put his name to a motion which would have the effect of closing down that factory?</P>

I put it to the Deputy that he should seriously consider whether he is going to carry on with the motion or whether he will have the courage to stand up and say that he will withdraw it, as any Deputy who has any sense of responsibility would. The Deputy apparently has no sense of responsibility.  A number of factories have been started as a result of these duties.</P>

They are going to tell the farmers of this country&mdash;which shows the Deputies' sense of responsibility again&mdash;that they are going to do now what they definitely promised the farmers of this country at the last general election that they would not do if they were elected.  They definitely promised that they would not interfere with the wheat schemes.</P>

      <P>I know they are. Columcille always promised.  The promises of Columcille are famous. That is the trouble.  At the last general election the Fine Gael Party <Col N="922" /> guaranteed to the farmers that they would not interfere with the wheat schemes if they were elected, and now even though they came in here in a very small majority they are endeavouring to interfere with the wheat scheme, because under this motion, if it is carried, they are abolishing the growing of wheat in this country.  In the first place, they will not have the mills to work the wheat.  The mills will be closed down.  That is the position of affairs under this motion.  In the second place, one of those taxes, levies, duties or impositions, whichever you like to call it, had to be imposed to enable the farmers to grow wheat in this country.  Still, Fine Gaels claim that they have some interest in Irish industry.  If anybody will look at one of the local industrial development associations they will see some one of their names blazoned in the forefront&mdash;the name of some individual who is going to walk around there into the Lobby in favour of closing the door of every Irish industry in this country.  That is what this motion means.  Is there any Deputy there who can show me how those industries are going to carry on and thrive if you apply the free trade principle which I have heard preached from those benches during the past six months?  I have already shown one instance&mdash;and I can give several others&mdash;of the position of affairs that would come about if, through any foolishness of the Dáil, this motion were carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies seriously to go through the list of the tariffs and duties and impositions, as they are called here, which have been imposed by the Government, and to trace each one of them to the particular industry to which it applies.  They will then say to themselves: &ldquo;If that is the position of affairs, am I prepared to withdraw that particular imposition and to close down that particular factory?&rdquo; Ask yourselves that; ask yourselves that seriously.  Let those over there who claim that they represent some few deluded farmers in this country seriously ask themselves: &ldquo;Am I prepared to go back to the farmers in my constituency and tell them, `Last week in the Dáil I voted <Col N="923" /> for the closing down of the beet factory, so you need not grow any more beet'.&rdquo;</P>

Some Deputies have no minds to take it. Deputy Brennan, speaking here this evening, complained of the £8,000 in tariffs on agricultural machinery.  That was one of his complaints.  When Deputy Brennan said that, he absolutely failed to realise what was behind the £8,000 tariff.  Does Deputy Brennan realise for one moment the number of industries that have been started in this country during the last few years, and the number of dying industries that have been revived during the last few years owing to this tariff on agricultural machinery?  Does he realise the expansion that has been given to Pierce's Engineering Works, Wexford?</P>
      <P>Does he realise all the shovel mills and spade factories that have cropped up and are giving an enormous amount of employment?  Deputy Brennan was also very eloquent on the bacon industry.  There is nobody in this House who can tell us more about the bacon industry than Deputy Gorey. I should like him to stand up here and give us a frank admission as to what the profits of his particular bacon factory were in last year and previous years.  Let him make a comparison between the position of that particular bacon factory in 1931 and to-day.  Let us have all the cats out of the bag.</P>

I have not gone through quarter of the ills and woes of the results to the country of this unfortunate motion which was brought in here in a moment of aberration or mental delusion.  I do not believe Deputy Morrissey ever signed that motion in a sane moment.  I have too good an opinion of the Deputy to believe that.  Let us get back again to the agricultural machinery and examine that end of it.  I should like to refer to the case of a young man in my constituency who was working for Messrs. Scott's in Cork&mdash;a good firm.  He had £4 10s. a week.  Out of his savings he had built a lovely bungalow in Blarney.  He was quite happy and content, and settled down; but he saw his opportunity and he had the courage of his convictions in regard to Irish industry.  He sold his bungalow, went to live in an old one-roomed house, bought an old mill in Templemichael, and started working it.  At the present moment that man is giving employment to 46 people in Templemichael owing to the operation of this tariff that Deputy Brennan has put his finger on and that he says will bring such disastrous results. Deputy Brennan wants to wipe out this industry and throw these 46 people on the dole, along with hundreds of others employed in spade and shovel factories all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies to realise the implications of this motion.  I regret that I am becoming hoarse trying to make Deputies realise its implications.  There is this proposal in regard to agricultural machinery.  I ask Deputies to study the employment given by Messrs. Pierce in Wexford in connection with this industry.  Study the employment given there in 1931 and the number employed to-day, and ask yourself if you are going to drive these people out of employment.  When you have worked out these things for yourselves I am sure that Deputy Morrissey, at least, will have the decency to come here and say: &ldquo;I put down that <Col N="925" /> motion in a moment of foolishness; I am sorry for doing so and I express my regret to the House and particularly to Deputy Corry&rdquo;&mdash;because the Deputy has caused me a lot of trouble to-night trying to explain the harm he would cause in his own constituency, and throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, through this motion.</P>

I am not going to carry on much further except to tell Deputy Morrissey that apparently he wants to see Russian oats coming into this country and our farmers wiped out.  That might suit Deputy Morrissey for business reasons, or for other reasons.  I suggest that the Irish farmer can grow oats good enough for Irish horses to feed on and can grow barley good enough for Irish animals to eat.  The Irish farmers can produce barley suitable for the preparation of any kind of drink that would be regarded as one of the necessities of life that Deputy Morrissey mentioned.  I will ask the Deputy to spend the rest of the night seriously thinking over his motion and its implications, and when he does I am sure he will be anxious to apologise.

He, at least, was serious in what he said, even if he did not add any great weight to <Col N="926" /> the debate.  He tried to controvert some statements made about the cost of living.  He said there was more money in circulation in the country, and, even though prices were increased, these increased prices were justified by the increase of wealth.  I am sorry the Deputy did not try to explain what he meant by that statement. It appears to me that the sole object of the two Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke was to get some modicum of praise from their local supporters. Deputy Kelly's speech seemed to be devoted altogether to boots and a factory in his constituency, and the sum total of the raiméis that we had from Deputy Corry was concerning some flour factory somewhere in his constituency. He treated this House to a tirade totally irrelevant, and there were at least fifty repetitions, because he always came back to the mill at Glendulane, or wherever it was.</P>
      <P>Neither of the Deputies got down to the essential portions of the motion, whether or not there is a reduced standard of living and whether or not there is an increase in the cost of living and, I might add, an increase in the cost of dying in this State.  To my mind both the cost of living and the cost of dying have gone up. Deputy Kelly told us that a general statement does not prove anything.  It does not, but if a statement is made general enough and gets sufficient repetition, it eventually proves something. I submit that if anyone here wants to be satisfied about the reduced standard of living of the people and the increased cost of the essentials, the necessities of life, he has only to go to the people who are in a position to give him definite information, and these people are the women in the households, the women of the poorer, the middle-class and the upper-class in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people will argue that there are not evidences of a lower standard of living in cities and towns.  Going through Dublin, passing a cinema and seeing the crowds waiting to go in and observing other evidences of apparent prosperity, one might be caught by an argument like that and might be inclined to think that there are no evidences of a decreased standard of <Col N="927" /> living in Dublin.  Because there is no apparent evidence of a lower standard of living in the streets of Dublin, it must not be taken that in Dublin there is not poverty and a reduced standard of living.  Everybody knows that there is.  But the real knowledge of what poverty means and ample evidence that the standard of living has been reduced in this country, are not going to be found in Dublin, in Limerick or Cork, because, although there are poor and needy and although people are suffering by reason of the reduced standard of living and the increased cost of the necessaries of life, they have some little consolation, some <i>quid pro quo.</i>  There are various aids for those people. There is the unemployment assistance, there is the home assistance, there are relief works of various kinds&mdash;Government relief works and corporation and county council works&mdash;in which these men secure employment.  I do not say that these aids are a sufficient substitute for the mode of living these people need.  But these things are some <i>quid pro quo.</i>  But in this State there are people who have none of these benefits.  These people, because of the increased cost of living, are suffering intense agony.  There are thousands of people in this country who a few years ago were in a fairly average middle-class state of prosperity but these are now reduced to a lower standard of living than any humble person in the City of Dublin.  These are people who never begged and will never look for relief or assistance from anybody, even if starving.  It is people like these who feel the real edge of the position to which this motion is drawing the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>If one wants to learn the real situation, let one go, not only to the small farmers' houses, but to the middle class farmers, and there ask the woman of the house whether she is not enduring a reduced standard of living. There one will find evidence all around of great distress.  Ask her if she and her husband and children are not suffering a reduced standard of living because of the increased cost of the necessaries of life.  One will be given the real answer, the almost universal answer there, as to what the agriculturists <Col N="928" /> in this State are suffering at present.  We have Deputy Corry getting up here this evening like an artist in a circus and treating this matter as if it were a good joke.  There is no Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who does not know what the situation is, and no Minister should be unaware of it.  However, I would particularly appeal to Deputies representing cities and towns, who perhaps do not know the real situation, to consider seriously the plight of these people.  There are farmers and their families, thousands of them, who do not have meat of any kind for weeks and weeks on end. There are farmers whose children, when they come home from school, are regaled on potatoes and milk.  Perhaps somebody will answer, &ldquo;It is good enough for them.&rdquo;  It is good enough for them if they are not prepared to stand and make some protest.</P>
    <P>The wives and mothers of the farmers in this country are in some cases driven to desperation and many of them to early graves because of the matters this motion deals with.  I know of widowers who, because of the economic state to which they have been reduced, have themselves to look after their little children ranging from nine years down to one year old.  I know of a case where the father has to wash the children and their clothes, and feed them.  I have actually seen the father of a family at nine o'clock at night, after his day's work in the fields, washing the children's clothes and doing the work that should be done for them by a woman.  This farmer had not the wherewithal to pay a woman for doing the work.  When these and thousands of other children of the farmers come home from school their meais consist of potatoes and milk.  These are not small farmers. They are fairly sized farmers, men on whom no slur as to neglect of their work could ever have been cast.  There are hundreds and thousands of families of agriculturists in this State who are suffering extreme privation because of the condition to which the country has been reduced.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that no Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party who has spoken here has had the decency to admit that <Col N="929" /> the standard of living has been reduced amongst the majority of the people of this State&mdash;the farmers and the agricultural workers.  No attempt has been made to refute the charge that the cost of living has gone up.  It needs little argument from any Deputy to prove that it has gone up.  The things that most concern the farmers and agricultural labourers are our exports. Unfortunately, the policy of the Government has been that we have a garden of our own out of which we should feed our own people; that we should keep all our own food for ourselves, that we should build up a tariff wall.</P>
    <P>Well, that tariff wall is now there for everybody to see.  At one time when the thought struck him at Christmas some Minister went round that garden wall, got up and said: &ldquo;You may bet I never forget the lips and kisses over the garden wall.&rdquo; Well, the last time he kissed there was the sign of coal on his face.  On the next time when there is a meeting over the tariff wall I hope the Minister will bring back something besides the coal agreement.  I hope something will be done that will bring some reduction in the matter of the cost of living which everybody knows has gone up.  However, this is one of the things that Fianna Fáil is attempting to deny.  I hope the Government will do something to make it possible for the people who are suffering so much because of the cost of living to again enjoy some of the comforts they enjoyed in other days.  These are the things that affect the people and the Government should be more concerned with the prosperity of all the people than with the success of one flour miller in Cork or one bootmaker somewhere else.  After all, the success of one flour miller or bootmaker or the success of one individual factory-owner does not affect the prosperity of the country so much.  What really matters is the well-being of the general body of the people, the farmers and the agricultural workers. They are the much more important part of the community.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal of talk about our exports but everybody knows that <Col N="930" /> all our exports have gone down, save one&mdash;our exports of human beings. That is the only export that has gone up so far as we can learn from the official statistics.  We export the best of our cattle and keep the worst for Roscrea or have them turned into sausages.  We are exporting the best and bravest of our young people, the young men and young women who have the courage to venture abroad to Britain to seek the living they cannot get here.  These boys and girls are going across to England to make a living.  These are the people we are exporting, while the older people, like myself, and the younger children who are not fit to emigrate are kept at home.  These are some of the results of the policy pursued by the Government. It is surely time that the people of this country began to think seriously about our economic policy and compel the Government to act on the lines proposed in this motion and thus to make some revision, some modification in the matter of the impossible burdens placed on the people by the increased cost of living. The standard of living of the bulk of the people, which in this country has sunk so low, can in this way be improved.</P>

      <P>I do not exactly follow the latter portion of the statement made by the Deputy who has just spoken.  I do not think that there is any reference in this motion to the specific tariffs which might be taken off.  So far as I understand, it is aimed entirely at removal of duties, levies and impositions with a view to raising the standard of living.  Deputy Brennan told us that it would be a good and healthy thing to take stock.  It is always a good thing to take stock.  We have taken stock and we take stock periodically.  The Government to whose Party the Deputy belonged were in office for ten years.  They tried out the free-trade system until the very last.  They would have remained on it still if the people were agreeable, but by the ordinary process, the people indicated that they were no longer agreeable to following a policy which left quite a number of people in County Meath and other counties living under <Col N="931" /> the shelter of iron sheds, living in such sheds along what is possibly the finest, if not the most beautiful, road in Europe.  These points were mentioned by me on many occasions.  Thank God, the people are no longer there and the tariffs, duties and levies referred to in this motion had something to do with that.  Some of that money was spent on the doing of these things.  During a period of ten years in which, as Deputy Bennett said, there were high exports, these people remained in misery and starvation.  Many of them never touched even a drop of milk except foreign milk, possibly in a dirty tin.  I do not want to be extreme in any way, but I want to do justice where justice should ordinarily be done.  I claim that we, as a Government, whatever we did, relieved the people who were in bondage and hardship for generations.</P>

      <P>Let us be honest about it.  This Party left no stone unturned to relieve that class.  Their standard of living has gone down, but that is not the fault of these levies and tariffs.  It is the fault of other conditions over which no Party in this House had any control.  These conditions will only be removed with the co-operation of every Party.  This is a grave and serious problem.  The statement made here is that we lowered the standard of living. What was the standard of living in the City of Dublin, as I knew it, six, seven, or eight years ago?  Were there any of those new houses then in Cabra, or Blackrock directions?  What was the condition of the slums?  Was any effort made to improve conditions in the slums except for one purpose&mdash;that is, to win an election?  Promises were made by Deputies opposite, on the <Col N="932" /> authority of the Government, that some thousands would be spent on these matters.</P>

      <P>They found work somehow, notwithstanding that Deputy Dillon has told us that domestic servants leave this country because they cannot get sufficiently fine material to wear.  According to Deputy Dillon, these prohibitions and tariffs prevent these girls from getting the beautiful, shimmering materials that are made in foreign countries, and they will not eventually be allowed to go to dances here because they wear tweed skirts and brogue shoes.  That may be the reason, but I do not think it is.  There is material enough here to be got if they want to go to dances, but it <Col N="934" /> indicates that he does not feel that their standard of living has been lowered.  It is very doubtful whether, with the exception of the class I have spoken of, the standard of living has been lowered in any class.  Figures and statistics have been quoted here. I have no great wish to quote statistics or figures&mdash;they are dry things; but undoubtedly there are quite a lot more motor cars on the road. Undoubtedly, the Minister for Finance gets more money through taxation on drink and more money from entertainments. There is hardly a doubt that there is more money invested in industry and otherwise.</P>
      <P>The standard of living of a large body of the farmers is not what it ought to be, and I am not going to deny that for one moment; but neither am I going to deny that the standard of living of farmers in any country is what it ought to be.  We read of the position of the British farmers, the Welsh farmers and the farmers in Scotland.  We see all the dilapidation which the new bounty has inflicted on some of them, because bounties they do get.  We read of one set of farmers who may be supporters of the present Government in Great Britain stating that they got £40,000,000 in subsidies, while on the other side of the House we hear it stated that they got only £8,000,000, but when that kind of talk goes on in that country, everything cannot be well there, either.  They have had to resort to taxes, subsidies and other methods, much the same as we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would not have been a word about this but for the one fact that there are many members on the opposite benches who regret very much and very sincerely that they did not adopt this policy when they had the opportunity.  There is a certain amount of jealousy in existence, but I submit that this thing ought to be examined in cold blood.  There should be no jealousies.  It should be examined in a cold, business-like way and stock should be taken in a proper way without heat or political propaganda, so that the country, and we, may know the facts of the situation. So far as the evidences appear at present, so far as any road one travels <Col N="935" /> or any country town one goes into&mdash; even the City of Dublin&mdash;is concerned, the indications point to an uprising of the nation and show quite clearly that the policy which was preached here for hundreds of years and which is now being put into practice is unquestionably a successful policy, and, notwithstanding the fact that there are some whose standards of living have fallen, the great majority, and especially those who needed a raised standard, have undoubtedly got a higher standard of living.</P>

      <P>As one who was a former member of this House and who has come back here again, I want to say that one always listens with respect to what Deputy O'Reilly has to say.  His addresses to this House have the merit at least of trying to do justice according to his lights in a serious manner to any of the problems to which he addresses himself.  His speech is a great improvement on some of the speeches we heard from the Government Benches.  We listened to one of those speeches to-night.  It reminded me more of the speech of an organ-grinder's assistant, if an organ-grinder's assistant could speak, than the address of a responsible individual, a representative of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked half a dozen times by different people to give my views about the cost of living, the standard of living, and as to how the bacon industry is affected, as it is known that perhaps I could give figures first-hand. It is true that the standard of living for some people engaged in business, the bacon industry and some of the other industries, has risen, not by 5 or 10 per cent., but by something like 500 per cent.; but if we go to the producer of the raw materials for bacon, what do we find?  Deputies claim here to have done a lot with regard to bacon with their tariffs and all the rest.  The Government in office now has done nothing for the bacon industry that was not done by the previous Government.  In 1931, before they went out of office, the last Government had an expert examination of the bacon position made, and before the report of that commission <Col N="936" /> reached this House a provisional prohibition on bacon coming into this country was sanctioned by this House, on the proposition of the late Minister for Agriculture.  This Government had nothing to do but to adopt the report of the committee and confirm an act performed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>If I were a business man, pure and simple, I should be spending hours every night praising and blessing this Government for what they have done for the few business people in this country; but, as a producer, I would be cursing them all the time.  What is the position with regard to the bacon industry?  Has the pig population increased since this Government came into power and put on impositions, and since the institution of the Bacon Board and the Pigs Marketing Board?</P>
    <P>The facts are that before these boards came into existence we were killing anything from 1,500 to 1,700 pigs a week.  What are we killing for the last 12 or 18 months?  From 700 to 800. We are killing half the pigs we used to kill before, and the same applies, I think, to nearly all the factories.  The quotas have gone down.  Why have they gone down?  Because of the ridiculous, idiotic imposition of this Government with regard to feeding stuffs.  They instituted an admixture scheme consisting of an admixture of certain Irish meals in pig feed.  On the one hand, it was too dear, and on the other, it did not give sufficient results to justify its existence.  The pig population has fallen by half because of that admixture scheme.  It has fallen because of two things&mdash;the price of the feeding stuff and the fact that the animals fed on it did not give a return for the food they got at the price that had to be paid for it.</P>
    <P>The pig population has fallen by half and our killings have fallen by half, but what about our balance sheet? There is no secret about it.  Our balance sheet has been produced every year in public for the ten years of our existence.  For the last seven or eight years we have been steadily making money.  We were making £1,500, £2,000 and £2,500 a year profit on the 1,500 or 1,600 pigs a week.  What is <Col N="937" /> our position on the 700 or 850 pigs a week?  Instead of making £2,000 profit, we are making £16,000 or £17,000, and if all the pig-curing concerns in Ireland were able to live when we were able to live, what are they making now with four times the quota we have got?  As I have said, if I were a business man, pure and simple, I would be blessing this Government every night.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware (1) that after an inspection of the Clonlisk drainage scheme following a sworn inquiry held in Roscrea in February, 1930, certain defects in the scheme were to be righted; (2) whether those defects were remedied; (3) if he will state the report of the engineers from his Department who inspected this scheme last summer; (4) if he is aware that the greater part of the lands in the area is still flooded no maintenance work having been carried out by the Offaly County Council since the taking over of the scheme by the council; and if in the circumstances, steps will be taken to formulate a remedial scheme free of further cost to the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>(1) The investigator who held the public inquiry in respect of the draft award for the Clonlisk drainage scheme reported that apart from the two minor matters of a maintenance character requiring attention the district was in a satisfactory condition. (2) The final award was issued in July, 1932, and so far the county council has not carried out any works of maintenance in the district.  (3) The district was inspected by an engineer from the Office of Public Works in July this year, in compliance with Section 26 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, and a report on its general condition was sent to the Offaly County Council on 25th September. The report discloses that lack of maintenance has resulted in considerable deterioration of the channels particularly in the more sluggish portions of <Col N="793" /> the district.  (4) I have no information as to whether the lands are flooded at the present time.  The necessary works of maintenance are the responsibility of the county council and their cost must be borne by the occupiers of the improved lands in the district. The assessment of these lands for repayment of portion of the capital charge leaves an ample margin for maintenance and it is not proposed to provide a grant for the purpose.</P>
