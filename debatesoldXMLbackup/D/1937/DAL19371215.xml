      <P>Applicants for unemployment assistance who reside over six miles from a local office of my Department are not required to attend at a local office, and proofs of title to unemployment assistance are taken by post.  Since September last, these applicants are paid at the post offices most convenient to their residences on any day of the calendar week following immediately the week in which payment became due.  Each applicant can select for himself the day that is most suitable to him to attend for payment. The payments are thus made at weekly intervals.  Having regard to the fact that for the convenience of these applicants all transactions are carried out by post, earlier payments cannot be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, perhaps, Deputy MacEoin will agree that my amendment No. 3 covers the first two amendments in the name of Deputy O'Higgins.  I told the Deputy when he raised the matter on the Second Reading that I would try to meet his point of view.  I think amendment No. 3 accepts the principle laid down in amendments Nos. 1 and 2, and does it in a more convenient way. After all, we do not want to clutter up the oath with all the regulations as to what a soldier may or may not do.  In amendment No. 3 I think the problem is dealt with in a better way, because it proposes to put into the Bill a prohibition against membership of those organisations with regard to members of the Forces or members of the Reserve, and I think that is as effective a method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that it may be as effective, but the point is that it would be in the oath which the officer or the soldier swore.  I admit the Minister's amendment is a prohibition, but we know that lots of things which are prohibited are sometimes done, and if an officer, noncommissioned officer or man swears a thing, it has more weight.  It will have more weight if he has sworn to abstain from membership of those organisations, that is, any political society or organisation whatsoever and any secret society whatsoever.  I think that to eliminate that is not good policy, because we have had enough of that matter at various stages, and we should try to keep clear of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were any necessity for it, it would be all right, but in the oath, as it stands in the Bill, every officer and soldier will swear to obey orders issued to him by a superior officer according to law.  We are making it portion of the law in regard to <Col N="2414" /> officers and soldiers that they may not belong to a political organisation, and in regard to both officers and soldiers of the Forces and the Reserve, that they may not belong to a secret organisation. I think that covers it.  If we were to put into the oath everything that was prohibited in regard to the Army, it would mean incorporating in it the whole book of regulations, and it would be a pretty lengthy document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the young officer or soldier has not gone through the whole Act when he is going into the Army, and he is not fully aware of its provisions.  It is only after he has gone through the lectures and so on, that he acquires a fair idea of what the law is.  By putting it into the oath he runs up against it the very first day; it is brought to his notice right away, the moment he puts on uniform.  While I admit that eventually the Minister's amendment might be just as effective, at the same time there is an advantage in having it brought to the notice of the young officer or soldier on his first day of entry; it is something that is stamped on his mind, something that he will be likely to remember.  Swearing that on a particular day makes an impression on the soldier or the young officer that is not otherwise obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would give the House some indication as to what is in his mind and what is intended by the term &ldquo;secret society&rdquo;? I have a good deal of sympathy with the idea of preventing soldiers and members of the Reserve from being members of secret societies, and if I had my way I would prevent all citizens from being members of secret societies.  The term seems to me to be a very vague one, and I should like to know what is meant by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean an oathbound society, any organisation which holds a secret meeting, or what does it mean?  I think the term &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; is not at all clear; I think it is a very vague expression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a term that has been incorporated in the law here for a great number of years.  The present oath contains the term &ldquo;secret society,&rdquo; and it is so plain, its connotation is so well known to everybody, that it was not thought necessary even to put it into the usual definitions that are contained in the front of every Act of Parliament.  It is not in the definitions as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not seem to be any definition.  It may be perfectly clear to the Minister, but it is not at all clear to me.  Apparently I cannot get a definition except by coming down to brass tacks, so to speak.  Are the Knights of Columbanus a secret society, or is the Freemason organisation a secret society?  Would it cover both of these?</P>

      <P>I do not know if it was intended to cover them by that exact expression, but they would be covered actually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when he found he was in a difficulty, defended himself by quoting the old oath.  That is perfectly legitimate, but at a previous stage of this Bill I pressed the Minister very hard to give us some reason or justification for departing from the terms of the old oath. In the oath that was previously taken by officers and soldiers each individual, whether an officer or a soldier, swore that he would not belong to a political organisation or to any secret society.  For some reason which the House has not been informed of so far, the Minister now considers that it is wise to depart from that form of oath and no longer to bind an officer or a soldier by oath to refrain from membership of a secret society or a political organisation.  We discussed that on the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amendment down here to reinclude those words in the oath. It is opposed by the Minister, but he <Col N="2416" /> sidesteps the point by putting a paragraph into the Bill prohibiting membership of such organisations.  That is not the same thing.  If the Minister argues it is the same thing, what is the objection to extracting that declaration from the individual? What is the objection to having it in the oath?  There is something very puzzling and very mysterious about all these antics with regard to this oath. The Minister, we must take it as a matter of policy, considers it inadvisable to ask for a declaration from officers and men that they will not belong to political organisations nor to secret societies.</P>
    <P>There is another omission from the old oath in regard to which I would be anxious to hear what defence the Minister has.  In the old oath the Parliament was referred to and the officer and the soldier swore obedience to Parliament.  At that time they held their commissions directly from the Executive Council, and the higher officers of the Army held their appointments directly from the Executive Council.  Now there is to be a change. The commissions will be held from the elected President, not from Parliament or the Executive Council.  The appointments of the higher officers, the Chief of Staff, etc., will be made by the President and not by the Parliament. In that set of circumstances the declaration which was previously taken, swearing obedience to the Parliament of the people, has been completely deleted from the present oath. There are three significant deletions: (1) direct recognition of Parliament by the declaration of the officer or soldier; (2) a direct declaration by the officer or soldier not to belong to a political organisation; and (3) not to belong to a secret society.</P>
    <P>Those are three very significant omissions from the old oath, and I want the Minister to advance some justification for those very significant omissions. It is not sufficient to get up with a nonsensical argument such as: &ldquo;Are you expected to put everything in an oath that you desire to prohibit or make illegal?&rdquo;  That is merely a chaffish argument and unworthy of the Ministerial Front Bench.  The old oath <Col N="2417" /> was there and it is the normal procedure of Governments to follow established precedents.  There must have been some very grave reason for deleting those words, a reason which weighed with the Minister and his advisers.  The reason may be quite a good reason, but I suggest the House is entitled to hear what it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with Deputy O'Higgins' point that in this oath there is no declaration of the recognition of Parliament by the soldier.  He says it is mysterious why that should be left out, and that it is very significant.  The Deputy referred to that on the Second Reading, and yet he did not think it necessary to put forward an amendment dealing with the matter.  It is perfectly clear to everybody that the Defence Forces Bill comes up each year, and if the Dáil did not pass it, the Army would cease to exist.  It is well known that it is from the Dáil the Army gets its funds.  It is known to everybody in the country, soldiers and recruits included, that the President, who is appointed Commander-in-Chief, is elected by the people, and he exercises whatever powers he has in accordance with the Constitution and on the advice of the Government.  I do not think that that point has any significance and, if it had any significance, the Deputy, having adverted to it on Second Reading, would, I think, have put an amendment down for to-day.  It is perfectly clear to everybody that, according to the Constitution, the Army is under the control of the Dáil. This Bill is being passed by the Dáil and will be amendable by future Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the question of leaving out of the oath reference to political organisations and to secret societies, I think that neither of these matters is of any great importance at present.  It is accepted in the Army that officers and soldiers will belong neither to one type of organisation nor to the other while serving in the Forces.  Reservists are aware that they must not belong to secret organisations. That is in the regulations.  The old oath was a fairly long one and, in most countries where an oath is taken <Col N="2418" />&mdash;in some countries no oath is taken by officers or soldiers&mdash;it is a very simple one.  The officer or soldier swears to obey orders and, in the case of a kingdom, that he will be loyal to the king.  In this new oath of ours, the officer or soldier will pledge his fealty to Ireland, his loyalty to the Constitution and obedience to orders issued to him according to law.  I do not think that anything more is required. If we were to put into the oath everything we thought it advisable to bring to the soldier's attention, we should have to put in a long list of offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of some oaths, they are put in.  If you go back through the various oaths taken by soldiers at different times in different countries, you will find that they dealt with some problem of the moment. We ourselves had a reference to secret and political organisations in our oath simply because these constituted a problem at the time the oath was framed.  They are, thank God, a problem no longer.  To meet Deputy O'Higgins' point, I brought forward the amendments on the Paper.  I think he will admit that my two amendments cover the point he had in mind except that the provision is to be inserted in the law rather than in the oath.  There are a great many crimes to which reference should be made if we wanted to call the special attention of the soldier to them.  In some oaths in the past in certain countries, crimes like running away from the enemy, treachery, or assisting the enemy were inserted. We have not thought it necessary here to put these into the oath.  We have been content with providing by law for punishment of these offences.  I think that there is a very good case for dropping this provision out of the oath and putting it into the law.  It will really have the same effect.  All we could do with the man who broke his oath would be to punish him.  We could not do that if we had not provided for it by law or by regulation. As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to have this provision so specifically <Col N="2419" /> set out in the Bill, as I am proposing to set it out to meet the Deputy's view.</P>

      <P>Compliments are rather rare here and I have no objection to the Minister taking a compliment to himself with regard to the case he has made for deletion of this reference from the old oath.  All I can say is that I am not convinced by the case he has made.  I doubt if many Deputies are convinced.  The Minister gave no explanation of the deletion of the words pledging obedience to Parliament nor did he defend that course. He merely pointed out that I had not moved an amendment to that effect. I am not Minister for Defence and his responsibility is not mine.  However, I can say without evasion that, if I were Minister for Defence and these words were staring me in the face in the existing oath, I should be very slow to remove them and to frame a new form of oath to be taken by officers and soldiers.  Little importance might be attached to these words if they had never appeared in the oath, but the deletion of words in an oath taken by officers and soldiers has a certain significance in the mind of everybody.  Even the simplest soldier will say: &ldquo;These words are gone. There is no reference to Parliament now.  Why is that?&rdquo;  What answer is he to get except that, for some reason higher up, it is considered unwise to link the mind of the soldier with obedience to Parliament?  It is merely a matter of three or four words extra and three or four words more are not going to make the oath any more cumbersome or unwieldy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unfortunate thing that the Minister thinks it well to delete such a reference from the oath.  It is unfortunate, too, that he will not see the desirability of relating the soldier's duty in a democratic country directly with the control of the people rather than with any individual in the State, no matter how appointed, whether by election or nomination.  In a democracy, the minds of soldiers and officers cannot be too intimately connected with Parliament.  It seems to be the Minister's deliberate intention to cut <Col N="2420" /> as big a channel as he can between the mind of the soldier and Parliament and between the appointment of the soldier and Parliament.  I can only say that I consider that unfortunate and unwise.  I do not at all agree with the Minister that because, in his opinion, the danger of political association or connection with secret societies is past, there is no further necessity for a declaration in the oath of non-membership.  It was there before and, if the danger is past at the moment, is the Minister not prepared to admit that that is because of the firm declaration in the oath for the last 15 or 16 years?  Does he think that we have reached a stage in Irish public life or in Irish military life at which we can afford to take chances and risks merely for the sake of deleting two or three words from an oath or merely for the sake of making a change in wording for which somebody else was responsible?  I consider it untimely and unwise.  If you are not confronted at the moment with the problem of political association, or membership of secret societies, is it not possible that before we are very much older, this Minister, or some other Minister, might be confronted with such a problem, and if the inclusion of a few words in an oath or a declaration will prevent that coming up in the future, I stand very strongly for the inclusion of such words.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister's amendment and the oath are inconsistent.  The oath to be taken reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I .......... do solemnly swear (or declare) that I will be faithful to Ireland ... and I will not join or be a member of or subscribe to any organisation without due permission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under that, he can get permission; but the Minister says, on the other hand, that by the new section which he proposes, he cannot be a member.  That is an inconsistency, surely.  I think that, to make the thing complete, you want both the Minister's amendment and Deputy O'Higgins's amendment.  I hold that the section is inconsistent with the Minister's amendment, and that if you do not put in both his and Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, you will not have consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in the least particular about the oath so far as Parliament is concerned, because I am perfectly satisfied that when the officers, noncommissioned officers and men take an oath of loyalty to the country, and to obey the officers set over them according to law, they will observe it.  I have not any doubt about that.  Parliament has the voting of the moneys which keep the Army there at all, and I think it has an effective and satisfactory control.  I am, however, annoyed by the fact that somebody can give permission to a soldier to be a member of a political organisation. Who is that somebody and why insert that in the oath unless it is for the purpose of drawing the soldier's attention to it?  I said earlier that the value of the oath was that it was planted immediately in the soldier's mind, but now you are planting in his mind the knowledge that he can be a member of a political organisation with due permission.  That is a very important matter, and I think the Minister would do well to explain to us who is the authority who will give the permission and does it override the section <Col N="2422" /> of the Bill further down?  I think that is the kernel of the situation.</P>

      <P>If the amendments which I propose here in Section 13 are adopted, it will not be lawful for anyone to give such permission and no soldier or officer will have permission to join or be a member of the organisations prohibited.  I think the Deputy's point with regard to the phrase &ldquo;without due permission&rdquo; is contained in clauses 6 and 11, and Section 13 prohibits anybody from giving permission to a soldier to be, or a soldier from being, a member of these organisations.</P>

I am not very much enamoured either of the Bill or of Deputy O'Higgins' amendment.  I am concerned more with having the ordinary soldier of the Regular forces, or of the Reserve, know what he is subscribing to, when he subscribes to an oath.  I asked the Minister for a definition of the term &ldquo;secret society.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Deputy O'Higgins' amendment and in the amendment by the Minister to Section 13.  There is no use in asking a soldier or a reservist to subscribe to an oath unless he knows what he is subscribing to.  I submit that the term &ldquo;secret society&rdquo; is very vague and the House at least should get some indication of what is in the Minister's mind when he proscribes secret <Col N="2423" /> societies for members of the Forces. The Defence forces in this country are divided into two main sections&mdash;the Regular force and the Reserve.  The Reserve, I take it, includes the Volunteers, and the volunteer also, I take it, is supposed to have all the rights of citizenship, without restriction.  The volunteer is a soldier while actually undergoing training, but at all other times, he has all the rights which any other citizen has, and I should like to know why members of the Volunteer force should be prevented from being members of an organisation which other citizens can belong to.  I could understand it if it referred to a secret illegal organisation.</P>
      <P>What does this term &ldquo;secret organisation&rdquo; mean?  Would the Masonic organisation or the Knights of Columbanus come within the term?  These are two fairly well-known organisations and some people call them secret societies.  I do not know what the Minister's definition of a secret society is, and I do not know further whether these two I have mentioned are secret societies or not, but I suggest there is no point in putting upon the member of the Reserve, a citizen force, a prohibition which is not put on every other member of society.  I further suggest that if you require the officers and men of either the Regular or the Reserve forces to make a certain declaration, or to take a certain oath, these men are entitled to know what they are subscribing to.  It is no use asking them to refrain from membership of a secret society if they, the Minister, or anybody else, do not know what a secret society is.  What is a secret society?  Does it mean an oath, bound society or merely an organisation which holds its meetings in secret?  I must confess that I do not know.  I do not belong to any of these organisations and I should prefer, as I said before, to see them all prescribed for everybody, because I think they are an unhealthy thing in the life of the community.  I should, however, like to know what bodies soldiers are prevented from being members of under this Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is confused <Col N="2424" /> about the whole position regarding the new clause.  I think the oath, at any rate, is in the simplest possible language, and that any person who has been able to get through the first book in a national school would be able to understand it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I ... do solemnly swear (or declare) that I will be faithful to Ireland and loyal to the Constitution, and that while I am a soldier in Oglaigh na h-Eireann I will obey all orders issued to me by my superior officers according to law, and I will not join or be a member of or subscribe to any organisation without due permission.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not like this amendment.  I think it is worded in a very clumsy fashion.  In my opinion the oath must be read into it, and be regarded as overriding it.  While the amendment purports to prohibit members of the Forces belonging to certain organisations, the provision in the oath will have to be read in conjunction with that.  On an earlier amendment, the Minister said that permission can be given to members of the Forces to belong to certain organisations, but that he is prescribing in the Act that they shall not be members of organisations of any kind.  It is clear that the provisions of the oath will override this amendment, leaving it to the Minister, or to somebody in the Army, to give permission to members of the Forces to belong to certain organisations prohibited by law.</P>

      <P>Are we not back again at Deputy Heron's argument on the question of secret societies?  In order to discuss what we have before us, should we not be told, first what a secret society is?  The Minister said that recruits to the Army will be educated and instructed in the rules and regulations: that from now on they will be instructed with regard to the provisions of this measure.  When this Bill becomes an Act the soldier will be told, I presume, that he is not to be a member of a secret society.  Will he be further instructed as to what secret societies are?  Would the Minister not think it well to inform the House now as to the instructions he proposes to give the recruits, and, further, what in fact secret societies are?  Otherwise, we are going to have <Col N="2429" /> a very ludicrous position.  Are we going to have the Froth Blowers' Association, the Three Pigs' Association, the O'Dearest Mattress Association construed as secret societies simply because the members do not tell their business to those outside their organisations?  I think that the Minister's definition of a secret society was that they kept their business to themselves.  Well, of course, you could extend that further and I think you will find that, under that definition, every limited company would be included, since they are all supposed to keep things to themselves.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider whether or not he should bring in a definition of the phrase &ldquo;secret society&rdquo;?  Are we to take it that it is to be as defined, let us say, by the Catholic Church, or what is it to be?

      <P>I strongly support the Minister, as I have supported other Ministers of this House in the past, in insisting that servants of the State should not be members of a secret society.  My Colleague, Deputy O'Brien, seems to think that the Executive Council, when they sit, are to a certain extent a secret society because they do their business in secret; but everybody can understand that the Executive Council, or the Government, of a country, have to keep certain matters that they discuss to themselves.  Now, is far as I am concerned in regard to this matter&mdash;I speak for myself&mdash;I do not acknowledge the right of anybody in this country except the Hierarchy to define what a secret society is.  If I understand the definition correctly, it means a body of people who are bound together by oath not to disclose the business they discuss.  I may be wrong in that, but if I am wrong, then let me be corrected.  The Minister has given a definition, but I am not sure <Col N="2430" /> from whom he got the advice as to that definition.  If his definition means a body or group of people gathered together and bound by oath not to disclose the matters they are discussing, then I am with the Minister in saying that members of the Army or members of the State service generally should not be allowed to join such bodies or such secret associations.</P>

      <P>In this connection, Sir, I should like to say that there is no use in burking facts.  There are two classes of secret societies.  There is the secret society with a political tinge and with political objects, and there is also the type of secret society the object of which is commercial advancement. Both of these kinds of societies have their representatives pretty active in this country here, as we all know.  I need not go into the names of the secret societies that are organised for political reasons or social reasons, but it must be remembered that there are also the secret societies formed for purposes of commercial advancement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, for which I ask a Second Reading, is the annual Bill carrying on the provisions of the Housing Act, 1932.  Each year, since 1932, we have had similar Bills making provision for the carrying out of the terms of that 1932 Act, and sometimes there have been amendments or changes, but usually of a not vitally important form.  This time there are some changes suggested that, I think, will be useful and helpful and that will, perhaps, enable us to make a little more rapid progress, particularly in regard to the question of slum clearance.  As to the details of the measure, I have some facts to put before the House.  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a further sum of £700,000 for the making of grants for the erection and reconstruction of houses by private persons and the erection of houses by public utility societies, bringing the total provision under this head since the 1932 Housing Act to £3,500,000.  Under the Act of 1932 we provided for this work £700,000.  This was increased to £1,400,000 by the Act of 1934, and under two Acts in 1936 the sum of <Col N="2432" /> £1,400,000 was increased to £2,800,000. That amount has been fully allocated and as the time for completing the work expires on 31st March next the Government have decided to provide for the fifth time a sum of £700,000 to enable the work of building and rebuilding to continue to 31st March, 1939.</P>
      <P>The amount of money allocated to private persons and public utility societies at 1st November, 1937 for the erection of houses in urban areas was £596,595 for the building of 11,481 houses and in rural areas £1,212,337 for the erection of 17,881 houses making a total of £1,808,932 for the building of 29,362 houses.  The amount allocated for the reconstruction of existing houses at the same date was £967,063 in respect of 25,086 houses. These figures represent a total of £2,775,995 in allocations in respect of the erection and reconstruction of 54,448 houses.</P>
      <P>The number of houses built under these grants at 1st November, 1937, was 19,954 of which 8,616 were erected in urban areas and 11,338 in rural areas. At the same date the total number of houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers was 12,780. The total number of new houses built and reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies up to November was 32,734 as compared with 19,694 on 1st June, 1936.  The amount paid by way of grants from the Act of 1932 to 1st November, 1937, was £1,893,390.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to continue the payment of grants at the existing rates up to 31st March, 1939 with the exception of the grant of £45 in respect of houses erected in urban areas. Houses erected in these areas up to the 31st March, 1938, which comply with the statutory conditions will be eligible for grants.  Section 3 of the Bill also makes provision for the payment of a grant in respect of houses in urban areas that are at present ineligible for grants because the houses were not completed by end of March 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside Dublin City and County there has been very little done by private persons and public utility <Col N="2433" /> societies for the erection of houses in urban areas.  When the first Housing Bill of 1936 was before the House on 19th February, 1936, I said that I was satisfied that in urban areas assistance could be withdrawn or, at any rate, considerably modified as regards the size of houses which should qualify for subsidy.  Subsequently it was decided to restrict the floor area of the houses in urban areas that would be eligible for grants to 800 square feet.  Up to then, a house up to 1,250 square feet in floor area was eligible for subsidy. It was hoped that the reduction in area would induce speculative builders to engage in the production of a house suitable to the requirements of the average working-class family and thus, to some extent, relieve the demand on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The change made in the law in 1936 has not materially altered the position. The bulk of the houses provided in urban areas are erected for sale. Very few are available for letting and in view of the growing demands on the Exchequer for slum clearance schemes it is felt that the time has come when the resources of the State must be reserved for this purpose and for the provision and improvement of the homes of small farmers and agricultural labourers in rural areas.</P>
    <P>A portion of the additional grant of £700,000 to be provided under this Bill will be available for the improvement of housing accommodation for the working classes in urban areas. Hitherto grants for reconstruction have been confined to the improvement of the dwellings of small farmers and agricultural labourers.  Representations have been made to me for extension of grants towards reconstruction of houses in urban areas.  In these areas there are many houses structurally sound but defective in sanitary accommodation which, if reconstructed on proper lines, could be made suitable as single dwellings or converted into two or three self-contained dwellings. The reconditioning of houses which are structurally sound in such a way as to bring them up to modern standards of comfort and sanitation <Col N="2434" /> will help towards a solution of the slum problem in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing Act of 1931 an urban authority is empowered to require the owner of a house which can be put into repair at a reasonable cost to carry out necessary improvements. Most of the urban authorities have failed to exercise such powers and there are many houses occupied by the working classes which, by reconditioning and abatement of overcrowding, could be converted into suitable habitations. In determining whether a house is fit for human habitation regard must be had to the extent, if any, to which by reason of disrepair or sanitary defect the house falls short of any by-laws in operation governing the general standard of housing accommodation for the working classes in such district.  Much has already been done in the removal of families from unfit houses in urban areas. From the passing of the Act of 1932 to the 31st March last 9,852 houses were ordered to be demolished.  These houses contained 12,071 families, comprising 53,398 persons.  The number of houses actually demolished was 6,122 which were inhabited by 7,853 families, comprising 36,535 persons.  The clearance of slum areas has been well advanced throughout the country with the exception of the county borough areas.</P>
    <P>The provision which is now being made for the reconstruction of houses should offer sufficient inducement to the owners to reconstruct them on modern lines and provide adequate sanitary accommodation.  A grant not exceeding £40 or one-quarter of the cost of reconstructing a house unfit for human habitation, which is otherwise suitable or capable of being made suitable will be met out of Stage funds.  In the county boroughs and the borough of Dun Laoghaire the State grant, will be conditional on a like contribution being made by the local authority concerned.  In other urban areas it will optional for the local authority to supplement the State contribution.  Power is being taken in the Bill to secure that the rent to be charged for a reconstructed dwelling will not be increased by reason of any <Col N="2435" /> expenditure from State or local funds.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that grants will be payable only in respect of houses that can be converted into suitable family dwellings.  It is also intended to confine the grant to houses situate outside places that will require to be cleared under the provisions of the Act of 1931.  In Dublin and other cities there are many houses on principal streets inhabited by the working classes the life of which, by proper reconditioning, can be extended for many years, and thus enable the local authority to confine its immediate operations to the clearance of the overcrowded and insanitary areas.  The present proposals are of an experimental nature and will be subject to review as soon as practical experience of the extent and utility of the operations can be measured.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the funding of arrears of rent in connection with the labourers' cottage purchase schemes framed under the Labourers Act, 1936.  When that Act was before the House it was suggested by several Deputies that arrears of rent might either be remitted altogether or funded.  On the Committee Stage I said I would consider the suggestion in so far as it concerned funding but, at that time, the case put forward did not seem to warrant the amendment. The cottage purchase schemes under the Act submitted by boards of health have been examined in conjunction with the returns of the rent collections, and I am satisfied that a removal of the restriction on sale imposed by Section 16 of the Act, 1936, is necessary to enable speedy provision to be made for the sale of cottages and to facilitate the collection of the arrears.  The method of funding the arrears is left to the board of health to decide according to circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this Bill is really a continuation measure making the necessary provision for the grants required to carry on the housing schemes.  The Minister gave us certain figures which showed the amount expended in grants, but I do not think he gave us what are the nation's commitments in the matter of housing.  For instance, in reply to a <Col N="2436" /> question the other day which Deputy Corish raised on the adjournment, the Minister made a statement which was quite true: that so far as the Government and the people were concerned it was the one people who were paying all the time, irrespective of whether the Government or the local authorities made the grants.  In order that we should get a true picture of the situation the Minister should have given us the figure of our entire commitments, including the grants which the Government have made for housing and the commitments with regard to payments on certain cottages.  We would then have at least a fuller picture to show us where we stood or what were our entire commitments in the matter.</P>
      <P>There are a few points in the Bill to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  A case was made here before, about 12 months ago or possibly prior to that, with regard to the valuation limit for reconstruction, and I think it was pointed out at that time to the Minister that very grave hardships were inflicted on certain people who happened to be just outside the valuation limit.  I entirely agreed with the Minister when he said on that occasion that there must be some figure fixed. That is true, but I think that, after all, the Minister has got over that difficulty in the matter of the major grants for new houses by fixing a graded scale of £80, £70, £60 and down to £45 for new houses.  In the case of reconstruction grants, however, we have an absolute limit, of £25 valuation, fixed.  That is an absolute line of demarcation and, in practice, it means that you have a man with a valuation of, say £24 15s. in fairly comfortable circumstances getting a reconstruction grant irrespective of his means, where as a man with a valuation of £25, who is in very poor circumstances, is not able to avail of that grant at all.  I should like if the Minister would take advantage of the introduction of this Bill to remedy that state of affairs.  The grants for reconstruction could be graded in the same way as the main grants have been graded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the Minister has altered the floor space from 750 to 800 feet, but I do not think that that will make any <Col N="2437" /> material difference.  The Minister pointed out, with regard to another matter, that he made an alteration the last time in the hope that it would bring about a change, but it did not.  I do not think this will make any change either.  What I should wish the Minister to do would be to eliminate this condition regarding floor space altogether, because personally I do not see that there is anything in it.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of what is happening. If a man wants to qualify for a grant for his house, he builds the house to conform to the specified floor space.  He then applies for the grant and, as soon as he gets it, he adds to the house.  I do not think that the Minister is at all escaping the payment of grants in the case of larger houses by this provision, whereas, if there were no fixed floor space mentioned, the man would in the first instance probably provide himself with a better type of house, a house that would not be so unsightly, possibly a house that would be more suitable and more of an asset to the country than the house which he has built to qualify for the grant eventually turns out to be.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to the question of finances, I have certain figures which are gleaned from replies given in this House from the Department of Local Government.  If they are correct, I think the total commitments of the nation towards houses amount to £6,500,000.  That includes grants and commitments for loans.  I should like if the Minister would say something about that because after all there is a limit to the nation's resources.  The Minister recognises that sooner or later we may, possibly, have to go a bit slow.  At least it would be no harm to know where we are.  It would be healthier to know exactly how we stood in many matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part III of the Bill, the Minister makes arrangements for the funding of arrears of labourers' cottages, but I do not know that the arrangement which the Minister suggests in that part of the Bill is going to be a satisfactory one.  I do not know exactly whether the Minister is satisfied, firstly, with these house-purchase schemes.  As far as I am personally concerned, I do not know that he is, because, although we have <Col N="2438" /> formulated a scheme, we have not got as far as the point where people would make offers to purchase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not.  Of course, I know that would hold it up, but I am afraid that the scheme which is drafted within the Act is not going to appeal to very many.  The funding arrangement seems to be a little bit mixed.  As the Minister pointed out, it appears that the board of health is going to have the right to fix the funding period, irrespective of anything else.  They have the sole and entire right to fix the funding period.  There is always a danger when you have two calls being met, like a rent call and a funding call.  I can visualise a situation like this arising.  For instance, the purchase scheme may extend over a certain number of years, say 30 years, and the funding annuity may extend over 15 years.  According to the Bill, such an arrangement can exist.  There is always, then, the danger that at the end of the 15 years nobody will take stock of the position, because under paragraph (f) of sub-section (3) of Section 9, it appears that the two will be to a certain extent consolidated. At least they will be paid together.  There is an obvious danger that once a labourer starts paying his annuity, which is part funding and part purchase, when the period of funding should come to an end, probably nobody will take notice of the position, and he will continue to pay on.  Mind you, that can happen.  I have known it to happen in another case. After all, if a man has to pay for 15 or 20 years, possibly he may die during that period, and his widow or son continues to pay after his death, and nobody knows when it should stop.  I do not think that is really satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention.  Matters are made very difficult for us here when we have to consider legislation by reference, which is the kind of thing we have here.  I have endeavoured to find out exactly where we stood in regard to certain sections and sub-sections that were being continued, repealed, and so on.  As a matter <Col N="2439" /> of fact, having had recourse to the authorities in the Library, I believe that if we pass the Bill as it is now printed, with certain enactments repealed, we shall not have done the job that we think we have done, because if my study of the Act, No. 19 of 1932, has been correct, there is no such thing as sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 5.  At least, that is not in the copy in the Library, and I presume it is not in the Act.  Of course, there is always the danger that an error of that kind can creep in, and I think the Minister should endeavour, for the sake of adding an extra word or two in the Bill, to make these matters clear, and let us have finished with legislation by reference.  It is very unsatisfactory to people who have to study Bills.  It is very unsatisfactory to everybody, and I do not know how people down the country, who take up an Act like this, would be able to follow it or know what it means.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister, when Acts like this are coming in in future, that he would at least go as far as he possibly can to clarify them, and not have us legislating by reference.  It certainly is not satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, the Minister has read us out a great many details about the building of houses, which I have no doubt are true, but I doubt if they give the position as we see it in certain districts in the light in which we think it ought to be shown up.  Quite frankly, my interest in this Bill is confined to the City of Dublin and the urban areas.  I wish the rest of the country well as regards housing, but I confess that I am looking at this Bill as it affects the City of Dublin and the urban areas.  The Minister has spoken about the need for houses.  We are all agreed on that.  He has read out a long list of houses that have been provided, and as I said I have no doubt that those are correct, but it does not follow that we are all satisfied with the progress which housing is making.  This housing problem is a very complicated one, and can be approached from several angles.  I do not want to make a speech about housing <Col N="2440" /> on this Bill, but at the same time it is very difficult to criticise this Bill without having reference to the other aspects of housing.  The Minister has mentioned that certain sections for the building of houses are being extended to April, 1939.  As I understand it, that applies to rural areas only, and when we come down to the areas in which I am interested we are only providing for them up to 1st April, 1938.  I do not suppose it is news to the Deputies of this House that there has been a very extensive strike in the building trade, which has stopped the production of houses, and that really this extension up to 1st April, 1938, for what is technically known as the 1,250 square feet houses is only an extension for houses that could not be completed up to 1st April, 1937.  It does not extend the 800 square feet houses at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing may be divided into various classes.  There are the wealthy people, who can look after themselves. They can either get the house that they want, or have one built to suit their requirements.  There are the very poor, who can do nothing, for themselves. They require to have houses provided for them.  Between those two classes of the community there is a very large section, some of whom can purchase houses without any assistance; others of whom can purchase houses with slight assistance, and others who require more extensive assistance.  I do not know whether or not Deputies in this House will agree with me, but I hold that as far as Dublin and district are concerned practically any house which is put up helps to solve the housing of the working classes.  I will give my reasons for stating that: houses in Dublin which have been vacated by the wealthier classes of the population have been moved into by the humbler section of the community, and those houses are serving a very useful temporary purpose, namely, they are housing the working classes.  Although they are not by any means ideal suited for that purpose, and I do not consider that that is an ideal solution, at the same time it is a very effective temporary one.  I suppose the Minister will not deny for a moment that if <Col N="2441" /> some thousands of fairly good-sized houses were provided for the working classes, that would immediately ease the situation.  When I say houses for the working classes, I do not mean houses which are specially built for them; I mean houses which would be adapted for letting as tenement houses. In my opinion that would help, as a temporary substitute, just as much as the building of working-class dwellings. I am not for a moment suggesting that the housing of the working classes should not be gone on with as quickly and as extensively as possible, and I think the corporation are doing that to the best of their ability.  If we do not all see 100 per cent. eye to eye with them, at least we can appreciate the problem they are up against and sympathise with the efforts they are making.</P>
    <P>To return to the population, I think the population of Dublin has increased by about 60,000 in recent years, and the population of the whole country has fallen by 100,000, so it would appear that the urban and rural districts have been denuded to the extent of 100,000, and Dublin has had to provide for an extra 60,000 over and above the ordinary inhabitants. That has helped to increase the problem.  Looking at this Bill, I am sorry to say that I really do not see any help by the State for the provision of middle-class and working-class houses after 1st April, 1938.  Building is one of those things which cannot be undertaken in a day.  A builder has usually been engaged in building all his life.  He has got a staff of tradesmen and labourers specialised in the various jobs that he wants done.  He is under the necessity of planning his work probably for a couple of years ahead.  He has to take over an estate, let us say, and he has to put down roads on that estate.  He has to start building houses and he finds, possibly, that the type of house that is wanted is slowly changing.  How far has the Minister helped him?  The Minister has helped for the next three months.  The builder is told that if he started a house before the 1st of January, 1937, he has until the 1st of April, 1938, to <Col N="2442" /> complete it, and that is only for the 1,250 square feet type of house.</P>
    <P>The Minister has glossed over the fact that he has done away with the £45 grant for this type of house.  He says nothing about the remission of rates.  He has done away with the remission of rates also.  I am charging the Minister with having done away with the rates remission for seven years.  That is not extended There is a provision under which the five years' remission goes on to the 31st October, 1938.  That only serves to show the haphazard, piecemeal way the legislation for the provision of houses is proceeding.  Some day we will have to make up our minds what classes of the community we are prepared to help.  We all know that the working classes require houses provided for them, but between them and the people whom nobody would think of helping to build a house is a huge number of people who are looking for houses.  I appeal to the Minister to try to make the building of this type of house a whole-time job, and not to leave the builder in the position that he has taken over an estate and he does not know whether he ought to put it up for auction or not.  He has got no indication as to whether the £45 grant is going to be extended after the 1st April, 1938.</P>
    <P>Everything is increased in price and, if there was an argument for a £45 grant in the past, there is an equally strong argument for a still greater grant in the future.  The same remark applies to the remission of rates.  That is a cruel imposition to put on a person shifting into a newly-built house.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the housing of the whole of the community as interrelated, as inter-locked.  There are people classed as working-class people who can buy this type of house.  They are qualified for a corporation house and if you get them to embark on another house you have eased the strain for the very poorest section of the community.  There is another aspect of this that is rather illuminating, so far as the position in Dublin is concerned.  I think the Minister said that 900 houses had been <Col N="2443" /> condemned over a period and 600 of them had been demolished.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the reason why these two figures do not balance, why there are 3,000 houses not yet demolished, is that they have got nowhere to put the tenants into.  There are lots of houses which are unfit for human habitation, and the corporation know that perfectly well.  I am not blaming the corporation, because they can say: &ldquo;Sure, we have nowhere else to put them.&rdquo;  As regards the City of Dublin, at the present time, at least so far as one section of the community is concerned, it is probably falling faster than it is being rebuilt.  That is why I want to plead with the Minister to consider the housing problem as a whole.  I suggest that there is one way of helping to solve the housing problem in the centre of the city.  There are a whole lot of houses and they are like the garments that we wear.  When our garments get too shabby to appear in before other Deputies, they are usually given away to some deserving person and they serve another turn in a lower walk of life.  Houses are just the same.  When they have served their purpose as houses for the upper classes, they come down to the lower classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not, but certainly they serve a useful purpose like the clothes and they form an effective gap, and if the supply of this type of house could be increased it would help to solve the problem.  That is why I am urging that every house that the Minister can get put up, even for the middle classes, will help to ease the difficulty.  The point is that you will have helped certain people out of houses in these areas and these houses will find their own level at a time when there is such an urgent demand for accommodation.  I would like to ask the Minister what satisfaction he can feel in having extended the <Col N="2444" /> scope for finishing the 1,250 square feet house up to 1st April next.  Surely the building trade are entitled to have a two or three years' programme put forward?  We hear a lot about the corporation, that they are endeavouring to keep ahead by surveying sites, etc.  I give them the greatest credit for that, but I would also remind the Minister that if the people could get any encouragement at all, if even the existing facilities are not taken from them, that a great deal more progress could be made in solving the housing problem.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the position of a person engaged in the building trade who sees that he is allowed to 1st April next to finish a house he started before last January. What encouragement does that give the industry?  The building trade would like to know what the Government's proposals are.  Do the Government consider that this class of house should be done away with?  It would seem as if the Minister is going the right way about it.  Does he consider that this class of house should not be built?  If the Minister thinks there are not enough materials and enough tradesmen to build the houses wanted for the working classes, I should like him to say so, although I would not agree with him.  Let him be frank with the House, but what is the reason for bringing in a Bill which, apart from the section which I believe is being gone on with by the corporation as fast as possible, leaves the other sections which are interlocked in an absolutely hopeless position, so far as their future is concerned?  I should like the Minister to give us ample time for puting in amendments, because if the Minister cannot see any future for the industry, I think the industry ought to be invited to show what proposals they can put forward.  It is absurd to say that in respect of one of our major problems in this city the contribution is to be that the industry does not know where it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with a great deal of what Deputy Dockrell has said and, like him, I see a lot of difficulties in this matter.  It seems to me that this Bill deals with a problem upon <Col N="2445" /> which there might be a fairly substantial measure of agreement amongst all Parties.  I think everybody recognises that the housing problem, particularly in the urban area and in places like Dublin City, is the major social problem confronting the country to-day, and that, in those circumstances, the whole question of housing, and the State's contribution to the problem, is one that should be tackled in a very big way, in consultation with all the parties concerned and as a uniform problem.  I agree with Deputy Dockrell that any contribution to housing helps, in the long run, to solve the desperate problem of the slums, and I think everybody recognises that a very substantial contribution to the problem of housing has been made, for instance, by public utility societies, and that any work that can be done by such organisations, as an assistance to what is being done by the local authorities, should get every possible encouragement.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of a highly technical character, and I do not know whether Deputies have been satisfied by what the Minister said, in introducing it, as to what is involved in it.  I personally, am not quite satisfied and it is fairly obvious from the summaries of the Bill that appeared in the Dublin newspapers that the Dublin newspapers did not know what the Bill was all about. I think there is a very strong case for having, in the case of Bills of a technical character, affecting matters in which the whole community is vitally interested, and in which every Deputy is, or ought to be, vitally interested, an explanatory memorandum issued by a person who would legally interpret the Bill and make plain, not only to Deputies, but to the community generally, what is involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell, in a passing way, referred to the question of remission of rates.  That is a very important aspect of this matter.  If public utility societies are to go on with their planned work of providing more houses, and if the classes of people for whom those houses are built are to be in a position to avail of them, it is extremely important that they should know whether it is intended that the provisions of the 1932 Act providing <Col N="2446" /> for a remission of rates, should remain in force.  I should like the Minister to say definitely, whether it is intended that the remissions of rates hitherto given to the class of houses built by public utility societies should continue. From the provisions of the Bill, I think that the same terms in regard to rates remission will not be given.  Would the Minister say if that is correct&mdash;that, as from April next, purchasers of the type of houses built by public utility societies, which are dealt with in this Bill, will no longer receive the same terms in the matter of rates remission?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>But at the present moment, there is a seven years' remission allowed.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this matter, and to recognise that if these bodies, other than public authorities, are to be encouraged to make their contribution to the housing problem, and if the stratum of the working classes which can afford to purchase houses from bodies other than public authorities are to be encouraged, it is a definitely retrogade step that the provisions in respect of remission of rates should be made less favourable for these people than they now are.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect and to amend this Bill in such a way as to ensure that the future position in regard to remission of rates will be not less favourable to the purchasers of these houses than they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those interested in the problem of housing from the point of view of the rural dweller, and I must confess that I do not think the Minister has been overgenerous in the amount of grants he has given to those who wish to erect houses, having regard to the large increase in costings which has taken place.  If these classes of people, who are, perhaps, as deserving as any of the rest, are to continue contributing to the health services by the erection of proper houses, the Minister ought seriously to consider increasing that grant.  I was here in 1932, and I heard <Col N="2447" /> the Minister pay a tribute to his predecessors in respect of what they had done for housing, in view of the very high building costs then prevailing.  At that time there was a £75 grant for a five-roomed house, and a £60 grant for a four-roomed house, and a £45 grant for a three-roomed house.  While we do not ask the Minister to go back to anything like that, encouragement must be given in view of the very high building costs which at present prevail in every direction, and which largely tend to discourage those who contemplate erecting houses.</P>
      <P>There is a scheme, the non-municipal scheme of housing, in which we are very deeply interested, on the board of which I have the honour to be a member, the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  It is a scheme which has largely succeeded in rectifying the disabilities of dwellers in country villages, and as soon as a scheme which is being sent up to the Minister receives his sanction, we propose to press forward that side of it as hard as we can.  Attendant on that scheme, however, is the necessity for clearing the very insanitary houses in country villages occupied by those who now will benefit by the operation of the non-municipal scheme of housing. Building costs are undoubtedly placing us at a disadvantage, but, at the same time, the necessity for providing proper sanitary houses for those who are living in insanitary houses is a matter of such urgency that we have to face them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem that is of vital importance, and which the Minister, perhaps, has not taken into consideration, is that of the reconstruction of the houses of small farmers.  The small farmers are not in very affluent circumstances at present, and the Minister has seriously retarded the reconstruction of their dwellings by the imposition of a restriction on valuation.  In some parts of the country there may be a very small acreage of land to support a family, but the poor law valuation may be high, while elsewhere the position might be different.  Take the case of a farmer in West Cork with a valuation of £25 or even £15.  In other parts of the country the acreage might be substantially <Col N="2448" /> greater because of difference in valuation.  If the Minister could make that part of his scheme more elastic and enable men who are seriously embarrassed financially to avail of the benefits of the reconstruction scheme, he would be doing a work for which they would have reason to be grateful, and he would be helping to relieve the insanitary conditions in which many poor and small farmers exist at the present time.  An old thatched house with a mud floor and mud walls is not conducive to good health.  These people are as much entitled to the Minister's consideration as any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to labourers' cottages, the problem is a very big one.  Numbers of labourers are emigrating, and whether we are overdoing housing work or not keeping up with housing needs is a debatable problem, having regard to the population of the rural areas.  One thing I am anxious to see carried out is the sale of labourers' cottages to the tenants.  Some people contend that it is not to the advantage of these tenants to buy their houses, but I rather think that it adds to a man's independence to own his house.  While the scheme of cottage purchase does not err on the side of generosity, the problem of the very large arrears of rent, particularly in County Cork and in the southern area, presents a difficulty.  I cannot imagine a man who owes as much as £30 rent on his cottage benefiting very largely by the funding of these arrears.  It is questionable whether the boards of health will be in a position to devise any scheme which will enable them to fund the arrears which have become excessive.  At present, we have labourers who are not able to pay even the ordinary 1/- a week.  Two cottage rent collectors were suspended by the South Cork Board and, when a proposal was made to reinstate them, they refused to go back.  They said they could not see their way to accept or occupy a position in which they could only collect arrears or deal with the existing situation by eviction.  The Minister is up against a problem as regards the funding of the arrears and up against a problem even in regard to <Col N="2449" /> new houses, and I do not envy him his task.</P>
    <P>The question of the remission of rates on new houses was alluded to by Deputy Dockrell.  There is no doubt that that will be a serious blow to those who are anxious to encourage building.  I happen to be secretary of a small public utility society and I confess that it would be a serious blow if, in addition to the increased building costs, the advantage of the remission of rates over a certain period were not to be continued.  I appeal to the Minister seriously to consider altering his intentions, as expressed in the Bill, with regard to the remission of rates. That was an attraction and it helped building.  I am sure the Minister is sufficiently enthusiastic to desire that building should continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to a few small points in connection with this Bill.  I agree with Deputy Brennan and Deputy Brasier as regards the limitation of valuation for the purpose of reconstruction grants.  If the Minister considers that matter, I think he will realise that it would confer a great benefit on a great number of people, who are not very well off from the financial point of view, if he were to issue reconstruction grants on a sliding scale without regard to valuation&mdash;somewhat on the same system as the grants for new building.  The position at the moment is, as Deputy Brennan pointed out, that a man with a valuation of £24 17s. will get a reconstruction grant, whereas a man with a valuation of £25 will not.  A person applying for a grant to build a new house will get from £80 to £45 on a sliding scale according to his valuation.  If the Minister would look into that point, he would I think, be satisfied that there is a strong case for applying a sliding scale to reconstruction grants, and that there is a strong case for payment of reconstruction grants to people whose valuations are slightly more than £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to direct attention is that of floor space.  There is one serious objection <Col N="2450" /> to the houses built throughout the country since this building grant was inaugurated.  I admit that, from the point of view of utility, they are very good houses but I am afraid we shall have throughout the country a series of farmhouses of exactly the same type&mdash;and that not a very beautiful type.  I am afraid that that limitation of floor space will result in having farmhouses of exactly the same type dotted all over the country.  The same remarks apply to houses in other areas.  We have houses of the bungalow type&mdash;all exactly the same &mdash;springing up throughout the country.  There is no doubt that the limitation of floor space has something to do with that.  There is no great value in the limitation of floor space. If it were wiped out altogether or if the limitation were not so great, we should have greater variety of style instead of having the same type of farmhouse and the same type of bungalow everywhere.  Anybody who travels throughout the rural areas will agree that 99 per cent. of the farmhouses built with the aid of grants are of exactly the same type.  While they are very good houses, the type is not very attractive.  They are of a square type and, while the windows are of good size, in practically every case the roofs come down on top of the windows.  One explanation of that which I got was that the limitation of floor space did not allow for any great expansion in the plans.  The houses are all being built to the same plan and, owing to this regimentation, we are getting exactly the same type of house everywhere.</P>
    <P>Another point which I ask the Minister to consider is with regard to the small towns which are non-urban towns.  To my mind, a lot has been done in the urban towns to relieve congestion but, in the non-urban towns, congestion and slum difficulties are I suggest as bad as they are in the urban towns, though of course on a relatively smaller scale.  I suggest to the Minister that every possible means should be used, either by persuasion or by pressure, to induce local authorities to get on with the work in smaller towns which are non-urban, <Col N="2451" /> and to carry out housing schemes in them.  Everyone will agree that in towns with populations of 1,000 to 1,500 the problem of slums and congestion is proportionately as bad as it is in larger places.  I suggest that the Minister should use a certain amount of pressure on local authorities to have that work started, so as to relieve congestion and to provide decent houses for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this question before, the Minister very kindly undertook to reconsider the question of increasing the valuation for the purpose of re-construction grants, but I regret to say that I do not see any sign of the promise being fulfilled in this Bill.  A very small increase would be of great benefit in the midlands and in the west.  For re-construction purposes the grant should be increased.  Up to £30 valuation would be a reasonable figure and would meet a very grave need.  As to building grants for new houses, I think the increased grant of £70 or £80 should go on the system of valuations we had, that is on valuations of £45 and £25.  It will be found that farmers who are in very poor circumstances have holdings with very high valuations.  These valuations are on land that was considered suitable for forestry and what but that is no longer suitable for such purposes.  For some reason not easy to explain the land is no longer of the quality required.  People would then think that land valued at £1 to £1 10s. per acre would be good land.  In many places in the midlands and in the west the valuations are out of all proportion to the present value of land. People in poor farms with high valuations are unable to build houses with grants of £45.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that question and also the position with regard to floor space, when a house is reconstructed.  I know that the present provision is a statutory one, but the Minister might make regulations dealing with the measurements.  It is very hard, because of the present regulations, that a man cannot get a grant because the floor space is 45 feet or so over, yet <Col N="2452" /> his valuation is under £25.  Probably some predecessor built an old ramshackle house and left nothing to maintain it.  There is no means of reconstructing it except by pulling half of it down, and then it will not be a house at all.  I urge the Minister to increase the floor space for the purpose of reconstruction grants, and not to confine such grants to houses that have not such a floor space.  Where a reasonable case is made I would go so far as to leave the Minister discretion, so that grants could be given for the reconstruction of houses with larger floor space than is allowed by statute.  In the case of a large family it would be a good thing to allow the reconstruction of such houses to take place.  That is important where the valuation is under £25, because some of these houses are eyesores in most districts.  In some cases it is impossible to devise any plan to bring such houses within the statutory limit.  I do not know if the Minister is prepared to consider these suggestions, but I urge him to deal with the questions of reconstruction and floor space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases where grants have been due for some time, with the result that delay has occurred in the reconstruction and building of houses.  Poor men have been encouraged by these grants to undertake work that they were not otherwise able to do.  They were encouraged also by building societies or did so on their own credit, but when the time to get the certificates arrived the merchants who supplied the materials were pressing for their money.  They wanted it to carry on their business.  When it was not there these merchants and the borrowers found themselves in a very awkward position.  If the Minister would pay attention to the position of people in such circumstances, and expedite payment of the grants, it would be very beneficial in many ways.  It would enable the merchants who had given credit originally to give further credit to other people.  I agree with what other Deputies said, that a hard and fast limit of £25 should not be adhered to, and that the time has arrived when there should be a change.  While I <Col N="2453" /> agree with Deputy Dillon's suggestion that there should be a sliding scale, I do not agree with the scale suggested. The method should be to increase the floor space in houses rather than to reduce it so as to get a larger type of house.  That would help to meet the other objection that was raised against having houses of a uniform type.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should consider the points put before him by various Deputies, all of whom are anxious to help him on the housing question. This is a very useful form of work.  I believe the time has come when some modification should be made, by way of having more uniformity in the houses and making extensions in some cases.  It is hardly fair to confine grants to those with £24 valuation.  A man with a valuation of £24 10s. should be entitled to a grant of £80 for building a new house.  The man with a valuation of £25 10s. is not entitled to anything.  These are points which the Minister would be well advised to take into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill I want to bring some points to the notice of the Minister, but not from a technical point of view.  Facilities for building are usually granted to building societies and, in many instances, they are in excess of those granted to individuals. I think it is high time that something was done about those societies&mdash;so-called building societies &mdash;that an inquiry was directed into their activities.  In a good many instances we all know that those utility societies are generally a combination of persons got together simply for the purpose of obtaining increased grants from the Government. In other instances they are simply a building contractor with a few nominees.  They constitute a society for the purpose of obtaining grants from the Government in excess of the grants to which they would be entitled as individuals.  As I have said, I think the time has come when the Minister and his Department should do something as regards inquiring into the activities of those gentlemen. The control that is exercised over these societies is of a very limited character.  It is mainly concerned with <Col N="2454" /> the question of registration, and that work comes under the control of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice. Under sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the Act of 1932, it is provided that trade union rates of wages are to be paid by those who get Government grants.  Everybody knows that that provision in the Act has been flouted, not only by builders but by the Minister and his Department, although on many occasions absolutely clear cases were brought to the notice of the Department of the evasion of that provision in the Act by building contractors. A number of men went so far as to bring the matter into court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Minister should introduce some provision into this Bill which would tighten up the giving of grants and that would ensure that trade union rates of wages are paid by those availing of grants.  Perhaps the Minister might also consider the introduction of an amendment to this Bill which would enable aggrieved men to institute civil proceedings in the courts for the recovery of the rates of wages laid down in the 1932 Act which they should have been paid.  There is another point.  It is this: that there are certain types of labourers who do not come under the definition of &ldquo;labourer,&rdquo; such as auxiliary postmen and others.  I suggest to the Minister that he should extend the definition so as to include postmen and people of that class.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in this Bill by which people, who allow their houses to get into such a state of disrepair that they are condemned by the sanitary authorities, can obtain grants for their repair either from the local authority or from the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that rather a dangerous provision?  Is it not an encouragement to people to allow their houses to get into a state of disrepair <Col N="2455" /> in order that they may be able to get grants both from the local public health authority and the Department?  In my opinion it is a dangerous provision, and one that should be seriously considered by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I now want to say a few words on the Bill from the point of view of the labourers.  In 1936, I think, when a Labourers Bill was going through the Dáil, the Minister was pressed by the Opposition, and particularly by the Labour Deputies, to insert in it a provision similar to that which we find in this Bill, namely, one for the funding of arrears of rent due by tenants.  It was pointed out to the Minister at the time that, if such a provision was not inserted in the 1936 Bill, the measure would be absolutely useless so far as the labourers of the country were concerned, and might as well not be passed.  The Minister rose in a state of righteous indignation and accused the Labour Party of advocating a policy of financial heresy.  But, in this measure, the Minister is swallowing the words that he used on that occasion. He has become converted to the policy of financial heresy that he denounced the Labour Party for advocating, and so we find the provision that they sought to have inserted in the 1936 Bill in the measure before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not, however, another reason for that particular provision in this Housing Bill?  Is it not there because the Labour Party, in its endeavour to be constructive, introduced into the Dáil some months ago a Bill which also includes a provision similar to this, but going a little further?  When they did that, what happened?  The Minister and his colleagues went down through the country and told the people that the Labour Party had gone a little &ldquo;madder&rdquo; than usual, and that the only solution for this country was another general election&mdash;to have the Labour Party isolated either on Lambay Island or Ireland's Eye.  Further, in order to give the Minister time to bring in this legislation, we had other Ministers getting up during Private Members' time and speaking &mdash;some of them for a period of two <Col N="2456" /> hours and five minutes&mdash;thereby holding the fort until the Minister for Local Government was enabled to bring in this Bill.  It is quite evident that Part III of this Bill is a very poor attempt, on the part of the Minister, to cover up his shortcomings. In it he is simply emulating the lead given him by the Labour Party, and I want to emphasise that When I say that, I am reminded of an attempt that was made a few days ago by the Government to gull this House and the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, when replying, give some information as to the views of his Department on the quality of the houses built with assistance from the State, either in the way of grants or by local authorities; and, further, some information, if not to-day then on a later stage of the Bill, in reply to the question put by Deputy Brennan?  The Deputy asked what the whole cost of the scheme would be to the State; what the annual cost is estimated to be for the <Col N="2457" /> present year and next year.  The Minister, I think, said that he did not propose to continue the grant of £45 after the 1st of April of next year.  If my recollection of his statement is correct, he said that costs had increased and that the programme for dealing with the slums would require the entire resources that were available in order to deal with that problem. Now, perhaps the Minister, with his Department, would consider the main purport of Deputy Dockrell's speech here this evening: and that is that any person who has built a house in recent years contributes in some measure or another towards the relief of that problem; and when you have a municipality such as Dublin, unable to do anything for the working classes with families under, say, six or seven, it is obvious that that problem is going to remain unsolved for some years.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House whether it is that the activities of those who are engaged in the construction of houses, which were qualifying for a £45 grant, should be devoted towards the construction of houses which are required by the municipality, or whether it is a combination of the two.  From my experience of this question of housing generally, however, I should say that unless other activities than that of the municipality are brought into play, the municipality will be forced, and the State itself will be forced, to contribute towards the housing of a very considerable number of people who, themselves, would be able to pay a higher proportion than that of those who, normally, would look to a corporation or a local authority to provide for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two questions&mdash;the question of speed and the question of costs.  On the question of costs, perhaps the Minister would look into the matter of the various impositions that have been placed upon building materials during the past few years.  It may be that it is part of the industrial policy of the Government to put on those tariffs, but surely, in the case of an article like cement, which we are not yet manufacturing in this country and which enters so largely into the construction of houses for all classes <Col N="2458" /> of people, it is scarcely fair that something like £100,000 should be collected in impositions of one sort or another on that particular commodity.  In the case of the other articles which are subject to impositions and which have increased their cost, it would be, perhaps, the Minister's duty to look into the matter and see whether or not there has been any response on the part of those who are providing the materials in this country.  If they are of equal price and equal value, or anything approaching it, we would not object to pay a little more, perhaps, but when one sees the cost of building rising as it has been rising during the last few years, it is perfectly legitimate to examine all and every one of the causes that are in question.  Deputy Dockrell drew attention to the fact that one of those series of grants is to stop on the 1st April next.  Perhaps the Minister would take this into account that if, having given careful consideration to that problem, the grants that would be allowed for those houses could be scaled down so that the grant that is at present, say, £45, could be let run for 12 months at £40, then down to £30, then to £20 and so on, and if he considers that it is not necessary now to have any of that class of houses provided, would he consider the question of the provision of houses by builders&mdash;houses which they might undertake to supply in order to enable the housing to be undertaken of people who would normally go into corporation houses.  Perhaps the Minister might consider giving assistance in that direction, because it would seem that it would be assisting the State and the local authorities, and at the same time it would be providing housing for a very large number of people as well as providing employment.  If in that connection, the Minister could consider some sort of financial arrangement which would enable that type of person to purchase those houses, it might ease the problem, lessen the strain on the State, lessen the strain on the local authorities, and contribute towards making a greater number of people happy either in the building of the houses or in subsequently occupying them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset, Sir, that I think that the progress outlined by the Minister in connection with house-building in this country is very satisfactory and very creditable, and redounds to the credit of the Minister and his Department as well as that of the different local authorities through the country.  However, I want to say that I agree with Deputy Heron when he said that all Bills of this kind, involving as they do certain technical matters and certain amendments of other Bills, ought to be accompanied by an explanatory memorandum, because it is very difficult to follow the different amendments and changes in the sections of the various Acts since the Act of 1932. I want to join with Deputies Cosgrave, Dockrell and Heron in connection with this question of the withdrawal of grants for private people after the 31st March next.  I think it will be agreed by the Minister and everybody else that the private people who have been building houses in recent years have contributed their quota towards the solving of the housing problem.  Everybody knows, of course, that housing is the biggest problem that faces the country at the present moment with the exception, perhaps, of unemployment.  A great many people have been contemplating building houses in recent years, but owing to the fact that such a huge amount of housing was being undertaken by local authorities, building operatives have been very scarce, and people who had been contemplating building have had to put off the building of their houses on that account. I think, therefore, that the Minister should reconsider the position in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I, for one, am glad to see that the Minister is going to make a contribution to help people in urban areas to repair their houses, because everybody who is a member of a local authority sees from time to time reports from borough surveyors and sanitary officers to the effect that certain houses are in a state of disrepair, both from a constructional and from a sanitary point of view, and that these houses could be put into a proper state of repair if certain <Col N="2460" /> moneys were expended upon them.  I am not now referring so much to the house owned by a landlord as to the house owned by a private person.  On various occasions, in the Wexford Corporation, we have had such cases brought to our attention, and we have always considered it a pity that there was not some fund available to enable a small house-owner of the kind I have in mind to do something for the repair of his house-that would be in line with the report of the borough surveyer or the sanitary officer.  As far as we can see now, the Minister is empowered to give a sum of £40 towards the cost of such repairs.  What I want to know from the Minister is whether I am to understand from that, that if the repairs would cost £40, the Minister would only give £10 of that &mdash;in other words, a quarter of the amount.  That would be all right as far as a landlord is concerned, but I suggest to the Minister that he should go a little further in connection with a house owned by an ordinary working-class man, because it would be just as hard for such a man to find £30 as it would be for him to find £40. I ask him to reconsider that particular aspect of it before the Committee Stage.  His gesture is a generous one so far as the people who own houses and who have tenants are concerned, but I suggest that, so far as the small man is concerned who has recently acquired his own house&mdash;and in a great many cases people have done that&mdash;the fact that he is only going to get one-fourth of the cost of repairs will be absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this money is intended to be used for structural alterations or not.  If it is, I can foresee that when the valuation officer comes round, as he does periodically, there might be an increase of valuation in cases of that kind, and I think that would be disastrous, because increases which have been made in the valuation of houses in various urban areas in recent years have prevented people from carrying out any reconstruction or additions to their houses. With regard to valuations generally, I raised this matter before.  I am inclined to think that the valuations which are being placed upon houses <Col N="2461" /> built by local authorities are far too high.  I remember in 1923 or 1924 that Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President, gave a guarantee in the House that he would see to it that the valuations to be placed upon new houses would not be higher than those upon houses of a similar capacity built in previous years.  That has not been carried out, and the result is that when the rates are calculated in the rents of artisans' dwellings the rents in some cases are prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to is the question of the remission of rates in operation at present. I understood the Minister to say in answer to Deputy Heron that the present system whereby rates are remitted over a period of seven years is to cease.  I suggest to the Minister that that has been a big inducement to private people to build houses in recent years.  It enabled them to get over a period when they had certain calls on their purses and was certainly a great inducement and should be continued.  If the Minister will make inquiries from the Department and from various people concerned he will find that what I say is quite true.</P>

      <P>I am not one of those who did, and I do not know that the Wexford Corporation did.  Deputy McGowan or Deputy Heron, I forget which, referred to the question of the wages paid on building schemes.  I am not going to say that the Minister flouted that provision or anything of that kind, but I suggest to him that sufficient care was not taken by his Department to secure that that particular section in the 1932 Act was carried out, and I ask him to have a tightening up in that connection.  I should also like to know if, in connection <Col N="2462" /> with the expenditure of the grant which he proposes to give for the reconstruction of houses in urban areas, that particular section will be applicable.  If it is not clear in the Bill, I think it ought to be made clear, because I can visualise a position where a man will get a certain amount of Government money to reconstruct or repair his house and have the work done by a handy man, and the efforts of the Minister will be entirely abortive because of the fact that proper tradesmen, at trade union wages, are not employed.  In the interests of efficiency the Minister should have that matter attended to.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not call for very much criticism, but perhaps in the Committee Stage attention will be drawn to certain matters.  Again I say that the progress of housing in this country is very creditable, but it is a pity that the Minister withdrew the subsidy to local people, because they have certainly done their share to solve the housing problem in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies of all Parties will join in expressing satisfaction at the efforts made with the object of eliminating the slums and rain-soaked mud cabins throughout the country.  I think the efforts of the housing department in that connection are worthy of the highest commendation from the House.  I have had, over a substantial period of years, occasion to seek the intervention of the housing department and to seek guidance and advice from the housing department in various housing matters, and I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the courtesy, zeal, and efficiency of the staff of that department, who have spared no effort to assist in every possible way the expedition of housing progress in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, so far as it assists in the provision of further money for housing, will be welcomed by all Parties in the House.  There is only one misgiving I have about this housing question, and that is that I am afraid we are not giving sufficient attention to the supervision of labourers' cottages being erected under the main Housing Act. This Bill proposes to provide further money for the erection of cottages for <Col N="2463" /> labourers.  I have had occasion to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Department very serious complaints as to the manner in which cottages were erected in the County Kildare.  I have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion a good deal of national and local money is being wantonly dissipated there because of the type of labourers' cottage which is being built, and because of the apparent lack of adequate supervision in the erection of the cottages.</P>
    <P>I have brought to the notice of the Department particular cases which I investigated personally, showing that many of these new cottages, which have been only erected a year or two, are already showing signs of dampness, that in quite a number of cases there was defective plastering, and in other cases there was merely a sharp dashing of stones against ordinary case concrete, the concreting having only got a skimming coat of plaster. It is not to be wondered at that houses constructed in that way will not resist the elements.  I also had to bring to the notice of the Department defects in the tiles used, many of which have not shown a capacity to stand up to porosity tests.  I think tenants are going to find themselves in serious difficulty in the future by reason of the porosity of tiles, defective plastering, and the dampness from which a number of houses suffer.  But the outstanding defect so far as cottages in the County Kildare are concerned is in the chimneys.  In regard to almost every new cottage there has been complaint after complaint as to the defective condition of the chimneys. Wherever the smoke goes in labourers' cottages in other counties, the fact remains that in Kildare the smoke will go anywhere but up the chimney.  I have had technical people subject these chimneys to tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later.  Some of these chimneys have been subjected to well-known tests to ascertain their drawing capacity, and they will not draw.  Many tenants <Col N="2464" /> find it necessary, not merely to leave the kitchen door open, but to leave the window open as well, in order to induce the chimney to take away the smoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the object of the Act to increase the expenditure on housing under the Housing Act of 1932 and subsequent Acts?  It is under these Acts that labourers' cottages are being built.  I do not want to stress the point at any great length.  I shall deal with it in greater detail later, but I do suggest to the Minister that a much more rigid supervision should be exercised by his Department in order to ensure that the money spent in the erection of labourers' cottages is spent to the utmost possible advantage.  It is not being spent to the utmost possible advantage, so far as I can see in County Kildare.  I speak of that county because I know first hand of the enormous number of defects which have been shown up in cottages spread over a wide area in the county.  I can hardly imagine that the Minister's Department, from the information in their possession, are satisfied, but I cannot help thinking that a good deal of dissatisfaction arises out of the unsatisfactory engineering arrangements in the county.  Various engineers in the county are responsible to the board of health, but there is no technician on the board of health <Col N="2466" /> capable of judging the work of the local engineers.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that his Department ought to give some consideration to the question of putting in charge of local engineers some person to whom these engineers would be responsible.  That person should have some technical qualification enabling him to judge the manner in which work is carried out by local engineers and the standard of work performed in connection with the erection of labourers' cottages.  If the Minister will do that, I think he will avoid what I am afraid is inevitable if the present position is allowed to continue, namely, a colossal expenditure on repairs in a few years.  If we are going to permit the erection of labourers' cottages, which are not satisfactory and which in the first few years are going to show defects, I think the effort of the State to provide cottages and houses generally will be thwarted by the inefficiency of people engaged in the erection of these houses under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has one notable feature about it inasmuch as it provides for the discontinuance of the £45 grant which was made in respect of certain houses in urban areas up to the present. That grant is now to be discontinued under this Bill and I am afraid the effect of discontinuing it will be to slow down the erection of houses in urban areas.  We are still far from satisfying the demand for houses in urban areas.  Building costs have increased considerably of late. A firm, asking for more capital the other day, advertised the fact that its profits had increased substantially since 1932, which was the year of the advent of this Housing Act.  The costs of building materials have apparently been so high in the view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he has felt it necessary to refer the price of building materials to the Prices Commission for investigation. I understand that the Prices Commission has reported on the matter.  We have not yet seen the report although, in a matter of this kind, one would expect that the report would be made available so as to ascertain the views of an impartial body such as the Prices <Col N="2467" /> Commission on the question of the cause of the substantial increase in building costs in recent years.  The price of building materials certainly has increased considerably.  We ought to know whether, in the view of the Prices Commission, that increase is justified or whether it is not just a case of some people taking advantage of the fact that the State is subsidising housing on a very extensive scale and endeavouring to get &ldquo;rich quick.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the effect of the discontinuance of the £45 grant for certain houses in urban areas will inevitably slow down house-building in urban areas.  If you take the discontinuance of that grant with the proposal to drop the provision whereby there is a remission of two-thirds of the rates for a period of seven years, I think the combination of both factors will certainly have an adverse effect on housing in urban areas.  One provision is bad, but a combination of both, I think, would make the position very much worse, particularly at a time when the cost of building houses has increased very substantially.  Architects who have been consulted on the matter in connection with building schemes initiated by local authorities all recognise the fact that, in the past two years, building costs have increased by approximately 20 per cent. over the costs of two years ago, we select this moment to discontinue the grants in the urban areas and to withdraw the remission in rates.  I think it is a mistaken policy.  I think the effects on house-building will be bad, and I think it is not calculated to continue the impetus in house-building which has been a feature of housing activity in recent years.</P>
    <P>There is to-day a considerable amount of unemployment in the building trade.  Whatever might have been said about the scarcity of certain types of building operatives in recent years, there is certainly no scarcity of building trade operatives to-day.  I think if the Minister consults the employment exchange records he will find that there is quite a considerable number of unemployed building-trade workers. <Col N="2468" /> Those who are in a position to judge the present condition of the industry, and the prospects of the industry in the immediate future, are all agreed that the tendency will be for the industry to absorb less people because of the present high cost of building.  Now, we have a further aid to a slowing down in house building, namely, the discontinuance of the grant and the withdrawal of the rates remission for a period of seven years.  I did not have an opportunity of hearing the Minister's introductory speech.  I do not, therefore, know what case has been made for the discontinuance of the grant of £45, but, whatever case has been made for it, I think it is rather a short-sighted policy, and one calculated to impede house building.  If it was felt desirable in other years to provide grants even much higher than £45 to assist in house building, I do not know what has suddenly happened to justify the discontinuance of State grants for this purpose.  I am afraid that the effect of it will be to cause further unemployment in the building trade, which in this city, at all events, has not by any means recovered from the effects of the recent dispute in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Labourers Act is also associated with this amending Bill.  When the Labourers Bill was going through the House we endeavoured to secure that provision would be made for funding arrears, because we realised that, with many tenants owing a considerable sum of money for rents, it would be impossible for those people to take advantage of any suitable purchase scheme. That is particularly true when one remembers the position in Kerry, and I think in Clare too.  In Kerry, which gives the classic example of arrears, we find, I think, that the average figure for arrears is about £7 15s. per house, which means that on an average the tenants are in arrears on the cottages for over two and a half years. How one can imagine that those people will suddenly pay off those arrears, and proceed to purchase their houses under the Labourers Act, is something which I do not purport to explain.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to provide now for a scheme of funding under this Bill.  I do not, <Col N="2469" /> however, think that that makes the Bill anything more attractive.  I welcome it just as an indication that the Minister realises that the main Act has one defect; I hope it will not be long before he realises that the Act has a number of other defects as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know, and the Housing Department must know&mdash; certainly Deputies in touch with cottage tenants know&mdash;that there has been widespread objection by tenants to purchasing their cottages under the Principal Act.  Under that Act the tenants were given a reduction of 25 per cent. in their existing rents, but in lieu of that 25 per cent. reduction they were made liable to keep the cottages in repair in the future.  Even though an inadequate sum of money is at present being spent on the repair of labourers' cottages, such sum as is being spent works out annually at more than the remission of 25 per cent. in rent to the tenants under the purchase scheme.  I think the national average is that the repairs to cottages cost about 5d. per week, but the tenant is not going to get a reduction of 5d. per week under the purchase scheme.  Of course, everybody who has any experience of labourers' cottages and the demands of tenants that their cottages should be kept in a proper state of repair knows perfectly well that, if the repairs were carried out as they should, 5d. per week would not at all keep the cottages in repair, particularly if allowance were made for the fact that for quite a long period inadequate sums were spent in carrying out repairs which should have been properly attended to in other years.  I think, too, that another objection of the tenants to purchasing under the Principal Act is that the period for the payment of the annuity is too long.  The period provided in the Principal Act was 65 years, and I think that period inordinately long.  The length of that period, and the fact that they are required to pay 75 per cent. of the existing rent, the other 25 per cent. being regarded as a set-off against the liability to keep the cottages in repair, have induced the tenants to take the view&mdash;and I think the correct view&mdash;that under an Act of that kind <Col N="2470" /> it is not in their own interests that they should purchase their cottages. It is much better for the tenants that the local authorities should continue to own the cottages rather than that they should purchase under a scheme of that kind, which I think will not lighten the burden on the tenants but will, in fact, increase it.</P>
    <P>If I were a wealthy ratepayer in a county, I would urge every cottage tenant to purchase under the Principal Act, but if I were interested in a tenant I would tell him not to purchase under the Principal Act, because under the provisions of that Act a burden will be taken off the wealthy ratepayer and put on the backs of the tenants.  When you have got to make a choice between two elements of the community as to who should bear a burden, I think the burden ought to be put on the back of whoever is most capable of bearing it.  From the point of view of the tenants, at all events, I think the Principal Act is not a good Act.  It requires much more than the introduction of a funding arrangement to make it an attractive Act from the standpoint of the tenants.  I think, however, it is very desirable from every standpoint that the tenants should be encouraged to purchase their cottages under a satisfactory scheme.  At a time when the drift from the rural areas to the towns is most marked, and when the effect of that drift is to cause serious social problems in the town, we ought to be doing everything we possibly can to keep the people on the land.  That can be done in a variety of ways, some of which it is not permissible to discuss under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am saying that the Minister, having taken that step, ought to take two more steps.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I am allowed to criticise what is not in it, and on the Fifth Stage I am allowed to criticise what is in it.  I am availing of my rights as an ordinary Deputy to do that.  I think there is a good case to be made for encouraging tenants to purchase their cottages under the Principal Act, and I would very much like if the Minister could see his way to go further in amending that Act than he has done in this measure.  At a time when there is a drift from the rural areas to the towns and cities, it is very desirable to anchor people to the land, and one of the best ways to do that is to give them an interest in their homesteads.  Anything that ties the people to the land, such as the ownership of a house, is a very valuable national safeguard and tends to minimise the dangers which are inherent in a constant drift from the rural areas into the towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not stop at amending the Labourers Act in the manner outlined in this Bill.  I will express the hope that he may see his way to go further by reducing the period over which the annuities may be paid, and reducing the amount of the annuities as well.  If that means a little additional financial burden on the local taxpayer, it will, nevertheless, be money well spent.  We have to recognise that the tenants who occupy those cottages are, in the main, a class of people whose conditions of livelihood are marked by low wages and social amenities which are not enviable, and if the central authority or the local authority must make a contribution towards brightening their lot and helping to avoid the evils of congestion in the towns and cities, money spent in that manner would be well spent.  I hope the Minister will see his way to introduce further amendments to the Labourers Act of 1936.  I hope he may find it possible to reconsider the discontinuance <Col N="2472" /> of the £45 grant in urban areas which, I am afraid, is likely to impede instead of encouraging further house-building efforts.</P>

      <P>I had not the good fortune to hear the whole of this debate and, particularly, I missed the Minister's speech.  There is just this clause with regard to grants to urban authorities that I would like the Minister to explain, if he has not already done so.  I would like him to explain as fully as possible the principle that underlies that provision.  It seems to me to be a very remarkable innovation that without a means test, or without any inquiry as to the income derived from property, the owner of urban property can get the Government to help him to put such property in order, to help him to improve it, that he will get a free grant for it.  We all know there are people making very big incomes out of house property, very big incomes indeed, and in many cases they are in the position of improving such property to any extent that may be desired.  It is altogether to their interests to do so.  I am surprised to find that Deputy Norton had nothing to say on that very big principle.  So far as I know, it is a new principle that the Government voluntarily come to the aid of such people and say: &ldquo;If you im-improve that property that you are already making a very big income from, we will assist you with grants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Did the Deputy hear Deputy Corish's speech from these benches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish made a very slight allusion to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, there is the remarkable principle that where such grants are given, a Government Department will bargain with the owner as to the rents that are to be charged.  There is no provision in the Bill as to the criteria to be adopted, the principle to be accepted in bargaining as to rents.  There is the simple provision that the Minister will have the right to fix a maximum rent. It looks to me as if there is an infinity <Col N="2473" /> of trouble in store there.  Once one set of rents has been fixed by a Government Department, it is obvious that nearly all rents will have to be fixed.  I take it that wherever a grant is given by the Government the rents for all such property will come under the supervision or control of a Government Department.  That is much more than the thin end of the wedge.  It is half the wedge in towards the full control of the rents of all urban property.</P>
      <P>It seems to me an immense extension of State activity.  It seems to be a very remarkable development of State intervention.  I think it will inevitably follow that other rents will be fixed, even where no grants have been given, and that it must follow that the State will fix the rents for such other property.  I would not like to say definitely that I think the decision of the Government to take such a step is right; and, similarly, I would not like to say it is wrong; but certainly it seems to me a very remarkable development to be introduced as a mere aside to a Housing Act.  I would like the Minister to tell us if we are to understand that in a city like Dublin, for instance, if the municipality can be got to subscribe half the cost, the Minister will be prepared to subscribe the other half up to the extent of £40 for each separate dwelling, and that he is going to do that irrespective of the means of the applicant and irrespective of any inquiry of that kind, and that it simply is on the condition that he will be at liberty to fix the rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is he going to fix the rents? Does it not mean an immense amount of new work for his Department?  I take it that it cannot be done in any arbitrary or slap-dash way.  Will it be done, having regard to what the rents previously have been?  Will it be done, having regard to the cost of putting up such a building?  Will it apply to all flats?  If a house that is laid out in flats is the subject of such grant, will that mean that each flat in that building, even where the flat is not affected by the improvement, will be subject to the Minister's control with regard to rent?  I think it is one of the biggest developments of State interference we have seen, and <Col N="2474" /> I look forward to the Minister's explanation, if he has not already full explained the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for some time to this debate, and it certainly surprised me how quickly the Labour Party can change their minds from one week to another.  Ten or 12 days ago we had Deputy Corish practically at the throat of the Minister for Local Government over one matter, that on the admitted advance in the price of building materials an increased grant was not given before last September. We have heard him to-day throwing bouquets at the Minister for Local Government.  For what?  For withdrawing the £45 grant from the urban districts.  That is all I can see in this Bill.  This £45 grant is now to be withdrawn, and Deputy Corish, Deputy Norton and the Labour Party congratulate the Minister on that.  It is certainly a great injustice.  To give a £40 reconstruction grant in urban areas may or may not be a benefit.  I do not happen to live in an urban area, but £40 of a reconstruction grant in an urban area, where the trade union rate of wages has to be paid, is almost useless.  I should like the Minister to reconsider that question of the £45 grant.  Even on the admission of the Labour Party, you have an increase in the cost of building materials within the past few years.  That increase amounts to at least 20 per cent.  On top of that you have the increase involved by the Conditions of Employment Act, amounting to about 8 per cent.  One can safely say that inside the last few years building costs have gone up here by at least 30 per cent. I ask the Minister to consider that and, instead of withdrawing grants, to increase them.  In the West of Ireland the local authorities have done very good work, and, seeing that the increased cost amounts to about 30 per cent, the Minister should make some contribution towards that increase. If that increase is not met, there will be a hold-up of building even in the case of private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell the House why building costs have gone up to such an extent.  Some of us have a fairly good idea of the reason, but <Col N="2475" /> it would be no harm if the Minister would let the House know.  Perhaps he would tell us whether the tariffs on building materials and the subsidising of factories engaged in the production of material for building construction have any influence in the matter and whether these activities are a paying proposition or not?  Take nails as an example.  Up to 18 months ago, they were being bought at about 14/- per cwt. or £14 per ton.  What is the price to-day?  Is it not £28 per ton?  I ask the Minister to say whether there is a nail factory in this country and whether it is operating under a tariff of 75 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce would give us that information.  I would also like the Minister to say whether the 75 per cent. tariff compensates for the inconvenience caused to people engaged in the building industry.  We have also a duty on cement of 5/- a ton.  The Minister knows as well as I do that, inside the last two years, cement without any duty has gone up in price. When it is going up in price, the Minister should recommend the removal of that duty.  Then, as to roofing, we all know that the roofing of these houses with tiles is bound to increase the cost. Tiles are much heavier than slates and there has to be heavier timber work in all these houses on which tiles are used &mdash;even labourers' cottages.  Can nothing be done to develop the slate industry? Is it possible that, after 14 or 15 years as an independent country, we cannot develop the slate quarries and produce sufficient slates for our own needs? Even the ordinary individual cannot get a few cwts. of slates at present. We have slate quarries in Deputy Corry's county, in Donegal and in other counties and, at the same time, nine-tenths of the houses are being roofed with tiles.  It is good for us to realise what local authorities have to contend with in the way of increased costs and duties on materials which are not being provided in this country. We have steel windows for our houses which are just as good as timber. People object because they are not made in the country but the timber put into the wooden windows is not <Col N="2476" /> made in the country either.  Something should be done if building is to be brought within the means of people anxious to build.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Norton talk about supervision.  In the County Galway, we get enough supervision.  In that respect, the Minister and his Department are carrying out their duties.  I do not know what is really lacking as regards the formation of the houses or the chimneys of which Deputy Norton complains but, as regards supervision, I had, inside the last 12 months, four inspections of a scheme of labourers' cottages in one day.  If that is not supervision, I do not know what is. Deputy McGowan mentioned that contractors and their friends were applying for grants.  That is a serious charge to make in this House.  It amounts to saying that there are Private contractors in this country who nominate employees, or friends of their own, in order to get grants for houses which they will not occupy afterwards.  I heard such a charge made before and I think that, on one or two occasions, they were investigated by the Minister's Department and were found to have no foundation. Now the charge is made definitely here. The Minister should certainly be in a position to answer such a charge which is definitely against his Department and, if investigated, I think it will be found to have no foundation.  Great advantage has been taken of housing facilities in rural districts, in spite of increased costs, and I appeal to the Minister, instead of hampering these people who are inclined to do the best they can, to provide them with some grant that will help them.  We all know that the £45 grant was a very small help, and with the 20 per cent. increase in building alone&mdash;and I think the full percentage increase is 30 per cent.&mdash;in the last two years, I think that instead of reducing or withdrawing this grant it should be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Vice-President having a little doze?  I am not sure whether we are delaying him too long on this matter.  Since I came into this House I have heard criticisms which suggest that the high building <Col N="2477" /> costs have given many Deputies a hint as to profiteering by those engaged in the building trade.  I am not anxious, nor would I be allowed, to refer in any detail to the causes, or to the facts, but I might mention that although costs have gone, and are going, up, it does not necesarily mean that those engaged in the building trade&mdash; builders' providers or importers&mdash;are making profits accordingly.  I will leave it at that, but if anybody wants a detailed debate on that subject here, it can be had at any particular time. There has been in the past too much bandying about in this House of such terms as &ldquo;frauds&rdquo; and &ldquo;profiteers&rdquo; as applied to persons engaged in different businesses, and to-night we have had hints about the building trade as a whole.  Deputy Moore referred to a section of this Bill as an extraordinary innovation, as a dangerous thing, as if those who had property which had got into disrepair, and the rents of which, by reason of the property getting into disrepair, were withheld, should receive no assistance whatever in getting their property back into repair and getting a decent clean deal in the matter of rents.  That is what I understand this section to mean.  I am sure the Minister will explain it in more detail, but it seems to me that those who have property, those who pay moneys to the Government in direct taxation, are always to be attacked and to get no assistance whatever.  These people who have big responsibilities as citizens, and are willing to meet them &mdash;they have done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future&mdash; always seem to be made the object of attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Norton was speaking here, the Chair ruled that he was going outside the scope of the debate.  I had intended to follow on certain lines, but out of consideration for the Vice-President, and for the Chair particularly, I am not doing so.  I notice, however, that utility societies come into this debate again.  On previous occasions I referred to bogus utility societies, and I remember that the Minister bowed agreement with my statement that there were and had been utility societies formed, registered <Col N="2478" /> as such, with no capital and which had gone bankrupt and left houses unfinished.  There are at the present moment, not far from where I live, several houses unfinished in respect of which money was voted by this House.  I cannot say if these houses were erected by these societies, but there are four houses unfinished, and I do not know the reason for it. Deputy Norton spoke about the houses in Kildare, and I am sure that the Minister's Department will see to it that there will be more attention to detail and more supervision in future. Whether it is due to a shortage of staff or not, I do not know, but Deputy Norton's statement can be verified to a large extent by me.  It seems to me that the available engineering officials are not able to cope with the work placed upon them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to the officials of the Housing Department who, in view of the chaotic and complicated Bills and conditions, labour associations and all the difficulties attendant on the carrying on of an intensive housing policy, such as the difficulty of meeting the mutual interests of all and bringing about all-round compatibility, have one of the most difficult tasks of any Department.  They have shown themselves tireless and efficient, courteous and most helpful to us all.  I wish to reiterate that the allegations of profiteering made against those in the building trade are not true.  If anybody wishes to give details in this House in respect of these allegations, they will be replied to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister sincerely on the introduction of this Bill.  Urban authorities and boards of health, in many cases, have been put to very great expense to provide houses for people who were living in condemned and insanitary dwellings.  Under the Minister's proposals in this Bill the owners of these houses can now get reconstruction grants.  It is true that the grants are small, but they will enable people to put these houses into a habitable condition.  Undoubtedly that will relieve a certain burden that now falls on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is taking <Col N="2479" /> some power under this Bill in connection with rents.  I hope that principle will go further.  Undoubtedly rents in urban towns and in all parts of the country are contributing very largely to the high cost of living.  I do not take much notice of what Deputy Norton said about labourers' cottages. Deputy Norton is in the happy position that the more that is done the more he looks for.  It is a very happy position to be in when one has no responsibility.  Personally, I would be anxious to see a 50 per cent. reduction in the rents of labourers' cottages. I would even be anxious to see a reduction of 75 per cent., aye, and to see the tenants getting them for nothing, but when we face the responsibilities and see what has been done, and consider the burden the State has undertaken, it is another matter.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council provided £250,000 for the first scheme of labourers' cottages.  That was done because this Government made provision by which 60 per cent. of the loan charges and the labour would be paid by the Government, leaving only 40 per cent. to be paid by the tenants and the ratepayers.  That was a fairly big burden for the State to undertake but it was done because for 30 or 35 years there were no building schemes. As no cottages were built in the rural districts since 1914 the State had come to the rescue.  The cottages that were built in County Cork out of the £250,000 cost about £250 each, and £150 of that was provided by the State.  Immediately the tenants went into occupation of these cottages, the rents of which are about ? a week, they could proceed to purchase them, as well as the acre of land attached. Under the purchase scheme the rents were reduced by 25 per cent.  I do not think any Deputy will allege that there would be an enormous amount of repairs needed on new cottages. Tenants of older cottages, under the proposals here, if they notify their intention to purchase, the board of health is compelled to put them into proper repair, so that they purchase houses in perfect condition.  The cottages should not need repairs for some years.  In that way the State <Col N="2480" /> has gone a long way to meet people whose rents are admittedly low.  The general run of the rents is between 9d. and 1/- a week for the house and an acre of ground.  When the rents are further reduced, in the case of the 1/- cottage to 9d. weekly, the tenants will be owners, and surely the little repairs that may be required will be no great burden upon them.  As far as Deputy Brodrick's friend is concerned, if he looks at the <i>Cork Examiner</i> he will find an advertisement in it for Irish slates every day.  If he wants slates I will send him all he requires.</P>

      <P>As far as the £45 is concerned, as the Deputy is anxious to hear about it, I sat for about six years on the benches that the Deputy's Party now occupy, and during that period he always carefully walked into the Lobby to vote against any reconstruction grant whatever for small farmers, about whom he is now so anxious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When sitting on the opposite benches I appealed time after time <Col N="2482" /> for some grant for small farmers for reconstruction purposes.  We had several divisions in the House on that question, and I recollect that the Deputy voted in favour of giving no reconstruction grant.  Of course, he has changed his mind since.  I would appeal to the Minister to raise the limit of valuations, so that it will be possible for him to give a £40 grant for the reconstruction of the dwellings of small farmers.  In certain areas of the country you find a £25 valuation on a holding of 15 statute acres.  There are hundreds of cases of that kind in my constituency.  I do not think anybody will contend that a man with 16 acres of land is a large farmer.  Yet, these people are prevented, under the present valuation limit, of availing of the reconstruction grants.  Most of those valuations were fixed at the time of Griffith's valuation.  If the Minister were to increase the valuation limit from £25 to £35 it would mean that many of the people I speak for would be able to live in decent houses.  At the present time the houses of a great many of them are in a worse condition than the labourers' cottages that Deputy Norton complained of.  If the Minister were to do what I suggest, I am sure there are from 150 to 200 people in my constituency who would be able to avail of the  grants.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should give this concession to the people in the rural areas now that he is extending his generosity to the owners of urban house property, to people who, because of their neglect to keep their property in a proper state of repair, have thrown a severe burden on the local authorities. On the whole, I welcome the Bill.  I think it is an improvement, as every Bill has been that the Minister for Local Government has introduced in connection with housing.  All his Bills mark an advance and an improvement on the previous ones.  That view, I venture to say, is held in all parts of the House.  There is nothing but praise for the work that the Minister has done to improve housing conditions.  Of course, one hears growls here and there, but the world would not be the world it is without them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Moore in the diffidence that he has expressed in connection with the rather novel section in the Bill which is intended to benefit the owners of house property.  It certainly marks a very big departure from existing legislation and practice.  The section, as one gathers, is intended to benefit the owners of property in towns and villages, and in certain circumstances in county boroughs.  I am not worried by the fact that it is an experiment. If it helps to solve the problem that the State and local authorities are faced with in dealing with housing, as we know it to-day, then the departure is one that can be welcomed.  It will be all to the good if some of the property concerned can be saved from complete demolition and made available for families in sore need of decent housing accommodation.  The scheme we find outlined here is one that, I venture to suggest, will need very careful handling.  The proposal is that 50 per cent. of the cost is to be put up by the local authority and the remainder by the Department.  If the local authority has to face that burden, then it will have to ensure that there will be proper supervision of the work carried out under the scheme.  The Department will have to be careful to see whether or not a particular property is entitled to come under this beneficial legislation.  Recently, we have been demolishing house property in most of our towns. In some cases the property got into a bad state of repair through no fault of the owners.  But at any rate the cost to the local authority has been pretty severe.  In other cases local authorities have had to deal with house property owned by usurers, people who never showed any mercy to the unfortunates who occupied their property, and never made any attempt to keep it in a decent state of repair.</P>

    <P>The good type of landlord and the bad type of landlord will be met under the scheme outlined in the Bill. I suggest to the Minister that the Department, before giving a grant under this scheme, should seek advice from the local authority and <Col N="2484" /> ascertain whether a particular property is worth considering.  That precaution, I think, should be taken before a local authority is asked to put up half the cost of the repair of property in its locality.  If that is done, it may result in getting good results from this rather novel experiment. Proper safeguards are, in my opinion, essential if the scheme outlined here is to be a success.  Unfortunately, we cannot get all the new houses built that we require, or with the speed that we would like, but if the safeguards that I have mentioned are taken in connection with this scheme, local authorities will be enabled to afford increased housing accommodation for the many people who are badly in need of it.  I could not quite follow Deputy Brodrick's statement about all the bouquets that have been thrown at the Minister from the Labour Benches.  I did not get any perfume from them.  On the other hand we had Deputy Corry suggesting that we were throwing bricks at the Minister.  A remarkable thing about Deputy Corry's speech was that, while he did not deal with the Bill, he made a splendid defence of the main Act. When concluding, he did admit that the amendment introduced by the Minister into this Bill is an improvement on the main Act.  Listening to the Deputy one would imagine that it was impossible to improve the main Act.  He went to great pains to denounce the Labour Party, and Deputy Norton in particular, for suggesting that further amendments to the main Act could be usefully made.</P>
    <P>The amendment the Minister is embodying in this Bill is the minimum that he believes necessary to make the main Act acceptable.  But I venture to suggest that even this plum, which the Minister is offering to the cottiers of the country, will not be sufficient to induce any great number of them to purchase their houses.  I believe that, if Deputy Corry would speak his mind, he would admit that the labourers of the country would be justified in asking for a 50 per cent. reduction in their rents.  That is not being conceded to them in this Bill.  I believe that, without it, they are not going to avail <Col N="2485" /> of the provision to purchase.  It is all very well for Deputy Corry to point out that the rentals of labourers' cottages are low.  But the Deputy must admit that farmers' rents are also low, and while that is so, that they have been getting, now for some years, a remission of 50 per cent. in the amount of their annuities.  There has been no corresponding reduction in the rents of labourers' cottages, so that what we find at the present time is that the sum that a labourer has to pay in rent and rates for his cottage is about the equivalent of what the owner of a 20 acre farm is paying for his holding. I think he will have to admit, in view of that, that there should be lower rents for labourers also.</P>
    <P>I want to agree with Deputy Corry in one point that he made, and that is in connection with the question of repairs to the houses of small farmers; and I would urge on the Minister, particularly since every Deputy in the House who has spoken so far has advocated an extension of the facilities for the repair of the houses of small farmers in the country, that he should give more favourable attention to such people, or at least that he should give equal attention to the demand that has been made on behalf of other people. It must be remembered that many small farmers, starting, perhaps, in very humble circumstances during the war years, got an extension of their land, and it must also be remembered that that increased portion of land they got has become a burden on them now.  It has become a burden more than anything else on the type of a farmer of whom I am speaking.  Now you have labourers' cottages springing all round the country, but the biggest eyesore at the present moment is the house of the small farmer who is residing, perhaps, in a thatched house and under most insanitary conditions.  The people to whom I am referring are not able to undertake the repair of their houses. I hope it will be understood that I am not attempting to make a comparison such as, let us say, Deputy Corry made, but I believe that there is no section of the community in this country more entitled to get relief from what, undoubtedly, are the slum conditions <Col N="2486" /> under which they are now living, than the small farmers of the type to which I refer.  I think that the Minister, therefore, should try to extend the facilities herein provided so as to increase the valuation.  I think that the £25 valuation grinds very hardly on people of the type I have mentioned. I think it has been admitted by all Deputies who have spoken on this matter that, in some counties, it may be a source of very great hardship.  From what I have heard from the Minister, it seems that there is no hope of a re-valuation.  The Minister himself says that he is not inclined to go in for a general national re-valuation, but it must be remembered that there are certain counties where there are real hardships on account of the high valuation under which farms of this type are suffering.  One reason for these hardships is the disability of not being able to avail of the housing grants provided.  I think that the Minister ought to get away from the £25 valuation, and that he should extend it to £30 and £35 valuation, in order to enable such people to avail of this.</P>
    <P>One other point to which I should like to refer is the question of supervision and the question of the payment of reasonable rates of wages and reasonable conditions of employment for people employed on the erection of such houses throughout the country.  I think it is only reasonable that, when the State provides money for such purposes, the State should exercise proper supervision as to the control and expenditure of these moneys, and that the State ought to institute sufficient supervision to see that reasonable rates of wages are paid to, and that reasonable hours of work are worked by, those who are employed on such schemes.  If that were to be taken into hands by the Minister and his Department, and if the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act were to be enforced with regard to such workers, I would be satisfied; but I put it to any Deputy who has spoken in this House on this matter&mdash; whether Deputy Brodrick, Deputy Minch, or anybody else&mdash;that an attempt has been made, in connection with the building of these houses, to <Col N="2487" /> evade the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act in connection with the building of houses.  There have been cases of men working by candlelight, moonlight, and so on, and working under the most unfair conditions generally; and I say that that is unfair and that it does not give even a guarantee of a reasonably good house being built, equivalent to the money that has been spent on the building of the house.  I believe, so far as I can find out, that, in the view of some of our engineers throughout the country, they are not happy with some of the work that has been done.  I will admit that the matter of supervision has been tightened up and that engineers and clerks of works are making more frequent visits, but I am afraid that these works will not bear the test of time, and, in my opinion, that is mainly due to the lack of proper supervision and to allowing people to evade conforming with the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act.</P>

      <P>This, Sir, has been a rather protracted but an interesting debate.  I had hoped that, being near Christmas time, the Bill would have taken only about half-an-hour or an hour, and that we would have the same experience, as I have had once or twice before, and get the Bill through in a short time.  That, however, was not my good fortune to-day.  However, I had the good fortune to hear many interesting speeches and some useful suggestions.  Before I enter into anything else, however, I should like to thank those Deputies who have been so kind as to refer to the Department of Local Government and Public Health and its officials in such eulogistic terms as they have done.  I could not say too much in praise of the officials of the Department, from my knowledge of them; and I do not think there is any Deputy in this House who has ever gone to these officials&mdash;particularly the officials dealing at the moment with the matter of housing schemes&mdash;for help or guidance, or even with complaints, who would say that he has not been met with courtesy <Col N="2488" /> and sympathetic consideration at all times.  Naturally, that is what one would expect from civil servants, but it is not always what one receives from certain people in this world.  I am glad, however, to hear Deputies paying a tribute to the fact that they have always got such sympathetic consideration from the Department.</P>

      <P>One matter that has been spoken of so often by Deputies who took part in the debate is the question of the valuation of holdings in rural areas for purposes of reconstruction, and it is a matter to which I should like to refer.  I am afraid that there is no likelihood of getting an increased revaluation so far as this Bill is concerned.  We have a problem to deal with in connection with the lower valuations, which is still a very big problem, and I think that, until we have considerably reduced the problem in which those who are in greatest need are concerned, it would not be right to take up the question of people who are not so badly off.  That is the way I take it. After all, a valuation of £25 in this country for an agricultural holding means, generally, that it is a pretty good holding.  A man who has a valuation of £25&mdash;not always, of course &mdash;is generally able to provide for himself and for the reconstruction of his house, but certainly a man with a valuation of £35 or £45 ought to be in a better position than a man with a valuation of £25 or under.  In any case, we still have obligations to some 14,000 persons who are living in agricultural holdings of less than £25, and I think we have gone a great deal further on the road towards dealing with the poorer classes.  For these reasons, therefore, I would not be in favour of increasing the grant at the moment.  Possibly something could be said for it, but I am anxious to get all stages of the present Bill through as quickly as possible, because we have come to the end of our tether so far as finances are concerned, and if we do not get the Bill through rapidly allocations might be held up.  It might be possible, however, to bring in at <Col N="2489" /> another time an amended scale such as, I think, Deputy Brennan suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A graded scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think that, before we even think of that, we ought to think of the poorer people first&mdash;people whose houses in many cases are falling about their heads, and people who, in my opinion, have first claim on any grants that may be available.  These have, I think, the first claim on any Government resources available.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies spoke about the number of agricultural holdings over £25 valuation there are in their constituencies. I have not the total number of agricultural holdings with valuations up to £25&mdash;they are not made out in £5 units&mdash;but I have the number up to £30.  The total number of agricultural holdings in the country up to £30 valuation is 314,226.  There are about 60,000 holdings above that valuation.  Altogether there are in the country 376,369 agricultural holdings from £1 up to over £200 valuation, and of these 314,000 are below £30 valuation.  We might take it that 300,000 of them have a valuation of £25 and under.  So that we are dealing at present with more than three-fourths of the problem in dealing with the people of £25 valuation and under. Until we have cleared off these poorer people, I think there is not much of a case on the numbers given for increasing the valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also spoke of the great cost and of our commitments. Deputy Brennan's predecessor, when speaking on Housing Bills, used to complain sometimes that I had not told the people often enough what we are committing the country to in the way of expense.  Deputy Brennan mentioned the figure of £6,000,000.  I have not the exact figure, but he is right in saying that in or about £6,000,000 has been the cost up to the present of our housing work under the 1932 Act.  That is a very big figure.  I do not want to hide it.  I should like the country to know it; and I should like everybody to understand what we are committing the country to.  I <Col N="2490" /> should like them to realise at the same time that there is a necessity for that expenditure.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of the Government, there has not been one penny spent on housing under the 1932 Act, or even under previous Acts, that is not good expenditure, good money well spent on housing the people.  There is no better way you can expend the nation's money than on the provision of decent, sanitary housing accommodation for our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also asked if I would give the annual commitment. The annual commitment varies with the growth of the housing schemes of our local authorities.  The annual commitment of our local authorities last year, in round figures, was £196,000; this year, £302,000; and next year it will probably be £340,000 or £350,000.  Commitments are heavy, unquestionably. £6,000,000 is a heavy burden for this country, but it is not too heavy in proportion to the liability in the way of bad housing that we have to meet.  If we are spending the nation's money for good social services, I think there will be a return afterwards in the help and benefit to the community that will be even out of proportion to the amount we spend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of the £45 grant in urban areas.  That £45 grant, it is proposed, should cease on the 31st March next.  It does not come as a surprise to the House, I am sure, that that £45 grant should cease, because it was mentioned here on the last two occasions on which I spoke in introducing the annual Housing Bill.  Certainly on the last occasion I made a pretty specific pronouncement that the intention was not to continue the £45 grant after the expiration of the period covered by that last Bill.  I am one of those who like to see houses of every type being built.  We are badly in need of houses.  We are very much in arrears in Dublin City, in particular, and in the urban areas around Dublin; and any measure which would encourage houses to be built in considerable numbers I should like to adopt.  But I do believe that, so far as the private builder is concerned, the £45 grant has been but very little encouragement to <Col N="2491" /> him in undertaking new building schemes.  I have had that view expressed to me by private building speculators.  What they have put to me is: &ldquo;If you can help to secure that loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act will be available for local authorities, you can keep your £45.&rdquo;  That has been said to me more than once.  I do not see any reason why there should not be money available under that Act.  If at any time the case is made to the Government by the Dublin Corporation or any local authority that there is a difficulty in getting money for that purpose it will get serious consideration.</P>
    <P>With the £45 grant in urban areas there goes, of course, the seven years' concession with regard to the remission of rates.  That is a matter of consideration, first of all, to the speculative builder, and probably also to the purchaser of a new house.  Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Norton, Deputy Heron and others spoke about that matter.  I shall look into that and see what we can do with regard to a further extension.  I do not know whether we can do it under this Bill, because it may require an amendment of the Local Government Act, but I will look into it anyway.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brasier said that the Minister was not over-generous in grants to dwellers in rural areas.  I have made the statement before in this House, and I have made it elsewhere, that no Government in the world has given more generous grants out of the nation's purse towards the rehousing of the people than has been given by this Government under the 1932 Act, and is being continued by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no country where it is more necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, so far as I know.  I do not know what the necessity may be in other countries. There may be other countries where it may be equally necessary, but I do not know.  I do know that there is no other country where more generous grants have been given or grants anything like as generous. Even official inquirers from wealthy countries like the United States, who <Col N="2492" /> have been sent to study our housing schemes and who have gone over Europe studying housing schemes and housing legislation, have in conversation with me admitted that they could not get their Government to face up to giving grants either to local authorities or private persons such as we have given.  Loans, I think, are now to be granted in the United States on a larger scale than anything ever done in this country, but they are only loans, at a high rate of interest, and will have to be repaid.  There are no grants, nothing in proportion to what has been given here.  The grants here are very generous, no more generous than they should be; but they are generous grants, and they are available in town and country.  I am glad to say that they have been availed of to a very great extent indeed in the rural areas, both housing grants and reconstruction grants.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Norton with regard to the supervision of housing which had particular reference to County Kildare was, I think, mentioned by the Deputy before.  I have had the matter examined more than once.  I have not had a final report of the examinations that have been made as yet, but I think I can say this much: that all the charges which he has made will, I believe, not be found to be well founded.</P>

      <P>There may be some.  Wherever they are well founded we shall do our best to get the matter remedied.  Deputies, especially those who have any special connection with local authorities, will know that it is not possible for the Minister or his Department always to get local authorities to do things as the Department wants them.  It often happens that a Deputy, sometimes a member of a local authority, will come in here to the House and make complaints, or that a member of a local authority who is not a Deputy will write to me or the secretary of my Department making complaints.  Afterwards we, through our inspector or by correspondence, ask the local authority to carry out certain suggestions <Col N="2493" /> and you know the type of answer we get&mdash;sometimes more forcible than polite.  &ldquo;It is not our business; they have their own business to do.

I never try, even though I could, to act the Mussolini.  My policy would be to write down a courteous letter, to send down a courteous inspector to talk to the officials and, if necessary, to talk to the members of the local boards and try to get them, through their officials, to do these things that we think should be done.  Even though we are not always successful, we do our best.  We cannot compel them. Deputy Lenihan talked about the Minister compelling local authorities to do this, that or the other.  We cannot do that.  We are constituted on democratic lines in this country. I often wish, when I read the sort of criticisms that one sees in the local Press about what we have failed to do, and about all the things that should be done, that I had the power to go right down and get the job done myself.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGowan was the first to raise a subject which some other Deputies also mentioned, namely, the question of trade union wages.  I have always, during my public life, stood for the payment of trade union wages.  Wherever I have any power, authority or influence, I would like to see trade union wages paid.  That has been my view always. Deputy McGowan went so far as to say that the Minister and the officials of his Department flouted the section in the Housing Act.  That is untrue. <Col N="2494" /> He has no right to make a statement of that kind for which he has no foundation.  Other Deputies who spoke on the Labour Benches would not say that the Minister or the Department flouted Section 8 of the Act which deals with the payment of trade union wages, and the observance of trade union conditions.  At any time that a complaint was made to us from anywhere, that trade union wages were not being paid, we took the matter up immediately with the authority concerned and no grants were paid unless we were satisfied that trade union wages had been paid.</P>

I am not going to mention his name, and I think I shall say no more about it as the Deputy has mentioned his name.  There was one case we had where men in the building trade took action against a builder for the payment of trade union wages.  They said they had not been paid trade <Col N="2495" /> union wages, and we were doing our best to secure evidence of the fact that they had not been paid, but it came out in the court that they had made an agreement with the builder before they started on the job that he should not be obliged to pay them the full trade union wages.  Therefore these men lost their case in court.  I believe it happens in some cases, not so much in Dublin City but around Dublin, that agreements of that kind are arrived at.  Agreements are arrived at, not in the city, but not far from the city, under which men arrange with the builder to take something less than the standard rate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Heron and Deputy Corish talked about the Bill requiring an explanatory memorandum. I could understand that from Deputy Heron, who is new to the House, and who perhaps has not had an opportunity of studying the four or five other Bills which preceded this. This is merely an annual Bill to provide £700,000 more.  The basis of that is the 1932 Act.  The additional £700,000 is voted annually here in the Dáil.  It gives an opportunity, naturally, for debate, but there is usually no new principle of any kind in the Bill, and it is more or less taken for granted.  This time there were several new things put in the Bill, and it was slightly more complicated than the last, but I am surprised at Deputy Corish making that statement when he should have known the matter off by heart.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister allow me to say this?  The Minister said it was providing more than was previously provided, but he knows that the Bill contains provisions taking away certain advantages, such as the remission of rates.  All I suggest about a memorandum is that it would be a good thing for the members of this House, and for the community generally, if they could get an explanation of a highly technical Bill of this kind, dealing with a matter vitally affecting a large number of people. The Minister will probably agree with me that the newspaper summaries of the Bill demonstrate the fact that the newspapers, which presumably might read legislation of this kind with a somewhat expert eye, were themselves not aware of the actual provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to permit me to say a few words in regard to conditions of employment.  I have personal experience of the Minister's anxiety always to see that trade union conditions would be observed.  I must pay that tribute to him.  But I suggest that if a contractor breaks his contract by placing into a piece of work which he has contracted to perform something that is inferior, or something that is wrong, he ought to be brought to book about it, irrespective of whether he has got the subsidy or not.</P>
      <P>When on several occasions a contractor has been proved guilty of not paying the standard trade union rate of wages, I submit that he has broken his contract, and that there should be some means of dealing with him.  He enters into a contract, undertaking to observe trade union conditions, such as wages and hours of work.  Trade union officials have proved that in a contractor's wages envelopes the amount stated on the outside did not correspond with the amount contained inside, but because he had got the subsidy beforehand no redress could be obtained.  I suggest that there is some leakage there, and that some tightening up should take place.  That man is undoubtedly a fraud on the Government, and he is a fraud on the worker. If he enters into a contract on conditions laid down by the Government which are in conformity with the local conditions as observed by the trades unions, I submit that he has no right to enter into separate conditions with an individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton was speaking on this amendment when progress was reported yesterday.  I do not think it is one that could be or should be accepted.  The purpose of Part III of the Bill is to restrict working hours in shops.  It is proposed to institute a 48-hour week as the normal working week for shop assistants.  It is, however, intended to provide that a maximum of 11 hours in any one day may be worked.  It is, of course, obviously impossible to work 11 hours per day regularly if a 48-hour week is to be observed, but in the circumstances existing in shops it is necessary to allow a certain elasticity to deal with the conditions of particular trades.  I think Deputy Norton was speaking with certain well-known types of shops in mind, but he must remember that in the section we are setting down a maximum working day that will apply to all shops in all parts of the country at all times of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what this sub-section is intended to do.  It is not framed to determine what the normal working day will be, but to fix an over-riding maximum which will apply generally; that is, a maximum of 11 hours per day.  Whether it is a day during the Christmas season or a fair day or market day in a country town, or whether it is any other special occasion upon which exceptional trading conditions might operate or not, that over-riding maximum will operate.  That is what this sub-section is intended to provide, and to reduce that over-riding <Col N="2500" /> maximum to 9 would be, I think, a mistake and it would impose undue and unnecessary restrictions upon the conduct of a retail business in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that the Conditions of Employment Act of 1936 provided for a maximum day of 9 hours.  It did, but it also provided for an overtime period of 2 hours. There is no comparison between industrial conditions and retail trading conditions.  Industrial conditions can be organised on a regular basis.  The circumstances under which retail trading is carried on must allow for a considerable fluctuation as between one day and another and one season of the year and another and, consequently, any reference to the provisions of the 1936 Act are of very little value as an argument.  I think the period of 11 hours is reasonable, bearing in mind that it is an over-riding maximum and it could not under any circumstances become the normal working day, having regard to the other provisions of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's viewpoint, because this 11-hour day is not going to happen twice a week.  It would not be to the advantage of the employer to endeavour to work it in twice a week.  If an assistant works 11 hours one day, the working day is cut down at other times. I wonder if 9 were substituted for 11 how it would work in a country town on a fair day?  I wonder has Deputy Norton ever been in a country town on a fair day?</P>

      <P>I would imagine not, seeing that he has put down an amendment of this sort.  The conditions of a country town on a fair day are well known to most Deputies. On an ordinary day a country town usually gets alive and the places are open for business at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, but on a fair day the business element of the town are wide awake and astir even at 4 o'clock.  As a rule, the public-houses open at 7 o'clock.  They get special exemptions because it is a particular day.  If the <Col N="2501" /> assistant works for a very long time that day&mdash;and the assistants do&mdash;what is the result?  I wonder has Deputy Norton ever been in a country town the day after a fair?  If you go into a country town the day after a big fair&mdash;I have attended fairs with very considerable frequency and I have often been in the town on the next day and I know the conditions&mdash;you will find practically the whole town asleep at 12 o'clock.  There is scarcely anyone on the streets.</P>

      <P>I was not conscious of it having that rigid effect, but assuming it had, the shop is not compelled to close after 9 hours, and the situation which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney envisages is one which can be met by an adjustment of staff.  It is not suggested that this amendment will have the effect of preventing shops opening and dealing with customers. That matter would be dealt with in legislation relating to hours of trading.  The amendment would not have the effect of closing a shop.  It is still possible for the shop to serve customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When you come to deal with whether a staff should work hard or whether the staff should work for a reasonable period, I think you have to strike some sort of a reasonable level, and I believe a maximum working day of 9 hours ought to be adequate.  After all, in respect of industrial employment&mdash;and &ldquo;industrial employment&rdquo; has a pretty wide definition in the Conditions of Employment Act&mdash;the maximum working day is 9 hours.  If we fix 9 hours as the maximum working day for all the categories of workers dealt with in the Conditions of Employment Act, I do not think it is unreasonable to fix a maximum of 9 hours in respect of shop workers.  If the number of hours under this section be reduced from 11 to 9, the shop worker can be employed up to a maximum of 54 <Col N="2503" /> hours per week&mdash;48 hours normally and 6 hours' overtime whereas, under the Minister's provision, it is possible for a worker to be employed for 11 hours on any one day and 60 hours in any one week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be 60 hours for quite a substantial period of the year when you take into consideration the half-days off, the holidays and bank holidays.  Taking these into consideration, the worker could be employed for 60 hours during a substantial period of the year.  That is too long.  I think that we ought to fix a maximum of 9 hours per day, which would make possible a working week of 54 hours. Is there any situation in the ordinary retail trade which makes a maximum working week of 54 hours, including overtime, unduly short?  I do not think there is.  There is not much fluctuation of traffic in ordinary retail premises.  There are certain fluctuations at certain odd times of the year. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that the fair is a problem which has to be dealt with.  On another motion&mdash; perhaps one dealing with the economic war&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would tell us that there are no fairs now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said the retail trade.  There is no contingency which could not be budgeted for within that reasonable margin; and a 54-hour week and a 9-hour day is sufficiently long without extension to 11 hours. We have already recognised the principle of a maximum working day of 9 hours, and I think we ought to recognise the same principle in this Bill. When a worker is required to work 11 hours, he has virtually no social existence on that day, because, during that time, he must be at the disposal of the employer.  It is possible for the worker under this section to be required to attend at 9 o'clock in the morning and not to be away from the employer's premises until 9.30 at night. That is an inordinately long day, and I do not think the Minister should permit a worker to be employed for that period.  A maximum working day of 9 hours would result in the worker being at the disposal of the employer for approximately 10 hours, having regard to the fact that an hour of the 10 hours would be spent in having a meal, on the premises or off the premises.  That time is of no great social value to the worker.  If the time in the Bill is adhered to, it will mean that the worker will be at the disposal of the employer for 12½ hours on certain days.  Would the Minister say whether he would be prepared to meet the subject matter of the amendment to some extent?</P>

      <P>What we are fixing is an overriding maximum which will apply in respect of all shops at all times, irrespective of whether the worker is employed on normal work or on overtime.  I think that a maximum of 11 hours is quite reasonable.  I could conceive traders arguing that even that period was unduly restricted. Deputy Norton has spoken as if we were contemplating that the normal working day would be one of 11 hours. The section does not deal with a normal working day.  It deals with the abnormal period that arises in every trade in every part of the country, and it says that, even in these abnormal periods, no matter what the circumstances, the maximum day must be one of 11 hours.  Having regard to the exceptional circumstances that arise in some trades in certain districts, some provision of that kind is necessary.  I should not be disposed to shorten the period at all.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not appreciate what the section provides. We say that the employee should ordinarily work a 48-hour week but, to meet fluctuations in business, we provide for overtime.  With overtime, the employee can work up to 60 hours a week, and a certain number of hours per month and per year&mdash;all subject to the overriding consideration that, on any one day, the maximum number of hours worked must be 11.  I think that that is quite a reasonable provision and that it would be unreasonable to restrict it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My complaint about that provision is that the worker's hours may be so adjusted that, for two or three days a week, he may be required to work inordinately long hours.  I appreciate the difficulty that has to be met in the case of seaside and holiday resorts but why permit an employer to employ a worker up to 11 hours on any one day in a place where an emergency of that kind does not exist and has not to be provided for?</P>

      <P>What will happen, I fear, is that workers will be kept on for long hours towards the end of the week, and will have short days, or divided attendances, in the other portions of the week, and that will be an objectionable arrangement.  Suppose an employer were to say to a worker under this section: &ldquo;I am permitted to employ you up to a maximum of <Col N="2507" /> 11 hours in one day.  I will bring you in on Monday morning for a couple of hours, book you off and bring you back in the evening; I will do the same on Tuesday, and on Wednesday you will have a half-day; on Thursday, I will employ you for 10 hours, and on Friday and Saturday for 11 hours.&rdquo;  A working week made up that way would be most irksome from the point of view of the employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be most irksome for anybody.  There may be some exceptional trades in which such circumstances might be practicable, but if there are, we have to provide for the circumstances of these exceptional trades.  I have in mind one type of worker who works exceptionally long hours per day, but he gets these long hours compensated for by whole days off.  I have in mind a certain class of worker who works from early in the morning to late at night. It is not a particularly heavy type of work, but he gets one day off in four. In quite a number of unusual kinds of occupations and trades, exceptional conditions will exist and provision must be made for these exceptional conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 51.  I should like the Minister to consider his own words because I think he has himself shown that in a Bill like this, there must be a certain amount of flexibility.  The Minister last night referred to a messenger boy arriving half-way up a street at quitting time and then knocking off. Similarly, in a refreshment house, you do not want to have a situation in which a customer is being served with the soup and his meal stopping there because the maximum hours have expired.  If the Minister looks into it, he will see that refreshment houses require a consideration quite different from that required by other forms of trading.  Undoubtedly, workers in this trade have to work long hours, but there are periods when they are not serving at all.  It is not like a retail shop where the assistants are kept going by customers coming in from time to time.  The Minister should consider that, after all, people require to eat and drink, and unless he is going to say to the general public: &ldquo;Between certain hours, you cannot have a cup of tea or a meal,&rdquo; he should examine how far he can extend the flexibility of the conditions applying to the catering trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 18&mdash;and what I have to say is more or less in connection with Deputy Norton's amendment with which we have just dealt&mdash; you have in that section a normal working week of 48 hours and then you have 11 hours in one day, 60 hours in a week, 228 hours in four weeks and so much in the year.  Most employers, I think, do not approve of overtime. It is not economic and it has been demonstrated many times that an employer who employs four employees to do the work of five employees, working them on a basis of 25 per cent. <Col N="2510" /> overtime, is at a disadvantage in every respect.  That is admitted by the employers.  Employers look on overtime as a necessary evil.  It has to be worked from time to time and it is largely co-ordinating.  A great number of employees are working only 44 hours, but take the case of a staff working 48 hours a week.  What are they working?  Probably 8½ hours a day on 5 days, making 42½ hours, and then 5½ hours on Saturday.  The proprietor sees emergency work piling up.  He does not think he will tackle it on Monday evening, it is a little worse on Tuesday, and he then says: &ldquo;I will have to clear this up; we will have to stop in on Wednesday evening.&rdquo;  His normal day is 8½ hours.  What is in front of him?  The usual thing for an employer to say is: &ldquo;We do not want to keep the people in more than we can help and if we work half-an-hour one day, it will clear off all the arrears for the week.&rdquo;  That will bring him up to 12 hours and a fraction on a single day.  I want to stress that the Minister is making it impossible for any retail trader ever to work one and a half days in a day.</P>

I wish to say that the refreshment houses should really be in a more flexible position than other traders.

      <P>Yes.  The amendments were prepared hurriedly, and I am in the Minister's hands as to how far he is prepared to make special provision for refreshment businesses. From some remarks he made last night, he realises that refreshment businesses are not on all-fours with the position of ordinary traders. I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendments if he would care to consider representations with a view to getting something that will satisfy the Minister and provide that the hours at which the ordinary public can get refreshments will not be unduly restricted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister how he proposes to deal with seasonal business, with special reference to districts that cater for tourists.  In my constituency surrounding Cork Harbour, a very large number of people cater for tourists and for those whose health necessitates spending a certain time at the seaside. These places, of necessity, must have long hours for business.  The traders are in a small way, and as their profits are seasonable, if the business hours are not long, probably they would not be able to cater for their patrons.  How does the Minister propose to deal with cases of that kind if the hours of business are restricted? The present proposals would practically mean doubling the number of employees, having two people where one did before, but the business might not be able to afford that expense. That would simply mean that that kind of business would have to shut down, or there would be fewer businesses on a larger scale.  Perhaps the Minister could give some indication as to how he would dispose of a problem of that kind.  It is one of considerable importance to a large number of people, and affects an industry in which the Minister is also interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite see the relationship between Deputy Dockrell's amendments and his remarks as <Col N="2512" /> to the desirability of having more flexible regulations applied to refreshment houses than to ordinary shops. The Deputy referred to the possibility of a waiter serving a customer with soup, and then deciding that his hours of work had expired, and knocking off, leaving the diner without the rest of his dinner.  That situation could arise whether the waiter's hours of work are 48 a week, as is provided here, or 56 or 60 hours a week as provided in one amendment.  The only point that arises on that amendment is whether the hours of work during which persons are employed in refreshment houses should be 48 or 56 in the week. The Deputy proposes 56 hours in the case of Dublin and 60 hours in areas outside Dublin.  It is difficult to know on what ground that proposal is made. I do not see that we can make any distinction between the work involved in refreshment houses and the work involved in ordinary shops.  In respect of a certain class of refreshment-house work, it could be said that it is more onerous or even more unpleasant than other forms of shop work.  It is, of course, recognised that the main difference between &ldquo;refreshment house&rdquo; as defined in the Bill and the ordinary shop is that in the case of the ordinary shop it will be the practice of the proprietor to make the hours of trading coincide with the hours of employment.  If the employment of assistants is confined to 48 hours in the week, the hours of trading will, in practice, be 48 hours, whereas in the case of refreshment houses much longer hours of trading are not merely the practice but are desirable.  I do not know that there would be any general approval of the idea to restrict unduly the hours of trading in refreshment houses, certainly refreshment houses of the kind that cater for tourists, to which Deputy Brasier referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be recognised, however, that the principal class of persons affected by Deputy Dockrell's amendment are persons employed in licensed premises.  It is true that the amendment affects hotels, refreshment houses, cafes and tea-rooms, but from the point of view of number, I should imagine that employees in licensed <Col N="2513" /> premises are the principal class concerned. At the present time they have in Dublin an agreement with their employers, an agreement which, I understand, is enforced by a very strong trade union organisation, limiting their hours of work to 56 in the week, but the hours of trading permitted by law are, of course, considerably longer than 56, and the employers had to adjust their arrangements so as to enable their staff to be disemployed at times when their houses were open for business.  I do not see that it is going to constitute any considerable difficulty for them to adapt themselves to the circumstances that will arise when the 48 hours becomes law.  It may involve, in the case of some of the larger houses, the employment of additional staff, if not on a whole-time basis, at least on some basis which will enable the full complement of assistants to be there when required.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that certain discussions have taken place between the trades unions concerned and the representatives of the employers to see how arrangements to that end might be made.  In rural districts I do not imagine that there would be very great difficulty in operating the 48-hour week, having regard to the other provisions of the Bill, because in licensed houses it is very rarely the case that business is brisk all the day round, and each day of the week.  In most licensed premises there are certain times, or special days in the week, when the services of an assistant are required, and the employers will have little difficulty in fulfilling the law in relation to the hours of employment of an assistant and, at the same time, securing the services of an assistant when the circumstances of the business call for it.</P>
    <P>Now, in relation to restaurants and hotels, I think the same circumstances arise.  We will have to make certain modifications in Section 19, which deals with spells of employment, in order to meet the circumstances of hotel waiters and similar employees who are, in fact, ordinarily employed in spells.  They are employed for the breakfast period and then have a period off before lunch, and another <Col N="2514" /> period off before dinner.  In relation to this class of worker also there should, I think, be no difficulty in adopting a 48-hour week.  Certainly, many classes of hotel workers are more urgently in need of the protection of legislation of this kind than shop assistants or other persons affected by the Bill, because some of them work exceptionally long hours and are paid at exceptionally low rates.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Dockrell has made any case for the amendment, nor do I think there is a case for putting the workers in those premises in a different position, in respect of the maximum hours worked, from persons employed in retail shops.  I gave the matter consideration.  There was a natural temptation for me to leave the licensed trade outside the scope of this measure because the licensed trade, in respect of hours worked and conditions of employment, has already been the subject of legislation.  That legislation is administered by another Department of State, so I thought I might have a good alibi if I left the trade out of this Bill.  Their hours of work, right to, holidays and certain other provisions, were all fixed by statute as far back as 1912 or 1913. Consequently, I might have been justified in leaving the trade outside the scope of this measure altogether, but I felt that it would be difficult to defend that, however plausible the arguments that one might produce, seeing that we were instituting the general practice of a 48-hour week for workers employed in retail distribution. I should require much stronger arguments than any I have heard, either from Deputy Dockrell or from organisations of employers who have made representations to me on the matter, before I would be prepared to make any exception to that rule.</P>

      <P>I know, but they are a different proposition altogether.  I am dealing now with hotels and with houses the major portion of whose business is the providing of food even though some are licensed and some are not.  The amendment that I would like to see the Minister accepting is No. 51, though I fear from the remarks that fell from him last night that he will not accept it.  I can quite understand that there are persons in hotels who are overworked.  I am completely in agreement with the Minister in saying that that ought not be allowed to continue.  What I want to see is, how this legislation is going to affect work in hotels.  Suppose that you stop in a country hotel. There is the hotel boots.  He is the first up in the morning and the last to retire at night.  On occasions he may be only able to get two or three hours' sleep, and then he is at it the whole day long.  That seems to me to be an impossible life.  My difficulty in speaking on this is that the Minister has not yet made up his mind as to what class of hotel servants this measure shall apply to, and what class of attendants in restaurants it shall apply to: as to whether it applies merely to waiters and waitresses or to cooks and people who work in the kitchen.  Whether it applies to hall porters we are not clear.  Our difficulty is that the Minister has not yet made up his mind.  We will not know his attitude on this until we see it expressed on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there will be great difficulty in carrying this out in refreshment houses.  Let me take the example that I was dealing with a moment ago&mdash;the hotel boots.  I imagine that his wages are practically nil.  He lives on his tips.  Then you have the case of the waiter.  Looking at it not merely from the customer's point of view but from the waiter's point of view, it would be very unpleasant if you had, say, a half-dozen people dining in a hotel, if the waiter who was expecting to get a tip from them had to leave after serving the <Col N="2516" /> joint because if he remained a minute longer he would be committing an offence.  Waiter No. 2 comes along with the sweet.  That is the only service he renders the diners, and he presents them with the bill.  That certainly puts waiter No. 1 in a very unpleasant position.  He goes away and he gets no tip.  We all know that in hotels and restaurants the tips the waiter receives are, at least, twice as valuable as the wage he gets.  I wonder how is this going to hit those hotel servants.  I should imagine that it is going to reduce their income seriously.  I think that in a great number of instances it will work out very unfairly.  For that reason I think that the whole of this hotel business should be considered and legislated for by itself.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that the licensing business and the restaurant business cannot be legislated for in the same measure.  They need to be treated on a different basis.  In the case of the hotels it will certainly be very hard on the waiter who attends at lunch and dinner if he has to leave before the meal is over, and in that way lose his tip.  I do not know that the hotel and the draper's shop have anything in common, or that they can be dealt with in common.  If the hotel and restaurant business is to be successfully carried on, it seems to me that you must allow the workers who are in touch with the customers a fair deal. The legislation dealing with them will have to be conceived in a different way from the Bill before us.  I am afraid that if this legislation goes through, unamended, you will have a number of the smaller hotels shutting down.  That would be very disadvantageous for the country.  On some days the hotels are very busy, and on others very little business is doing.  On the occasion of a wedding breakfast, for instance, a great number of waiters are employed, but as against that you have days when there is little or nothing for them to do.  It seems to me that the whole problem is quite different, as I said, from the problem of the retail shop, and that you cannot run a restaurant on the same lines as a retail shop.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to think that I had the licensed trade more in my mind than any other section of the catering trade in my remarks. That was not so.  I want to bring to the Minister's attention a certain class or section of the catering trade that I had in mind, and I do not know whether the Minister will agree that it is a more difficult problem than that which is concerned with the licensed trade, because it seems to me that, with organisations on each side such as they have, they can very well look after themselves. The point I want to make, however, is that it seems to me that the position of a hotel in the winter time which has a dance practically every night is a very different proposition.  It seems to me that that is a really serious problem, because such hotels have big and expensive premises and they have to keep large stocks and to provide <Col N="2518" /> expensive foods and drinks which they have to have under the supervision of responsible members of their staffs. Now, that is not a case into which you can bring casual workers.  I quite agree that it would be absurd, for instance, for somebody who is washing up dishes all day long, or doing some such work as that, to be expected to work these longer hours; but it seems to me that, where you have got a big and expensive establishment, which has to keep open for just one particular class of their trade, for perhaps one hour of the day&mdash;such as a hotel&mdash; early in the morning, and then has to keep open for a dance later that night, there should be a greater amount of flexibility allowed in cases of that kind.  It seems to me that, if there is not a greater amount of flexibility allowed in such cases, there will be a grave danger that such people will find that they will not be able to cater for that particular class of business, and that they will find themselves in the position that that class of business will have been killed by certain legislative enactments.  Now, I do not want to see the worker having to work unduly long hours, because I do not approve of that, either from the physical or the moral point of view, but I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he could see how far we could go to meet the special conditions of the catering trade.</P>

For instance, if a hotel organises a dance, which may go on to a late hour in the night or until early in the morning, and desires to have the staff that has been employed during the day to remain on in service during the period of that dance, then I say that the staffs so employed at that dance are entitled to payment for overtime work&mdash;unless the dance is a regular feature of the hotel work, in which case I think a special staff should be employed; and I think that, in such a case, it would be unreasonable to expect the day staff to do that kind of work regularly, especially when we consider this <Col N="2519" /> maximum with regard to hours that has been fixed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Chair is correct.  The idea of this is to exclude the application of sub-section (5) of Section I from sub-section (3)  of the same section.  I think that is the general head.  Under sub-section (1) it is provided that there shall be, generally speaking, a 48-hour week, and that is in sub-section (2).  Now it goes on, in sub-section (3), to state that, subject to certain conditions, there shall be a certain amount of work, not to exceed a certain limited number of hours in each week.  That is perfectly correct.  It provides for overtime rates in the usual way, but if sub-section (5) is let in&mdash;the portion where the Minister reserves the right to amend any of the provisions in this Bill relating to hours&mdash;the Minister can amend in sub-section (3) the number of hours a week, and he can have that 60 hours treated as ordinary working hours, thereby depriving the employee of overtime rates.  You could amend sub-section (3) by this clause and you could say that the employee is to work those 60 hours, thereby depriving the <Col N="2520" /> employee from being paid overtime rates and saying that he would be only paid as for ordinary working hours.  I think that the only way this can be remedied is by means of this amendment.  If it were to be confined to this sub-section, it would mean the stopping of the Minister from being able to increase the number of hours to 60 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what the Deputy is getting at, although I think he would get the same result by proposing to remove the sub-section out of the section altogether, because the sole purpose of sub-section (5) is to give power, by order, to amend or extend the maximum hours of work set out in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of the section.  It is desirable, and I speak now from experience of other legislation of this kind, to have powers to deal with the special circumstances that are bound to arise in special trades.  We provide here a safeguard that before action can be taken on sub-section (5) there must be consultation with representatives of the employers and members of the staffs of the shops likely to be affected by the order.  We have these consultations regularly under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, before various orders are made modifying the application of the Act to different trades or under special circumstances. It is necessary to have that.</P>
      <P>There are some trades in respect of which perfectly normal hours may be worked day in and day out the whole year round.  There are other trades where the whole business of the year may be concentrated in a very short period, in respect of which some modification of the provisions of the section may be regarded as reasonable by everybody concerned, including the employees.  It has, in fact, been our experience under the Conditions of Employment Act that where reasonable grounds for modification of the provisions in respect of special trades or occupations existed, application for such modification came as often from the employees as from the employers. In any event, the assent of representatives of the employees was usually forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> In relation to this section of the Bill I think we should have the same powers of modification.  I do not contemplate they will be used very frequently; but, if some special circumstance arose, such as an occasion which brought very large crowds for a very long period to some centre, suppose, for instance, this Bill had been in operation on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress in 1932, there should be some provision to modify the section so as to permit longer hours of work being adopted in these circumstances, wherever required.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  I assume with reasonable certainty from past experience that we will have representations from some trade, the circumstances of which were not perhaps even thought of, and the circumstances of which we were not aware of, for which some special provisions will have to be made.  We had these general powers of extension under the Conditions of Employment Act, and they have had to be used fairly extensively. A very large number of exemption orders have been made, and unless they had been made, the Act would have operated to prevent certain industries being carried on at all.  It is in contemplation of similar circumstances arising in relation to some retail trade that similar powers are being taken under this section where the hours of work are concerned.  It is a sort of a general safeguard to enable us to deal with circumstances which we have not foreseen or which may arise in relation to a particular trade or district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy McGowan is that, while an emergency may develop, and while it may be considered desirable that an emergency should be met, it should not be met in such a way that workers should be required to work in excess of 48 hours without receiving overtime payment for attendance beyond 48 hours.  The Minister may think it desirable in a special event to permit an employer or employers in a particular area to work, let us say, 72 hours a week every fortnight or three weeks on some special emergency. Deputy McGowan's point is that, if the employer is permitted to work in excess of 48 hours, which is the normal working week, and in excess of 60 hours, which is the normal maximum for ordinary work plus overtime, any portion of the attendance beyond 48 hours should be at overtime rate.  In other words, that if you permit an employer to work his staff beyond 48 hours, you should in any case provide that such attendance as exceeds 48 hours should be at overtime rate.  He is not quarrelling with the provision for granting exemptions in certain circumstances, but he wants to make sure that, where a worker works for more than 48 hours in any of these emergencies, he should be entitled to the overtime rate provided for in sub-section (4).  Will the Minister undertake to meet that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to have the wider power.  The Deputy may be assured that the provision for consultation will prevent the power being used recklessly or injudiciously in any circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister contemplate granting permission to an employer to employ persons in excess of 48 hours without payment of overtime for the excess over the 48 hours? The Bill lays down a general principle of a 48-hour week with certain exceptions. There may be overtime up to 60 hours per week, and in sub-section (5) of Section 18 there is provision for exceptions beyond that.  The cardinal principle of the Bill is a maximum working week of 48 hours.  If we give exemptions beyond 48 or 60 hours, the right of the worker to overtime payment, <Col N="2523" /> when the 48 hours is exceeded, should be preserved, otherwise you do violence to one of the main principles in the Bill.  Will the Minister undertake to look into that?  It is easy to meet the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (5) has power which is preserved still with reference to sub-section (3), except in this one particular connection.  In time to come, a Minister might be dishonest enough to amend that section, according to his powers under sub-section (5), to mean that they could work up to 60 hours and perhaps beyond it.  It is quite possible that they would be ordinary working hours for which a man would not get overtime. Even if this is put in, &ldquo;save as otherwise provided by this sub-section shall not work more than 48 hours per week,&rdquo; he still preserves all his other powers to amend the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of a case which might arise where you will get, perhaps, an agreement between workers and an employer under which they will work, say, a 48-hour week for a number of weeks and a 52-hour week for a corresponding number of weeks, the arrangement providing that the over-all maximum would not be more than an average of 48 hours. You might well get that arrangement entered into, and I would not like to see ourselves in a position in which we could not implement it, if we were satisfied that it was desirable to implement it.  We have had so many cases of that kind under the Conditions of Employment Act that I feel certain that similar cases will arise here, even though they will not be so many, because the circumstances of industry are more complicated than the circumstances of retail distribution.  I have the feeling that some cases may arise, and it is desirable to have the possibility of hours longer than 48 hours being recognised for exceptional kinds of trades, in exceptional seasons, where it has been the ordinary practice so to do, or where the carrying on of the trade would be prevented otherwise. <Col N="2524" /> The overtime provision which is there is intended by me to discourage the working of overtime.  I would feel that this Bill was a failure if it operated merely to secure that shop assistants should get more remuneration but continued to work the same hours, that is, hours in excess of 48, and that the only effect of the Bill was that while they did continue to work the same hours in excess of 48, they were paid more overtime.  If that were the result, I should regret it. The provision was intended to operate so that in fact overtime would not be worked.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil deplores the lowering of the standard of living of the community by Government action through the operation of taxes, levies, duties and like impositions on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, and is of opinion that all such impositions should be forthwith abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable time has elapsed, owing to pressure of Government business, since we last debated this motion.  Various opinions seem to have come from members of the House as to the reasons for the remarkable increase in the cost of living.  Tariffs have been blamed for it; taxation and the various expenses which fall on the working community have been blamed, <Col N="2525" /> but I think the villain of the piece in this debate has been the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In 1932 he had a plan and, in pursuance of that plan, he embarked upon a remarkable scheme of tariffs or imports on almost every article that was imported into this country.  In fact, the difficulty we had in arriving at any decision on this matter was to find the particular article that was not taxed.  We must give the Minister, at any rate, the merit of honesty in carrying out his policy.  He put a tariff on every article he could possibly think of and, if it was not effective in achieving its object as a protective tariff, it had, in his view, the merit of adding to the revenue of the country.  The fact that we are at present collecting over £11,000,000 at the ports is an indication that, at any rate, the policy of high protective tariffs has not been as successful as was anticipated.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister for Industry and Commerce found it necessary in Cork to warn those industrialists who were not satisfied with a small profit. He found it necessary to warn them that they would be dealt with drastically. He tells us that &ldquo;the greatest danger to the present industrial revival comes from a minority of manufacturers who are cashing in to an undue extent upon protection&rdquo; He admits further that &ldquo;the one thing that may produce a public reaction against the idea of developing our native industrial resources is any failure on the part of industrialists to give the public a fair deal&rdquo; It must be the aim, he says, of our manufacturers to produce articles as good and as cheap as any that can be imported. That is practically an admission that the Control of Prices Bill has not been as effective as was anticipated.  The very fact that the Minister thought it necessary to give that warning to industrialists was an admission on his part that the policy of protective tariffs had a tendency to increase prices and to increase them to an inordinate extent, beyond the capacity of the people to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When questioned the other day, the Minister said that five licences had been given to boot manufacturers to come over here to manufacture boots <Col N="2526" /> and to take advantage of the protective tariffs which had been imposed for the benefit of industrialists in this country.  I can remember paying a visit to Messrs.  Dwyer's of Cork at the Lee Boot Factory, and there is no question at all about it, the Lee Boot Factory and the Hanover Factory are as efficient as you could make them. At that time they were of opinion that a tariff of 15 per cent. on boots would give a very powerful impetus to their industry.  It was not the desire of such manufacturers to have a very drastic increase, as such an increase would bring industrialists from England to open here, and the fact that the Minister has given these five licences proves very conclusively that, under the policy of high protective tariffs, we are simply giving employment to foreigners instead of to our own nationals.</P>
    <P>One thing the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been careful not to do, is to put a tariff on the raw materials for industry.  He has not been as careful in that respect in regard to agriculture with the result that every form of implement connected with agriculture is highly tariffed.  Manures, which are a very much needed adjunct to agriculture, have also been tariffed.  So have feeding stuffs.  In fact, a very large proportion of the needs of production for farmers has been tariffed with the inevitable result that they cannot produce at a profit without increased prices.  Naturally, the competition of other countries in the agricultural sphere is able to keep these prices down.  Therefore, the farmer is the one man who has not benefited in any way from protective tariffs while he is seriously affected by the material increase in the cost of living which has imposed such a blow on our community.</P>
    <P>I have here a cutting from the <i>Evening Herald</i> headed &ldquo;Soaring Cost of Living&mdash;Bonus Rise for Civil Servants.&rdquo; The cutting states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Higher and higher soars the cost of living.  The index figure mounted 14 points in the mid-August period since 1935; 15 points in the mid-November period during the same time, according to tabulations issued <Col N="2527" /> last night.  Smoked bacon advanced by 3/- per cwt. this week; best rashers now sell at 2/- per lb. in Dublin.  It is an ill-wind that doesn't blow some body some good, and so</P>
    <P>civil servants, in the light of the current mathematics, are to get a</P>
    <P>bonus which works out at 2/6 per week on a basic salary of £4 per week. Since the mid-August tabulation this year, living costs soared seven points. Then the index was 170; in last night's official announcement 177 was the index for mid-November.  Therefore, the average living cost for six months was 173½.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is the position with regard to civil servants.  The same thing prevails with regard to those who are employed by local authorities, and local authorities have had very serious demands on their purse by almost every class of their employees for an increase in salaries based on the fact that the cost of living has materially gone up.  We had an extraordinary position at the South Cork Board of Assistance, where a large number of persons were refused increases in salary, and the only man whose salary there was an attempt to increase was a wealthy landowner.  He owns about half the village of Douglas and is the possessor of a licensed house.  That man was paid £100 for cleaning the sewers of Douglas village, which, needless to say, he did not do himself, but employed a man to do.  A suggestion to increase his salary by £10 a year was proposed by Deputy Corry and lost by my casting vote.  I am very pleased to say that, because he was the only man whose salary it was suggested to increase.  Those are people who are making that same demand based on the cost of living.  It has not been denied by Deputies in this House that the cost of living has advanced.  The only excuse, in their opinion, is that the standard of living has increased.  That is a very debatable point.  It certainly has not increased amongst the farming community, and I do not think it has increased amongst the agricultural labourers.  Those two classes, at any rate, are suffering very severely from <Col N="2528" /> the disabilities and impositions that affect the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The South Cork Board of Public Assistance has had to increase its estimate for public assistance by £3,000, although the number of applicants for public assistance is down by 1,000. That is based entirely on the estimates of the superintendent assistance officers that the cost of living has gone up, and it required such an increase in the assistance in order to enable the poor to get even anything like a living out of the miserable pittance that is given under the administration of public assistance.  That is a state of affairs which is not indicative of the high state of prosperity that is claimed for this country.  The amount would probably be very much higher still were it not for the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, which has to a certain extent relieved the boards of public assistance, but the present condition of affairs has meant stronger demands on the estimates of those boards.  As I said, the South Cork Board of Health have had to increase their estimates, although the number who are in receipt of public assistance is down by over 1,000.  An amazing statement was made by a worker to myself, that the cost of living did not matter very much, because with every point of increase in the cost of living an increase in wages was demanded and obtained.  If the increase in wages is going to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living, we are going to arrive at a stage when the workers themselves will be affected by that. They will be in the position of taking in each other's washing, and their natural all-round drift must of itself have some influence on the cost of living in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the burdens to which I have to draw your attention, Sir, is the ever-increasing volume of rates.  Deputy Brennan asked a question about the amount of rates collectible in the various county council areas all over the Irish Free State.  The amount shows a very drastic rise.  I think if the Minister for Local Government were here&mdash;because the amounts of the estimates for the county councils are <Col N="2529" /> mandatory and have to be passed whether they like it or not&mdash;he would probably admit that the rates are likely to go up more and more as time goes on.  We were promised derating in 1932, but we did not get it, and we are still bearing the imposition of an ever-increasing rate on a partial system of taxation, that is a system of taxation based on the poor law valuation of agricultural land. Although we may get certain grades of relief, nevertheless that burden is ever-increasing as time goes on.  That is the position in which the farmer is to-day.  He is the largest section of the community.  His purchasing power is very considerably reduced.  I do not want to dwell too much on this point, because we have laboured it so much, but the penal tariffs deducted from his cattle exports have meant that a sum of £5,000,000 is taken off the price of his cattle.  It means that those who are raisers of live stock have to bear the burden of the retention of the land annuities in this country; they have to bear the burden for those who do not raise cattle and export them.  In other words, the man who sells new milk, and does not raise calves, is in the position that he is not bearing that burden to any great extent, except in so far as a few pigs or any other exportable produce he may raise are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has become an ever-increasing difficulty for the farmer to pay his rates.  In the Cork County Council&mdash; those county councillors who are present will bear me out&mdash;we have had to discontinue the services of rate collectors, and place the collection of the rates in the hands of an officer collector, who probably has more drastic powers than the ordinary rate collector.  With regard to the labourers, we are building cottages for them, for which we are charging 1/- a week.  We are not able to collect that 1/- a week.  Four collectors, I think, were dispensed with on the proposal of Deputy Corry, and there were two of them who absolutely refused to go back.  We have it here in the reports of the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> which I will not weary the House by reading, that those men would not accept their <Col N="2530" /> old positions, simply because they said they would have to resort to eviction if they did.  On that account they refused to accept their positions back again.  That is an indication as to what is the position of the labouring man.</P>

We are paying £5,000,000 to England by way of penal tariffs. The Minister did not tell us the acreage in regard to wheat and that two and a half or three barrels represent the average yield.  The highest average yield in our neighbourhood is four and a half barrels.  All that is supposed to be a welcome boon to the farmers of this country.  They have to be content with that, although they have to pay out £5,000,000 as penal tariffs on cattle.</P>

Cattle from one to two years fetched £11 17s. 6d. in 1931, and this year in the corresponding period they fetched £8 16s. 0d. per head, or £3 per head less.  Cattle two years old were quoted at £15 in 1931, and this year the price was £12 4s. 2d. We are thankful that the price did not fall more than £3 a head.  What the Minister forgot to mention is that two years ago farmers were very glad to accept anything they could possibly get for their cattle.  For two-years-old stock, as little as £2 10s. a head was given, and I am very thankful that conditions are not now so bad.</P>

      <P>When the farmers were killing calves under the Order of the Minister, you could buy them for 1/6.  That state of affairs cannot go on.  You have the workers affected. The purchasing power of the farmers has a powerful influence on the prosperity of the various country towns. If the farmer is not purchasing, the shopkeepers in country towns are poor.  They are affected by the cost of living and the workers in the towns are affected.  The rates are high and the cost of building is high and the cost of living generally has increased. We are told of the money that we get in the way of bounties and subsidies. Who are paying those bounties and subsidies?  Is it not the people who have to bear the burden?  The people have to pay every penny, and yet all these things are supposed to be a wonderful boon from the Government.</P>
      <P>The one man who should have protected the people from the imposition of tariffs is the Minister for Agriculture. He is the man who is supposed to make agriculture his special care and who should have protected the people from the taxes which have been imposed, and the increases in various directions that have been put on the agricultural community.  The labourers are unable to meet the demands made upon them.  They cannot even pay 1/- a week rent.  We have instances where the rent collectors are suspended, such as those whom Deputy Corry suspended.  Their suspension is the surest indication that the people cannot bear the burden much longer when they cannot meet the sum of 1/- for the rent of their cottages.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Corry was at one time a very stout supporter of the people who were giving old clothes.  Is the country to be much longer in the toils of this policy of despair?  As for the plan that Fianna Fáil said was going to bring prosperity, has that been carried out? We know there are cases where tariffs have worked.  They have worked with reference to some of the tariffed industries of agriculture.  The Minister referred to apples and tomatoes. There is a farm close to where I live.  It never paid as a farm, but they started to put up glasshouses by the acre simply because there was a tariff put on tomatoes.  It gave them a form of protection.  They carried on a system of horticulture, every item of which was protected by tariffs.  Tariffs have increased the cost of living, but in that instance they brought a certain amount of prosperity to the owner of that farm. He had the necessary capital to organise his horticultural industry and in that instance the tariff worked well.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that instance of prosperity there is another case, also a short distance from where I live.  It is the case of an unfortunate farmer who is worked to death because he could not pay the wage that Deputy Norton pitied the farmers for only being able to pay, that is, 24/- a week. In many cases the farmers were not able to meet 24/- a week.  This man has a young family, and he had to get rid of a workman and carry on the work on the farm as well as he could. He had to pay a tax on artificial manures.</P>
      <P>We had a case cited recently by the <i>Irish Press</i> where they tried to cast ridicule on a statement made by Deputy McGilligan.  They say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGilligan further declares that not merely is every branch of our live stock declining, but that even the soil is losing its fertility in consequence of being overworked as a result of Government policy and because of the inability of agriculturists to buy fertilisers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They go on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2534" />&ldquo;As regards the number of live stock in the country, the statement is not correct.  The true position is that the number of cattle in the country in June was higher than the average from 1922 to 1932.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down we see:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When he talks of the fertility of the soil having declined in consequence of the tillage policy of the Government he simply betrays an abysmal ignorance of the subject. Every child attending a rural elementary school knows that the effect of tillage is to give heart to the land, to improve its condition, to call forth its latent qualities and to render it more capable of giving bountiful crops.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is some of the stuff that a paper like that is trying to dope the farmers with.  I live in a tillage district and I know that tillage without animal manure very quickly exhausts the soil.  There is not a farmer here who does not know that.  Farmers engaged in the dairying industry usually have sufficient stock to provide the necessary manure for tillage.  We are not all like Deputy Corry, making £1,000 a year out of his farm.  I think he informed the House some time ago that he makes £1,000 a year out of it. If he is able to do that, he should occupy the place now occupied by the Minister for Agriculture.  I would very much like to know what his plan is.  I believe that at the moment he is the unpaid Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure we all hope he will occupy that bench soon, and perhaps then he will tell us how to make £1,000 a year out of the land.</P>

      <P>I use one of MacBride's thistle cutters every year, and I promise to lend it to the Deputy to cut the thistles on his farm. With regard to beet, 37/6 per ton, of which 7/6 goes for transport, is the price which is supposed to have replaced the lost cattle trade.  Can anything make up for the lost cattle trade?  Can that price at 37/6 from <Col N="2535" /> which 7/6 is deducted, make up for it?  Why, two tons of mangolds would be better, and would sell at a much higher price.  Yet that is the price which the Minister for Agriculture tells the farmers they ought to be so thankful for.  He told me that I had got six months, but I assure him that there are farmers in the Free State, and a very large number of them, who would like to send the Minister for Agriculture to penal servitude for life.</P>
      <P>I cannot sit down without referring to the leader of the Labour Party. His speech practically agreed, word for word, with the opinions of members on these benches.  The only thing he said which did not agree with those views&mdash;and I was sorry to hear it&mdash; was that his Party intended to vote with the Government against this motion.  Although his speech, as I read it, was in favour of the motion, he said to the Government Deputies: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil, with all your faults, I love you still.&rdquo;  We hope that that little alliance will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all ashamed of anything I do, and if I vote with the Labour Party it is because I conscientiously believe I am right in doing so.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe who drew attention to the price of the loaf. From the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; in 1932, the Government initiated the policy of growing wheat, and the farmers of the country stood up to that policy, but they were not getting the price owing to climatic conditions which the Government must surely have taken into consideration when they initiated that policy and when the operations of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were called into play to urge the country to &ldquo;Grow more wheat,&rdquo; even when that slogan went into a farmer's house, or a shop in Patrick Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That policy has been carried out by the farmers to their detriment and loss, and, while there was a time when we used to speak of the wealthy brewers' profits, to-day we have to <Col N="2536" /> speak of the wealthy millers' profits. Apparently price control has not been brought into play with regard to these.  The miller's profits are growing more and more, but they are growing at the expense of the community and of the farmer, and the farmers are not getting a return for the wheat they grow.  It is very much a seasonal crop. If the weather is favourable, they may get something like a fair crop, but more often than not, the season is dead against them.  I have no hesitation in saying that with the majority of the seasons foul, either in the spring time or in the harvest time, and against the farmer, the farmer cannot get a reasonable return, and he cannot get a reasonable price, such as the County Cork grain growers asked from the Minister and which they probably would have got were it not for the intrusion of other people.</P>
    <P>We have a right to demand that we get a reasonable price.  There is apparently no control in respect of the flour millers or of the bakers either. In this country the cost of the loaf is 1/- and it has been pointed out that it is 8½d. in London.  Deputy Briscoe said it was much better to have the price 1/- and that a man should be able to buy it, but the man in London is in employment and he is able to buy it at 8½d. and probably has something to spare for other things.  So with the workers and every class of the community here, if they had not to bear the huge impost of the cost of living. Even if the Government are collecting £11,000,000 at the ports, the taking off of that £11,000,000 of taxation would make a very great difference.  That sum represents £11,000,000 of inoperative protective tariffs.  Surely they should be taken off, and we ask the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>The unemployed in 1932 numbered 80,000.  To-day we are informed, through the medium of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, that they are up to the 100,000 mark.  That means that in spite of all the emigration, in spite of the huge plan of Fianna Fáil which was going to bring back the emigrants from other countries, put them to work here and provide them with an industry which would give them a living, the Government has failed.  In spite of <Col N="2537" /> the huge emigration to England of whole families at present, the unemployed number 100,000.  The Government policy has been a failure, and whether from the point of view of wheat, beet or the various industries that have been started, the unemployed have not been reduced in numbers but have been increased.  Every tariff on implements, every tariff on manures, on feeding stuffs, and every other disability which the farmer labours under&mdash;in spite of the £2,000,000 for wheat-is overborne by the £5,000,000 penal tariffs on the cattle and the big bonus to the coal industry.  These are things for which the Government has to answer.  It is true that we got the halved annuity, but that annuity was halved on the condition that the Government got the other half, and I do not think we are very thankful for it.  If we are to have any reduction in the number of unemployed, if we are to live in this country of ours, we must ask the Government to reduce all these imposts which are causing, as has been admitted on the other side, the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this motion quite recently Deputy Dillon (in volume 69, column 560) quoted the late Minister for Agriculture.  He said that the late Deputy Hogan, when introducing a tariff on bacon, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am introducing this tariff in order to satisfy the cods in this country.  It is a god of a tariff; it will do no good.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was a cod of a motion introduced into this House, it is the one before the House at the moment, and whatever doubts we might have had in our minds as to the sincerity of the motives which inspired the Deputies to table this motion, these doubts have been dispelled after listening to the speech which has just been delivered.  One would imagine, judging by the arguments from the Opposition Benches, that the cost of living had increased enormously during the past five years, due to <Col N="2538" /> the imposition of tariffs by the Government.</P>
    <P>They were very careful to refrain, as far as possible, from a comparison of the cost of living with the cost of living even during the years of the Cosgrave Administration when the figure was lowest.  Whenever they did make reference to these figures, they were careful to select figures which would give an untrue picture of the situation.  It has been said that you can prove anything with figures and, to a certain extent, that is true.  It is very easy to give a false impression of the cost of living by selecting certain figures which, in themselves, may be correct but the use of which may be misleading.  It is easy to select the month of one year when the cost of living was at its peak and to select a month in another year when the cost of living was at its lowest and, by thus drawing an untrue comparison, to create a false impression in the minds of the people.  A fair comparison would be the average cost-of-living figures for any two years.  I propose to take be the average cost-of-living figures for any two years.  I propose to take the figure for the lowest year of the Cosgrave Administration and the latest figure available.</P>
    <P>Nobody will dispute that the cost of living, during the period of office of the former Administration, was at its lowest in 1931.  In that year, according to the Statistical Abstract for 1937, the index figure was 92.  In 1936, the figure was 91.  Although there has been an undoubted increase in the cost-of-living index figure during the past few years, it has not yet reached even the lowest figure attained during the Cosgrave régime. Deputies were very careful, when speaking from the Opposition Benches, to refrain from pointing out that there had been a fall in the cost-of-living figure after this Government came into office.  Speaking on this motion, as reported in volume 69, page 1211, Deputy Cosgrave said that the consumption of bacon had been considerably reduced.  He said that, notwithstanding the bad times during his Administration, there was consumed in this country a total of 825,844 cwts. of bacon.  That was in <Col N="2539" /> the year 1931.  Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What was consumed in 1935? The total consumption in that year was 613,000 cwts.  The consumption is down by a quarter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far so good.  In the year 1929-30 the number of pigs consumed in this country was 482,000.  In the year 1934-35 the number consumed was 806,000.  The number of cattle consumed in 1929-30 was 122,000.  In 1934-35 the number consumed was 211,000.  That shows an increase in the number of pigs consumed of 324,000 and of cattle 89,000.</P>

      <P>The number of sheep and lambs has gone up from 504,000 in 1929-30 to 536,000 in 1934-5.  Deputy Cosgrave was very careful not to mention these figures.  The Deputy who has just sat down said that it was impossible to carry on tillage properly as the number of cattle had seriously decreased&mdash;as compared, we must assume, with the numbers here during the Cosgrave Administration.  In 1931 the total number of cattle was 4,029,084, and in 1936 the number was 4,014,035, a decrease of roughly 15,000 in a total of over 4,000,000.  There have been greater falls than that even in two consecutive years during the Cosgrave Administration, but the Deputy was very careful to abstain from any reference to those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the increase in the cost of living, that operates in both ways. I admit that an increase in the cost of living hits the consumer, but it does not at all follow that an increase in prices which brings about an increase in the cost of living does not benefit the producer&mdash;and the principal producer in this country is the agriculturist. In the <i>Trade Journal</i> for September, 1937, page 199, there is given a list of figures showing the variation in the prices of a number of commodities produced by the farmers. I shall mention but a few.  Taking the year 1932 and comparing it with 1936-7, oats increased by 20.4 per cent.; barley by 28.8 per cent.; store cattle of 9 to 12 months by 51.5 per cent., of <Col N="2540" /> 12 to 15 months by 45.7 per cent.; fat cattle of 15 months to 2 years, 8.4 per cent., sheep 43.3 per cent., and so on down along the line over a list of approximately 40 different commodities. That explains, to some extent, the increase which has taken place during the past few years.  I merely cite that to show that while an increase may affect the industrial worker, on the other hand, it brings a benefit to the agricultural producer.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that as a result of the imposition of tariffs there had been a tremendous increase in the cost of living.  The actual increase in the price of goods produced in this country since 1931 has been only 2.1 per cent.  If the arguments of the Opposition are true, the increase should be reflected, for instance, in the savings of the people.  In page 155 of the Statistical Abstract we find the approximate number of accounts in the Post Office Savings Bank to the 31st December in each year from 1929 to 1935.  The number of accounts active in 1931 was 174, and in 1935, 215. Coming to the business of the Post Office Savings Bank in each calendar year, the figures being in thousands, the number of accounts opened in 1929 was 41,852, in 1931 39,120, and in 1935 48,510.  The balances due to depositors in the Trustee Savings Banks at 20th May and 20th November in each year, 1928 to 1936, disclose that on the 20th May, 1931, the total amount was £1,194,049, and on the 20th November, 1936, £1,910,769, and so on for the various items showing the deposits of the people.  The same is true of insurance.  There has been a considerable advance, both in the number of policies issued and the sums assured during the same period.  Turning to the number of judgments, bankruptcies, etc., the same holds good. Instead of the depression and poverty that the speeches of the Opposition would lead us to believe is there, the indications seem to point to progress in the right direction.  Proceedings in bankruptcy in the High Court of Justice in each legal year 1931-32 to 1935-36 show that debtors' summonses issued in 1931 numbered 84, and in 1935-36 the figures had fallen to 77. Petitions of bankruptcy filed in 1931-32 <Col N="2541" /> numbered 51, and in 1935-36, 48. Arrangement petitions field in 1931-32 numbered 112, and fell to 61 in 1935-36. It may be said that the increased cost of living to which reference has been made was confined exclusively to this country.  Far from that being the case, as Deputies well know, if they would only be honest enough to admit it, there has been, during the past few years, an increase in the cost of living in most countries, just as there was a decrease from 1931 onwards.  After reaching the lowest stage in the slump, the cost of living figure has been mounting for the past few years.  For instance, in Great Britain, where wages are so high, according to the spokesman of the Opposition the cost of living is low.  According to the statistics the price of beef in Great Britain in 1931 was 1/3¾d. per lb. and in 1937 1/2½d.</P>

The price of mutton here in 1931 was 1/2½, and in 1937, ½.  The price of bacon here in 1931 was 1/3½, and in 1937, 1/8¼ per lb.  In Great Britain the price of bacon in 1931 was 11d., and in 1937, ?.  The price of flour here in 1931 was 1/7¾ per stone, and in 1937, 2/9¼.  In Great Britain the price of flour in 1931 was 1/10. and in 1937, 2/8½.  The price of sugar here in 1931 was 3¼d. per lb., and in 1937, 3¼d.  In Great Britain the price was 2½d. in 1931, and the same price in 1937.  I have quoted figures that are for and against me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving all the information that I have at my disposal at the moment.  I now come to another spokesman of the Party opposite.  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan is reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 5th instant as having stated at a meeting in the County Kerry &ldquo;that the Government are making bread, tea and sugar dearer, and that follows directly from Government policy.&rdquo; Deputy O'Sullivan was particularly unfortunate in selecting these three items.  I propose giving a quotation from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for September, 1937, page 189.  In the period August, 1936, to August, 1937, the increase in the price of bread is shown as 5.5 per cent.; in the case of sugar a decrease of 8.3 per cent. is shown, and of tea a decrease of 10.2 per cent. is shown.  So much for that argument. There have been so many futile arguments used by the Opposition in the <Col N="2544" /> debate on this motion that I think it would weary the House if I were to quote any more figures to refute them. Everybody knows that there is nothing in their arguments, and that this motion was put down from purely political motives: for propaganda purposes, to try to make as many people as they can believe their statements. They probably have come to the conclusion that they have only to repeat these fairy tales often enough to get people to believe them.</P>
      <P>For every fact that I have stated, I have given the reference in practically every instance.  If there is any Deputy who wants to check up my statements he can do so by looking up the references I have given and find out for himself whether I have quoted correctly or not.  Suffice to say that the cost of living, which has shown a tendency to increase during the past few years, has not yet reached even to the lowest figures that it was at during the previous Administration.  The last Administration could not prevent the collapse in prices which followed from 1929 after the financial crash in America, and, later, in England.  They could not prevent the drop in the price of commodities.  They were as powerless to prevent the catastrophic drop in prices which ensued at that time as the present Government is to prevent a slight increase in the cost of living. Their panacea for all the ills of this country is to remove all the tariffs that have been imposed, and thus throw out the many thousands of people who are in remunerative employment at the present time.  In the <i>Trade Journal</i>, from which I have quoted, it has been shown that the industrial output during the past five years has been increased by approximately 36 per cent., giving employment to large numbers of people.  If this country were to change its Government at this moment and to pursue a policy such as that outlined by the speakers from the Opposition Benches&mdash;to reverse engines&mdash;thus throwing out the large numbers of people who have found permanent employment in the new industries established by this Government, it would be a disaster of the greatest magnitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2545" /> The Opposition tell us that we have only to get rid of the tariffs imposed, but I have shown that the net result of the imposition of these tariffs has been to increase the cost of the various commodities manufactured here by 2.1 per cent.  Is it worth making the sacrifice for the sake of a reduction in the prices of these commodities of 2.1 per cent., thereby throwing out of work thousands and thousands of people to add to the large numbers at present unemployed?  Incidentally, the last speaker made a comparison between the numbers in 1932 and 1936, but he was very careful to refrain from pointing out that the whole basis upon which these statistics are founded has been, altered since the change of government, and that until this Government came into power it was impossible to give a true indication of the numbers unemployed. That is not so now, because since the change of government accurate records are being kept.  I do not intend to detain the House further. I think the motion that has been tabled is, as I said at the outset, pure nonsense, and has been put down for purely political and propaganda purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of this Party, without any inspiration from any source except their own reading of the motion, have decided to oppose and vote against it.  I am personally of the opinion&mdash;an opinion which is shared by my colleagues&mdash;that the passing and putting into effect of the motion would create a first class financial crisis in this State.  Whatever we may do, either here or outside this House, we certainly are not going to be a party to creating a crisis of that kind in the country.  I am amazed that a man of the intelligence of Deputy McGilligan should put his name to this motion.  I have long been of the opinion that he is one of the ablest men who has ever been a member of this House.  Whatever one may think of his policy or political outlook, it must be conceded that he understands the meaning of the motion. He must know perfectly well that the abolition of the taxes, levies and duties which the motion calls for would create a first class financial <Col N="2546" /> crisis.  I can understand political opponents of the Government using a type of propaganda calculated to destroy them politically, but I cannot understand the mentality of intelligent men who will allow themselves to be carried so far that, instead of attempting to destroy their political opponents, they will attempt to destroy their country&mdash;the State itself&mdash; which they are here to protect and safeguard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey's name is also to the motion, and he to a lesser extent understands the meaning of it.  It seems to me that the motion is one which must have been drafted in the offices of the Fine Gael Party and not in the Party's room in this House by the responsible and intelligent people who are the leaders of that Party.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, this motion, if passed, would have the immediate effect of destroying some of the first class industries established in this State not only by the Fianna Fáil Party since they came into office, but some of them by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what effect would the abolition of all taxes, levies and duties have on the future of the sugar-beet industry.  Would Deputy Brooke Brasier take responsibility for abolishing those levies and duties and thereby wipe out the beet factory in Mallow? If the Deputy decided to take a decision of that kind, then I think he should be held answerable to the people who sent him here.  He admitted at the close of his speech that there were some industries&mdash;he did not enumerate them&mdash;which were worth preserving.  I think that all the first class key industries established either by the last Administration or the present one, industries for which we have the raw material ourselves, are worth preserving for any Government that may be in office in this country.  It is surely the duty of the representatives of the people, irrespective of party, to see that such industries are preserved, and that no steps are taken to endanger their position.  Would Deputy O'Leary, for instance, as a practical farmer, be <Col N="2547" /> prepared to take responsibility for the abolition of the subsidy that has been voted continuously for some years for the maintenance of the dairying industry, which gives very valuable employment?  I speak with some knowledge of this matter, because I happened to be a member of a body for some time which was set up in connection with the Stabilisation of Prices Act.  Apart from that, I come from a constituency which has benefited very much as a result of that, and I certainly would not vote for the abolition of a subsidy which has meant the maintenance of that industry in the last few years and which, as Deputy O'Leary knows very well, could not have been maintained without the subsidy.  I know, and Deputy O'Leary knows, that if we had to sell our Irish creamery butter at the world market price, the price of milk would have dropped by 2½d. a gallon.</P>

      <P>I have had the honour to represent my constituency in this House since 1922, and I have always recognised that you cannot provide a living wage for the workers in the various industries unless you give them some help, and I admit that bounties or subsidies must be provided.  I qualify that by saying that it is not worth subsidising an industry to the amount of £1,000 or £1,000,000 unless you provide a proper price for the farmer, and I say that the beet scheme does not give the beet grower a proper price for his beet.  I have some little information with regard to that.  I am not familiar with the actual work <Col N="2548" /> done in connection with the cutting of beet and so on, but I say that the present price is not an economic price for the beet grower, and if either Party in this House wants to put these industries on their feet properly, a sufficient bounty should be given to enable the farmer to get a proper price for his milk, his beet, his wheat or any other commodity the farmer produces.  I remember well being present at a meeting of farmers and workers held in Athy when I was one of those appointed to go over to Belgium in 1924 in connection with this question of beet growing.  I travelled out there with people who represented different points of view at that time, and I came to the conclusion that the beet industry was worth establishing and was deserving of a subsidy, and I saw that if a subsidy was worth while in Belgium it was well worth while here in order to induce the farmers here to change their methods of farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am referring to is not knowledge that is peculiar to myself.  We know that the farmers, shortly after the Carlow beet factory was established, were very slow to take advantage of the 52/- per ton that was offered at that period.  When they found, however, that their neighbours next door realised that there was a profit to be got out of it, <Col N="2549" /> then there was a scramble amongst the farmers to get more acreage; and I am very sorry to say to my friend Deputy O'Leary that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government at the time had not the courage to establish the three additional factories that have been since established by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I was absent, unfortunately, from this House when Deputy Dillon opposed an Order for the establishment of a tariff on the clothing industry.  I read with amazement the speech he made at that time, and I dare say it was just as well for myself and for Deputy Dillon that I was not in the House when he made that speech.  He represented a certain industry, which I believe is a very great industry and is mainly Irish because the people who have put their money into it are mainly Irish, as being controlled from outside, and he referred to the company concerned in the terms of the people who provided the technical advice. The company concerned is a purely Irish concern and I am glad to say that, although Deputy Dillon tried to misrepresent it, four-fifths of the capital has been found in the constituency I have the honour to represent, and from the rest of the country <Col N="2550" /> the capital was over-subscribed six times.  Yet Deputy Dillon came along with an attack on that company which he knew perfectly well to be incorrect. If Deputy Dillon and his colleagues had their way, they would wipe our that industry and throw out of employment the people who are getting very valuable employment in there at the present time.</P>

We are <Col N="2552" /> not influenced in our attitude in this matter either by the leader writers of the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Press</i> or by the viewpoint either of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  I am not by any means enthusiastic about sharing responsibility for the government of this country&mdash;I sympathise with those who will have the responsibility in the future&mdash;but if Labour were given the responsibility for the government of the country to-morrow, it would not certainly be so silly as to sponsor a policy of this kind.  I believe I am correct in stating that the people who are backing this motion by their speeches in this House would not do so either if they were faced with the responsibility of government.  They would have to honour the promise made to the people at the last election and maintain the key industries established in this country, not by foreigners, but by Irishmen, with Irish brains and Irish hands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that you cannot have protection in a country without effective control over the prices of the manufactured articles.  I <Col N="2553" /> do not think that this Government have exercised the powers they have under the Control of Prices Act to keep prices at a reasonable level.  We have a Prices Commission inquiring into complaints made by the public or complaints passed on to them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It does not require a genius or a body of supermen to find out whether prices are unfair or excessive, or not.  If I were a member of the Prices Commission and wanted to find out whether the prices of children's boots or ladies' shoes were excessive, I would go to the retailer and find out the prices there and then go to the factory and see where the difference came in.  It is easy to find out, without a long-drawn inquiry, what is the price charged by the manufacturer to the retailer, and as a result of that, whether the middleman is getting too much out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see some people who have established boot industries in this country paying 25 per cent. on their ordinary shares.  I say that there is something radically wrong there on account of the prices generally charged to the community, especially for children's boots.  The same thing applies to clothing.  Then we have the glaring example of the Prices Commission, after a long-drawn-out inquiry, the production of books and documents, and evidence tendered on oath by witnesses, including the flour millers, submitting a report that the price of flour was excessive at a certain period, <Col N="2554" /> and the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying in this House that he did not agree with the report submitted by his own commission, and that that was his justification for taking no action.</P>

      <P>I would be pleased if by what I say I could induce Deputy Kelly to make a speech on this matter. I want to say deliberately that I would never be a party to voting for a motion of this kind calling for the abolition of taxes, levies and duties on foodstuffs and other necessaries of life, on everything, in fact, and which, when put into operation, would in my opinion create a first-class financial crisis in this State.  Neither myself nor the members of my Party are going to be a party to any such resolution, even though it is put down for the purpose of trapping the members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The drainage scheme referred to in the question is reported to be one which cannot be economically carried out during the winter months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was considered in connection with the programme of drainage schemes for last summer, but the <Col N="2412" /> unemployment position in the electoral division of Ballingurteen in which the work falls did not warrant the making of a grant at the time.</P>
    <P>The scheme will again be considered on its merits in connection with any future programme of summer drainage schemes in competition with any other proposals for the same area and in the light of the unemployment position at the time, but it cannot be stated when the work will be carried out, if at all.</P>
