      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if the Irish Free State representative in Spain is still accredited to the Valencia Government, and if the Executive Council will decide to alter its attitude in reference to the position of the Irish Free State representative in Spain to the extent done by Great Britain.</P>

      <P>The representative of Saorstát Eireann in Spain was never accredited to the Government at Valencia.  As I have said on previous occasions, he was accredited in September, 1935, to the then Head of the Spanish State.  Our diplomatic representative is in contact with General Franco's Government.  There is therefore no need to send a representative in a different capacity.  With the great majority of European States, we believe that in the existing conditions it is in the interests of general peace and peace in Spain to continue to adhere to the non-intervention policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary appreciate that the Cork County Council is anxious to provide their employees with a pension scheme: that the employees of certain local authorities in the country have a pension scheme; and will he do something to expedite the introduction of legislation which will at least enable the Cork Corporation employees to enjoy the same pensions rights as are enjoyed by the employees of other local authorities?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Galway Board of Health and Public Assistance that the plots attached to the labourers' cottages erected at Kinvara are enclosed by a stone wall boundary fence.  The individual plots were lockspitted shortly after the tenants went into occupation, and I am also informed that if the tenants so desired there was nothing to prevent them from having the plots cultivated during the past two seasons. The board have now entered into a contract for the erection of gates and piers and general repair work to the boundary fences, and it is expected that the work will be completed within the next two months.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the actual quantities of apples imported by the factory referred to, but a licence was recently granted to the factory for the importation, free of customs duty, of a quantity not exceeding 400 tons of apples for the manufacture of cider. The country of origin of the apples was not prescribed in the licence, but I understand that the apples are being imported from France, and that they are of particular varieties which are grown specially for the production of cider, but not at present grown in this country.  They are required for blending with our home-grown apples in order to produce cider of suitable quality. Before the licence was granted, all the facts of the case were examined by my Department, and the factory undertook not only to purchase specified minimum quantities of home-grown apples, but also to provide at their own expense large quantities of trees for planting (which is now proceeding) under a cider apple tree scheme administered by the local committee of agriculture, with a <Col N="2235" /> view to the production of home supplies of the particular kinds of apples which it is at present necessary to import.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to meet the House so far as possible, but we are pressed for time.  If I thought the Opposition would co-operate with us, we might recommit the Bill again so as to give the greatest possible opportunity for examination, but, ordinarily, owing to the pressure of time, we would be compelled to take re-commitment only in regard to the new amendments.  I dislike very much not giving every member of the House an opportunity of going through the whole Bill.  This is the first time members have got the Bill in really complete form, and it is only at this stage that they can see the general sequence. Amendments might occur to a Deputy on reading the Bill as it is.  I think it would be better to wait until Thursday to deal with this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object <Col N="2250" /> of this Bill is to amend the provision of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935 which requires that the registration of persons entitled to acquire citizenship by registration must be effected within two years from the date of the passing of the Act.  The provision in question is contained in sub-section (5) of Section 2 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935.  The persons to whom the provision relates are persons born before the 6th December, 1922, either in Ireland, or of parents one of whom was born in Ireland, who were not domiciled in Ireland on the 6th December, 1922 and consequently did not become citizens under Article 3 of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann. Such persons if still living abroad and not naturalized citizens of any other country were enabled by the Act of 1935 to become citizens of this country by the simple process of registration. The registration was effected in a register of nationals kept in an Irish Legation or Irish Consulate in the country in which the applicants resided, or if there were no Irish Legation or Irish Consulate in that country, in the general register of nationals kept in the Department of External Affairs.  The registration, however, had to be effected within a period of two years from the date of the passing of the Act of 1935.  That Act became law on the 10th April, 1935 and, consequently, the period in which registration could legally be effected expired on the 9th-10th April of the present year.</P>
      <P>A large number of applications by persons who would be eligible for registration but for the expiration of the time-limit of two years imposed by the sub-section in question have been received since 10th April last, and it is thought that in these and in future cases where the Minister for Justice is satisfied that applicants should be admitted to citizenship the statutory limitation of time should be removed.  That is the only amendment of the Act of 1935 proposed in the present Bill.</P>

To become citizens, those of them who were living abroad had to register in a register within a period of two years, with, of course, the necessity of Ministers being satisfied, and so on.  That period of two years has now elapsed, and we have a number of applications with which we want to deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which I was about to make was that we are now extending the provisions of the Principal Act in certain limited directions. I suggest that it would not be out of place if, at this stage, the President were to indicate the extent to which citizenship has been conferred on persons who are not citizens by birth on the soil.  I wonder if the President would do that on the next stage?  It may be that the President will say that, periodically, there is a list of persons published on whom citizenship has been conferred, but it is not easy to collate statistics in that disjointed way, nor does it give the information <Col N="2252" /> I require, namely, on what nationalities are we conferring Irish citizenship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no doubt about that matter not being relevant to this Bill.  One question arises, that is, whether it is advisable to remove the time limit in respect of certain limited classes of people applying for citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition is to increase the number of citizens in this State.  May not one of the considerations that will influence the judgment of a Deputy in coming to a decision on that be the number of people, with no connection whatever with this nation, who have acquired citizenship?  If, for instance, a large number of that kind have got citizenship, it is all the more reason for admitting the others&mdash;those mentioned in this Bill.  That is a very good argument that could be brought forward for those who might support this Bill, namely, why not give it to people who have been born here or to people whose parents were born here when we are giving it possibly rather generously to people who had no connection whatever with this country? Surely that is a very relevant argument and a very relevant reason why this information should be given on the next stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that when we are amending the main Act, we are obviously doing something which has a relation to the number of persons who are citizens of this country, and that it is not irrelevant to ask the President at this stage for information as to the number of persons of alien birth upon whom we have conferred Irish citizenship.  I am asking the President if he would not get that information for the Committee Stage, so that we may have a picture of the way in which the main Act is being used and know the extent to which we are conferring Irish nationality on persons who are not of Irish birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I could easily get the information for the Deputy in answer to a Parliamentary Question.  I can get it if we are not going to take <Col N="2253" /> all the stages of this Bill to-day.  We could possibly get it for the next stage, but this is a Bill that has reference only to those born in Ireland or born of parents one of whom was born in Ireland.  It has nothing whatever to do with aliens and the information for which I asked, as being relevant to this stage, was the number of applications pending of the class of people dealt with in the Bill.  There are some 608 applications pending of persons either born in Ireland or one of whose parents was Irish.  I do not think that any considerations such as the Deputy mentions would militate against its passing.  They might be a further reason for passing it but, at any rate, I do not think that any consideration as to the number of other nationalities that were received into citizenship would militate against its passing.  If there were a number of them, it would be an extra reason for passing it, so as to get in a greater number of Irish blood or parentage.</P>

      <P>I will have the information sent to the Deputy and circulated to the House at the first opportunity, but I should like to get all the stages to-day.  There is nothing in it that I can see that would necessitate our holding it up and from the point of view of assisting the Departmental officials and so on, the sooner we get it the better.  If the Deputy is satisfied that he wants it, I can let him have the information, but my own belief is that any considerations of that kind would be only an urge to pass the Bill rather than a deterrent against passing it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the <Col N="2255" /> year ending 31st March, 1938, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs and of certain services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    <P>A paper has been circulated showing how the sum of £10 is arrived at. Before I go into details I might tell the House exactly what the matter is about.  For some years we have had informal conversations concerning an exchange of representatives with Italy. It has been from the beginning the policy of this State to have diplomatic relations with the principal nations of the world.  That policy is founded on reasons of vital national importance which there is no need to discuss. Italy was the last remaining great country in Europe with which we had not yet exchanged diplomatic representatives. There has always been a very friendly feeling between the peoples of the two countries.  Deputies are aware of the antiquity of our friendly relations with the Italian people.  I need only mention the name of St. Columbanus and other great Irishmen of the early Middle Ages who helped their Italian fellow-workers to maintain and develop a Christian civilisation throughout the whole of the peninsula.  Their memory is still revered by the Italian people, and I believe it is the experience of all Irishmen who travel in Italy that the welcome extended to them by the people is particularly warm.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Vote is to establish a legation at the Quirinal, and, in so doing, to return the friendly gesture of Italy in appointing a diplomatic representative here last summer. With regard to the item of £10, the Estimate is intended to cover roughly two months, February and March.  We expect that the appointment of a Minister for whom provision will have to be made will be made by the 1st of February.  All the details are based on a two months' period.  The total cost for that period under various heads would be £897, but there is a saving of £887 on other heads, so that we have only to provide a further £10 to meet the total bill.  The details were given on the paper.  If there are any points upon which Deputies wish <Col N="2256" /> to get information I will be happy to give whatever we have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, apparently, kept until the last what has been the tit-bit of his whole Estimate. Obviously, one of the important matters which we ought to have been told at the outset was the fact that we are now appointing a Minister to Italy, and that by the Letter of Credence which our Minister is going to present there we are formally and definitely acknowledging Italy's annexation of Abyssinia.  The President has quoted a number of States which have done that.  That is a matter for these States.  But it is rather remarkable that the list comprises, mainly, some South American States and other States which, in that act of aggression against Abyssinia, supported Italy.  Apparently we are to line up with these States now and recognise Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, <Col N="2258" /> the greatest piece of international violence and injustice that has been committed during this generation.</P>
      <P>It is not so long since the President was at Geneva making speeches condemning the violence which was being done to Abyssinian independence, condemning this outrageous violence on the part of an aggressor, and condemning also the fact that a weak member of the League was having territory grabbed from it by a country which simply aimed at, and has aimed at for a considerable time, the open annexation of Abyssinia.  While we had the President adopting that role at Geneva, and asking this House to pass a Bill imposing sanctions on Italy for so doing, now a short time after we have a Supplementary Estimate introduced here to recognise that, because of her capacity to beat Abyssinia into surrender by the use of mustard gas and all the other frightfulness associated with warfare, we are to appoint a Minister to the Italian State, thereby recognising its outrageous annexation of Abyssinia as well as the complete subjugation of the independence of that State.  Why we should select this moment for doing it I do not know, seeing that we contrived to carry on between 1922 and 1935 without taking the step which we are now asked to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a most unfortunate event that the President, at this stage, should ask us to appoint a Minister to Italy, especially in view of the fact that we propose, by a formal Letter of Credence, to recognise not merely Italian sovereignty in Abyssinia, not merely Italian political influence there but the complete annexation of the Abyssinian State by Italy.  What is the purpose of making this hasty appointment in this way?  Would the President tell us what is the volume of our trade with Italy, what is the annual value of the goods which Italy takes from us, and the value of the goods which Italy sends here?  Is the volume of trade such that, while this whole question of the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is occupying an important place in European international politics, we must rush in and appoint a Minister to a <Col N="2259" /> State with which we have virtually no trade at the moment?  Italy, the other day, told the world that she has now withdrawn from the League of Nations because, apparently, the League has not been willing to come to heel when Mussolini chose to ask the League to come to heel.  Italy announced to the world the other day that she is leaving the League of Nations simply because her annexation of Abyssinia is not recognised with a wholeheartedness equal to the ferocity with which that annexation was carried out.</P>
    <P>The President stated that Great Britain and France recognised that annexation, but I think that if he makes further inquiries he will find that that statement does not represent the facts of the situation accurately.  It may be true that both France and Britain have reduced the status of their legations at Addis Ababa.  It may be that in the new situation they do not find it necessary to retain ambassadors there, and have reduced the status of their representation there to that of a consular general.  That is not a recognition of the Italian annexation of Abyssinia.  I think the President's information on that aspect of the situation is far from correct.  In fact, if my memory serves me, there is quite a spot of annoyance at present on the part of Italy because France will not accredit her representative in Rome to the King of Italy on the ground that he is claiming also to be the Emperor of Abyssinia.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the President reconciles all this with our continued membership of the League of Nations, with the speech that he himself delivered at Geneva as well as the fact that it is not so long ago since he asked this House, and rightly so, to pass a Bill imposing sanctions on Italy for her outrageous annexation of a State which was an equal member of the League of Nations with us?  If there is any one nation that should stand out against a recognition. of that annexation it is this State. The history of this country is, in many respects, not unlike the history of Abyssinia, a country that has suffered at the hands of the despoiler <Col N="2260" /> and Imperialist.  We here in this country have had a history somewhat like that.  In these circumstances we are asked to accredit a representative to the Italian State as distinct from the Vatican: to accredit a Minister to the Italian State, and there by give recognition to the annexation of Abyssinia.  I think that the President might very well withdraw this Estimate and not ask the House to pass it in existing circumstances, especially at a time when the whole question of the annexation of Abyssinia is occupying an important position in European affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Deputy is quite accurate in saying that the question he refers to is occupying an important position at the present moment in European affairs.  The attitude of this Government in regard to that dispute is pretty well known, I think, to all members of the House.  We adopted the attitude that we did in agreement with a large number of States in the League of Nations in October, 1935.  We took a decision later in 1936, in accordance with a similar decision of the States in the League of Nations to remove sanctions.  In other words, the States in the League had to admit that they had failed in the purpose of putting on these sanctions.  The position that we have to face is this: that over a number of years we have been having, as I said earlier, informal talks with Italy in regard to the establishment of a legation in Rome at the Quirinal. These talks have been going on for a considerable period.  In accordance with our general policy we have been anxious to have a representative at Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please allow me to finish?  We are not doing anything of the kind. Every State that wants either to change a Minister or to appoint a new Minister must of necessity, in accordance with international custom, give to the Sovereign to whom the representative is being accredited the title that is assumed in that State.  For instance, if there is a representative being accredited to the United States of America, then it is the title of the head of that State that is chosen and not one by the State that is sending the representative.  It is certain that every State will have to do that. When we are certain that every State is going to do that, are we to continue to postpone something that has been long overdue?  We have taken this decision on the basis that this does not affect and cannot affect the question of Ethiopia.  That question has been taken as settled so far as the other States are concerned, and so far as the question of the establishment of Consuls-General is concerned, we have to take into consideration the question of States having an immediate interest in that particular area. Consequently, the question for us to determine is whether the appointment of such a person to Rome, which, as I have said, is long overdue, is to be effected now or whether we are to wait indefinitely, knowing well that our attitude with regard to Ethiopia would have nothing to do with the ultimate results, and knowing that every State that has to carry on its business with other States&mdash;and, by &ldquo;business&rdquo; I do not mean trade, but the ordinary affairs that have to be carried on between nations&mdash;ultimately, if it is going to have relations with Italy, will have to accept the style and title that the head of the <Col N="2262" /> Italian State gets, and not any other title.  The matter of the title of the head of a State is decided by the State itself.</P>
      <P>We had no immediate and direct quarrel with Italy, and in the matter of Ethiopia we acted as one of the States in a group.  We took our part in that action, and, when that action was found to be unsuccessful and could lead to no good results, and when the other States in the group decided that they should abandon it, we acted similarly.  The question for us is whether we have to continue saying that these negotiations had begun before this time and whether we are now simply going to let these things stand over or not.  I think we ought to face the reality and go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says that it is now found necessary to accredit a Minister to Italy.  Of course, we already had a Minister at Rome accredited to the Vatican, but the President wants to accredit a Minister to Italy as well, and the President says that we cannot help the fact that the King of Italy has chosen, as his title, Emperor of Ethiopia as well as King of Italy.  Surely we are not all living in the clouds?  Do we not all know perfectly well that the King of Italy has chosen the title of Emperor of Ethiopia merely because of the fact that the military forces of Italy, with bombing planes and mustard gas, aided and abetted by political manoeuvring on the part of certain active members of the League of Nations, have been able to bring Abyssinia to its present position? Is it not clear to everybody, who has given any attention at all to the matter, that Ethiopia was encouraged by certain States to resist Italian agression on the promise and in the belief that it could look forward to certain support and powerful assistance from certain members of the League of Nations?  We all know that these promises were not carried out, with the result that the Italian military machine was able to steam-roll its will on Ethiopia, and the King of Italy is now styled Emperor of Ethiopia&mdash;not on any moral grounds, nor because of the <Col N="2263" /> approval of other nations, but because the Italian military machine, by means of bombing planes and mustard gas, has been able to steam-roll its will on the people of Ethiopia.  As a matter of fact, the reason that the King of Italy is now entitled Emperor of Abyssinia, instead of Emperor of Eire, is merely because the Italian military machine has been able to conquer Abyssinia, and has not been able to come over here.</P>
      <P>Are we not definitely recognising the fact that, because the Italian military machine has been able to subjugate the independence of Ethiopia and because, by virtue of that fact, the King of Italy has now become Emperor of Ethiopia&mdash; are we not recognising that subjugation by now definitely accrediting a Minister to a King who has absolutely no authority whatever to assume the title of Emperor of Ethiopia?  What right has the King of Italy to assume that title any more than to assume the title of Emperor of Eire?  None.  The only right&mdash;if it could be called so&mdash;that he has to that title is the fact that his military machine has been able to stifle the independence of Ethiopia; and now we, in this country, which has suffered so much in the past from the aggression of another country, are accrediting a Minister to Italy and thereby recognising, in a frank and open manner, that the King of Italy is entitled to call himself Emperor of Ethiopia, not as a result of the will of the people there, but because of the force of the Italian military machine and the bombing planes and mustard gas that have been used to beat the Ethiopian people into submission.</P>
      <P>The President says that we cannot get on with Italy unless we make this appointment.  Well, it seems that we have been able to get along without such an appointment fairly well in all those years up to the present.  I am not aware of any irreparable loss that has been suffered by our people by reason of the fact that we had had no Minister accredited to the Italian Government. What were the actual losses to our people occasioned by the absence of a representative in Italy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am prepared to hear the President on that question also.  Here, however, at a time when what is left of Abyssinian thought is trying to enlist the sympathy of the world, and particularly the sympathy of the small nations of the world, in support of its right to regain its independence, this small nation of ours selects this time to recognise Italian domination in Ethiopia.  Let these States in South America do what they like.  They have no past like ours, or even comparable to ours.  There was a time when we protested that his Britannic Majesty had no moral authority to assume the headship of this country of ours and no right to function here in Ireland, and we said to the world that his Britannic Majesty had no right to function here because he has no moral authority derived from the Irish people to do so. Are we not in precisely the same position in dealing with Ethiopia? The King of Italy has no moral authority to exercise any jurisdiction over Ethiopia.  The only authority that he has, as I have said, is the same as that which the British claim to have over this country, namely, that by their instruments of war they could beat and baton the people into submission. Is that the kind of over-lordship we ought to recognise?  Is that the kind of over-lordship that this small country of ours, with its particular past, should recognise?  Yet, by this action, in effect, we are saying to Italy and the world that, although we ourselves have been despoiled by an invader in previous years, and although we are only a small nation, living, in many respects, at the mercy of the larger nations in Europe, we, knowing our own history, still are going to line up beside Germany, Austria and Italy and also beside some States thousands and thousands of miles away from us?</P>

      <P>France has not done it. The President has been silent on that. It may be that Deputy Walsh should be the Minister for External Affairs, <Col N="2265" /> because, apparently, he knows more about it than the President.  The President has been very silent on the French recognition of the Emperorship of Ethiopia by the King of Italy. Everybody knows it is not a fact. Now, in all our nakedness we are saying to the world that we recognise the Italian annexation of Abyssinia. A small nation like Ireland, with its past, is proclaiming that to the world. It is unfair that we should be put in that position.  We have done without a Minister in Rome for 15 years, and we should contrive to do without him for another 12 months, and then consider the position in the light of conditions then existing.</P>

What we are doing at this moment is that we are recognising a fact&mdash;a fact which will be recognised by every State that has to change or accredit a minister.  What does the Deputy suggest is going to happen in a year's time?  We have been for some years, as I have said, in negotiation for the purpose of trying to get a legation established at Rome.  There is no use in saying that we have already a legation at the Vatican.  That does not function in the Italian State&mdash;it functions in another direction.  Italy was one of the chief States of Europe with which we had not had, up to the present, diplomatic relations.  It has been our policy&mdash;a policy that was there before our time and since our time in office&mdash;to get representatives established in the principal States in the world.  There are very good reasons for it&mdash;reasons which have nothing to do immediately with trade. You have no remedy&mdash;even if you wished to have a remedy&mdash;for it, except not to do it.  The Deputy is fond of saying: &ldquo;Do not do anything&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;according to our own sense of what our needs require, instead of waiting for others?  The attitude we have adopted is there is a <i>de facto</i> position staring us in the face and we must take account of that. If we wish to have a representative in Italy, as has been our wish, then we give to the sovereign of that country the title which he has taken or which his own people have taken.  That is the title we have to recognise&mdash;we can do nothing else.  We have decided that it is in the national interest that we should have this legation established. The Italian Government last July, I think it was, accredited a Minister here, and, in accordance with the regular custom, it is due that we, having accepted that Minister, should send a Minister back.  In doing that we are satisfied that we are doing everything that becomes our people and our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No action of ours can change the position.  I doubt if any action of any of the States in the world can change the position at the moment.  Are we simply to blindfold ourselves and not look at things which are staring us in the face?  We think it is in the national interest to make this appointment. What we are doing is, we are giving <i>de facto</i> recognition to the title which the sovereign has assumed and which has been given to him by his people.  We have either to do this or not&mdash;there is no half-way house about it.  If we do not do it now, it probably will not be done at all&mdash;certainly it will not be done next year or the year after.  It has to be done now or not at all.  I think that it would be quite <Col N="2267" /> wrong for our people to avoid having a legation in that country when, in doing so, we are doing what we know other States will do the moment they have reason for doing it, as we have.</P>

First of all, he stated and has repeated that all the rest will recognise it and, on the second occasion, he added, &ldquo;When they are in the same position as we are.&rdquo;  He further said that our appointment of a representative at Rome will not be recognition.  I cannot see how those two statements can hang together.  As regards the statement that the other States are in the same position as we are, he must be aware that France has been without an ambassador in Rome for a considerable time, apparently for the reason that she will not recognise the King of Italy as King of Abyssinia.  The President asks, &ldquo;Are we to wait indefinitely?&rdquo;  My answer to that is, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Common action was taken at Geneva, and I can see no reason why this country should depart from that common action and should not wait until it is agreed amongst all the Powers that they should unite in recognising Italian suzerainty over Abyssinia.</P>

      <P>How does the Deputy think that there will be general agreement?  There is no question of an agreement on this matter. This will be done by each State as its own interests are involved.  We are giving <i>de facto</i> recognition.  We are not going into the merits of the quarrel.  We have to send a Minister and we are sending one, and we have to address the head of the State in which the legation is being established by the title which he has chosen, or which has been given to him.  We are not breaking away from any common action.  We took common action with the other States and, when they changed, we changed, and not before. There is no international agreement <Col N="2268" /> of any kind from which we are departing by taking this action.  The States are acting independently about it. There may be States which have some special quarrels with Italy and they are dealing with matters like this in their own way, according as it suits them.  We have no quarrel, as such, with the Italian people.  We have considerable relations with the Italian people and wherever our people go in Italy they are received with special warmth by the Italian people.  Are we going to take up the attitude of simply waiting until all the other people, who at the moment have particular quarrels, fix up their quarrels and send representatives?  There is no inconsistency between the things I have said.  What we are giving here is <i>de facto</i> recognition of the title, and is it not necessary?</P>

      <P>I deplore the low moral tone which the Government have taken up in this discussion.  I think we can agree with everything the President has said but not as to his conclusions. He has said that the Italian annexation of Abyssinia is being <i>de facto</i> recognised and will be recognised, in a period of time, by all the Great Powers.  He seemed then to go on to say: &ldquo;Well, we should be one of the first to recognise that fact.&rdquo;  He has been asked if there are any important trade matters waiting on this and he has replied, with admirable candour, that there are not.  He says that we have always lived on terms of very friendly relations with the Italians. I agree with that statement, and there is no reason why we should not continue to live on friendly relations with Italy, but that is no reason why we should not recognise that the conduct of our best friend was either right or wrong.  Owing to our peculiar geographical position and other circumstances, we can afford to take up a high moral tone without having to pay a price for it.  I think what the President has not answered, and what I should like that he should answer before this discussion closes, is: Does he approve of the annexation of Abyssinia or does he not?  If he approves of the annexation of Abyssinia, and if this House supports him in that attitude, the sooner we hasten in with our representative addressing the King of Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia, the better.  We can do that straight away, if we approve of the annexation of Abyssinia, but there are a certain number of people who feel that the annexation of Abyssinia was not right and that, even though we are very good friends of the Italians, and although they have been very friendly disposed towards us, their conduct in this matter was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are compelled to fall in at the tail of the Powers who have recognised the annexation of Abyssinia, I suppose ultimately we shall have to do so, having made our gesture, but we need not do so at this juncture.  There <Col N="2270" /> is no trade hanging on it.  There is nothing else resting on it.  Certainly from the moral point of view I, personally, feel that we ought to go slow on this question of recognition.  I should like the President to answer that question instead of saying: &ldquo;We shall ultimately find that other Powers have recognised the fact; we must be realists and face facts.&rdquo;  We have got to ask ourselves: was the annexation right or was it wrong?  If it was right, we should immediately proceed to recognise it.  If it was not, we ought to fall in at the tail of other nations who refuse to recognise it.  It seems to me that is the point which has not been brought out in this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should I speak to the House about a subject that was not before the House?  When something could be done to deal with this question of Abyssinia, we were not slow in dealing with it.  I should not be asked now to talk about the question whether we consider the annexation of Abyssinia right or wrong.  We dealt with that question when it was before the House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well what we did: We stood firmly by all the other States when the matter was being debated by the other States.  As long as anything could be done effectively we were there.  We have now come to a situation in which everybody, who does not want to blind himself, must realise that States, according as there is need for representation, must recognise the existing situation, unless they want to withdraw their ambassadors.  Even then they would probably leave a <i>charge d'affaires</i> there.  States who have a special quarrel with Italy may use the opportunity for the furtherance of their own ends but there is definitely a necessity for the maintenance of relations between these countries. <Col N="2271" /> Because there is that need, ultimately the States who must have their legations there must have their representatives accredited to the head of the State by the title which he has assumed.  We are giving him a <i>de facto</i> recognition of the title which he has assumed.  We are not, in doing that, going back on anything that we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be the position in regard to the <i>de facto</i> side of the question, there is no question here of a <i>de jure</i> recognition.  If the Deputy would give a little bit more consideration to this question of recognition, he would notice that States generally proceed exactly in that way, by giving <i>de facto</i> recognition in a situation of this kind.  They cannot do otherwise.  Our giving <i>de facto</i> recognition is simply recognising an existing fact.  There is no question at issue as to how that fact came about or about the rights or wrongs of the question.  We have had to make up our minds in this matter. We have been carrying on negotiations for years with a view to having a representative at the Quirinal.  To a certain extent these negotiations were suspended during the active operation of the sanctions.  Now these sanctions, that joint action, have failed.  Let us recognise that.  Are we then to put aside our original intention and not go on with the idea of establishing a legation in Italy or are we to wait at the tail until some other people decide on this question of recognition.  I am not suggesting that we want to be in the front but I certainly do suggest that we should not simply wait at the tail of other nations and do it when other people decide to do it.  We have got to make up our minds for ourselves as to when it is proper to establish this legation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in doing it at the present time we are doing what the national interests suggest.  We are not pronouncing any judgment whatever on the quarrel.  We are not asked to do so; it does not come up.  What we have to <Col N="2272" /> ask ourselves is whether or not we are going to send a representative of ours and establish this legation at the Quirinal.  I say that if you do not, then, if you want to have this consistency which you talk about, you must not do it as long as this question is not settled to your liking.  It is no excuse to wait until other States do it.  By our action we are in no way prejudicing the ultimate results of that quarrel. Of that I am certain.  In making this appointment we are only doing what any other State would do, having advanced to the point of negotiation to which we have advanced.</P>

      <P>The President tells us he is only recognising a fact, and apparently he states that with great approval.  That may be a very sound doctrine, but if the President looks back to the last 25 years he will recognise that there were a great many facts which he was not prepared to recognise.  He was not prepared to recognise the fact of the domination of this country by England.  This Dáil was established in 1922.  He was not prepared to recognise that fact.  Those of us who did recognise the fact, and came in here, got any amount of misrepresentation and abuse from the President and his colleagues.</P>

      <P>Well, 15 years is a fairly good stretch, and our recollections of those 15 years may be clearer than our recollections of '98. Perhaps that is what makes the Minister so uncomfortable.  Perhaps he would prefer to go back to 1649 or 1072 or some other convenient date, and then we can romance with greater freedom?</P>

      <P>Fifteen years will do me.  That will cover the public record of the Minister and his colleagues.  We applauded the action taken by the President at Geneva when he protested against the attack on and destruction of Abyssinia.  We are of the same <Col N="2273" /> opinion still, although the President has changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people think that to change is to improve, and to be perfect is to change often.  If that be so, the President is rapidly approaching perfection.  We, as a small nation, always claimed our freedom and independence, and have always given our sympathy and whatever support we could to other small nations seeking to preserve or establish their independence. Thirty or 40 years ago the whole of nationalist Ireland applauded the resistance of the South African Republics to the aggression of England, and we have always given the same sympathy to Egypt and India. Although we saw Abyssinia crushed with the greatest display of frightfulness that the world has seen, and which shocked the whole world, we now hurry <Col N="2274" /> in, in order that the name of this State may be added to the long list of South American Republics, which will be used as an argument to compel bigger States to use this new title.  The President has not contradicted the statement that neither France nor Britain has recognised this new title, and I understand that to be the position. Nothing will be gained by passing this Estimate and establishing this legislation.  What is the urgency for it? The President said it is not altogether a question of trade.  I agree it is not, but trade enters into it.  What will it mean in trade?  We have not been told.  Is there a single worker or farmer or any other person in this country who will have an extra pound in his pocket as a result of the establishment of this legation?  I hope we will reject this Vote.</P>

The enforcement of these conditions will not be entirely a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce; it will be a matter for the persons concerned, a matter for organisations representing the persons concerned.  During the discussion upon the Second Reading I mentioned that it was intended to effect such amendment in the Bill as to make it clear that any person could take proceedings to enforce the conditions which the Bill lays down.  It is, in <Col N="2277" /> fact, anticipated that, in the ordinary course, aggrieved shop assistants will themselves move to secure their statutory rights when the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Norton, I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 19, to delete the words &ldquo;Shop Assistants&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Shops.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the title of the Bill.  Since 1892, various shop measures have been passed and all these are described as &ldquo;Shops Acts&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Shop Assistants Acts.&rdquo;  The Minister will recognise that while the term &ldquo;Shop Assistants&rdquo; is used in the title of the Bill it is not defined in any part, of the Bill and it is, presumably, intended that the conditions laid down in the Bill will govern various classes of people working in and about shops not all of whom could be described as &ldquo;shop assistants,&rdquo; as that term is ordinarily understood.  It appears to me that the title Shops (Conditions of Employment) Bill would be more appropriate than the title Shop Assistants (Conditions of Employment) Bill.  In a number of the sections of the Bill, reference is made to people engaged in various ways, in serving customers and in packing goods.  Some of these people are not ordinarily known as &ldquo;shop assistants,&rdquo; and the title I have suggested would be more appropriate than that used in connection with the Bill.  It would also avoid any confusion as to the application of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) page 4, line 30, before the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; where it first occurs, to insert the words, &ldquo;the business carried on in a theatre.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the position of certain employees in theatres and cinemas.  I do not know whether the Minister agrees that the Bill does not apply to theatre and cinema employees <Col N="2282" /> as a whole, but only with a section of them.  It appears to deal definitely with those persons engaged in selling programmes, sweets, cigarettes and so forth.  The purpose of my amendment is to extend the provisions of the Bill so as to include ushers, usherettes and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter consideration, and I am not at all sure that it is practicable under this Bill to deal with the conditions of employment of persons working in theatres and cinemas.  This is a Shops Bill or a Shop Assistants Bill &mdash;whichever you choose to call it&mdash;and persons so employed do not come within that definition, nor are theatres or cinemas shops within the accepted meaning.  I am in complete agreement with the Deputy when he contends that there is need for the regulation of the working hours and general conditions of persons employed in cinemas and theatres, but, considering the question in relation to the provisions of this Bill, I think it would be inappropriate to effect that regulation by means of the inclusion of those persons within the scope of this measure.  A number of the provisions of this Bill&mdash;which was prepared having in mind the circumstances in shops only, and for the purpose of ensuring that there would be some general system of regulation of the conditions of employment in shops&mdash;would not apply at all to persons employed in theatres or cinemas.  It is better, therefore, to leave over to another measure the making of whatever regulations are desirable and practicable in relation to theatre employees.  I do not say that that is a very firm decision on my part.  I have been approached by various interests who have urged both points of view on this question, and I came to the conclusion that, on the whole, it was not desirable to attempt to adapt the provisions of this Bill to the special conditions which must prevail in theatres and cinemas which, in fact, operate when shops are closed, and the persons employed in which must be engaged at periods and times when shop assistants, in the ordinary way, are not at <Col N="2283" /> work at all.  I would, therefore, urge that the regulation of conditions of employment of theatre workers should not be attempted in this measure, but should be left over for another measure dealing with themselves solely or with themselves and similar classes of persons engaged in the provision of amusements for persons who are employed during normal hours.  I make that decision more easily by reason of the fact that the particular provision of this Bill most urgently desired by those employees&mdash;the holiday provision&mdash;will, in any event, apply to them under the general measure which, as I intimated, it is my intention to introduce early next year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  In relation to every general class for whom we introduce legislative provisions of this kind, there will be certain exceptions who will have to be dealt with separately. It is my intention to cover every class, including these exceptions, before our whole code of legislation is completed, and my only reason for excluding these workers from the provisions of this Bill is that it would complicate the Bill and lessen its general effectiveness. Their circumstances are different from the circumstances of shop assistants and their hours of work are different. The particular regulations necessary to ensure that their conditions of employment will be as they should be would be different from those required in the case of shop assistants.  I would therefore propose to deal with that by special legislation later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but, again, there are special regulations required in that respect.  I do not know if it will be generally held desirable to exclude juveniles from employment <Col N="2284" /> in theatres and cinemas&mdash;that view might be urged by some people&mdash; but if it is not so held, clearly, the hours of work of juveniles employed in theatres and cinemas must be different from those which would be permitted in the case of juveniles employed in shops or in factories, and the fact that these considerations are there indicates the desirability of dealing with this class of workers by special legislation.</P>

      <P>It might be necessary to define it, but the Deputy can mention it when we come to the amendment.  I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, line 30, to insert after the word &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the business of carrying on a laundry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to make clear that the expression &ldquo;dyer and cleaner&rdquo; includes the business of carrying on a laundry.  I think there is some possibility of the phrase not being held to include the business of a laundry and, therefore, this amendment is desirable.  I think the point was made by Deputy Benson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the insertion of the amendment, although I should prefer to see it worded &ldquo;the business of a launderer&rdquo;, which would combine better with &ldquo;dyer and cleaner&rdquo;.  The Minister, however, has not met the other point I raised on Second Reading, that, by this Bill, he is making a factory a shop. It is not actually a very serious matter in this Bill, but in the Hours of Trading Bill it might be a very serious matter, because a closing order might compel a factory, as a shop, to close before the Conditions of Employment Act required <Col N="2285" /> it to close as a factory.  I admit it is difficult to get wording which will quite suit the Minister.  I take it that what he wishes to apply these conditions to is a shop used for the receiving and returning of customers' clothes which have been laundered, dyed or cleaned, and not to touch a factory, but I submit that as it is worded, it definitely includes a factory, because it refers to the business of a dyer or cleaner or the business of a laundry which obviously must be a factory.  Further down there is a definition of a shop as &ldquo;any premises in which any retail trade or business is carried on&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the Minister can see any way of meeting it under the definition of a retail trade or business, or whether he would be prepared to accept the inclusion in that definition of the words &ldquo;other than a factory&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to discuss the matter with the Deputy if he raises it, but I want to point out certain aspects of the question which have not, I think, occurred to him. We do exclude from the scope of the Bill any person engaged in work defined as industrial work under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>But not the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary course the type of laundry we are familiar with in the City of Dublin does its shop work through separate depots and its industrial work in the factory premises, but throughout the country there are quite a number of laundries which do not maintain separate depots and where shop work and industrial work are done on the same premises, and it would be difficult to ensure that the provisions of the Bill applied only to persons employed in depots because they might, and should, apply to persons employed on the laundry premises who are doing the type of work to which this Bill applies and who are excluded from the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act.  I am still open to consider whatever suggestion the Deputy might care to make in that regard, but I want to bring that difficulty to his attention&mdash;the difficulty that arises from the fact that <Col N="2286" /> in certain smaller laundries throughout the country persons doing shop work are doing it in the factory premises and will continue to do it in the factory premises and in respect of whom it is necessary to have these provisions as it is in respect of persons doing the same type of work in depôts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>That position will arise equally in the city, because every laundry I have ever heard of has, in addition to the ordinary clerical staff, a window, or something of the sort, at which work is received, and many of the laundries in the city have no outside shops at all.  They are merely receiving depots in the actual laundry, so that conditions in that respect are not different from those in the country. I quite agree that the members of the staff are definitely excluded, but the premises still remain a shop, although there may be no member of the staff a member for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>And for the purposes of the Hours of Trading Bill, too.  If you do not amend the definition in this Bill, you will not amend it in the other Bill.  If this passes as it stands, the Minister will not accept an amendment on the Hours of Trading Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy agrees that it does not make much difference whether the amendment is to this Bill. or not, but in fact he is leading up to an amendment of the Hours of Trading Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>It matters more in respect of that Bill because it is possible that a closing order might be made which would restrict the hours of work more than they are already restricted by the Conditions of Employment Act.  Supposing a closing order is made for 6 o'clock this week and next week.  It is essential in every laundry that on at least two or three nights they should work until 9 o'clock to get work out for Christmas, but if this order is in force, while the Conditions of Employment Act will allow us to employ the girls, the Hours of <Col N="2287" /> Trading Bill would not allow us to keep the premises open.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that?  My objection is purely academic, but I do not like businesses that are really factories shoved into this Bill.  I am sure the Minister will agree, and I think he might look into it and see if he could not set the matter right before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell will appreciate that Deputy Benson's apprehensions arise not from the provisions of the Hours of Trading Bill, but from the possibility of an order being made under it which would be contrary to the interests of the laundry business.  I do not think it very probable, but I think we may be able to devise some system which will prevent these apprehensions having any ground at all.  It will not be easy to do it, but I will consider that aspect of it.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister's feeling on this amendment is, but it is designed to make it perfectly clear that the sub-section applies to a wholesale shop.  Customers do not resort to all wholesale shops, and in moving this amendment, I am seeking to make the position with regard to a wholesale shop absolutely clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is, of course, to extend the scope of this legislation to cover wholesale shops where the conditions of employment are somewhat similar to those in retail shops, as distinct from wholesale shops that are mainly offices and not warehouses in any sense.  I do not know what difficulty the Deputy anticipates will arise from these words.  In some wholesale shops it may not be the practice of customers to resort to the premises, but it is, in fact, open to customers to resort to the premises if they wish, if <Col N="2288" /> merchants have goods for sale wholesale, even though the sales are mainly to customers dealing with agents or by post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was narrowing the definition &ldquo;wholesale shop,&rdquo; and that that made the intention not quite clear where customers did not resort to the premises.  However, if the Minister is perfectly sure that premises where customers do not resort to them are covered, I am satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the amendment for the first time, and studied it in relation to the section, I was inclined to agree with the Deputy that these words did not serve any purpose. A difficulty arose from the fact that there are some types of wholesale shops which are, in fact, offices. There may be some goods kept for display purposes, or as samples, but the work done by the staff is mainly clerical and not that of shop assistants. I wish to distinguish that type of establishment from a wholesale establishment which is, in fact, one where shop assistants are employed under much the same conditions as in retail shops.  The distinguishing difference appears to lie in these words.  The words are not satisfactory and I would undertake to consider the point later.  It may be better to leave the words there, even though that may mean including a certain type of establishment that we had not intended to cover in the Bill.</P>

Mere exclusion does not settle the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A messenger is in a somewhat different position.  I do not think it would be practicable to bring messengers within the scope of this Bill at least to make the same hours <Col N="2291" /> of work and other general conditions apply in respect of them as apply to the shop assistants on the premises. In fact, I do not know how we can best secure that any abuses in connection with the hours and employment of such persons will be remedied. Undoubtedly, certain abuses arise in respect of the hours of employment of persons of the messenger class, but it is not quite so easy to regulate those hours as it is in the case of industrial workers and shop assistants.  Persons engaged upon messenger duties must, presumably, complete those duties, and I think there must be a somewhat more liberal provision in relation to the time necessary to do that than in the case of a person working in a factory. As regards the latter, you can say that he must not work after a certain hour in the evening.  When that hour comes he should, and must, cease work and leave the premises, but in the case of a person delivering a message he cannot just stop half-way up the street and leave the parcel on the pavement and go home any more than a person delivering goods by motor-lorry can pull the lorry into the kerb and walk away when the clock strikes.  Consequently, a somewhat different type of regulation of hours of employment is required in relation to such persons from that of shop assistants or industrial workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What that type of regulation may be I am not quite clear at the moment. I have certain ideas in my head, but I have not explored them or submitted them to the test of criticism by persons who will be up against whatever practical difficulties may be involved. At any rate I do not think it would be possible to bring that type of person within the scope of this measure.  I agree that some regulation is required in respect of that class of person.  I am willing and anxious to receive suggestions as to how regulations might best be made, but I do not see that we can fit those persons into this Bill.  It is for a different reason that I wish to exclude from the Bill persons in the canvasser or commercial traveller class.  I do not think they require protection of the kind provided here, or that it would be in their <Col N="2292" /> interest that they should get such protection. They do not suffer from abuses of the kind that the persons for whose benefit this Bill is intended suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the attitude that the Minister has taken up on this amendment.  The conditions that prevail in the country and in the city are altogether different.  If the Minister were to accept an amendment extending the scope of the Bill, and apply its provisions to people other than shop assistants, then I venture to suggest that would lead to all sorts of complications and difficulties.  We have had the experience of other measures, of simple amendments being made to them when going through this House, and then of finding, when the measures were given practical effect, that results were produced that we never dreamed of.  If the scope of this Bill were to be widened you would have all sorts of people coming in under it.  It is a measure that should be confined to shop assistants.  If other classes of workers require protection, then let them get it in a separate measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a certain amount of force in some of the remarks made by the Minister on this amendment.  I recognise that there might be certain difficulties in applying the measure to commercial travellers and commission agents.  I may say that I had not that class in mind at all when the amendment was put down.  I do suggest, however, that the words, &ldquo;within such shop, and is wholly or mainly,&rdquo; actually limit the scope of the Bill to people employed within the four walls of the shop.  If a person is employed outside the shop, but on work related to the business done in the shop, then under this definition he will be excluded from the scope of this measure.  On the question of messengers, I suggest to the Minister that the whole purpose of the Bill is to give protection to a class of people who have to work inordinately long hours, and if that applies to any class of workers employed in shops, it surely applies to the messengers who, in many cases, are out day and night delivering goods.  I put it to the <Col N="2293" /> Minister that, either under this amendment or by some other means, he should legislate to ensure that messengers will come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty of regulating the hours of messengers. He pointed out, for instance, that a messenger, when out delivering a parcel, could not stop half way up a street and leave it on the pavement when the clock struck.  We are not dealing here with an Hours of Trading Bill, but with a Conditions of Employment Bill.  If a messenger, in certain circumstances, has to work very long hours on one evening, something might be done to have that considered as overtime, or perhaps it might be made up to him by working shorter hours on another day.  I do suggest that there is a definite need for bringing messengers within the scope of the Bill.  It is unlikely that in going ahead with his code of legislation the Minister would contemplate bringing in a separate Bill to deal with messengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not contemplate anything of the kind.  There is no such intention, but I did intimate, when introducing the Conditions of Employment Act last year, that the whole problem of persons engaged in that type of transport was being considered and that, in fact, the third of our series of Bills would be designed to deal with those persons.  There is no fundamental difference between a messenger who travels on foot, carrying a basket, or delivers parcels on a bicycle, and the man who drives a motor lorry.  The problem that arises in relation to the one is the same as that which arises in relation to the other.  We excluded those types of person from the Conditions of Employment Act last year, just as we exclude them from this Bill, but the intention is to deal with all those persons&mdash;persons mainly associated with transport operations&mdash;in one measure. That measure will have to be of a different character, I think, from either this Bill or the 1936 Act.  It is not intended to leave their conditions of employment subject to no regulation. <Col N="2294" /> They will be covered by the next Bill, which will deal with the type of worker who is engaged in transport either on foot or in a motor car or lorry.  I could detain the House some time pointing out the difficulties which might arise if we were to attempt to deal with that class of worker in this Bill.  If an amendment were to be inserted on the lines that Deputy Heron suggests, I do not think that we could confine it to the persons the Deputy has in mind.  I am afraid that we would have to take in a whole lot of other people, such as bread van drivers, people driving around in cars selling milk, and quite a number of others.  I feel convinced that quite considerable difficulties would arise unless we approached the problem of the regulation of their hours on a somewhat different line to that which is adopted here, and that is what we intend to do in the next Bill.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that there is a class of shop assistant concerning whom it is uncertain whether or not they would come under this Bill if that phrase &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; is allowed to remain.  Let us take the case of boys attending petrol pumps. There is probably a couple of hundred boys employed doing that, and it must be remembered that sometimes these pumps are not directly part of a garage, and might be some distance from the main premises.  I submit to the Minister that, in the Bill as it stands, it would be uncertain whether these boys, or girls, as the case may be&mdash;because I understand that some girls are employed in such work&mdash; would be included under the terms of the Bill.  I am sure that it would be the Minister's intention to include them, but I am not sure whether the <Col N="2295" /> case of such people would be covered by the Bill, and I think that the Minister should give that matter some further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is intended that persons so employed&mdash;persons in the retail trade&mdash;in circumstances such as Deputy Moore has described, should be included.  Section 3 of the Bill refers to the extension of the Act to places where any retail trading is carried on.  It says that the provisions of this Act shall extend to any place where any retail trade or business is carried on as if that place were a shop and as if in relation to any such place the person by whom the retail trade or business is carried on there were the proprietor of that shop.  There is a somewhat similar provision further on in the Bill, I think, which is designed to achieve the same result. If any question is raised as to the effectiveness of these provisions, I am prepared to consider them, but the intention is that persons employed under such conditions as have been described will be covered by the Bill in the same way as if they were actually employed in a retail shop premises.</P>

      <P>Well, the section says that the provisions of this Act shall extend to any place where any retail trade or business is carried on as if that place were a shop.  Well, you are carrying on a retail business when you have a petrol pump.  However, there is another matter about which I should like to have a definition from the Minister, and that is how he expects the phrase &ldquo;members of the staff&rdquo; to be construed when you are dealing with a refreshment or a licensed premises.  You see, what is said here is that the expression &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; when used in relation to a shop means any person who does for the proprietor any work which is wholly or mainly performed within such shop and is wholly or mainly <Col N="2296" /> in connection with the serving of customers, or the receipt of orders or the despatch of goods, and so on.  In the case of a refreshment house or a licensed premises, what is meant by the serving of customers?  It seems to me to be a very vague term.  You may narrow it down to the case of a waiter or a waitress, but take the broader meaning of it and you must include the case of the cook or the other attendants in the house who also serve the customer. What does the Minister intend?  Does he intend that all the servants of a hotel or a refreshment house should be included, or does he merely intend that it should be only the waiters or waitresses, as the case might be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed a certain disinclination to extend the scope of this Bill to cover clerical workers, and I am afraid that I must press this point.  It may be that certain classes of clerical workers require a Bill of this kind and that <Col N="2297" /> they require protection by some such Bill.  Representatives of the Trades Union Congress whom I met, in fact, urged that, of all the persons employed in some classes of shops, clerical workers required protection more urgently than any other class of workers.  That, however, I think was mainly in relation to the wages paid rather than to the hours of work or the conditions of employment, although the conditions of employment and hours of work were also very definitely mentioned.  I do not see, however, that we can effect the same type of regulations here as in the case of shop assistants.  I should be disposed to have the general question of the conditions of employment and hours of work of clerical workers considered separately.  I have no desire to minimise the difficulty that there may be in effecting any similar type of regulation in regard to such workers as we are proposing in relation to industrial workers and to shop assistants, because it must be remembered that, in the case of clerical workers, the relation between employee and employer is often of a confidential nature and of such a character that the same considerations do not exactly arise as in the case of industrial workers or shop assistants. However, if it is felt that, apart from the compulsory provision for paid holidays and the regulation of wages, there is need nevertheless for the control of the conditions of employment and hours of work of clerical workers, then I think that the clerical workers associated with shops should come under such regulations&mdash;that is, regulations that would apply to them as a class and which would have regard to their functions as clerical workers rather than to the fact that the clerical workers concerned had to do with a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that most of the clerical workers Deputies had in mind would be of the class of the cashier in a shop, and so on, and I think that these are covered by the Bill.  The type of clerical worker not covered by the Bill would be, I presume, a person employed in the accountancy department, which is not so different from <Col N="2298" /> the function of a person employed in the accountant's office in a factory or any other type of employment such as that of an insurance company.  To attempt to regulate the hours of work of such people, however, I think would be a hopeless task, and I do not see how we can do it.  It may be desirable, however, to effect some means of wage control and it is intended to make a compulsory holiday provision, but I am afraid it would be very difficult to attempt to regulate the hours of work of such workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quite see the Minister's difficulty in regard to clerical workers as a class apart from clerical workers employed in shops, but I think that an investigation would reveal that, in shops generally, the clerical staffs are treated on the same basis as the shop assistants, and that, so long as the shop is open, the clerks are on duty just the same as the assistants, and that they go off duty when the shop assistants go off duty.  It seems to me, therefore, to be obvious that in a Bill of this kind which, amongst other things, will require the setting up of some kind of an inspectorate and will necessitate the carrying out of certain inspectorial duties, it would simplify the matter to have the clerks employed in shops dealt with on the same basis as the shop assistants.  As the Bill stands, I think it is doubtful if even the people to whom the Minister refers, such as cashiers and so on, are included.  It is doubtful if, say, the cashier and the book-keeper employed in a shop are included.  I do not see why the whole clerical staff of the shops should not be treated on the same basis as shop assistants, and why that should not be made clear in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the scope of the definition and the statement I made that cashiers were included, the terminology used is similar to that used in the 1912 Act, and has been the subject of a judicial decision.  There is no reason for apprehension on that score. If there were, I would move to amend the Bill to make the point expressly clear, but I am assured that it is not necessary.  On the second point raised by the Deputy, it is, of course, clear <Col N="2299" /> that the clerical staff to whom the provisions of the Bill do not apply need not necessarily be employed in the shop premises at all, and, in fact, they would not in many cases.  If one considers the case of multiple shops, the clerical staff doing the accountancy work for these shops will probably be in some central premises, and not upon the actual shop premises of the firm at all.  In other cases, of course, the accountancy work and the actual trading work will be done within the same walls, but that need not necessarily be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Where that is the case, is the Minister satisfied that they are covered by the Bill as it stands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons who have no direct connection with the actual business of the shop&mdash;I gave as an example persons in the accountant's or secretary's office&mdash;are outside the Bill. Persons who have direct association with trading in the shop, even as clerks, persons doing clerical work, such as a cashier receiving money and giving out receipts, etc., are covered, and have been held to be covered by the corresponding definition in the 1912 Act. But the clerical worker who is outside the Bill is doing precisely the same type of work as a similar clerical worker would do in relation to a factory, an insurance company, a stockbroker's office, or some other type of commercial establishment.  In so far as their conditions of employment require to be dealt with, they should be dealt with as a class, the same as shop assistants are dealt with as a class.  Even though there may be no comparison between the type of work done by one assistant and another, we can deal with them as a class.  We can set down certain general conditions which must apply to them as a class, and they are different from those we would apply to clerical workers.  In their case I do not think we should try to be anything as rigid in the matter of regulating hours of work, whereas we might require to be more rigid in the protection of earnings and certain other aspects of employment.</P>

Take the case of a clerical worker engaged in a shop who, possibly, never serves a customer, but who might make an entry for that customer, or for the delivery of goods for that customer.  That is No. 1 clerical worker.  Then there is another clerical worker who is in another part of that shop, who never is near a customer, and who is making entries in connection with the business, but who is on the premises.  Are both of these covered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that it would be much easier from the Minister's <Col N="2301" /> point of view&mdash;he, of course, is the best judge of that&mdash;to legislate for clerks employed in shops while he is legislating for shops.  I think insurance companies, railway companies, and even small offices like solicitors' offices who employ clerks, might be grouped together in considering clerical work.  But I think the clerks employed in shops, such as invoice clerks and other people actually working in shops, should be definitely included in this Bill.  However, with the Minister's assurance that he has in mind future legislation to cover this class, I am quite satisfied to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In practice, most of the clerks employed in shops are covered by the Bill.  Invoice clerks, which he mentioned, will be covered.  The type which is not covered is one whose work is so detached from the business of the shop that it cannot be held to come within the definition.  They are very few in number in connection with shops and they will be mostly in relation to multiple shops.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), at the end of line 18, to add the words&mdash;&ldquo;and when used in relation to a refreshment house includes any person who does for the proprietor of such refreshment house any work which forms part of or is ancillary to the business of such refreshment house&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the position of a refreshment house defined in the Bill. It is stated to be a hotel, restaurant, café or tea-shop.  The question is what is the position of a number of the staff of such an establishment.  What line will be drawn?  For example, will the kitchen staff or porters be included? Will any of the staff in connection with the hotel portion of the establishment be included?  This amendment will bring them in.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say as to the dividing line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Bill <Col N="2302" /> as it stands is quite satisfactory in this aspect of it.  That is to say, I do not think the definition is sufficiently clear to avoid the possibility of confusion arising.  When I met representatives of the Trade Union Congress I tried to express the matter in this way.  I said that we intended to cover everybody employed in a restaurant and everybody employed at similar work in a hotel.  But I do not think that it is quite sufficient to say that or that the Bill in fact does it because various anomalies might arise.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me for and against the application of this Bill to hotels.  I had very strong representations from an organisation of hotel proprietors against the application of the Bill on various grounds and equal representation from organisations of workers in favour of its application and an unusually large number of personal letters from individual hotel workers all over the country relating to their conditions of employment, some of which revealed rather extraordinary circumstances to exist in some cases.  The difficulty comes in when you try to draw the dividing line between what constitutes hotel work and what constitutes domestic service.  I do not think that by a Bill of this kind we should attempt to regulate the conditions of employment of domestic servants.  But clearly a very large number of persons who are classed, say, for the purpose of the Unemployment Acts, as domestic servants are in a different class from persons who work in hotels and who do in hotels work similar to that which domestic servants do in private houses, or in clubs, or similar establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is any similarity between the work of a hotel and the work of a shop, where the work done in a hotel is in connection with the serving of customers or the receipt of orders, then I think we can reasonably apply the conditions of this Bill to that work. If I were starting in this matter again, I might be more inclined now to take the line that hotels are not shops and that the problems arising out of the conditions of employment in a hotel should not be tackled in a Shops Bill. A lot of our difficulties arise from the <Col N="2303" /> fact that we are trying to deal in this Bill with work that should not properly arise on a Shops Bill.  The question of work in hotels should, I believe, be tackled separately.  We have, however, tackled it in this Bill but I do not think that we have solved our problems altogether by doing so.  Does a domestic servant in a hotel, whose ordinary work is cleaning, making beds and similar activities of that kind, come within the scope of this Bill if she serves a cup of tea in a guest's bedroom in the morning?  Clearly, a waiter who serves a cup of tea in the diningroom comes within the scope of the Bill.  If one, why not the other? These are the types of questions that arise, questions which it is very hard to answer.  If we were to attempt to cover all classes of persons employed in the hotels, then I think the question of what constitutes a hotel might arise at once for consideration.  There are many places throughout the country which are called hotels, where undoubtedly a casual guest will be provided with hotel accommodation for a night, but where casual guests are very few and where the main business of the staff employed is doing the ordinary domestic work of the proprietor's family who reside in the hotel.  To attempt to distinguish between the work done as a domestic servant of the proprietor and work done in association with what is described as a hotel, would be very difficult.</P>
    <P>I think we shall consider this matter again and try to get a clearer definition of the type of hotel work and restaurant work to which the Bill will apply.  The intention is to ensure that we will cover everybody in a restaurant &mdash;because we consider that everybody in a restaurant is engaged in serving customers, the receiving of orders and so forth&mdash;and to try to cover corresponding workers employed in hotels and similar establishments.  I do not think that will be easy.  It might be even desirable to take hotels out of the Bill altogether and to deal with them separately.  The only objection to that is that certain anticipations of improved conditions amongst hotel <Col N="2304" /> workers have been aroused and they would not like to see them postponed, nor would I like to postpone them.  It might have been the more satisfactory course to have taken in the first instance, and to approach the matter as if we were not dealing with a Bill which attempted to deal with hotel workers, but we had better go ahead now.  I think it will be necessary to get clear definitions of the type of work involved.  On the general question and the definition of the class of workers employed, I should be glad to get the views of persons directly interested or concerned in this business.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would leave the amendment for the moment, I think it would be better.  I do not think that we should attempt to pass this Bill this week.  Too many points are likely to arise in it, or have been already raised by organisations of workers and employers in various retail trades, to enable us to dispose of the measure now.  If we could get it through Committee Stage this week, get all these various aspects referred to and the various problems set out, we could adjourn the next stage until after Christmas, particularly as the Dáil is meeting early after Christmas, and then recommit the Bill.  In this Committee Stage we shall be able to eliminate a number of the more contentious matters and in relation to others we shall be able to define them and to set out what the problems are, leaving it to the recommittal stage to put these matters in legal language.</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that the Minister will find it very difficult to include hotels in this Bill, because hotels are quite different from shops and must be regarded from a different point of view.  The Minister said that certain hopes had been aroused and that he does not want to disappoint them.  I quite understand that, but this Bill will go through the Committee Stage and will then remain over until after the vacation. During the vacation the Minister <Col N="2305" /> could work out a Hotel Bill and possibly have it ready so that it will not be more than a week or so afterwards until it could be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main Act connected with agricultural produce (fresh meat) was passed in 1930.  Since then there have been points arising out of it that were obviously worthy of consideration in an amending Bill.  A number of these points have accumulated, and this Bill is intended to deal with them. In the first place, Section 2 of the Bill gives the Minister discretion to refuse an application for registration.  At the present moment there is a certain doubt about that.  It is thought by some people that if an applicant were refused registration he might perhaps, by going to the courts, be in a position to compel the Minister to grant the application.  I think everybody will agree that there should be some discretion left to the Minister to refuse an application, because it is quite obvious that if a person were to set up in opposition to a person already in the trade, no good purpose would be served.  Therefore, there should be the usual discretion that is given to the Minister under all these Bills, of refusing an application where there are at present adequate facilities for anybody who wants to dispose of pork, lambs, or whatever the particular line may be.  There are, as a matter of fact, 38 licensed premises registered <Col N="2306" /> under the Fresh Meat Act.  There are 34 exporting pork, 16 exporting mutton and lamb, and three have beef exporters' licences.  That shows, of course, that some of them are engaged in more than one business.  At the moment there is nobody exporting fresh beef.  There was only a very small business in it at any time, and the beef was exported to Great Britain.  There has been a prohibition against the export of fresh beef to Great Britain for the last five years, and therefore there is no business in that line being done.</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2), of this Bill removes from the Minister the obligation to have premises inspected on application.  If anybody were to apply for a fresh-meat licence under the present Act, the Minister must carry out inspection of the premises, and must give a fortnight's notice of his intention to do so.  Where a person's application has been turned down on more than one occasion, it is hardly fair that every time that person makes an application the State should be put to the expense of having to serve notice that the place would be inspected on such a date, and actually carry out that inspection, but such is the position under the present law, and it is sought to repeal that in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill deals with Section 13 of the Principal Act.  That Act provided for a deposit of £12 10s. with each application for an exporter's licence, and the retention of that deposit if that licence were granted. Since the Bacon Act was passed the position has been very much changed, because, under the legislation dealing with pigs and bacon, premises must be inspected in the same way as they were formerly inspected in regard to the export of fresh meat.  In the case of a factory which has already been inspected, and where the premises are properly constructed, and so on, there does not seem to be any justification for compelling the proprietor to lodge £12 10s. if he wishes to go into the export of pork or lamb.  In fact, this Bill seeks to remove the obligation on an applicant of lodging £12 10s. where he has already a licence under the Bacon Act as passed last year.  Section <Col N="2307" /> 3, sub-section (2) seeks to bring this provision into operation as from 1st July last, because since that date, when the Bacon Act came into operation, there have been at least, I think, three applications.  They happened to be from small factories&mdash;the big ones were already licensed&mdash;near the Border that had to make an application for exporting their offals.  From the point of view of those small factories, £12 10s. is rather a substantial amount, and the Department has not collected that £12 10s. in the hope that the Dáil may pass this Bill.  It is, therefore, sought to make this section operate as from the 1st July last, so that those three small factories to which I have referred may be permitted to retain that £12 10s. which they would have been compelled to lodge under the original legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the certificate given by a veterinary examiner. Under Section 37 of the original Act, it would appear that if the veterinary examiner were to adhere strictly to the Act he would have to give a certificate for every carcase and part of a carcase condemned as unfit for human consumption.  In a number of factories &mdash;sometimes big, sometimes small&mdash; the veterinary examiner has a very difficult day's work on some occasions, because in some of the medium-sized factories and the small factories in particular a great part of the killing is done on the one day, perhaps on a fair day or a market day.  The veterinary examiner has a very busy day, and it would be very difficult for him to fill up a certificate in every case where a part of a carcase is condemned. If this Bill is agreed to, this section will permit him to cover all his condemnations in one certificate. It does not make any difference, as far as efficiency goes, but it does relieve him of a great deal of filling up forms, signing them, and so on.  It permits him to short circuit his work as far as that is concerned, but it does not relieve him in any way of his inspection work, which must be carried out as it always has been.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the minimum fee payable by holders of pork exporters' licences.  Under the Agricultural <Col N="2308" /> Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts, there were certain minimum fees set out, but they have of course, to a large extent, been replaced by the fees under the Pigs and Bacon Act. Considerable fees will be payable under the Pigs and Bacon Act, because there is a fee payable, on the same principle as under the original Fresh Meat Act, for every pig slaughtered. I should perhaps go back to the original idea when the main Act was brought in in 1930.  It was foreseen at the time that a veterinary surgeon must be employed, whether whole time or part time, for each of those factories that were getting fresh meat exporting licences; and naturally it was considered at the time by the Government that there should be a minimum fee, so that people would not come into this business for the sake of exporting a very small quantity of fresh meat in the year, but still entailing quite considerable expense on the State in the way of veterinary examination.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there was a minimum fee prescribed for every applicant.  There is, of course, a minimum fee also under the Bacon Act, but suppose we take it that a bacon factory is maintaining a veterinary surgeon as an inspector, and they were to go into the pork trade as well, it is considered that there is no justification for putting a minimum fee on the pork licence as well as the bacon licence, because there is no additional expense on the State.  The veterinary surgeon is already there, and it only means a little extra work for him, for which perhaps he may have to be paid a little more if it is a part time post.  Of course, if he is a regular employee of the Department of Agriculture, in other words a civil servant, then he is expected to do a man's work and is not paid any more for it.  In any case there would be no point in charging a minimum fee as a pork exporter to that bacon factory, and it is laid down here in Section 5 that that fee should be dropped&mdash;that is the minimum fee for a fresh beef exporter's licence where the applicant is already a holder of a bacon licence.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 there are set out paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  Paragraph (a) deals with a simple case where only <Col N="2309" /> a pork exporter's licence is held by a bacon curer.  Paragraph (b) deals with such a person who held also another licence under the Fresh Meat Acts, such as a beef exporter's licence or a mutton exporter's licence, and (c) deals with such a person who held two or more exporter's licences other than a beef exporter's licence.  There are therefore, different divisions under (a), (b) and (c), and they are dealt with in that way in the Bill.  It is necessary to set them out in that way, because the original 1930 Act follows on those lines.  I do not know if Deputies who were here in 1930 will remember that the Fresh Meat Act, 1930, did apply also to goats and horses.  As far as my recollection goes, I do not know if any fresh meat exporter ever did actually apply for a licence dealing with horses, but the Act did actually apply.  Finally, it is desirable to bring Section 5 into operation as from 1st January, 1937, because the Pigs and Bacon Act was brought in on 1st April, 1937.  A number of matters which have been dealt with since 1st April, 1937, have to be regularised by this measure and, therefore, it has to be made retrospective so far as that particular section is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained already that the section gives the Minister discretion to refuse an application for registration.  It is held by some of our legal advisers that we have got that discretion.  There are others who hold a contrary opinion, and there is a certain doubt.  It is held by those who say we have not that discretion that if an application were refused it is possible the courts might hold that the Minister is compelled to grant a licence, provided the premises were properly constructed, as laid down by the Act. It is quite obvious that in certain cases the Minister should have discretion to refuse, as he has under Acts of a similar type.  It happens sometimes that a <Col N="2310" /> person is in the fresh pork business, and some business rival wants to go out against him.  He applies for a licence. That does not do any good to the producer of pigs.  It may give a certain gratification to the person applying, in order to put the other man out of business, but I do not think it should be encouraged from the State point of view.  Therefore, I think the Minister should have this discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I have often given expression to this complaint before, but a practice has grown up in the House under which Ministers, when introducing measures, go on to explain what the various sections are for.  Most people can gather what is the meaning behind the sections. What we would like to get is some introductory statement giving reasons for the legislation.  I do not know that I have heard, in the last five years, anything like a lucid explanation as to why a particular measure was brought in.  With regard to Section 2, there have been up to this certain rights on the part of certain people who applied for licences.  Some people have had them over a period of seven years, certainly for five years. Now, at a moment's notice, this right is to be determined by a clause in an amending Bill, and the only explanation is that it is not going to increase the price of pigs anywhere.  I may say that between the Minister and the Pigs Marketing Board they have settled the price of pigs and the production of pigs in this country.  This year we exported live pigs to the value of £430,000.  When the Minister was over here telling us how agriculture should be managed and what a deplorable position the farmers were in, the value of the pigs exported&mdash;I am talking of the year 1931&mdash;was £2,158,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had all these Bills since the advent of Fianna Fáil, and what have they done towards the improvement of our pig production?  I daresay the Minister would be quite entitled to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that I am irrelevant and that I should more correctly deal with what is in this Bill.  I know that quite well. More power is to be given to the Minister&mdash;that is one of the things that is indicated in this measure.  He can <Col N="2311" /> exercise absolute discretion with regard to granting or refusing a licence.  He ought to be aware that, as a result of the Government's interference, with all their officials and with the multiplication of inspectors and so on, the articles that the people have to buy have increased considerably in price and yet there has not been a single farthing added to what the farmer is able to get&mdash;the man who, possibly, is responsible for the Minister being there and for the position of others who are in the enjoyment of Ministerial office.  I do not know what case can be made for Section 2.  What the Minister seeks to persuade the House to agree to is that registered slaughterhouses, once they have been granted licences, should retain those rights and no other person will be entitled to get them except in the Minister's absolute discretion.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 4, I would like a better explanation than the one the Minister gives.  There again we have an official of the State getting plenary powers to assemble all the diseased portions of whatever meat is in the factory into one spot.  Personally I would prefer that there would be a certificate in each case and that he should see the condemned meat destroyed, if possible.  If all the diseased meat is going to be piled in the one place and no steps taken to have it destroyed, there is a very grave danger of some part or parts of the meat being taken out and again put in with the fresh meat.  I think the Minister ought not to agree to this thing of giving what I might call an omnibus certificate.  It is much more likely that greater care will be exercised if there is a certificate issued in regard to each carcase or part of a carcase and have it immediately destroyed.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister says in regard to Section 5 is true&mdash;if a man pays in respect of one item and it practically covers other items&mdash;I think there is an advantage; at least the costs are not going to be increased.  Will the Minister tell the House what an unfortunate pig is assessed at from the time it leaves the producer, the damage it has incurred to the State, the Bacon <Col N="2312" /> Board or any other institution of that sort, so that we will get some idea of the charges it has to bear on its back, apart from the fat and the lean?</P>

      <P>I would just like to make some reference to the restrictions that have been placed already on this business.  I happen to be connected with the Cork Farmers' Union abattoir, which was set up and financed by farmers.  Owing to the control and the discipline that have been instituted, the trade of that particular concern is now very considerably curtailed. If there is further curtailment, as appears likely, the position will be that the farmers will suffer.  I am afraid I do not welcome the various points made with regard to this Bill.</P>

      <P>When I entered the House the Minister was speaking and I thought I had probably missed some explanation as to the purpose behind the Bill.  What I would like to know from the Minister is what does he hope to achieve by this measure; in other words, was there any necessity for it, or what is the necessity for it?  I do not know that we exported very much fresh meat except pork.  Is there some abuse which the Minister seeks to check? What is the purpose of all this legislation? Is the Minister trying to check an abuse, or is it an endeavour to develop something which we have not yet developed?  I am merely looking for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An Act was passed in 1930&mdash;the Fresh Meat Act&mdash;and, invariably, we find in this type of legislation that a number of amendments are necessary.  In respect of practically every Bill which has been passed on behalf of the Department of Agriculture during the past ten or 12 years, there is a file in the Department of suggested amendments.  When we come to a point at which an amending Bill is necessary on some point, these other proposed amendments are produced.  What made this Bill urgent is that double fees are being collected in some cases as a result of the Pigs and Bacon Act.  A person who is in the pork business as well as this business is paying on the <Col N="2313" /> double.  We are also meeting a number of small points.  Deputy Cosgrave went into the realm of trade in pigs.  I think that it is unfair to quote the number of live pigs exported this year as compared with 1931 without quoting the figures for bacon.  If you add these figures, the result is not nearly so bad as the figure quoted by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave offered objection to giving the Minister discretion under the Bill.  I am sorry he has gone out, because I should like to have reminded him that he thought he was giving the Minister for Agriculture discretion in 1930.  As a matter of fact, any layman reading that Act would come to the conclusion that the Minister had been given discretion.  Some legal doubt was thrown on that and note was taken of it so that next time a Bill was being brought in it would be made right.  The principle of discretion was established by the last Government and followed by this Government in regard to this type of legislation.  If anybody reads Section 2 and compares it with the Principal Act, he will see that that is the effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave was aware of what actually takes place in the examination of pork and bacon, he would be quite satisfied because the procedure is exactly that which he advocated.  The veterinary surgeon is very busy in these rush days.  He examines certain parts of the pig. Nearly every farming Deputy has seen the procedure from time to time and I do not want to go into gruesome details.  The veterinary surgeon becomes suspicious that a pig is affected with tuberculosis and he condemns the whole pig or parts of it.  These are put aside and there is a heap of them at the end of the day.  We are, however, fortunate in this country that we have not a lot of tuberculosis in pigs.  All the veterinary surgeon will have to do under this Bill is to serve a notice on the owner to destroy the stuff he has condemned.  Under the present Act, he would have to write a certificate for each part of a pig which he condemned.  The stuff is all collected and is then destroyed. It will give the veterinary surgeon somewhat less trouble to operate in <Col N="2314" /> this way than to follow the provisions of the original Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked what was the cost of all this legislation.  The cost is 6d. per pig.  I think that very good value is given.  Under the Pigs and Bacon Act, we can definitely say to consumers, whether at home or in places to which we export our bacon, that not an ounce of bacon leaves our factories without veterinary examination, so that people can be absolutely sure that they are getting wholesome bacon.  Sixpence is not a big fee to pay for that service.  The cost is not increased under this Bill.  In fact, it will be cut down because the double fees will go wherever they occur. That is going to cut down the cost of inspection to the trade and we may take it that, where the curer has to pay, it is the producer who suffers in the long run.  I do not know whether Deputy Brasier, when he referred to the curtailing of the trade in Cork abattoir, had in mind the restrictions or the quotas allocated by the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks up that matter he will find that a similar question was raised several times about various factories.  When I inquired as to the figures, I always found that the factory concerned was doing as much business in 1937 as, if not more than, they were doing before these restrictions came into operation. It is obvious that they must be doing more business, because more pigs are being killed.  Deputy Brennan asked what fresh meat we were dealing with. The Fresh Meat Act dealt with beef, lamb, pork, goat and horse.  This Bill does not change that.  No person applied for a permit to deal in horse or goat meat.  These provisions are, however, in the original Act and I suppose they will hardly be used.  The meat with which we do deal is pork and lamb.  This Bill may be taken to apply to pork and lamb.</P>

    <P>In the Bill as it stands there is a very wide definition of relatives who are excluded from the provisions of the Bill, and it seems to me that the relatives of small shopkeepers require the protection of this Bill just as much as other employed persons.  In previous shops legislation, in the 1912 Shops Act, for instance, the only exclusion was the family of the shopkeeper, resident, I think, on the shopkeeper's premises, or something to that effect.  In this case, relatives are exempted to a large extent, and I think there is a strong case for limiting the number of exemptions. The reason the amendment suggests cutting out the younger generation from the exemption is that while there might be a case for the old people hanging about the shop day and night, there is a case for limiting that in respect of the rising generation, or the younger relatives.  I do not see why the relatives of the shopkeeper should not be put on the same footing, so far as this Bill is concerned, as shop assistants.  Apart altogether from the merits of the case in respect of the shopkeeper's family, there is the other consideration that a shopkeeper who is getting his work done by his own relatives is in competition with another shopkeeper who has to employ persons from outside, and has possibly an advantage and, therefore, making all the conditions in the Bill more difficult of enforcement.  I think there is a strong case for limiting the number of relatives exempted.</P>

      <P>My amendment goes quite the other way.  My suggestion is that it is a very ordinary thing for persons in business to get up relatives and train them in that business.  They are really adopted children, and they become members of the family, and, according to the Bill, if they are living in the house with their relatives, they are really in the same position as children.  I submit that if a nephew or niece comes up to live with an uncle or aunt in Dublin, he or she should be regarded in exactly <Col N="2317" /> the same way as the son, daughter and others whom the Minister has in his Bill.</P>

It is, I think, desirable on general grounds to exclude from the scope of legislation of this kind the immediate relatives of an employer, where those immediate relatives are maintained by the employer and reside with him in his premises.  That is what we set out to do by this sub-section of Section 2. The particular definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; which we have embodied here is taken from the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney may remember that he raised the question of nephews and nieces when the Workmen's Compensation Act was before the Dáil as a Bill, and the arguments I shall have to make against his contention are similar to the arguments I made on that occasion.  I do not think we should go so far as to carry the exemption of persons to that degree of kindred.  It is, I think, not unusual for licensed premises' owners to go to quite considerable pains to hunt up relatives for the purpose of avoiding the obligations which would otherwise rest upon them in respect of the conditions of employment enforced by the trade union catering for the class of worker employed in licensed premises, and I fear that a somewhat similar state of affairs might develop if we were to extend the degrees of kindred set out there to any extent.  It might well lead to shopkeepers in various parts of the country dispensing with the services of existing employees for the purpose of replacing them with nephews and nieces, and thus avoiding altogether the obligations imposed on them by this Bill in relation to the conditions of employment of those who work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I do not think we should go as far as Deputy Heron would have us go, and exempt from the definition in the Bill such persons as sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, or brothers or sisters.  We have any number of sons, daughters, brothers and sisters, half-brothers or <Col N="2318" /> grandsons, and where they are residing on the same premises as the employer, and are maintained by him, I think we can regard them as being so intimately associated with the ownership of the business that it is inappropriate to apply to them the various conditions which would otherwise be applied by placing on employers the obligation of giving these people certain annual holidays and other benefits, or to give them power to go to the Wages Board to have wages defined and so on.  I appreciate that this is somewhat a difficult point, but I think we can take immediate relatives of an employer who reside with him and put them into a different category from the ordinary employees.  We are really setting out to deal with conditions of the ordinary employee, the man who is selling his labour for wages, and who has no other intimate relationship with the employer than the contract of wages.  It is for such persons the Bill is designed.</P>
    <P>If there is any point to be made that abuses might arise, or that certain special advantages might be secured to particular employers by giving employment, to immediate relatives only, we could deal with that by amendment of the appropriate section. Wherever such questions as the employment of juveniles arise, or where orders are made limiting the number of juveniles in a shop in relation to adults, we take into account as adults persons who may be relatives of the proprietor working on the premises. In relation to this section, any appropriate suggestion of that kind can be considered.  I doubt if it would be wise to adopt the course suggested by Deputy Heron, or the alternative suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. We have a definition here of &ldquo;relatives&rdquo; which has, at least, the sanction of precedent, in so far as it appeared in other legislation and it emerged as a result of long discussion when that legislation was being enacted.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to bear in mind that the mere fact of relationship between a proprietor and the persons concerned does not exempt the proprietor from the provisions of the Bill unless condition (b) also exists, that the relatives <Col N="2319" /> reside with the proprietor and are maintained by him.  I think it is better to leave the definition as we have it.  I know that it could be argued for a long time as to whether a half-brother, a granddaughter or a grandson should be in or out of the definition.  In the last resource it seems to me, in the interests of common sense, that it would be unwise to do what is suggested by Deputy Heron or by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken has given the real justification for the amendment.  It is precisely to ensure that a shopkeeper who is a good employer will be treated on the same basis, by law, as the shopkeeper who is a bad employer and who exploits assistants, whether they are his own relatives or not, that the change is suggested.  I find it difficult to see why a difference should be made when one is, so to speak, protecting human life.  If life is made tolerable for shop assistants, why should it not be made tolerable for relatives in shops?</P>

      <P>If you allow relatives to be outside the provisions of the Bill, that may give the person who does not employ assistants a definite advantage over those who do employ assistants.  Most of us who are familiar with shops know the system that prevails in the country of relatives being taken into the business. Relatives are installed to carry on the business on the assumption that when the shopkeeper passes out a niece or a nephew will succeed to the business. For the next ten years that niece or <Col N="2320" /> nephew may be a positive drudge, and may be treated worse than a paid assistant would ordinarily be treated. Then, owing to the adverse conditions, the niece or nephew might simply have to walk out.  From the other angle, in order to protect the relatives, they should be included and protected by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate the practical difficulty of enforcing a Bill in relation to intimate relatives of an employer who reside with him.  It could not be done.  You can make a law saying that these people must work for 48 hours only but, in fact, they could not refuse to work certain hours, nor could you prevent them doing so.  There would be no point in putting that into legislation, because it could not be observed. Bear in mind that they are intimate relatives living with the employer in his house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points to which the Minister might give further attention.  The first point is outstanding, that an undue advantage is given to an employer who is able to carry on his business with the aid of those in the family circle, and they are excluded from the provisions of this measure.  That employer has an advantage over competitors, and having that advantage, this measure may destroy something that it is endeavoured to bring about freedom for shop assistants that they never had before.  If you are going to destroy that freedom there is no advantage gained by the Bill.  As regards protection for relatives in the family circle, we know that employers who employ relatives, instead of being generous to them, take advantages that they could not take with strangers.  It may be said that those inside the family circle could join a trade union in which they could obtain protection, but they are reluctant to join a trade union because they know it will bring the wrath of the employer on their heads. If relatives in the family circle leave that type of employment, outside employers are reluctant to employ them, believing that there is something against them.  The Minister should <Col N="2321" /> take these points into serious consideration. For these reasons, I feel that it would be a disaster to allow such people to escape their obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister's outlook on these amendments.  I think you could argue up and down as to the degrees of relationship that ought to be included or excluded.  It seems to me that not enough has been made of one point, and that is: why should not relatives get the same conditions as regards hours as shop assistants?  Is somebody going to make the case that, under this Bill, the hours are absurdly short, and, therefore, that a man's relatives may quite easily work a while longer?  It seems to me that shopkeepers who have relatives living with them and working for them are of two kinds.  They may be generous people and treat their relatives in exactly the same way as ordinary employees; they pay them the same wages and give them the same hours of work.  If that is done, I do not suppose that this Bill is intended to apply to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case where people are possibly inclined to take their relatives at something less than their market value, it is entirely in a proprietor's hands to say what he will pay them, and, apparently, it is also left to him to say what hours he will work them.  In my opinion a relative ought to be in no better and in no worse position than any other human being.  The Minister has made the point that he cannot check that up in the case of relatives. I quite agree that that may be so in some cases, but if flagrant cases occur, and I suppose there are such where relatives are consistently worked longer hours than ordinary assistants, I imagine that in such cases some one will be found to come forward and give information.  I do not think that this legislative body should take up the position that relatives are in any different position from that of ordinary employees.  As to the number of <Col N="2323" /> hours worked, the treatment of both should be the same.  The question of wages is a different one.  I am not going to try to draw the line as to what relatives ought to be in or what relatives ought to be out, but, personally, I would like to see them on the same footing as other employees.</P>

      <P>There must be some exclusion.  When Deputy Lawlor was speaking of a shopkeeper employing his relatives, and in that way getting an advantage over his competitors, he drew a picture which might possibly appear occasionally in some area at some time, but it is not the typical picture that Deputies should consider. What Deputies should keep in mind when considering the amendment is the typical picture of Mrs. Mulligan, who runs a huckster's shop and who is assisted by her daughter, Miss Mulligan.  If the House were to adopt the amendment to exclude sons and daughters from the definition section, then Mrs. Mulligan would have to put up an abstract of the Act for the benefit of her daughter, Miss Mulligan, and keep all records prescribed under the Act, and in all other respects would have to treat the daughter who assisted her as a salaried employee.</P>

      <P>I think the same lady reappears in almost every constituency. That is the type of shop that I ask Deputies to keep in mind, and in relation to such establishments it is obviously unwise, if not foolish, to adopt any amendment which means that a son or a daughter in that relationship is to be put in exactly the same position as a salaried employee. Undoubtedly, you may come across the <Col N="2324" /> case of a shopkeeper with four or five sons who will exploit their labour and get some competitive advantage on that account.  That case is not typical, however, and applies no more to the retail trade than it does to farming or any other occupation.  I think, however, it would become more general if we were to extend the definition to the extent that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney suggests.  The relationship between cousins is obviously less intimate than between father and son, or brother and brother.  In cases where you have a father and a son, or a brother and brother carrying on business in the same premises, it is impossible for the law to step in and try to regulate their relationship with any degree of exactness. It cannot be done, and I do not think that we should attempt to do it.</P>
      <P>The possibility that a shopkeeper may be placed at some disadvantage by reason of the fact that he has to employ others under the terms of this measure does not warrant, in my opinion, any alteration in the definition.  The position might become serious in some areas if we were to extend the definition.  I am not prepared to extend it, and, on the other hand, I do not think that we should restrict it. We find this definition in previous legislation passed by the Dáil.  I refer to that fact merely to indicate that this question has already been before the Dáil when it was the subject of considerable debate; and this definition of what is a &ldquo;relative&rdquo; has been put in merely on account of the fact that it represents the best effort which the last Dáil could achieve in that connection, and which, I am sure, the present Dáil would find it difficult to improve upon.</P>

    <P>This amendment of mine concerns relatives who are not actually physically living in the same premises of the proprietor of the establishment, in a case where there is not room in the house of the proprietor to accommodate them.  Of course, we all know that, in a great number of houses, there is a shortage of accommodation, and I submit that, if the accommodation in such a house is not sufficient to enable the employed relative to reside in that house, it is reasonable that, if he resides out, he should receive the same treatment as the ordinary assistant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am afraid that we would be going very far if we were to adopt this amendment.  I think there is a case, as I have said, for exempting a relative who resides with the employer in the employer's house, but to try to deal with the case where there is not sufficient accommodation in the employer's house, and where the employed relative lives elsewhere, would create great difficulties, because, of course, it would mean imposing on the inspector, or upon whomever was thinking of taking proceedings under the Act, the obligation of being satisfied as to the adequacy of the accommodation in the house of the proprietor, and if the inspector could not satisfy himself on that point, then, in fact, the amendment would operate to exempt the relatives concerned, no matter where they resided, from the conditions of the Act.  I do not think that we could go that far.  I am certainly in sympathy with the idea the Deputy has in mind, but I think that his amendment&mdash;or at least the interpretation of it&mdash;would go much farther than is intended and that it would be interpreted as extending the provisions of the Act to a much greater extent than the Deputy himself has suggested in his remarks.  In view of that, I think we should hesitate about accepting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose the amendment, Sir.  It seems to me that, in the minds of a good many members of this House, there is the <Col N="2326" /> idea that any degree of exploitation of shop workers or shop assistants is justified provided that the employed person happens to be a relative of the shopkeeper.  At an earlier stage and in view of the Minister's attitude, I advocated a further delimitation with regard to the exemption of relatives of employers who come within the scope of this Bill.  For the same reasons, I now urge the rejection of this amendment.  This idea of bringing in relatives of employers who do not live on the premises of their employers is simply an endeavour to take away from the Bill the value that it has as a protection for certain persons in the community against unfair exploitation.  I think that, possibly, the best case that can be made for the Minister's attitude in regard to the limitation to persons living on the premises of the employer is the difficulty of the enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  I admit that it would be very difficult for an inspector to deal with a situation where the persons actually lived on the shop premises, but I do not see any justification whatever for enabling a shopkeeper to engage in a special degree of exploitation of his employees simply because he can claim that these employees happen to be relatives of his.  Therefore, I hope that this amendment will not be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>Now, the Deputy is young&mdash;I mean that he is young to the House&mdash;and I suggest that a little restraint is very good for youth. At any rate, the Deputy seems to be impressed by the idea that everybody in this country is inhuman and that the one idea in life of everybody in this country who has got a relative <Col N="2327" /> employed, who is a young person, is to bully and browbeat them and give the worst possible life to that person.  That is not the case at all, and I should imagine that, in 999 cases out of 1,000, the relative is very much better treated by the proprietor than is the paid assistant of the establishment.  That, certainly, is the thing that one would expect, and I believe it is the thing that one would find in most cases.  My amendment is not to the effect that such a person should be worse treated than the shop assistant, but that the regulations, which the law may find it necessary to bring in to regulate the relations between master and employee, ought not to apply as between the members of a family and the head of that family.  Probably the relative is much better treated than the ordinary assistant, and probably, in a great number of instances, he works very much shorter hours and gets holidays off and days off that a paid assistant may not get.  At the same time, however, he may work for a much longer period on one particular day.  There might be a race meeting on one afternoon, to which one might want to go, and the relative might be let off for that occasion, but the paid assistant might not be allowed off.</P>

If these employers are prepared to have their relatives working under decent conditions, they have nothing to fear from the provisions of this Bill, which is merely laying down a certain minimum with regard to the conditions which are regarded as being tolerable for people working under the conditions concerned; and I take it, therefore, that the people employing <Col N="2328" /> relatives, in such circumstances, will be only too glad to avail of the provisions of this Bill.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 29, to delete the word &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this deals with the same point as is raised in amendment No. 33 later on.  The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to bring into conformity with this measure what has been a popular opinion in many circles, concerned with the raising of the school age and the raising of the age for absorbing youth into industry.  While the general trend of opinion, as annunciated at Trades Union Congresses and at the meetings of other representative bodies, is that the age ought to be 16, I take it, therefore, that the amendment is modest and that there is every reason why it should be acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to state that at many conferences which have taken <Col N="2329" /> place between representatives of employers and trade unions the question of employment of juveniles was under consideration and there was, practically speaking, no hostility on the part of employers in certain industries, or in almost all the industries in reference to which that particular matter was raised.  But they certainly did maintain that, in order to make it effective, it ought to be universal. This measure gives an opportunity of reaching the half-way house, if I may put it that way.  Instead of pressing for the age of 16, as has been done by other bodies up to now, the amendment says 15 years.  Employers have stated, on the other hand, that they will be satisfied to meet the trades unions in connection with the matter of absorbing juvenile labour, but that it should be universal.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that this is an opportunity which will not occur again for a very considerable time, and I should like very much that he should accept the amendment.  I see no reason why it should not be adopted.  We all know, with the changes which have taken place, the difficulty that confronts young lads or girls who are absorbed into industry at 14 years when not properly educated and the fight they have in after life.  At the present time that fight is more intense than it was some few years ago.  If the Minister accepted this amendment, he would certainly meet many points that are worthy of consideration.  He would make this universal and it would be a benefit to the children as well as to the people who are going to be absorbed into employment later.

      <P>I made that remark for the purpose of emphasising that the general problems associated with juvenile employment cannot be tackled piecemeal; in fact, if they are to be <Col N="2330" /> tackled at all in any systematic way, a beginning must be made at some other point than restriction on the employment of juveniles.  This question of raising the school-leaving age hardly arises on this Bill, but I would remind the Deputy that it has been the subject of very careful examination and the report of a commission, which has been set up to consider it, has been published. The general feeling, I think, is in favour of raising the school-leaving age and, consequently, the age of entering into industrial employment. There may be a difference of opinion in rural areas upon certain aspects of the problem, but, so far as urban areas and industrial and commercial employment are concerned, the general view is undoubtedly in favour of raising the school-leaving age and the age of entry into employment.  But there are practical difficulties, and these difficulties are not removed merely by prohibiting young people from being employed in certain occupations until they are 15 or 16 years of age.</P>
      <P>The immediate difficulty, of course, is the provision, not merely of school accommodation, but of an adequate system of instruction in schools, if and when the accommodation is provided. If the school-leaving age were raised to 15 to-morrow, there would be a complete inadequacy of school accommodation and of everything associated with school accommodation for a very considerable time.  Not merely would that scarcity of accommodation, lack of suitable teachers, and other difficulties arise, but I gather that educationists are of opinion that the benefit to young persons would be negligible.  In other words, that it is impossible to work out an addition to the existing primary school programme covering one year only which would be of any real benefit to students; that if we raised the school-leaving age to 15, the last year would be practically a repetition of the previous year; and that if any educational purpose is to be served by the raising of the school-leaving age, it must be to some point beyond 15; that the added period must be more than a year, if any useful system of instruction is to be devised which will be of permanent benefit to the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2331" /> The problems associated with that aspect of the matter are, of course, being examined by the Department of Education.  In fact, the Department of Education, as the Deputy may be aware, are proceeding along the lines recommended by the commission&mdash; which was to deal with this problem of raising the school-leaving age, not by the general application of a new rule, but by what I may call an experimental development in particular localities. That was the recommendation of the commission, that instead of enacting legislation raising the school-leaving age to 15 or 16 for the whole of the country, in particular districts the age should be raised when the accommodation had been provided, when the programme of instruction had been worked out, and teachers trained in the provision of that instruction.  When the Department of Education has made progress in its particular sphere of activity, then I think we can, at some stage, consider this question of limiting the age of entry into industrial or commercial employment.  I do not think that we should do it before then. If we were to insert the amendment in this Bill, the only effect would be to prevent persons between 14 and 15 years of age getting employment in shops.  We would not prevent them from getting employment; we would merely prevent them from getting employment in shops.  I am not sure that that is desirable.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other problems which arise, problems with which no doubt the Labour Party are familiar, or should be familiar.  In other countries where they have raised the school-leaving age they had to take into account the circumstances of working-class families where the income, small as it might be, which juveniles over 14 years of age could bring into the household was of importance, and, consequently, they provided, by various methods, for substituting for that income some other means of support for the family while the children were attending school over the age of 14 years.  That particular aspect of the whole problem has been also dealt with in the commission's <Col N="2332" /> report to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>With the general proposition that the school-leaving age should be raised, at any rate in the towns, and that, as a consequence, the age of entry into industrial and commercial employment should be further restricted, I am in complete agreement. I think, however, that it would be wrong to start by restricting the age of entry into employment; that the start must obviously be made by raising the age up to which children must attend school.  Before that can be done, a great deal of preliminary work has to be undertaken and a great deal of preliminary expense to be met, because, of course, the provision of new school accommodation, additional teaching staff, and all the rest, cannot be done without considerable cost.  If we are to contemplate a general extension to the higher age to cover all children in towns and cities, some provision may also have to be made in the other direction to which I have referred; that is, in the matter of making good to poorer families the income which these children might have earned if the change had not been effected.</P>
    <P>This question has arisen on other Bills, of course.  It is a simple matter for me to speak against Deputy Lawlor's amendment on the ground that no purpose would be served by preventing the employment of such juveniles in shops when they could get employment in factories or other less healthy occupations, but I do not want to defeat the amendment on that ground.  I am urging that it should not be adopted because it is a long way from setting about solving this problem, a problem which we all want to see tackled and a problem on which I feel action will ultimately be taken. The beginning must be made at the education end, and until some progress has been made at that end we can hardly consider legislation of this kind. Remember, the school-leaving age was raised to 14 and the Compulsory Attendance Act was passed when there was no restriction on the age at which children could be absorbed in industrial occupations, so it need not be considered that the amendment is an <Col N="2333" /> inevitable consequence of the raising of the school age.  The raising of the school age would be in itself effective to achieve the end which the Deputy has in mind, when the necessary preliminary steps have been taken, the necessary finances provided, and the machinery brought into existence which will enable that to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim to be an educational expert, but undoubtedly it is, in my opinion, desirable that any increase in the school-leaving age should be associated with the adoption of a system of education which would have a definitely vocational bent.  I think that is desirable, but what the educationists tell me is that it is not possible to do that on the basis of a one-year programme only, that one year would be too short a period to afford any instructional value to the pupils; that if the school-leaving age is to be raised at all in a way that is to have any educational value for the students, it has got to be a two-year period which will be added.  Whether that is so or not, I do not know.  I do not claim to be an expert on this subject, but the problem has been considered by experts whose views are available in the published report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Lawlor's amendment would defeat its own purpose, because if juveniles were not, as the Minister suggested, absorbed in some form of employment, it would mean that they would have to spend one year free of any control, because, presumably, the male parent at least would be working. They would be out of school at 14, and they would be for one year completely out of control.  They would not, in many cases, be useful members of an establishment after that year of absolute freedom.  I quite agree that something should be done, and if by means of vocational tests such as have been instituted by the Institute of Industrial Psychology, tests could be carried out during the last year at <Col N="2334" /> school, and could be followed up by one or two years' vocational education, the result would be to make these juveniles very much more useful to a factory, shop, or whatever other form of employment in which they might be absorbed.  As the amendment stands at the moment, I think it would defeat its own object.</P>

      <P>I think we are all glad to hear the Minister express his sympathy with the object in view.  He maintains, of course, that it is practically impossible to have it included in a Bill of this kind.  He has referred to the report of the departmental committee which inquired into the question of the school-leaving age.  I am glad to know that he has not, expressly at any rate, approved of the statement in that report that children of fourteen are not too immature to enter into industry.  I hope I am right in assuming that he does not endorse that view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if I could help it, but this is a different question.  The question is whether it is better for children to remain at school, or to get into an occupation where they will be able to learn a certain type of skill that will be of benefit to them in after-life.  That is an open question. For certain classes of occupation, the actual transposition from the school to the factory can be done at that age. It does not mean that the education of the juvenile has come to a stop, but that his education will take a different form, and very few means of vocational instruction are available unless provided in a factory associated with a particular work.  Of course we are not dealing with factories now, and that is a theory which does not apply to most forms of shop work.  While I should like to see a general system which would permit of young people remaining at school for a longer period than they are now required by law, at the same time I do not think it does <Col N="2335" /> all the harm, which has occasionally been stated, to have them going to work at 14 or 15 years, provided the work is work of a healthy kind and likely to help them to something better in after life&mdash;in other words, that it is not blind-alley work, which is merely a source of a few shillings a week for the parents and of no benefit to the juvenile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1922" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he started to work early himself, but that he would not start his children to work early.  I take it that the higher grade civil servants who framed this report would not permit their own children to start work at 14 in a factory. They would prefer to send them on to the university, provided out of public funds and maintained out of the rates that all of us pay.  The Minister said he considered this a right age to bring them into a factory.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware of the fact that manufacturers in Great Britain a few generations ago maintained it was absolutely essential for the welfare of British industry that children of seven or eight years should be brought into cotton factories. They needed workers with pliable fingers to handle the cotton, and these would not be available unless they brought in children of immature years. Well, now, we should have moved away from all that.  If there is a lot of people idle in the country, it is better to have fully-grown men and women absorbed in industry than to force in immature children.  The Minister raises a point in regard to the question of adding an extra year after 14 and says that certain preliminaries would have to be introduced. I offer him an alternative, to take off a year at the other end, so that the minimum age at which children would be admitted to school would be seven instead of six.  Instead of forcing very young children to go to school to get them out of the way, it would be much better to have school attendance enforced between the ages of seven and 15 rather than between six and 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I withdraw the amendment, I should like to make a few remarks.  A point has been made by the Minister in reference to the child's help to the family by going out to work at an early age.  I think the Minister will admit that in the overwhelming majority of cases a child helps only for a short time.  That help brings about the sacrifice of that child for the balance of its life, and certainly does not tend to make it a good and decent citizen.  The Minister may have worked before he was 14, but he is one of the few, and he was not working in a blind alley occupation.  The overwhelming mass of the juveniles of this country who go into industry under 14 years of age are going into blind alley industries.  The result is that to-day you will find nearly every street corner in Dublin offering its quota of young men and young women who have worked only for a couple of years, starting at 14 and getting left off at 16.  I am pleased that the Minister can see there is good reason for the amendment, and I am satisfied that the contention he is making as regards its general application cannot be found in my amendment.  It would undoubtedly have to come from the other end, where the school leaving age would be compulsorily increased. Therefore, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 30, after the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert the words &ldquo;including the work of an accountant, clerk or other person employed in an office.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 defines what shop work <Col N="2337" /> means.  It declares that the expression &ldquo;shop-work&rdquo; means &ldquo;work (whether within or outside a shop) which is connected with or ancillary to the business carried on at a shop, but does not include work in connection with a wholesale shop&rdquo;, and so on. The object of this amendment is to ensure that the expression &ldquo;shopwork&rdquo; will also include &ldquo;the work of an accountant, clerk or other person employed in an office&rdquo;&mdash;then the section goes on to operate again&mdash;&ldquo;which is connected with or ancillary to the business carried on at a shop&rdquo;.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that when we come to find what shop work is we will not exclude from the provisions of this Bill and from such benefits as are provided in the Bill a person who is employed as an accountant, clerk, or in any other capacity in an office which is connected with or ancillary to the business carried on.</P>
    <P>I am leaving those words in the section, and consequently the ancillary character of the work of an accountant, clerk or other person has to be established in order to bring the person within the scope of the Act. Frankly, the object is to extend the scope of the Act, and bring into it persons who are employed on work of an ancillary kind, such as an accountant, clerk or person employed in any other capacity which is not covered by the title of accountant or clerk, but who will, nevertheless, perform certain tasks in connection with the business which is carried on in the shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion I expressed the view that it would be undesirable to extend this Bill to cover persons who are engaged in purely clerical work only, that is, clerical work, in relation to shops, of a similar character to clerical work done in relation to any other form of commercial activity.  In so far as clerical workers are engaged in shop work in conjunction with the serving of customers, or the receipt and <Col N="2338" /> despatch of goods, they come within the scope of this measure, but the type of person who is engaged in other forms of clerical work which have no direct relation, to the actual form of activity carried on is not covered, nor do I think he should be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a shop carried on in a particular premises in town&mdash;an ordinary shop for the purpose of dealing with customers; it might be for the purchase of drapery goods, for instance.  Let us assume that upstairs there is a person working as a book-keeper, keeping the accounts of that shop, and another person whose job is the sending out of invoices or the posting of ledgers in respect of the purchases which are made downstairs.  Do I understand from the Minister that in his opinion those people are excluded from the scope of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy included a number of people in his definition.  In the ordinary course, a person whom I would describe as an invoice clerk is covered by the Bill.  I put that person in a different category to the person who is employed purely in the accountant's office, keeping the books of the concern.  It is very hard to get a definition.  The actual definition which appears in the Bill here has been the subject of legal interpretation in the past, and possibly will again in the future.  The type of person whom it is not intended to cover by this Bill is a clerk who is doing in relation to a shop precisely the same type of clerical work that he would be doing if his employers were operating a factory or an insurance company or a betting office or any other type of commercial activity.  If the person is employed in any way in relation to the actual business of retail trade, then that person is covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned here before, in relation to those clerical workers, that, while there may be a case for general regulation, it was not as easy to effect it as in the case of shop assistants or industrial workers.  We could, of course, provide certain safeguards in respect of wages, and in so far as I am familiar with the <Col N="2339" /> circumstances under which a number of clerical workers are employed, I think that is the safeguard which is most urgently required, but I do not think it would be possible to regulate, with the same degree of precision as is possible in the case of other classes of workers, the hours of work or other conditions of employment.  We are providing them with a statutory right to holidays, but I should not like to have to undertake the task of regulating the other conditions of employment, because it is not unusual&mdash;in fact I would say that, on the contrary, it is quite usual&mdash;that the relations between those clerical workers and the employers are on a different basis to those of other workers.  They are more confidential.  They involve a greater degree of personal trust, and so forth, in the ordinary case.  There may, of course, be establishments where a huge number of clerical workers are employed, and the thing is run as a machine, but that is the exception, and in relation to those establishments the abuses to which I have referred do not as a rule exist, because their very size ensures against them in the ordinary case.  I do not think we should attempt to extend this Bill beyond those who may be regarded as shop assistants, that is, those who are engaged in any way in connection with the serving of customers.  I do not mean to confine it to those brought into actual physical contact with the customers; it applies to those whose work has any connection with the serving of customers or similar activities carried on in shops.</P>

Those persons will, in fact, be found to include, in respect of the great majority of retail trades, every person employed.  In fact, it is only in the case of multiple shops, where the accountancy and office work are separated altogether from the actual business of individual establishments, that the distinction will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment is not to bring clerical workers generally within the scope of the Bill.  I recognise there must be a limit to its scope.  But here we are purporting to frame a code for persons engaged in shop work, and we proceed to say that this Bill will apply to the assistant.  I take it that it will apply without question to the cashier&mdash;will that be so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the person who actually deals with the accounts of the customer who makes a purchase, presumably, will not be included, and the person who keeps the books in relation to that purchaser's credit facilities or payments will not be included.  That seems to me to be an indefensible restriction.  If we are going to permit the cashier and the dispatch clerk to be included, why should we not permit the book-keeper and the person who does the general work of keeping the accounts of customers who shop on the lower floor of the building?  It might be argued that they are in because they are doing work ancillary to the business carried on at the shop, and I think a court might well rule that the person who keeps the accounts created by the customer making purchases downstairs in the shop is, in fact, performing work ancillary to the business carried on in the shop.  I think the way in which that could be arranged is that this type of work includes the work of an accountant, a clerk, or other person employed in the office, all the time bearing in mind the governing <Col N="2341" /> phrase &ldquo;work which is connected with or ancillary to the business carried on.&rdquo;  That ensures that an ordinary accountant, any private accountant, could not come along and say that he is within the scope of this Bill.  The person who would be included would be the person who would be doing work connected with or ancillary to the business of the shop. That would not let in the general clerk.</P>
      <P>Take the case of an ordinary establishment in the city.  The clerical workers go to work the same time as the shop assistants; they go to lunch at the same time and they are off in the evening at the same time as the assistants. Why should we apply this measure solely to the assistants and leave out the ordinary clerks who are dealing with the accounts of the customers, and why should we leave out the accountant or the book-keeper who keeps the accounts?  I suggest there is a very much stronger case for extending the scope of this Bill to the persons I have mentioned rather than for limiting the scope of the Bill and prohibiting the inclusion of these people.  I think that if you include these people it will be found that the Bill will be much easier and simpler to work.  I would like the Minister to consider the matter with a view to covering that type of employment, all the time reserving the governing provision that the work must be connected with or ancillary to the business carried on at the shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree to that.  I gave my views on the subject on an earlier amendment before Deputy Norton arrived.  Without desiring to repeat myself too often, I would like to say again that in my opinion, in so far as clerical workers require protection in regard to their conditions of employment, they should be dealt with as a class.  I do not think we should deal with a certain group of clerical workers in this Bill, merely because they are clerical workers employed in connection with shops, any more than we should deal with clerical workers employed in factories in legislation governing employment in <Col N="2342" /> factories, or any more than we should deal with clerical workers in insurance offices in legislation affecting insurance. We might consider it desirable to introduce general legislation covering clerical workers, no matter where they are employed.  I use the term &ldquo;might&rdquo; because I see considerable difficulty in devising a suitable type of legislation and enforcing it after we had enacted it.</P>
      <P>There is one, and possibly there are two, matters in respect of which provision for clerical workers could be said to be needed.  The first matter has relation to holidays.  They should be given the same statutory right to public holidays and annual holidays as shop assistants are getting under this Bill.  We may propose to do that for them by embodying them in a general measure covering all workers not already covered by legislation.  The second matter is in respect of their earnings.  Quite a large number of clerical workers are employed&mdash;not usually in connection with shops, but in connection with other occupations &mdash;at wages which are unduly low, and some means of enabling such persons to protect themselves and ensure reasonable remuneration for their labours may have to be devised by law.  To that extent I am quite prepared to go, but I could not see my way clearly to go beyond that in the regulation of the conditions of employment of clerical workers, because there are difficulties that I do not think Deputy Norton has quite considered. He merely sees these clerical workers as members of the staff of the shop, and his point is that, if we are dealing with the shops, let us include these.  I see them as a class, the same as I see transport workers, and a line of demarcation must be drawn somewhere.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is the practical way to do it.  I have been considering this matter, because I got representations on the subject.  As regards clerical workers, I am going to give them, by legislation, the benefit of the holiday provision of this Bill. If circumstances should arise to facilitate it, and if it were clearly necessary, I would be prepared to introduce legislation in relation to clerical workers somewhat similar to the wages part of this measure.  But I have not got in my head any clear idea as to how you could go beyond that satisfactorily in the regulation of conditions of employment of clerical workers.  In some types of establishment it could be done; in others it could not; but that is a question to which I would like to give further consideration before giving any opinion. I would prefer to deal with the clerical workers as a class, the same as we propose to deal with transport workers as a separate category of workers and the same as we are dealing with shop assistants as a separate category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to find out what portion of the clerical workers the Minister is proposing to cover, and I should like to have that clearly stated.  I am afraid the consolation that I received in the debate on an earlier amendment has been shattered by the discussion on amendment No. 16. The Minister referred me to work which is wholly or mainly performed within the shop and is wholly or mainly in connection with the serving of customers.  Deputy Norton starts in to try and analyse where the Minister cuts the cord in connection with serving a customer.  It is quite clear that the assistant who takes the order or displays the goods is a shop assistant. I raised a point about somebody who might be in a department <Col N="2344" /> standing there, possibly taking down that order for the salesman or assistant. The Minister extended the scope still further, I thought, when he spoke about a clerk who is making out invoices, that he is included. Deputy Norton mentioned the book-keeper who puts those invoices into the ledger.  Apparently those clerks are also connected with serving a customer.  Now, if you come down the other end of the line and follow the goods as they travel out, you find the dispatch clerk in the delivery department and the person who keeps a book recording the deliveries.</P>
      <P>The Minister says&mdash;I hope he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that all these classes are &ldquo;in connection with the serving of customers.&rdquo; He used the analogy of the betting shop, and said that the people employed on that class of business in a retail establishment did not come within the scope of this Bill.  I am only anxious to get a definition of who is and who is not covered by the Bill.  As regards the analogy of the betting shop, letters would be received in the morning.  In a retail establishment, letters would also be received.  Evidently, the clerical workers operating in connection with these letters would not be covered. The Minister also spoke about a factory. In a factory, they make purchases. So does a retail establishment. Evidently, a book-keeper who kept a creditors' ledger would be outside the scope of the Bill, while one who kept a debtors' ledger would be inside the scope of the Bill.  A person who prepared invoices would be inside the terms of the Bill, and a person who dealt with out voices would be outside the scope of the Bill.  I should like to know if that is the position, because we are all anxious to know where we stand.  The Minister will have to get down to some more precise definition than that in line 14.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point so that we should have a clear-cut idea as to the clerical people who are within the terms of the Bill and those who are outside the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell has made clear that, with the definition <Col N="2345" /> in the Bill, it is difficult for anybody, including the Minister, to say who are covered as people engaged on shop work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

    <Speaker pid="ArchieHeron" hpid="Mr. Heron Mr. Heron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has failed to get the force of the argument for a change in the definition. Deputy Dockrell is concerned only with having the definition clear and knowing who is included and who is excluded.  We, of this Party, are concerned with something more than that.  We are concerned with having a clear definition, but we are also concerned with having a definition that will include all shop workers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has seen the inside of a shop and he knows that it usually contains an office.  In that office, in the case of the larger shops, there is a cashier, who would be actually in contact with customers and who would clearly come within the definition in the Bill.  Besides that cashier, there might be a ledger clerk who would be entering up customers' accounts.  Is it suggested that the cashier will be within the terms of the Bill but that the ledger clerk will not because he is not in direct contact with customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister talks about the need for legislation on somewhat different lines for clerical workers outside shops, we all agree.  That is a different problem.  The problem with which we are dealing is that of clerical workers employed inside shops.  If there is to be a line of demarcation drawn, you could hardly have a better one than that which would be drawn around the shops.  It is illogical to include certain clerks, and anybody who happens to be in contact with customers, and to exclude those clerks sitting beside them because they are not in contact with customers, notwithstanding that they are working in the same shop and under the same conditions and for the same hours as those included.  I suggest that the Minister should make the definition clear and should include everybody employed in a shop.  The introduction of clerical workers in insurance offices, banks and other establishments did not seem to me to have anything to do <Col N="2346" /> with this question.  The present position seems to me to be ridiculous. If you have inspectors enforcing this legislation, one of them may go into a shop and see that the provisions of the Act are being complied with in respect of everybody but the ledger clerk.  He will pass him by and say: &ldquo;I shall come next week, or some other inspector will come, and look after you.&rdquo;  Surely it would simplify the matter, from the Minister's point of view, to include all people employed within the four walls of a shop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put another point to the Minister.  With the development of the telephone, the practice of ordering goods by telephone is growing.  Deputy Dockrell will probably confirm that.  A person may ring up a shop, ask the prices of certain commodities, order certain commodities, ask when they will be delivered, and direct the bill to be sent to him.  The employee is there dealing with a customer.  He may be a clerk employed in the office, because you cannot have a telephone at the counter where particular goods are stocked.  Why should not that employee be brought within the scope of the Bill in the same way as an ordinary assistant dealing with a customer? If the Minister said that all employees other than those standing behind the counter would be outside the scope of the Bill, I could understand his contention, but here we have a section which says that the Bill applies to persons engaged in shopwork, that work being defined as &ldquo;any type of work connected with or ancillary to the business.&rdquo;  You do not mean by that the actual serving of a customer.  It means something over and above that.  It means work extending into another domain such as that of cashier, dispatch clerk, or a person who would answer the telephone and take an order of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister brings these workers within the scope of the Bill, he is clearly driven to including certain clerical workers employed in the shop.  Why not go further and say that, in these circumstances, the shop is the proper line of demarcation and <Col N="2347" /> that all clerical workers employed in the shop are, in fact, covered by the Bill?  If, at a later stage, legislation is introduced to deal with clerical workers generally, it would be possible, by repealing certain portions of this Bill, to transfer the clerical workers affected to the new Bill.  At this stage the most convenient course is to bring in all clerical workers whose business is ancillary to the business of the shop. I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter in the light of the difficulties to which attention has been drawn.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dockrell wants to suggest any alteration in it, I am prepared to consider it, but, in my opinion, if you attempt to become more precise in relation to the class of persons covered by it, you will become more restrictive, and it is not necessary to do so.  There are in relation to the terms used here a number of legal decisions which make it considerably easier to draft this legislation knowing precisely the consequences it is going to have.  So far as Deputy Norton's point is concerned, I can say only this to him, that if he says that clerical workers require the protection of legislation of this kind as shop assistants require it, that transport workers require this protection, or that any other class of worker not covered by the existing Act require it, I am inclined to agree with him, but this is a Bill to deal with shop assistants, and I want to confine it to shop assistants.</P>

      <P>I would not say that, nor do I think it wise that we should use terms of that kind.  I draw the line around the shop, and I say that anyone who works in that shop is covered by the Bill.  Deputy Norton wants to go further and take in the whole building in which the shop is located, and to include the office of the firm operating the shop, although that office may be on the opposite side of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The office where the accounts of the firm are made up and the profit and loss determined is distinct, in my opinion, from the shop. In the average medium-sized shop this question will not arise at all, because the people who are doing that type of clerical work are either proprietors or persons otherwise engaged in connection with the shop, but in the larger establishments there is a clear distinction between the shop and the office.  We are dealing with the shop, and everyone who works in the shop, even though the work he does is clerical work, is covered by the Bill.  We are dealing with the type of people who work in the shops as members of the staffs of shops, and I propose to resist any movement to get beyond that.  I think it was a mistake to have gone beyond that in relation to hotels, but we have gone there now and we will stay there.  I think it might have been better to have kept hotels out of this legislation, as not being shops and as offering different problems from those which arise in shops, but to the extent to which they are in we will have to keep them in if we can get over the purely drafting difficulties involved.  I want to confine this legislation to the members of staffs of shops, leaving out the purely clerical workers whose association with shops arises from their employers operating shops, as would be the case if those employers operated factories, and leaving out the <Col N="2349" /> purely transport workers and certain other people who might be employed, such as electricians and plumbers.</P>

      <P>You will get overlapping cases.  When the Conditions of Employment Act was before us, I mentioned that Woolworth's had been held to be a factory because there was a girl behind the counter printing visiting cards.  These cases will arise where some difficulty of interpretation or application develops, but I am setting forth here the general idea behind this Bill, and, while I am prepared to consider any proposal designed to ensure that that general idea will be carried out, I am, at the same time, prepared to resist any proposal to extend that general idea.</P>
      <P>I am at one with Deputy Norton, or any other Deputy who urges that similar legislation is required for other classes of workers.  I agree fully with that, but I say that it should be done by separate measures, and not by extension of this Bill.  We should confine this to persons who work as members of the staffs of shops&mdash; anybody doing work which is defined here as work proper to be done by the members of staffs of shops.</P>

      <P>On the section, I wish to call attention to the wording of sub-section (3), which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Save as is otherwise expressly provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act shall extend to any place where any retail trade or business is carried on as if that place were a shop and as if in relation to any such place the person by whom the retail trade or business is carried on there were the proprietor of that shop.</P>
      <P>What happens where different classes of trade are being carried on in the same part of a shop?  Take the ordinary country shop, where over the same counter alcohol, cutlery, boots and a lot of other things are being sold. There is only the one counter, and you have a mixed general business being carried on over it.  This seems to contemplate that a person is selling boots, alcohol, etc., over different counters. That is not done in the ordinary country shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That point does not arise here.  If a person is selling one class of goods in one part of the premises and another class of goods in another part of the premises then the whole of the premises is regarded as a shop.  There is no difficulty in determining that fact.  The case that we are attempting to meet here is where the business carried on in part of the premises is not a retail business.  Where a retail business is carried on in some <Col N="2355" /> part of the premises then, for the purposes of the Act, the whole of the premises is deemed to be a shop.</P>

      <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to the definition of the expressions &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; and &ldquo;shop work&rdquo;.  To my mind &ldquo;shop work&rdquo; is given a much wider definition than &ldquo;member of the staff.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; is said to mean any person who does any work which is wholly or mainly performed within the shop and is wholly or mainly in connection with the serving of customers or the receipt of orders or the despatch of goods or the unpacking or packing of goods and is not industrial work under the Conditions of Employment Act.  The expression &ldquo;shop work&rdquo; is said to mean work which is connected with or ancillary to the business carried on at a shop, and so on.  On Deputy Norton's amendment I think that certain clerical workers would be out as members of the staff and in as doing shop work, so that it seems to me that these two definitions are in conflict.</P>

      <P>In connection with the definition of &ldquo;shop work&rdquo; I have already mentioned that I want the phraseology there used reconsidered, because I think it might be clarified, or amended in some respects.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of this Act a person <Col N="2356" /> shall be deemed to continue to do shop work during the time which the person so employed is at the disposal of the employer exclusive of any intervals allowed for rest or meals.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that an employee, so long as he is available for work on the premises, will be regarded as being in continuous employment.  It might happen that an employer would have a shop worker available at certain periods and say to him that his services were not required at that particular moment, and that in consequence of that the hours so spent on the premises would not count in his favour.  This amendment proposes to make that position impossible: that, so long as a worker is on the premises and available for work, his hours there will count.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the amendment in principle, although I think it will be necessary to provide that the worker is on the premises on the strict instructions of his employer.  If the Deputy is prepared to leave the matter over I will see what we can do.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>(1)  Nothing in this Act shall apply to any fair lawfully held or to any bazaar or sale of work for charitable or other purposes from which no private profit is derived or to any library at which the business of lending books or periodicals is not carried on for the purposes of gain other than that of making profits for some philanthropic or charitable object (including any religious or educational object) or for any club or institution which is not itself carried on for purposes of gain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), page 6, line 5, after the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;except a club in respect of which there is granted or renewed a <Col N="2357" /> certificate of registration pursuant to the provisions of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is that a club should be put on the same basis as ordinary licensed premises.  I will admit immediately to the Minister that, as I drafted this amendment, it is really much wider and covers much more than what I have in mind in connection with this matter.  The class of clubs that I wish to deal with are not social clubs, such as golf clubs, and clubs of that nature, but the type of club which is really, in all but name, a publichouse.  I am sure the Minister knows the type of club to which I refer.  It is rather difficult to get a word that would cover that type of club and yet not include the other type of club, but what I am driving at really is that, as I am sure the Minister knows, there are various clubs around the city here which, in effect, are simply publichouses under another name, and I do not see why the employees in such places should not be treated in the same way as in other cases.</P>

      <P>Clubs, of course, are not exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  The sub-section does exempt certain institutions, such as libraries and so on, which are not carried on for purposes of gain other than that of making profits for some philanthropic object.  I think that what the Deputy has in mind is certain so-called clubs which purport not to be carried on for the purposes of gain but which are, in fact, so carried on and which, as the Deputy says, are practically publichouses, except in name.  It is very difficult, however, to see how one could deal with that point, because what you are up against in a case like <Col N="2358" /> that is the question of an evasion of the law.  The law cannot touch a case like that because these clubs, to which the Deputy has referred, manage to keep within the letter of the law, even though they might be outside the spirit of it, and I do not see how we could quite get at such institutions without, at the same time, bringing within the scope of the Bill quite a number of <i>bona fide</i> charitable institutions which should not be affected by legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>Of course we might exempt clubs from this sub-section altogether and make them all subject to the provisions of the Bill, and say that their employees should be entitled to the benefits of the Bill whether these clubs or other such institutions are carried on for purposes of gain or not.  I think that that would be the only way to meet the Deputy's point, but that would have the effect of bringing in golf clubs and other such clubs and making these bodies subject to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps the Minister would consult with the parliamentary draftsman with a view to seeing whether or not some scheme might be devised, or some formula devised, which would take in the particular class of club I have in mind, and of which I am sure the Minister is aware, and at the same time exempt the other class of club. Of course, if the parliamentary draftsman says that it cannot be done, well, I suppose it cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If these clubs, to which the Deputy refers, have employees, why should they not be entitled to the same benefits as those which the employees of other institutions are entitled to under the Bill?  The object of the Bill is to provide certain benefits for the employees of clubs carried on for gain.  Why, therefore, should we have a sub-division of these clubs in order to ascertain whether or not certain people are entitled to benefits? Is it the object to take from outside the scope of the Bill certain employees and to prevent them from getting the benefits that would be got by employees engaged in similar work in a private establishment?</P>

      <P>Well, of course, the distinction I drew was that in certain clubs the servants are in the same position as the servants in ordinary houses.  However, I do not want to deal with that point.  What I want to deal with is this other type of club, to which I have referred and which, I am sure, both the Deputy and the Minister know about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, Sir, I should like to know from the Minister what kind of person exactly is sub-section (2) (b) intended to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the definition in the sub-section is fairly clear. One of the questions that arose when this Bill was being prepared was the question of the extent to which it should apply to post offices, and there was considerable discussion between my Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs before agreement was reached.  The agreement was to the effect that where a member of a staff of a shop in which post-office business is carried on is a person who has been appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, then that person is outside the scope of the Bill, but that where he was appointed by somebody else, such as, let us say, by the person who was appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, then he comes within the provisions of the Bill and gets whatever benefits may accrue under the provisions of this Bill.  The one thing we wanted to avoid&mdash;and I am sure the Deputy will realise its necessity&mdash;was to have one Department of State making regulations governing the conditions of employment of persons in the service of another Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but of course it comes under the Conditions of Employment Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I wonder why this exclusion has been put in, because <Col N="2360" /> it seems to me that the person who is appointed in the circumstances would be a person who had been appointed sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress as the case might be.  That person would be the owner of the shop, and I never heard of a case of an appointment made in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am not very familiar with the affairs of the Post Office Department, but I understand that there are certain types of intermediary establishments or shops of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What kind?  What does the Minister mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that, as I understand it, there are certain types of shops where certain people, other than the proprietors of the shops, are appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as distinct from the case where the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress is appointed by the Department and might employ other persons as members of the staff who are not within the Minister's control. The point is that the persons appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not come under the provisions of the Act, and, of course, if they are proprietors, they will not be under its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this provision is redundant, because I think you cannot find a case where the sub-postmaster or the sub-postmistress is a member of the staff of a shop.  What happens in normal circumstances, and, in fact, in all circumstances one might say, is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs appoints a person as sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress, and that person functions in that capacity for the Minister; but, in addition, that person may also run a shop and, in respect of that shop, that person is the owner of the shop and the employer in regard to any staff he may have.  I should like to know under what circumstances that person is within the scope of the Bill at all to make it necessary for the Minister to provide for this exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why not say that no proprietor is within the scope of the Bill, instead of making this kind of special provision?  It seems to be unnecessary in the circumstances and, because of its obviously unnecessary character, my suspicions were aroused. Why not say every proprietor is out? Why take this particular line?</P>

As a matter of fact, this matter has already been covered fairly extensively on the definition section and, possibly, the Minister might hold that it would be better to raise the others on the different sections.  There is, for <Col N="2364" /> instance, the question of the employment of juveniles, the working hours for juveniles, and the working hours for adults, which might be better brought up under the sections.</P>

I cannot remember for a moment if it arises on any other Part of the Bill but it certainly does arise in Part II, that members of the staff of shops who are relatives of the proprietor, and therefore excluded from the benefits of the Bill, have nevertheless to be taken into account in relation to certain provisions.</P>

Sub-section (1) provides: &ldquo;Any offence under any section of this Act (other than Part VI) may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister as prosecutor.&rdquo;  I understand that that may be regarded as restrictive, that it may be regarded as having the effect of confining the prosecutions to the Minister and precluding anyone else from instituting proceedings.  That is not what was intended, and I think it is not desirable. It is desirable that members of the staffs of shops, trade unions acting on their behalf, or any other person, should be in a position to institute proceedings for the purpose of the enforcement of the conditions of the Act.

      <P>In page 7, before sub-section (4) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) If any person with intent to deceive makes, or causes or allows to be made, in any such record or notice <Col N="2368" /> as aforesaid, an entry which is, to his knowledge, false in any material part, or wilfully omits or causes or allows to be omitted from any such record or notice, an entry required to be made therein, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the provision whereby the Minister may require the proprietor of a shop to keep certain records which, in his opinion, are necessary for the enforcement of certain portions of the Act.  He may require a person to keep these records as often as he thinks fit.  In sub-section (3) it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If whenever a records order is in force the proprietor of a shop fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the requirements of such order, such proprietor shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>I think provision is clearly made there to deal with the case where a proprietor fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with the provisions of the order, but there does not appear to be any adequate provision, or, in fact, any provision at all, in regard to a case where a proprietor complies with the provisions of the order, but does so in a manner which results in information of a misleading character&mdash;either accidentally or wilfully misleading&mdash;being provided.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should take power in this section to deal with cases where a proprietor may find it necessary to comply with the Minister's order but does so in such a way as only to make available in respect of the order information of a misleading or inaccurate kind.  It does not seem to me that the Minister has power to deal with cases where information of a misleading kind is provided under his requirement that certain records should be kept.  I think the Minister should have power to deal with a situation of that kind and to enforce penalties.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section 4.</P>
      <P>This sub-section exempts the proprietor of a shop, who has only relatives employed, from keeping records.  I am moving to delete that sub-section so as to make a person employing only relatives liable to keep records. It would certainly facilitate an inspector going to the shop if he were able to inspect records, to find out the number of employees there and the number of them who were relatives.  I think that the least we should expect from people who employ only relatives is that they should keep records of those whom they employ, and thereby facilitate the inspector in his work of differentiating between ordinary employees and relatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite sound in theory, but I want the Deputy to keep in mind Mrs. Mulligan's huckster shop in the Coombe.  That is the type of shop that is going to be affected if this provision is cut out.  Mrs. Mulligan will not keep the records, and in due course will have to be prosecuted.  That will look a bit ridiculous, seeing that no really effective purpose is served by making her keep the records.  Therefore, I would be disposed to resist the Deputy's amendment, because it is only in relation to Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill that power to make those orders exists.  They are: Restrictions on employment of juveniles; working hours and meal times, and the provision of holidays; and as none of the members of the family of an employer working in those shops is affected by those sections, the keeping of the records is only a formality.  It would certainly be regarded as only a formality by the persons concerned, and they would not do it.  That means that we would have made a provision here which was subsequently ignored, and it is bad to have any laws ignored, or else that in due course we would have to prosecute <Col N="2370" /> those people for a technicality.  I do not think we should put ourselves in that position.  It is better to leave it as it is, and I think the Deputy may be assured that the inspectors will have adequate powers under the next section to make whatever inquiries are necessary to enable them to enforce the provisions of the Act.  It is better to deal with it in that way rather than put upon certain people a legal obligation, the carrying out of which is extremely improbable, and which, even if carried out, would be of very little benefit to anybody.</P>

But the Minister gives to Deputy McGowan a reason for resisting this amendment, which does not seem to me to carry any water.

A street barrow is a shop within the meaning of this.

I certainly should like the Minister to consider an amendment&mdash;although I have not put down an amendment myself&mdash;similar to that section which is in the Factory Acts.  The Minister himself made reference to the Factory Acts in the discussion on the other measure as an authority for what he was doing. Under the Factory Acts there is a special provision that no statement made by a person under a particular section shall be used in evidence against him, and I certainly think <Col N="2372" /> that this Section 8 should have precisely the same safeguard for the liberty of the citizen.  I would ask the Minister to consider that, and I hope he will do so.  Otherwise I will put down an amendment myself on the Report Stage, but I hope that will not be necessary.</P>

      <P>This section, in the manner in which it is drafted, raises a very much bigger question than the mere administration of this Bill, because, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney rightly points out, I think it goes very much further than the Factory Acts or the Shop Acts.  As it is drafted, it is capable of introducing an entirely new feature into what might constitute an offence, and into the charge upon which a person might be tried, and possibly convicted.  It has been recognised under the Shop Acts, and I think under the Factory Acts, that a statement made by a person cannot be used against him; in other words, that he cannot make a statement incriminating himself.  I think if the Minister looks at those Acts he will see that.  That has been the invariable practice in respect to prosecutions under the Acts. If we are going to depart from that principle, we ought to do it in a specific Act, definitely changing the existing legal position in that regard, but we ought not to drag in the principle through this Bill.</P>

      <P>I want Deputy Norton to tell me how it is possible to enforce the provisions of this Act unless the inspector has power to enter at all reasonable times any shop and require the proprietor to produce to him any records which such proprietor is required to keep and to inspect and take copies of entries and records and require such information with regard to any particular member of the staff as he may reasonably require.

      <P>That sets out the penalty that applies in certain circumstances. I am dealing with the powers given to the inspector.  If there is, for instance, an order which says that not more than two juveniles can be employed for every five adults, should not an inspector be empowered to go in and ask the proprietor questions in that connection, and should it not be an offence for the proprietor to refuse to give information?</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks into the Factory Acts he will see there that the answers which are made by the proprietor of the factory to the inspector, or any person who is interrogated by the factory inspector, shall not be used in evidence against him.  That is precisely the amendment which I wish to have brought in here.  For the first time in our laws&mdash;it was under Article 2A of the Constitution&mdash;powers were taken to compel a person to answer questions put to him.  Now, Article 2A was dealing with a very dangerous conspiracy.  You are putting perhaps not quite as bad a power in this measure, but here you have the thin end of the wedge.  Under the legislation dealing with the hours of employment, you have gone the whole hog, but here you have not gone quite so far.  I suggest the Minister should bring in an amendment on the Report Stage which will make it clear that an answer given by a man shall not be used in evidence against that man if he is prosecuted.  That is in the Factory Acts and I do not see why it should not be in these Acts.  It goes down to the very basis of the administration of criminal law in this land, that nobody shall be convicted upon his own statements unless those statements are made by him freely and voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that, in the ordinary course of their business <Col N="2375" /> investigating serious crimes, the Guards have to give a caution to the individual if they intend to arrest him, that he need not say anything, and that if he says anything it will be taken down in evidence and may be used against him.  Here you have got a completely new departure, that a person must submit to interrogation and examination and that his answers may be used in court against him.  It is an entirely new departure.  I venture to think that if the Attorney-General, who is a man of standing in the Irish Bar, were to see this section, and especially if he were to see the section in the Shop Hours Act, he would very nearly get a stroke of apoplexy.  I do not think the Minister quite understands the gravity of the change he is bringing in.  I am sure he does not.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused me the other day of trying to pull the leg of the House&mdash;I think that is what he said. I am not; I am talking very seriously, and I inform him that he is bringing in an alarming innovation into the administration of criminal law in this country.  He is upsetting the whole basis upon which the criminal law rests, that is, that no man is bound to incriminate himself.  Here you have a section in which a man is bound to incriminate himself, and his answers can be used in evidence against him. I wish the Minister would talk to the Attorney-General.  If he does, I am satisfied this section will not stand.  I would like to know if the Minister will bring in an amendment such as I have suggested, bringing this into line with the Factory Acts.  If he says he will not, I will bring in such an amendment on the Report Stage and I will fight this section as hard as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heron</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the point of view of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in this matter, but I do not think he correctly quoted the Factory Acts.  As I understand it, he said that the Factory Acts have a provision to the effect that a statement made to an inspector using the powers given him under the Act may not be used in evidence against the person making the statement.  That is not the position.  The position is that <Col N="2376" /> there is a provision which says that the person under inspection may not be required to make a statement which can be used to incriminate him.  It is not just the same thing.  I do think there is a case for something like that in this section.  I think it is desirable that the inspectors or Gárdaí or anybody having the responsibility of enforcing legislation of this kind should have the widest possible powers.  I have no sympathy with any attempt to limit reasonable powers of inspection, but I think there is a case for the introduction of a proviso here such as exists in the Factory Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put one point to the Minister.  I wonder, under a section like this, does he realise the position of the ordinary individual?  Has he compared the position of an individual who will be prosecuted for a breach of an Act of this nature with that of the person charged with being suspected of a grave criminal offence?  Such a person cannot be compelled to make any statement except under due caution.  A person suspected of committing a breach of a highly technical Act of this nature is put in this position by the inspector &ldquo;Heads I win, tails you lose.&rdquo;  If a person does not give him the information he will be prosecuted, and if he does give the information he may be convicted out of his own mouth.  I do not think that is a reasonable principle of law to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, where an inspector gets a statement from an individual under these circumstances, that statement is given verbally.  It may or may not be entered by the inspector in a notebook. I suggest to the Minister that prosecutions under this Act might develop into a terrible farce in court and prosecutions may be rendered farcical if you are going to have this type of thing with an inspector: &ldquo;On such a day I interrogated So-and-so and he told me...&rdquo;  Then the defendant states that the inspector's recollection is entirely wrong and he told him no such thing.  There you will have a verbal statement to the inspector. The inspector declares that the <Col N="2377" /> defendant told him a certain thing and the defendant denies it, and it will be a question whether the inspector's version of what happened will be accepted in preference to the defendant's. I think that type of legislation is entirely wrong.  You should not compel people to convict themselves.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will point to a single Bill passed by this House, even under the ægis of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in which a provision of this kind was inserted, I shall certainly take a new view, but I venture to say that what the Minister has urged in that respect is evidence of the fact that he does not really appreciate the radical departure from the existing criminal law which is effected in this section.  My complaint as regards the section is that it has a Constitution Amendment Act mentality. Under that Act, it was an offence to refuse to answer a question. <Col N="2378" /> That is not an offence in any other democratic country.  Under the Constitution Amendment Act we made that an artificial offence for the purpose of squeezing people for certain information.  If they refused to give the information, we arraigned them on that charge.  That was what the Constitution Amendment Act provided and we all know the mentality in which that Act was conceived.  Here we have the same mentality.  If any person refuses to produce any record or refuses to give any information which an inspector may lawfully require him to produce or give&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That has not been the position up to now under our criminal law and I challenge the Minister to produce an Act, other than the Constitution Amendment Act, in which a person becomes guilty of an offence by refusing to give information.</P>

If he consults the same authority as he consulted in connection with that provision, and if he looks up the Shops Act of 1912, and the Factory Acts, he will find that in both there has been recognition of the principle that a person should not be required to make a statement which will convict himself.

      <P>&ldquo;The provisions of the next preceding sub-section shall not apply as regards any place, not being a shop, in which retail trade or business is carried on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These abstracts are of large dimensions, about 48 inches by 38 inches. The Minister will understand the impossibility of displaying such large abstracts on, say, a barrow, a pedlar's pack, or again, on Mrs. Mulligan's wheelbarrow in the street.  It would be impossible for these people to carry these large abstracts around.  On my reading of the section the ordinary coalman going through the streets retailing coal would have to have them displayed, when the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.  If persons are sent out from an establishment where they are employed in any numbers, I think the provision was intended to ensure that the employees would be aware of their rights.  The sole idea of the abstract is to ensure that means will be provided by which employees could be made familiar with their rights.  I am not so sure whether a person selling coal from a barrow in the street is a proprietor or an employee.  In the great majority of cases I think they are proprietors.  They are not in any sense employees of the merchants from whom they get the coal, and, consequently, they would not be affected by the section, unless they were assisted by a person employed for wages, which, I gather, is not the practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  In determining for the purpose of this Act the number of hours <Col N="2385" /> during which a person has, in any week, or other period, been employed about the business of any shop, he shall be deemed to have been so employed during any time during which he was in that week or other period as aforesaid employed about the business of any other shop or in any employment to which the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, applies.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who has been previously employed on any day in an employment to which the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, applies shall not be employed on that day about the business of a shop for a longer period than will, together with the time during which he has been previously employed on that day in such other employment, complete the number of hours which under this Act he may lawfully be employed to do shop work.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to prevent a person being employed on the same day, first in a factory, and later in a shop, for more than the number of hours he could lawfully be employed, if employed in the shop the whole day.  There is a similar provision in the Conditions of Employment Act, which provides that a person's hours of work can be determined by finding out what he was engaged at before he undertook a particular type of industrial work.  Once he was employed in industrial work that day, it is part of his employment at industrial work.  Under the Conditions of Employment Act all his hours in any kind of work can be aggregated and if they bring him to the maximum hours provided under that Act, that maximum operates in respect of that person. This is an attempt to bring in a similar provision which, I think, is a useful one, under this Bill in respect of shop workers, to have something comparable to what the Conditions of Employment Act does in respect to industrial workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is to extend it to persons employed at any occupations which come under this Bill, or occupations covered by the Conditions of Employment Act, so that they would be limited to the maximum hours that may be worked in a day or in a week to the maximum permitted by this Bill, even though a person had been at both kinds of employment during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You might have a situation where a shop is run in connection with a factory, and a worker might be employed in the factory for three hours in the morning, and then work for nine or ten hours, as the case may be, in a shop for the remainder of the day.  In respect of that work I want the factory and shop attendance aggregated so that the total attendance must be regarded as attendance which must be viewed in the light of this Bill.</P>

I do not think that an employer should be allowed to combine the two employments and work an employee in a manner other than would be allowed under one employment. <Col N="2387" /> If it is intended to extend the scope to different employments I do not see how there is going to be any check-up.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is considering this matter, will he consider applying it to relatives, so as to prevent persons working all day in a factory then going into the shop of a relative and working there in the evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is referring to persons who are relatives within the scope of the Bill I do not see how you could make that apply very well without altering the scheme of the measure, as a whole. You could certainly make it apply to persons following two occupations, working in a factory during the day and taking employment for wages in a shop in the evening, by making that an offence if it involved working hours exceeding those permitted in the Bill. I cannot see how you could prevent relatives of a proprietor, persons who come within the definition of &ldquo;relatives,&rdquo; and living with him on his premises, giving a hand in a shop after the day's work.  It would be a difficult thing to do that without altering that part of the Bill which exempts these relatives from coming within its scope at all.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is unnecessary.  The making of these regulations is done in the ordinary way.  There are certain provisions for doing things by order, but the making of regulations in relation to matters to be prescribed is a mere formality.  You have regulations in regard to forms and one thing or another.  It is not usual to have a formal statutory order with regard to such things as the form of application, the form in which records are to be kept and such matters.  All that is done by ordinary regulation, and it is a much simpler procedure than having it done by a formal statutory order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that there is no need to move these amendments.  All legislation has to be drafted in the form in which it appears in this Bill at the moment, but I presume that when the Seanad is constituted again there will be some omnibus provision to deal with matters of this kind just as there was when the Seanad was abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that, under the section as worded, there is the possibility, assuming that you have the two Houses, than an <Col N="2389" /> Order need only be laid on the Table of one House.  I think that is conceivable. There is nothing in the section which shows that there is any intention of having an Order laid on the Table of the Seanad when there is a Seanad.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept these amendments, because long before this Bill becomes law the Constitution will be in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think provision should be made now to have the Order laid on the Table of the Seanad also, and ensure that, during the period before the Seanad is constituted, Orders will be laid on the Table of the Dáil.  It is only a matter of drafting, and it could be easily arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary, I think, to do that.  There will have to be some provision dealing with the new circumstances resulting from the reappearance of the Seanad.  It is, of course possible to provide that Orders of this kind can only be annulled by a resolution of the Dáil with a provision in the Order to enable the matter to be discussed.  This is a matter on which some difference may exist between members of the House as to what exactly the powers of the Seanad in that regard should be.  In the ordinary course, I assume that in the future the practice which prevailed in the past will continue to operate, and that is when documents of this kind are laid on the Tables of the Houses they may be annulled by a resolution of either House.  I would prefer that matters of this kind should be dealt with by general legislation, consequential on the constitutional changes, rather than by a specific amendment to this Bill.</P>

    <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order do the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  apply such order to shops of a particular class (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Minister thinks proper) situate in any area specified or delimited in such order, and</P>

      <P>(c)  in calculating the number of juvenile members of the staff of a shop, account shall be taken of any juveniles who are relatives of the proprietor of such shop and are members of the staff of such shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section confers on the Minister the power to make orders for the purpose of restricting or limiting the number of juveniles who may be employed in a shop in relation to the number of adults so employed, and the object of the amendment is to ensure that in calculating the number of juvenile members of the staff of the shop, account shall be taken of any juveniles who are relatives of the proprietor and are members of the staff of such shop.  In sub-section (3) of the section provision is made that when calculating the number of adults employed in a shop the proprietor and his relatives <Col N="2397" /> will be taken into consideration if they are adults.  Why then should not the juvenile relatives be taken into consideration in determining the number of juveniles employed there?  If the Minister would consider making the whole of this part of the Act applicable to relatives, it would meet the point here, but if not I think we ought to calculate the number of junior relatives for the purpose of calculating the number of juvenile employees so as to ensure that, in fixing the proportions, an employer employing a number of juvenile employees would not have an unfair advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 35, to delete the word &ldquo;eleven&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;nine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under this section, it is provided:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for a proprietor of a shop to permit any member of the staff of that shop to continue to do shop work after the time in any day when such member has completed 11 hours' shop work on such day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we were dealing with the fixing of a maximum working day under the Conditions of Employment Bill the maximum working day was fixed at nine hours.  But in respect of shop workers, we are apparently contemplating a position whereby a shop worker may work for a maximum of 11 hours on any one day.  That seems to be a particularly unfair and arduous provision.  For instance, it may be possible for an employer to organise his business in such a way that, on two days of the week, he may require his workers to work, with certain intervals for meals, for 11 hours each day.  Of course a worker who is required to work 11 hours each day has practically no social existence on these days, because the 11 hours is spent in the service of his employer.  The actual attendance of that worker in the service of his employer would be 11 hours, plus one hour for dinner and half an hour for tea.  So that you can contemplate a situation developing where a worker would start work at nine o'clock in the morning and would not be out of the service of the employer until 12½ hours afterwards, including an hour for dinner and a half hour for tea, when his task would be to get to his home, have a meal, and get back again.  He would, therefore, be in the service of his employer from nine in the morning until 9.30 in the evening. That is an unduly high maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the nine hours' maximum provided for in the Conditions of Employment Act is adequate.  I do not think we should contemplate extending the working day in shops to 11 hours.  One could understand the necessity during an emergency at certain <Col N="2401" /> times of the year, but there is no reason why we should contemplate, as part of a normal day's work, that an employer should have the right to employ a worker for as much as 11 hours. The effect of the provision will be to enable employers to take advantage, in many cases, of the provisions of this Bill, which it is not possible for them to take advantage of to-day, because they are held down to-day in many cases by better conditions under trade union agreements.  Employers can now point to the fact that, under this Bill, the Minister considers it desirable, in certain circumstances, that employees should be allowed to work 11 hours.  Trade unions, presented with a situation of that kind, will really find, through the medium of this Bill, the Minister's name being used to justify the viewpoint that there is nothing improper in an employee being required to work a maximum of 11 hours in one day.  I think nine hours as a maximum is reasonable, considering that there is a provision also enabling a worker to be employed on overtime within certain limits.  Even after the worker has worked for 11 hours, as provided for in this section, an employer can also require him to work on overtime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Deputy is wrong there.  There is no <Col N="2402" /> provision for overtime.  In the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, a nine-hour day was provided for, with two hours per day overtime permitted. There is no provision for overtime in this section.  It is an 11 hour maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The overtime cannot be grafted on to the 11 hours, but it can be grafted on to the week in which the 11 hours are worked.  It is possible, for instance, under the Bill for a worker to be employed in any one week up to 60 hours, 48 of which would be normal and the additional 12 would be overtime.  So that in any one week you can contemplate a situation developing whereby a worker would be employed under the Bill for 11 hours on two days, making a total of 22 hours, and the remainder of the 60 hours, including overtime to a maximum of 12 hours, could be spread over the other four days.  If you permit an employer to employ a worker for 48 hours per week and up to 60 hours with overtime is resorted to, you ought not to allow that employer to fix a maximum of 11 hours.</P>
