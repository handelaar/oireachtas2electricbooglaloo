I do not know that I am objecting, because I do not think it wise to give to the President a further opportunity of making the Bill still worse.  I realise fully and pay a tribute to the immense amount of work he has put into this, but the result is that every stage is worse than the previous one.  Therefore, I for one shall not object to the proposal now before the House, namely, recommitting the Bill merely for the purpose of the amendments, because I think the more thought he gives to the subject the more lamentable are the results.</P>

      <P>(4) The day appointed by an order under this section for the expiration of the time for <i>ex officio</i> nominations shall always be subsequent to the day appointed by the same order for the expiration of the time for Dáil panel nominations.</P>
      <P>This amendment is for the inserting of a new sub-section relating to the time for <i>ex officio</i> nominations.  The time is not precisely defined; it is simply provided that it must be later than the day of the expiration of the time for Dáil panel nominations, which must itself be not less than seven days after the expiration of the time for nominations by nominating bodies.</P>

      <P>The existing provisions of the section require that a register of nominating bodies should be set up in accordance with the Act.  The amendment would require that the register shall, in addition, be maintained in accordance with the Act.  The amendment is designed to lay stress on the fact that the first register will continue for the future to be the register of nominating bodies, subject only to annual revisions, and that there will not be a new register in subsequent years.

      <P>If the President will just throw his mind back he will remember that.  My argument was that the register continues, and that, therefore, nominations on the register were not in the position of nominations proposed for the first time.  The President eloquently argued that he was quite sure it meant the opposite.</P>

      <P>Now, the idea of the President objecting to metaphysics!  Really there is a limit to absurdity, even in this Dáil.  When it comes to metaphysics, I know a fair amount of it myself, but I keep it completely out of the Dáil.  However, <Col N="2566" /> there was an important question raised on that section and the President was quite clear, so important was the point, that the register did not continue.  I hope he has looked into the matter from the point of view of the particular section I have in mind.</P>

      <P>I do not remember the details of the argument.  What I was interested in was the position of the returning officer.  This is the practical part of it, whatever may be the theory&mdash;there is a question of theory and practice.  In practice what will happen is that the Seanad returning officer will have in front of him the existing register.  Unless there are withdrawals from that, it will be taken as a portion of his work having been already done.  But the register could be amended, altered, changed, just the same as if he had only a provisional list.  If I said the other thing, in theory, then, I was wrong and the Deputy is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a question of theory, but of what the powers were.  According to the argument of the President, it seemed to me the powers of the returning officer were different according as (1) the register could be and should be regarded as legally a new register, or (2) whether it would be regarded as a register continuing.  On the last day I understood that if you opted for one or other of the alternatives the practical powers of the returning officer were different; it was purely a question of the practical powers.  However, it is the President's funeral, not mine.</P>

It is the returning officer's business; it is being put on to him by law, and whilst the Opposition are in a position of glorious irresponsibility in that particular matter, I am not.  I took bodies without committing myself to any particular one.  The Deputy, if he runs his mind over some possible bodies, will see that there are bodies whose objects and purposes may include a certain activity which may not be covered by the activities for which the panels are designed, and which might not be regarded as really representative of these bodies.  I think it would not be right to draw this too tightly so that these bodies would not be allowed in. In the last analysis it is a matter for the returning officer.</P>

      <P>In page 6, Section 9 (2), before paragraph (d), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) no body which is composed wholly or mainly of persons who are in the employment of the State or of persons who are in the employment of local authorities and the objects of which include the advancement or protection of the interests of such persons in relation to their said employment shall be eligible for registration in the said register.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert a new provision, prohibiting the registration in the register of nominating bodies of associations of State or the local officials or employees of local authorities, whose objects include the advancement or protection of the interests of its members in relation to their employment.  A question of principle comes in here, obviously, and that is whether it is advisable that bodies such as civil servants and local employees should be entitled to be registered as nominating bodies.  It is on the general principle that it is inadvisable that public servants such as these referred to here should have political affiliations with a particular Party that this amendment is introduced. I think it will be generally conceded that it is not advisable there should be any close relation between public servants and political Parties, because public servants are supposed to do there work in the public interest, irrespective of what particular Party or Government is in office.  I do not expect there will be any difficulty in getting general acceptance of that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What I think the House understood me generally to mean was this, that if you have Civil Service organisations, organisations of public servants, whether they be in the State service or the local service, organised from a political standpoint with political functions, as undoubtedly they would have if they nominated a person for the Seanad, that person would be regarded as a spokesman and they would have a special interest in that person.  If that person were associated with a Party, he would be regarded as having a special affiliation with the Party.  The <Col N="2570" /> whole thing could be so linked up that it would appear that it brought the civil servant directly into politics. Probably what would develop would be Party politics and I think it is undesirable in the general interest to have that.  That was the attitude of the previous Administration just as it is ours now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress that.  It is quite clear that the President does realise that you must belong to a political Party to get elected to this particular body; that is admitted, owing to the character of the electorate.  Now, surely, if the civil servants have an association to promote their interests, they do get into touch with political Parties and they do get into politics in that way.  They have votes for members of the Dáil and, surely, if they have, what is the ground for depriving them of the privilege in this instance?  They represent a certain point of view; they represent more definitely and more clearly the administrative standpoint than the county councils do, who are more in the position, not of administrators, but rather of a local parliament.  The real administrative work there is done by officials, as it is done by officials in the State.  If you have a panel from the administrative point of view, there would be a stronger case for allowing civil servants to get representatives on that than there would be to give them votes for the election of a member of the Dáil, which would also be calculated to bring them into politics. Possibly the President will say that it has brought them into politics already.</P>

The subsequent election will take place on the dissolution of the Dáil.

These were dates which I was anxious that the President should look into. I admit that the changes made here give a little more rope so far as the first election is concerned.  That is important, but it is the elections after the dissolution of the Dáil on subsequent occasions with which I am concerned at the moment.  The House should have an opportunity of coming together for several days before it proceeds to the nominations.  The possibility that that might not be so was adumbrated in the first Bill. There was a provision to the effect that the last date was to be not later than the date of the assembly of the Dáil, which would make it possible to be on that particular date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are to have a returning officer appointed who is responsible to the Minister for at least ten or 11 months out of the 12, and I suggest that that man, so far as his livelihood is concerned, is entirely under the control of the Minister, and we know what that means.  He may, on the vague proposition that he is out of touch with the general conduct of the Government, be dismissed from that office.  How he is out of touch is not explained, but, if he fails to recognise the general line of Government policy, he may be dismissed.  That may happen in this particular case.  The President, who is so much impressed with the desirability of having a man who is in an independent position, promised to look into the matter.  I was expecting with the first batch of amendments&mdash;only ten pages&mdash;that there would be some reference to that.  There is none.  The position remains completely as it was. A man may cause dissatisfaction to the dominant Party, or the dominating faction in this House, and pressure may be brought to bear on the Minister. Have we any guarantee that the Minister will withstand that pressure? I suggest that we have none.  Therefore, <Col N="2579" /> in the election of this body we cannot look upon a civil servant as being in the position of independence, though he will have practically the decision, as to whether or not bodies are eligible as nominating bodies, or whether people are eligible to be on a certain panel.</P>
      <P>The powers that the Bill already gave the returning officer were pretty large.  I suggest that this amendment increases them, for the following reasons: As the Bill stands, the view of that particular officer cannot be reversed&mdash;unless nine members are present and are positively in favour of reversing the opinion or decision of the officer in question.  It is suggested that the quorum should be ten.  Therefore, if six members stay away the decision cannot be reversed.  You have in reality to have ten members who may be in favour of reversal before there is a reversal, and you must have a quorum.  It is quite easy to engineer that a meeting falls through, and there is provision in the amendment that if the meeting does not take place, and if the matter is not considered, the decision of the returning officer shall stand.  There you are adding actually to the powers of the returning officer in that respect.</P>

      <P>I prefer to leave it over with the other points that we will have to-morrow.  The other matter which the Deputy raised is of considerable importance.  I have given it consideration, and from the theoretical point of view, I think, in practice, whatever fears those in opposition might have, when Parties have the responsibility of government they do not behave in the way suggested by some remarks that were made.  The returning officer is in a semi-judicial position.  We have had that position in connection with the Dáil elections. Considerable power is given to the Seanad returning officer, although he only works at that for a small portion of his time.  As a general principle I would like if power was given in the case of the Dáil or the Seanad to an independent officer, if I could get one, and if it was worth the expense that would have to be faced for the establishment of such an officer with an office.  The inquiries I have made so far have led me to think that I cannot make a case from the point of view of having whole-time work for such an officer.  Even if we came to the conclusion that such an officer could be provided with whole-time work, and that there was work to warrant the setting up of a little office for himself, nevertheless I do not think we should do it here.  What we should do in that case is to appoint a special officer, who would have the functions of this officer, functions in the Dáil, and perhaps functions of that sort at the Local Government elections.  Though the view of the Department charged with keeping down expenditure and looking after finances is against the appointment of such an officer, still I do not think we can regard the matter as completely closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I would like to be satisfied more completely than I am that there is not whole-time work for such an officer and that whatever small staff he would require would not be justified, in view of the importance of the functions he has to perform.  If I came to the conclusion, and if the Government agreed that the setting <Col N="2582" /> up of such an officer was desirable, I think we should do it separately and independent of this Bill, and simply add to the powers which he would have under this Bill some other powers in connection with the Dáil and local elections.  I do not think it would be wise to put that in at this stage.  I fully realise the arguments of Deputies that if the powers were abused there might be an effort to bring pressure to bear on an officer of this sort.  However, I think it extremely unlikely.  In other cases there have been part-time officers exercising functions of a semi-judicial character, and there has never been a suggestion that an effort was made on behalf of the Administration to interfere with them in the exercise of their functions.  I could not do that here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out, notwithstanding the reluctance I have in a certain matter, that the President says that this is a purely theoretical business.  But we have practical things before us.  What is the good of saying that it is purely theoretical when it happened in the case of one of the principal servants of the State?  Was not that a practical matter?  Why does the President think he can ride away when an important point is raised by saying that the matter is purely theoretical and not a practical one?  If it is possible to dismiss&mdash;as it was possible in the past to dismiss&mdash;an officer in connection with the appointment of a doctor, where no political consideration ought to enter&mdash;if I might take that phrase from the President&mdash;where there ought to be no party manoeuvring, surely the danger is still greater here where the question of politics directly comes in, and where there is considerable power vested in this particular officer as to what he will do.  The President must know that we cannot shut our eyes to what was done at that time.  We can see how the Minister on that occasion stood over and protected the civil servant against political attack.  Is there any better guarantee for this man now who is to be appointed?  He certainly will not be dismissed on the grounds&mdash;I never suggested that he would&mdash;that political pressure was <Col N="2583" /> brought to bear on the Minister, but what I suggest is that political pressure may be brought to bear on the Minister and that other grounds will be found for his dismissal.  The danger is there, and it is not a theoretical danger.  Nobody has proved better than the President himself, or than the Minister mentioned in this Bill, that the danger is not a theoretical danger, but that it is a practical danger.</P>
      <P>When we had this Bill last before the House the President held out the hope that he might be able to meet the case that we on this side put up: to consider that the door was considerably open so far as that is concerned.  We are now asked to live on hope because the door is not completely closed.  We are as usual going backwards in this respect. The President agrees in principle with the desirability of what we are urging, but I am afraid the whole history of this Bill is that, once the President agrees with a thing in principle, that is the one thing that is not going to be carried out in the Bill or anywhere else. He has proved that in every details of the Bill, and in the general principles and lines of the Bill.  The suggestion that at some future, unheard of date the Minister charged with the keeping down of expenditure&mdash;such a misdescription of the present Minister for Finance I have never come across: if he was described as the Minister who was put in there to make expenditure bound up beyond all limits that were thought possible it would be a more accurate description of him&mdash;but apparently keen as the President is on this particular matter, suddenly the knife of the Department of Finance comes down on his neck.  The President is obviously not going now or at any future time&mdash; let us be clear on that&mdash;to meet the case that we put up, and for two reasons. The first he has stated and the second is that he acknowledges the soundness of the principle at the basis of what we are asking.  Therefore the matter is closed, and this man, who is in a position to decide a number of important political questions, will be at the complete mercy, and we know what that mercy is, of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow <Col N="2584" /> the Deputy on the line that he has taken.  I do not think that this is the proper place to discuss the question which he has alluded to.  I simply point out this, that the action taken by the Minister was taken not in the direction in which the Deputy has been suggesting. It was taken to defend public policy which was adopted in order that public administration might be kept as pure as possible.  That was the direction in which the action of the Minister was taken, and that was in the direction of sustaining that policy.  Now the Deputy has suggested that it might be taken in an opposite direction.  I would point out to him that the officer to whom he has referred was the secretary to a Department, and that the secretary to a Department is an executive officer responsible immediately to a Minister.  His appointment comes directly from the Executive Council. He can be removed by the Executive Council, if for any reason he is regarded as an officer who is not doing everything in the office that should be done in order to make the policy of the Government as effective as it can be, and the administration, which the Government is charged with, as effective as it can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case where an officer is appointed part-time, I will admit, in a semi-judicial capacity.  There has been no suggestion&mdash;I hate suggestions of the sort coming from Deputies who were members of a previous Administration &mdash;at any time that the decisions of officers who, under the law, have been put in a semi-judicial position have been influenced by members of the Government. I agree there are many things that, in principle, are better than many things which we have to accept in practice. Very often we have to accept in principle things which we would prefer if they could be put into practice.  We have a practical position here which was recognised by some of the Deputies who have spoken from the other side.  When I mentioned this first the criticism was made: Would this officer have whole-time functions to discharge; would it be justifiable to create an officer of that sort for the amount of work that would have to be done under the Bill?  I had the idea of trying to find whole-time work for him by extending his functions <Col N="2585" /> to Dáil elections and local elections. The information that has been sent to me is to the effect that even by adding the Dáil elections and local elections there would not be sufficient work for a single person to employ him whole-time, and that if we did set up such an officer it would also mean setting up special staff.  Consequently, I have been deterred from taking the course of making the position a whole-time one, and of bringing in concurrently a Bill for that purpose, simply by considerations of the expense involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance rightly questions matters of that sort, and asks whether the practice that has worked up to the present of giving officers part-time semi-judicial functions in which they are allowed to decide on their own, should not be continued: whether this would not be the thin end of the wedge, creating a whole host of semi-independent departments with their own staffs and thereby unjustifiably increasing expenditure. Now that is the practical consideration which has deterred me from trying to meet the Deputy in the direction in which evidently he would like me to go.  All that I can say about it is that that is the practical consideration. The fact that we are giving way to that practical consideration is not an indication that we would not like to act in the other direction, but there are difficulties in the way which make it inadvisable.  That is my attitude towards it.</P>

I do not know how that point would be covered, and I am sure that the Deputy will realise that it would introduce hopeless complications if we were to introduce <Col N="2587" /> matters of that kind.

      <Col N="2588" /> This amendment fixes a limit to the time allowed to the appeal committee for the considering of appeals, the limiting date being four days before the time for the expiration of nominations by nominating bodies.  It is necessary to fix such a limit in order to allow time for the nominating bodies, as finally determined following the consideration of appeals, to nominate candidates to the panels.  They want four days, and it will give them a little bit of an interval.</P>

      <P>In page 8, before Section 15 (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:</P>
      <P>(3) If an appeal to the appeal committee is not decided on or before the fourth day before the expiration of the time for general panel nominations at the first Seanad election, such appeal shall be deemed to have been disallowed by the appeal committee, and the decision of the Seanad returning officer which was the subject of such appeal shall have effect accordingly.</P>

It inserts a new sub-section under which the decision of the Seanad returning officer will be regarded as upheld in any case in which an appeal to the appeal committee has not been decided within the prescribed time.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 (2) relates to the signature and publication by the Seanad returning officer of the register of nominating bodies in the case where appeals have been made to the appeal committee. The amendment provides that the signature must take place not later than the third day before the expiration of the time for nomination by nominating bodies; that is, the day <Col N="2591" /> following the latest date given to the Appeal Committee for the consideration of appeals, and that the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> must take place &ldquo;as soon as conveniently may be.&rdquo; That is all.  Again, as Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, it provides for a very short time, and we shall have to take that into consideration.  However, it is the best we can do for the year 1938.  Certainly, it curtails the time, but we will see whether it is covered in the case of the annual revision.</P>

To-morrow is a very practical thing, and the question of morning daily newspapers circulating throughout the State was an important addition and of practical importance.  The Deputy wants to omit it.  I say it is of practical importance because you might very well have daily morning papers, as you have evening papers, that would not be, in fact, circulating throughout the State.

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 56 and 57, Section 17 (3), paragraph (a), to delete the words &ldquo;appear to him to be eligible for such registration&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;whose applications he does not disallow&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 (3) sets out certain things to be done by the Seanad returning officer in carrying out the annual revision of registered nominating bodies.  Paragraph (a) of the sub-section as it stands would require him to register all bodies which have applied and &ldquo;appear to him to be eligible....&rdquo; It is not in fact intended that the Seanad returning officer should register every body which appears eligible and the drafting of the paragraph in this form was due to an oversight.  The amendment will provide <Col N="2596" /> that he will register those bodies &ldquo;whose applications he does not disallow&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A certain number of bodies come over from the new register.  It is now acknowledged that they are on that new register.  They are not new proposals for the register technically, according to what we discussed a short time ago.  They are on the continuing register.  There is a body on that register.  The returning officer is faced with this position.  Another body applies and he thinks it is more suitable, but he is limited by the number he can put on.  One is already on and he can only delete on certain grounds, namely, the grounds that it has ceased to exist or ceased to be eligible.  Now a body that has not ceased to exist and is still eligible may not be as desirable as a new claimant.</P>

      <P>I agree.  The only question is whether it is not actually covered by the draft.  Again, I shall have another look to see if it is.  It is all a question of whether the draft covers that point.  I agree that it is important that the Seanad returning officer should not be prevented from adding a new, more acceptable body by some phrase that would indicate that he could only accept that body when some other body was knocked off.  We shall take a note of it.  These matters which were raised by Deputies previously on this Bill were all noted and attempts were made to meet them wherever it was found that there was any substance in the points raised. Very often in a Bill like this there may be something picked up which one needs to have in connection with another part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The paragraph affected by this amendment is one requiring the Seanad returning officer, in the course of the annual revision of the registered nominating bodies, to delete from the register bodies which have ceased to exist or have ceased to be eligible for registration.

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be something unique in the Bill, but on its merits.  I suggest that it is a wise provision, otherwise you would have all sorts of appeals.  You might have a Committee of the House sitting to hear appeals on all sorts of frivolous matters.  The fee is inserted so as to make sure that bodies, before appeal, will study their chances of success and see whether they have really a good case.  After all, we may take it that the bodies who will apply to be put on the register will have some funds, and, if there is a good case, there is no reason why they should not be able to back it up with a fee of £20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No, only in the case of an appeal.  After the returning officer has decided upon the register, there is a power of appeal to a Committee of the House.  We do not know how many may apply and if the Seanad returning officer rules out a whole number of bodies, as being <Col N="2601" /> clearly covered in accordance with the intentions of the Act, if they feel that they have a grievance, they should not be simply permitted to keep a Committee of the House engaged for a long time hearing their appeals. There would be considerable expense and the time of members would be taken up, and I think it is not unreasonable to insist on a deposit.  I should like to hear it argued on its merits.  The sum of £20 is purely an arbitrary figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good provision.  I should just like to point out to the President that in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) it is stated that, in certain circumstances, the £20 shall be returned in the event of the appeal being successful or in the event of the Committee not deciding the appeal within a certain time.  Is it not usual, in provisions of that nature, to give the Committee a discretion to decide that in the event of the appeal not being frivolous, the fee shall be returned?</P>

    <P>This series of four amendments provides a new basis for determining the number of persons that may be nominated to a panel by a nominating body.  The following is the new basis: If the number of nominating bodies is not less than the number of persons to be elected&mdash;Deputies will remember the number for each of the panels &mdash;then the number of persons to be nominated by each nominating body is two.  If it is not less than half, but less than the whole number of persons to be elected, then the number to be nominated by each nominating body will be three.  If the number of nominating bodies is more than one but less than half the number of persons to be elected, then the number to be nominated by each body will be four.

Suppose the number of nominating bodies was one, the number of persons to be nominated by that body would be eight.  In case you had two such bodies, each of them would nominate three, and you would have six for four places.  In the other case you would have eight for four places.  Suppose you had three bodies, the number to be nominated by each of them would be three, and you would have a total of nine.  If there were four bodies, each would nominate two, and you would have a total of eight; and in the case of any numbers from five to 15, you would have a total of from ten to 30. The numbers then would run: eight, six, nine, eight, as the total numbers. The intention was to get, as well as we could, about double the total number to be elected.</P>

If there happened to be three nominating bodies, they would have 33? per cent. wider selection.  I do not know if the President can come nearer to equality in the matter than he has come here.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Seanad returning officer receives a nomination paper (other than a nomination paper declared by this Act to be wholly void and a nomination paper so received after the time limited by this Act for such receipt), he shall forthwith post up, in such public place in the county borough of Dublin as he shall consider most suitable, a notice stating the fact of the receipt by him of such nomination paper and the name, address, and description (as stated in such nomination paper) of the person purported to be nominated by such nomination paper and the panel to <Col N="2610" /> which such person purports to be so nominated.</P>
    <P>This amendment is for the insertion of a new section before existing Section 26, requiring the Seanad returning officer to post up a public notice in Dublin regarding nominations received by him.  It is considered desirable to have some formal, and at the same time, simple and expeditious method of publishing nominations.  The moment it is posted up, the papers will give it wider publicity.</P>

The returning officer will not be required to determine whether the person is, in fact, qualified or not.  This will make it easier for the Seanad returning officer and the judicial referee to come to a decision on the spot.  The onus of supplying the necessary evidence is on the party applying.</P>

      <P>(b) if such person or his agent (as the case may be) refuses or fails to make such election or neither such person nor his agent is present or reasonably available, the Seanad returning officer shall retain the name of such person on such one of the said provisional panels as the Seanad returning officer shall determine by lot;</P>
      <P>(c) the Seanad returning officer shall delete the name of such person from all the said provisional panels except the provisional panel on which he is required, by whichever of the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section is applicable, to retain the name of such person.</P>

    <P>This amendment inserts a new sub-section <Col N="2612" /> providing for the case where a person is entered in two or more provisional panels.

      <P>Let us refer to Section 27 in connection with this question. It is the question I raised before. I asked the President a moment ago was not this contemplated as being taken in stages, one stage being complete. He said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  There is a stage complete when the Seanad returning officer has ruled out the name or names of a person or persons as not being qualified.  Coming to Section 27, we find that the only people who can raise a question are people whose names are on the list.  The President said that there was to be a clarification or an amendment of that provision, that he thought the ruling of persons' names off the list could be challenged and brought to the judicial referee by the person whose name it was proposed to remove.  His latest statement to me is that this is to be done in stages, one stage being complete when the name is removed.  A man whose name is removed could not, therefore, get referred to the judicial referee the question whether his name was properly removed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The judicial referee is present during the whole of the time.  I take it that the Deputy's point is that a name having been ruled off, it is desirable that the <Col N="2614" /> person concerned should have some chance of appeal.  The point is whether, while that is being done, the judicial referee is present or not.  If he is present, the appeal can be made to him there and then.  As it stands, it would appear as if the judicial referee were present during the whole of the time that this stage is being gone through.  He is there at the completion of the panels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. X, an applicant or aspirant for the Seanad, finds himself on a provisional panel at a certain time.  He is on that panel after certain matters have been attended to in relation to the validity of the nomination paper, which the Seanad returning officer can, of his own motion, decide.  He survives that test and, when you come to the stage called &ldquo;the completion of the panels,&rdquo; the name of Mr. X is on the list.  The Seanad returning officer comes along under Section 26 and rules the name off.  I asked the President if he contemplated this being done in stages. He said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  There is a stage at which Mr. X's name goes off the list. The Seanad returning officer is only coerced into bringing before the judicial referee a question by a person whose name is still on the list. Can a person whose name is ruled off appeal to the judicial referee? Whether he can or not, is full of doubt.  The more obvious explanation, after the statement of the President as to stages, is that he cannot appeal unless he anticipates what the Seanad returning officer is going to do and calls the attention of the judicial referee to the matter.  Otherwise, his time will have gone.  Section 27 (2) says that the Seanad returning officer may and, if so requested by any person whose name is on the provisional panel, shall, refer to the judicial referee any question arising during the completion of the panels. If a man's name has gone off the list, can he ask for the reference?</P>

      <P>To answer that, I should have to construe the various paragraphs together more closely than I can do just now.  I shall take another look at the matter before to-morrow.  The whole question is <Col N="2615" /> whether, through all the stages at which a nomination can be disallowed, the judicial referee is present or not. At any stage at which he is present, he can be appealed to.  If there is a stage at which he is not present, the Deputy's point is a good one and I shall have to look into it.</P>

      <P>Let us look at Section 26 (2) which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When preparing the provisional panels... the Seanad returning officer shall not insert in any provisional panel the name of any person purported to be nominated by a nomination paper which is declared by this Act to be wholly void or which is received by him after the expiration of the relevant time for receiving nominations.</P>
      <P>Does the Deputy refer to the exceptions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With these exceptions &ldquo;the Seanad returning officer shall prepare the provisional panels without considering or inquiring into the validity of any nomination paper.&rdquo; We have only to pay attention to the exceptions.  The first exception is in relation to a nomination paper declared by the Act to be wholly void.  The Seanad returning officer's judgment is to be taken on that.  Does the Deputy desire an appeal from that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 26 deals with the completion of the panels, and it seems to me that all the names will be on the list at the time that the judicial referee is present, with the two exceptions I have mentioned.  It would appear that you are providing for an appeal in all the other cases.  However, I will look into it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, there is ambiguity in this.  There is no doubt that at some stage of a provisional panel there ought to be entered on the panel everybody except those whom the Seanad returning officer in his absolute discretion may wipe off.  The President told me that this was going to be done in stages.  The operative phrase in Section 27 (2) is that the Seanad returning officer must bring things to the judicial referee, if he is so requested by a person whose name is on the provisional panel for the time being under consideration.  Let there be a stage.  There is some process going on, and the Seanad returning officer says: &ldquo;I do not think that man is qualified,&rdquo; and he rules him off. Once he is ruled off, has his name not disappeared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he will have to have regard at that stage to any appeal that may be made to the judicial referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not here. He is to have regard to the decisions of the judicial referee.  &ldquo;Decisions&rdquo; means really past decisions.  When one, in a court of law, quotes decisions, one is quoting decisions embodied in old cases, and the word &ldquo;decisions&rdquo; has something of that atmosphere about it.  It is not the <i>ad hoc</i>, there and then decision of the judicial referee.  If it is, suppose you have an applicant or aspirant for the Senatorial office.  He is there himself and is not accompanied by an agent.  The Seanad returning officer says: &ldquo;I have a series of rules which I am going to apply to this list,&rdquo; and, amongst other things, he says: &ldquo;Here is my test for ruling on the qualifications of people.&rdquo;  That is listened to by a man who does not <Col N="2617" /> comprehend at the moment that the ruling by way of principles is hitting his particular case.  The Seanad returning officer waits for an objection to be made; none is made, and Mr. X suddenly finds his name deleted. The first notice he gets of that deletion is when the Seanad returning officer says: &ldquo;That rules out so many names,&rdquo; and at that moment Mr. X is not a person whose name is on the provisional panel for the time being under consideration.  Is he not allowed to ask the judicial referee to rule whether that has been correctly done or not?  Surely he ought to be so entitled.  It apparently is the intention that he should, but if you read the phrase in Section 27 (2) you will see that there is at least ambiguity. The only man who can elevate a claim, which must be granted, for an appeal to the judicial referee is a man whose name is on the panel for the time being under consideration.  If it is to be taken that the phrase &ldquo;provisional panel&rdquo; applies to a panel starting at some stage and continuing until the very end of the ruling, the matter might be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be the intention, but there is ambiguity in the phrase used.  I take the case of a person who is forgetful or who does not comprehend the point of an objection being made.  He suddenly wakes up and finds that the Seanad returning officer says: &ldquo;You have no longer any interest in the proceedings; you are off the list.&rdquo;  Can he turn round and say: &ldquo;I was on the provisional list and, as such, am covered by the phraseology in Section 27 (2) and I want the judicial referee to pronounce on whether you are right or wrong in ruling me out&rdquo;?  I think there is a possibility that that man may find himself adjudged to be a person whose name is not on the provisional panel and who has no right to compel the Seanad returning officer to get the case considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem to me, reading it, that the provisional panel for the time being refers to the panel <Col N="2618" /> after the deletions which he can make on his own motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this panel starts by being a provisional panel somewhere about the opening of Section 26, and it is not finished by any intermediate rulings of the Seanad returning officer, there may be no harm done; but if a position has been reached at which a ruling has been made and a man's name has disappeared, he, I think, is prohibited from insisting on the Seanad returning officer putting the case to the judicial referee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have it further examined, but I think the phrase &ldquo;provisional panel for the time being under consideration&rdquo; means this particular panel which is going to be considered as a whole and which stands after the deletions I have referred to.  Any person whose name is on that has a right to appeal against his being struck off.</P>

      <P>There is a paper with a list of names on it and I call the paper as it stands before I begin to strike out anybody the provisional list.  It continues to be the provisional list until I introduce a new and amended version which is called the revised list.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which Deputy Linehan has raised is a fortification of my argument, because the phrase is &ldquo;any person whose name is on the provisional panel&rdquo; and not &ldquo;is or has been&rdquo; or &ldquo;was at any time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of what the phrase &ldquo;the panel for the time being under consideration&rdquo; means.  There is a list which contains a certain set of names and it is the panel which is for the time being under <Col N="2619" /> consideration.  You knock out names from it, but it still is the panel as it was, although you have drawn your pencil through certain names, and anybody whose name is on that is entitled to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the President's suggestion that if a man's name was printed on a particular list, being a provisional panel, and the Seanad returning officer draws his pencil through it by way of deleting him from the panel, his name is still on the panel until a new list is printed on which his name does not appear at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What he will say is: &ldquo;I propose to eliminate him,&rdquo; and he will draw his pencil through the name with the intention that when he has the revised list that name will not appear.  The name is on the printed list.  It is a question of words and what we mean by them.  I am not finding any fault with the criticism of these matters.  We ought to try to be accurate, but it is a question of what is the most natural interpretation and of what is meant.  We do not want ambiguities at all.  It seems to me that the intention running right through is that you would have a provisional panel at a certain stage, and the names on that document will be the names on the provisional panel.  Then you proceed on a process of revision, which takes place over a certain time.  It is not necessary to knock a name off the list altogether.  You can put a cross in front of a name to indicate that those people are going to go off, and any person whose name was on the list, if a mark of any kind appears at his name indicating that it will not appear on the revised list, can, at any stage, appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President dropped into the use of a phrase about which Deputy Linehan raised his point.  He said, &ldquo;any man whose name was on the list.&rdquo; That is not here.  I put Deputy Linehan's point in this way: Suppose the phrase were, &ldquo;any person named on the provisional panel&rdquo;?  He can appeal, and his appeal must be granted in the sense that the appeal is taken to the judicial referee.  But that is not the phrase. <Col N="2620" /> If the phrase was, &ldquo;any person named,&rdquo; it would mean &ldquo;named at any time&rdquo;; but the phrase is, &ldquo;any person whose name is on the provisional panel.&rdquo;  What does that &ldquo;is&rdquo; refer to?  Surely, if at the time he attempts to make his appeal, his name is not on it, if it has been deleted, his appeal is gone.  Suppose it was a general phrase, such as &ldquo;a person named on the provisional panel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a person entered on the provisional panel.&rdquo; That may mean &ldquo;named at any time&rdquo; or &ldquo;entered at any time,&rdquo; but when you say &ldquo;a person whose name is on the panel...&rdquo; I am going to interpret it as &ldquo;at that time.&rdquo;  He may apply for a ruling to the judicial referee, and must get such a ruling. Any person whose name was deleted, even though still at a provisional stage, and even though there is a document headed &ldquo;Provisional Panel&rdquo;&mdash; and that heading to the panel never changes until a final ruling is given&mdash; would be precluded from appeal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45.</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 27, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) If, when the provisions of the next preceding section have been complied with, the number of persons whose names are entered in any sub-panel of a provisional panel does not exceed by at least two the number of members of Seanad Eireann required by this Act to be elected from such sub-panel, the Seanad returning officer shall adjourn to a convenient day and hour the further proceedings at the completion of the panels and shall report to the <Col N="2621" /> Taoiseach the said deficiency in the said sub-panel and furnish to the Taoiseach a copy of the provisional panels as settled immediately before the said adjournment.</P>
    <P>(2) Upon receiving such report as is mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, the Taoiseach shall nominate to every sub-panel in respect of which he receives such report such number of persons as will be sufficient to bring the number of persons on such sub-panel up to a number exceeding by two (and no more) the number of members of Seanad Eireann required by this Act to be elected from such sub-panel.</P>
    <P>(3) Whenever the Taoiseach is required by the next preceding sub-section of this section to make nominations to a sub-panel, it shall be lawful for him to make additional nominations to such sub-panel in excess of the number of nominations required by the said sub-section, but such additional nominations shall be substitutional only and shall be operative only if and so far as is requisite by reason of the invalidity of one or more of the other nominations made by the Taoiseach under this section to such sub-panel.</P>
    <P>(4) Every nomination made by the Taoiseach under this section shall be made in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) such nomination shall be made in writing on a nomination paper in the form (modified as requisite) prescribed for <i>ex-officio</i> nominations;</P>
    <P>(b) every such nomination shall be made by a separate nomination paper;</P>
    <P>(c) every nomination paper shall state the sub-panel in respect of which the nomination is made and shall also contain the particulars required by the said prescribed form of nomination paper to be stated therein (including a statement of the qualifications of the person thereby nominated for the panel to which he is so nominated) <Col N="2622" /> and shall be signed by the Taoiseach;</P>
    <P>(d) every nomination paper shall be delivered or sent to the Seanad returning officer and shall be so sent or delivered that it is received by the Seanad returning officer before the time to which the completion of the panels was adjourned under the first sub-section of this section.</P>
    <P>(5) On the resumption of the completion of the panels after the adjournment thereof under the first sub-section of this section, the Seanad returning officer shall consider and rule upon the nominations made by the Taoiseach under this section (including examining and ruling upon the qualifications of every person so nominated for the panel to which he is so nominated) and shall enter in the proper place in the proper provisional panel the name, address, and description of every person whom he finds to be validly so nominated together with a statement, in such form as he thinks proper, of the qualifications which he determines to be in fact the qualifications of such person to be on such panel.</P>

      <P>The purpose is to make sure that you will have completion of sufficient nominations.  This amendment has to deal with nominations by the Taoiseach to complete the sub-panels.  If the number of persons on a provisional sub-panel is not at least two more than the number to be elected from that sub-panel <Col N="2623" /> the Taoiseach is required to nominate such number as will bring the total on the sub-panel up to two more than the number to be elected.  Such nominations would be subject to examination in the ordinary course by the Seanad returning officer with whom the judicial referee will sit.  To provide for the possibility of nominations under this section being disallowed, the Taoiseach is empowered to nominate a number of substitutes for any persons nominated by him in this connection who may be disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose we kept Section 40 as it was.  What is going to happen?  If the nominating bodies do not fill, through failure to do so, and you have not got as many as are required for that panel, it is blank and has to be filled somehow.  The original Section 40 was intended to have the nominations filled from the Dáil.  Similarly the intention was that if there were blanks from the Dáil they would be filled up from the nominating bodies.  That might not be so easy and you might have to give them another opportunity of doing it.  Supposing you had both in that position, certainly there would be a one for bringing in some other body.  We must have <Col N="2625" /> some stage of finality.  When we go from one stage to another, you want a simple way to bring about finality by giving somebody like the Taoiseach power to fill up.  What we have here is used in substitution for the other two.  The Deputy has raised a point that I think should be met.  If he agrees, we might leave this over until to-morrow when we will be having the final run through the Bill.  I understand the Deputy's point to be that any power there is for filling up, in the case of outside nominating bodies, should be in the Dáil.  You would want proportional representation in order to do that.  There may be difficulties there that we will have to face, and perhaps in the end it might be simpler to have what is suggested here, that the ultimate power should reside in the Taoiseach.  Then there is the question of the filling of vacancies.</P>

      <P>The President, I think, has in view failure on the part of nominating bodies, either through their failure to put up the requisite number, or through a certain number of the people they do put up being disallowed.  When that lacuna has been made good, he thinks there may be another stage to be dealt with.  My suggestion is, why not have the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or the Committee of Selection, for the second stage, and the Dáil for the first.</P>

      <P>You have an appeal body of 15 for the ultimate but not for the first stage.  For the first stage, I think the power should remain with the Dáil.  There is this point.  The nominating body must put forward the nominations.  There is no compulsion, of course, so that you may not get from the nominating bodies the required number.  Supposing there are ten nominating bodies. They will nominate 20, each nominating two.  When you say that it is compulsory for the nominations, does that mean that it is compulsory that <Col N="2626" /> each must nominate two, but that it is not compulsory that the original panel must contain 20?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 34 (2), to add at the end of the sub-section two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) as soon as the Seanad returning officer has so ascertained the <Col N="2628" /> results of all the elections held in pursuance of this section, he shall prepare, sign, and publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a list of the persons elected at such elections, showing separately the persons elected by each electing council, and such statement as so published shall be a conclusive and final declaration of the result of every such election;</P>
    <P>(f) the expenses of every election held in pursuance of this section (other than the expenses of things required by this sub-section to be done by the Seanad returning officer) shall be borne by the electing council and shall be raised, in the case of the council of a county, by means of the poor rate as a county-at-large charge and, in the case of the county boroughs of Dublin and Limerick, by means of the municipal rate and, in the case of the county boroughs of Cork and Waterford, by means of the poor rate or such other rate as the Minister shall direct.</P>
    <P>This amendment adds to Section 34 two new paragraphs, lettered (e) and (f). Paragraph (e) provides for the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of a list of the persons elected; and paragraph (f) provides that the expenses of every such election shall be borne by the electing council&mdash;that the expenses of every election held in pursuance of this section, other than the expenses of things required to be done by the Seanad returning officer, shall be borne by local funds.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, section 34, to delete sub-section (3), and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to every council of a county or a county borough which is for the time being dissolved under Section 72 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the electors who, if such council were not so dissolved, would be required, by the foregoing provisions of this section to <Col N="2629" /> be elected by such council shall be elected from amongst themselves by the surviving persons (in this Part of this Act referred to as the former members of such council) who were members of such council immediately before it was so dissolved and have not, since such dissolution, suffered an adjudication in bankruptcy or a conviction of a crime or offence which would have terminated their membership of such council if it had not been so dissolved or such of such persons as think fit to take part in such election;</P>
    <P>(b) every candidate for election at such election shall be nominated in writing by two of the former members of such council;</P>
    <P>(c) if such election is contested, a meeting of the former members of such council shall be summoned and the election shall be made at such meeting by the former members of such council present at such meeting (or such of them as think proper to vote), voting by secret ballot on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote;</P>
    <P>(d) the provisions of the next preceding sub-section, so far as they are not inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this section, shall apply with such modifications as shall be necessary or shall be prescribed by regulations made under this section.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to delete the existing sub-section (3), and to substitute a new sub-section which will provide more clearly and explicitly for the election of electors by councils. Paragraph (a) of the new sub-section refers to the disqualification of persons who have suffered an adjudication in bankruptcy or a conviction of a crime or offence which, in the ordinary way, would have terminated their membership of the council if it had not been dissolved.  In other words, such persons are excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of the proposed new sub-section <Col N="2630" /> refers to &ldquo;the electors who, if such council were not so dissolved, would be required, by the foregoing provisions of this section, to be elected by such council, shall be elected from amongst themselves&rdquo;, and so on. Actually, however, in some cases, the council, required by the foregoing provisions of the section, has not been dissolved.  I suggest that, in three or four cases, it is the previous council that was dissolved.  This Act requires certain councils to make nominations in the normal way, or councils that were acting at the last county council election.  Well, three or four councils were dissolved&mdash;and one has been dissolved since that time&mdash;and so far as the amendment goes that case is met.  For instance, in the paper&mdash;I think it is a similar paper to that from which the President first got his knowledge of the political complexion of these matters &mdash;I learn that three councils have been dissolved.  My contention is that the Act refers to the bodies elected in 1933 and to any council elected in 1933, that was since dissolved, but it has been provided for those that were dissolved before 1934.</P>

      <P>I think I see the Deputy's point.  Again, however, I do not know for the moment whether the point is fundamentally sound or not, and all I can say is that I shall look into it.  There is no doubt that the councils are a continuing body, but I should like to examine that point in order to see whether or not there is any need for this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 53, it is possible that I may not have read these lettered paragraphs of the amendment correctly, but there seems to me to be an attempt, in paragraph (a) of the proposed new sub-section, to meet a difficulty that was raised here on the <Col N="2631" /> last day.  Then, however, the amendment seems to relapse into the former deficiencies when you get down to paragraph (c).  I take it that the meaning of paragraph (a) is, simply, to prevent members of dissolved county councils from being electors if, since the dissolution of the council, they have been found guilty of a crime or have been adjudicated bankrupt.  Therefore, as far as paragraph (a) is concerned it seems to be all right; but then paragraph (c) provides for a meeting of the former members of such council.  It seems to me that the meeting referred to in paragraph (c) is not a meeting of the people referred to in paragraph (a).  Paragraph (c) speaks of a meeting of the former members of the dissolved council, including the adjudicated bankrupts and those who have been convicted of a crime, evidently. It does not speak as in paragraph (a), of a meeting of such members of the council who were members of it immediately before it was dissolved and who have not, in the meantime, suffered an adjudication in bankruptcy or the conviction of a crime or offence which would have terminated their membership of the council; it speaks of a meeting of former members of the council.  It says that a meeting of the former members shall be summoned and that the election shall be made at the meeting by the former members of the council present at the meeting. That is on page 8.  I am referring to amendment No. 53 and I am contrasting lettered paragraph (a) with lettered paragraph (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>A definition is given in paragraph (a).  There is an addition there where it refers to members who have not, since the dissolution of the council, suffered an adjudication in bankruptcy or a conviction of a crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is in paragraph (a): but paragraph (c) seems to contemplate the summoning of a meeting of all of the former members, whether they had been adjudicated bankrupt, convicted of crimes, or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, Deputy McGowan has made a suggestion to me just now which I think is right.  I think the point is that the people who are summoned under paragraph (c) are the former members of the council, as defined in paragraph (a), and the former members of the council as defined in paragraph (a) are defined as those members who have not been disqualified by bankruptcy and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that meets that point, but there was another point which was raised on the last occasion.  When you have summoned all of the former members of the council, or the surviving members, two things may happen: one is that you may have nominated and elected a man, who, since the dissolution of the council had been convicted for a crime or adjudicated a bankrupt.  That point, apparently, is met; but the second point is, that a man who becomes one of the elected seven may immediately offer his vote for subscription, because after that he may do something to disqualify him from membership of the county council, but his title to vote for the Seanad is that he is one of seven nominees, and, as such, apparently, he may do everything or anything that would disqualify him for membership of the council&mdash;such as being adjudicated a bankrupt, being convicted of a crime, or selling his vote &mdash;but is still able to exercise his vote for the Seanad.  I do not think there is any attachment of the Corrupt Practices Act to such a person.  We were told on the last day by the Minister for Agriculture that it was intended there should be.  It is certainly not met by this amendment.  It might be met by some impact between the Corrupt Practices Act and a man who was a voter for the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Consequential Provisions Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was explained that that Bill would apply to people who became members of the Seanad. There is no doubt that a man who becomes a member of the Seanad, with the Corrupt Practices Act being <Col N="2633" /> revived with regard to membership, would be disqualified from being a member of the Seanad if he became bankrupt or was disqualified for some crime.  I am dealing with the intermediate stage.  Supposing some nominees of a county council put themselves on record in a newspaper as saying: &ldquo;We will take £50 each for our votes,&rdquo; what happens?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it apply to a special electorate based on these additions of seven nominees from each county council?  It does apply obviously to members of Dáil Eireann.  They become an electoral body because the right to nominate or vote for a member of the Seanad depends upon membership of the Dáil.  Membership of the Dáil is broken by any of these corrupt practices, but is membership of one of these groups of seven representing the county councils broken by a corrupt practice?  We were told the last day that it was not intended it should be so.</P>

      <P>On Thursday last the Minister for Agriculture clearly laid down that they could accept bribes; that the law as it stood did not affect that, and that it was not the intention of the Government to provide that the law should affect that. I think that is an absolute statement of the case.  Meanwhile, the Minister went asleep during the night, and while he was asleep something occurred, because next morning all the points made against the Minister, and which he repudiated as being absurd, he said were all met.  Therefore, I am sure the Minister was wiser asleep than when he was half awake in the Dáil. Next morning he explained that the Consequential Provisions Bill did apply the corrupt practices to all electors. He did not explain how it did, but we were to accept that it did on the faith of the Minister who the night before said the opposite.  That is our <Col N="2634" /> difficulty.  Have we any guarantee or any proof of this.  Because we have two opposite statements from the Minister who was in charge of the Bill&mdash; that the Corrupt Practices Act did apply, and that it did not apply and that it was not the intention of the Government to apply it.  I understand the contention now is that you are reviving all references to the Seanad in the old legislation barring one or two.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first point raised by Deputy McGilligan I suggest that it would be even more clear by transferring the words inside the bracket to the third last line to come in after the word &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo;. It says &ldquo;the surviving persons (in this part of this Act referred to as the former members of such council)&rdquo;.  If you move it down after the word &ldquo;dissolved&rdquo; you apply the disqualification to the surviving persons.  I think that would make it clearer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is necessary, because undoubtedly as it stands &ldquo;former members of the council&rdquo; appears only to mean surviving persons, not surviving persons less those people referred in the words which follow.  Deputy Benson makes the point that if the words &ldquo;(in this Part of this Act referred to as the former members of such council)&rdquo; were brought down to the second last line of the amendment they would cover the surviving members, <Col N="2635" /> less those unfit persons who were adjudicated bankrupt or otherwise.</P>

Perhaps it would have curtailed a lot of discussion then if we had somebody who would meet the position.  Although an effort has been made, I am not sure that it meets the contention raised.  It speaks &ldquo;of the surviving persons (in this Part of the Act referred to as the former members of such council)&rdquo;.  In what Part of the Act are they referred to as &ldquo;the former members of such council&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>This can be read in two ways.  For instance, members of a council dissolved since the election in 1934 can be fittingly described as former members of the council resurrected for the purpose of this Bill. But it is doubtful if former members of a council, who went out of office in 1934 and ceased to be councillors by the operation of the statute, come under the head of former councils, inasmuch as they went out of office not by anything the Minister did, but by the operation of the ordinary statute that brought them into existence. Although an effort has been made to do it, I doubt very much if it does do it.</P>

      <P>If it is going to be the councils elected in 1928, of which many members are dead and of which only the skeleton remains, it is merely a tragic joke.  I know one council of which six of the former <Col N="2636" /> members are dead and another council of which four are dead.

      <P>We are asked to accept in this Bill a statement which is not yet proved to be accurate. There was a Constitution in this country from 1922.  In that Constitution legislative power was given to a body called the Oireachtas.  That body could have, if it so wished, given back power to the people to enact legislation but it failed to do so.  As long as that Constitution ran, the only legislative authority in this country was in the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas did not give away that power to anybody else.  They did not <Col N="2638" /> re-put it into the hands of the people. How does it come then that the people enact anything?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the power of the people to do this: If the law of the country is that the Oireachtas enacts legislation, and if that is not changed, as it could have been changed by legislation, and if something happens which is declared to be legislation by the people, then I ask where is the power of the people to legislate?  It is nowhere in the old Constitution.  It could have been derived from the old Constitution, but it was not derived from it.</P>

      <P>The general object of the Bill, A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, is as explained by the Minister for Justice on the Second Reading.  It is to ensure that there will be continuity in legislation, and that the changes which have come about in connection with the operation of the new Constitution, which will come into effect on 29th December, will not have the effect of causing any dislocation.  The object of this measure is to ensure that the legislative machinery will continue, and that there will be no dislocation. The method under which that result is sought to be arrived at is to give the Executive Council&mdash; which will be the Government under the new Constitution&mdash;power to make orders on the same lines as were made in 1922 under the Adaptation of Enactments Act when a somewhat similar change was being made on the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann.  It is entirely a legal matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only explaining the general terms of the Bill.  I did not say it was included in Section 2. Section 2 deals with the general adaptation of the expressions &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo;<Col N="2642" /> and makes provision with reference to matters that have come into operation. They shall be construed and have effect in like manner as they were construed and had effect immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution in relation to anything done or to be done or an event occurring or a period or series of periods beginning after the coming into operation of the Constitution. The expressions &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; are to be construed and have effect as meaning Ireland.  There is this further provision in paragraph (c): &ldquo;in relation to anything done or to be done or an event occurring partly before and partly after the coming into operation of the Constitution&rdquo;; that is, which will be partly completed afterwards, and it makes arrangements so that there will be no break in the continuity with reference to the appropriate legislation in that regard. The object of the section is to modify the expressions &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Free State&rdquo; so that such statutory instruments as refer to these shall be carried on and shall have the same force when the new Constitution comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Minister's explanation, I take that as being the full content of Section 2. We have passed two measures called the Control of Manufactures Acts.  In one of those the definition of national does not correspond with the definition of national in the old Constitution, nor does it correspond with the definition of national in the present Constitution. Am I to take it that that word in relation to anything done prior to the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann and in relation to anything that happened afterwards means Ireland?  The Minister will see that it was a definition by which it was attempted to ensure certain things for nationals of this country with regard to manufactures in the country.  I think the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; was not defined in such a way as to include Ireland.  I am bound to take it from the Minister's explanation that hereafter the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; means anybody who is <Col N="2643" /> Irish.  If that is so there is a big change effected.  I would like to know if that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sought to make any change, but simply to carry on the existing position.  As far as I know, the general object of the measure is to carry on the existing position.  The Deputy says a change is being effected. I may not be competent to say whether or not a change is being effected, but the advice I have received is that the object of this measure and of this section is simply to carry on the existing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>No change whatever. There is a bit of a label stuck on and we are to have bonfires lit for that.  Remember that this does not change the position.  If the Minister is afraid to say it, I will say it for him.  I think we can agree to the section on the basis that it means nothing.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, I would like some explanation of the necessity for those sub-sections which oust the courts in favour of the Taoiseach.  What is the meaning of sub-section (2)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) leaves it to the Taoiseach to determine questions as to the most appropriate particular official person or body or governmental authority under the new Constitution.  It follows on the lines of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922, from which it is taken almost word for word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we take that with sub-section (3) of the next section.  I want to get that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy wants to have made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this is giving power to the Taoiseach to determine certain things.  It is quite clear it does and it adds that the decision of the Taoiseach shall be final.  It does not say when that decision shall be made.  There is a corresponding sub-section in the next section which relates to government orders.  It says:</P>
      <P>Every order made by the Government under this section shall, unless such order otherwise provides, have and be deemed always to have had effect as from the commencement of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2645" /> If I take the analogy of that, then the situation would appear to be that at any time, say, ten years hence, the Taoiseach may come to a conclusion with regard to some correspondence between an official in the new State and an official in the old State and that that will operate as having a retrospective effect going back ten years. That would be a pretty serious situation and I would like to ask what is this supposed to have reference to and what is the importance of it and how may the legal situation hereafter be changed by any decision made by the Taoiseach?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks me how will the legal position be altered. I think he should be in a position to answer his own question and to know what way it is going to alter it.  This provision is not going to make any change in the existing situation, which is that the President of the Executive Council, under the Adaptation of Enactments Act of 1922, has power to decide these matters where a dispute arises.  I do not know whether, in fact, a dispute has arisen.  If a dispute had arisen and it became necessary for the President to determine the point, I have no doubt that the legal advisers to the Government, if they felt that further provision was necessary to cover the circumstances, would have made such provision in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any danger that the Taoiseach might, deliberately or otherwise, delay in adjudicating a matter like that or is it possible that a question might not be put up to the Taoiseach for a number of years and that he would then give a decision which would have retrospective effect? Will no period be fixed during which that sub-section might have the effect of operating retrospectively to the detriment of some official or somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the matter would probably be dealt with under the next section, where the Government has power to make certain adaptations and modifications. If it were found necessary that the <Col N="2646" /> adaptation should have retrospective effect, the Government would make an order under Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They need not make an order under Section 5.  Suppose the Government of the day find themselves in difficulties and they can see a way out if they can give to some new official the powers possessed by, say, the Revenue Commissioners in relation to matters that should arise in court.  The Taoiseach by saying, &ldquo;I find that he is the corresponding official to the officials who at one time had certain powers&rdquo;&mdash;by this simple decision as to correspondence between two people he could carry over and give into the possession of a new official powers previously possessed by another body.

I should like to know if the Minister is saying that the courts definitely have the power to override the decision of the Taoiseach, which is stated in this Bill to be final, or is it merely a problematical matter the deciding of which in the Supreme Court at some future date may cost the State a lot of money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Every order made by the Government under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as conveniently may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within twenty-one days on which such House has sat after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to make provision for bringing orders made by the Government under the section before each House of the Oireachtas.  It was intended that this provision would be in the Bill but it was omitted.  It was also omitted from the 1922 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is on the lines of the 1922 Act there is a strange omission in the Bill.  It was so left that the Government's retrospective adaptation might have been carried through by them and not published.  This <Col N="2653" /> amendment carries us some length. During the discussion on the last section the Minister used the phrase that there was an amendment on the Order Paper which would give the Dáil an opportunity to discuss any of these orders.  This amendment does not do anything of the sort.  It simply means that the order is to be brought in &ldquo;and if either such House shall, within twenty-one days on which such House has sat after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such order, such order shall be annulled accordingly...&rdquo; That is the ordinary form of order that comes in but it is not the type of order that gives the Dáil a chance to discuss it.  The order that necessitates that the Dáil must discuss is one that says it shall not be valid until it is affirmed.  This order can lie on the Table for 21 days, and unless the Government is so disposed the 21 days may have passed without the Dáil getting an opportunity to discuss the matter at all.  The order is then useless.  If the 21 days have passed there is no value in raising a discussion, even though it is going to lead to a vote against the order.  If Ministers deliberately use this order, and the Dáil does not get a chance of discussing it, then why have they brought in an order requiring an affirmative vote before it becomes affirmative? We have had experience of that before in the use of this order. In fact, motions were put down but, because of the impossibility of fitting in discussion of such motions with the disposal of Government time, there was no question of discussing them and matters became law by lapse of time. The Minister may defend this kind of order as one that is commonly made. It is, but it is not an order that gives the House any rights.  It only gives rights if the Government so wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that there should be consistent interpretation <Col N="2654" /> from the coming into force of the new Constitution, and that there should not be any variations from time to time.  The intention is to try to secure the same interpretation right through, after the Constitution comes into force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>So that if an order is made some years after the Constitution comes into effect, it will be consistent. There might be some inconsistencies if this retrospective power were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things at issue.  Something may occur requiring decision five years after the Constitution comes into operation. It may be necessary not to have any breach of continuity, but that can be done without making this legislation operate retrospectively, to make legal anything illegal that may have been done in the meantime.  This goes the whole way and gives power to make it retrospective and to have retroactive effect.  There is a difference. Generally when there is this patchwork arrangement contemplated, it is necessary to see that there is no breach of continuity, but that may be done without prejudice to any matters affected and without invalidating things that happened.  This allows, and the contemplation is, that these matters shall be validated; that there shall be a new decision which shall have retrospective effect from the commencement of the Act.  Why is that necessary?  I can see the necessity of having no breach of continuity.  Why have such breach of continuity voided by invalidating all that happened in the meantime?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular case that the Deputy has in mind, it is hardly likely that the Government would seek to apply an order with retrospective effect.  The necessity for this retrospective clause is to preserve consistency.  If there is a definite upsetting of something that has gone before.  I do not think that the <Col N="2655" /> Government would approach it by making an adaptation order.  Presumably they would deal with it by legislation.</P>

      <P>The opinion of the legal advisers of the Government, after their experience of the past 15 years, is that the Government should be given more power of elasticity.  In accordance with that, they have made a specific adaptation superior to the general adaptation in the preceding section.  Under this section they are seeking power to enable them to have more elasticity.  As I have said, from their experience they feel that special circumstances may arise, and that it is necessary to have this power.  They are simply going on their general experience as to the operation of these adaptation orders in past years.</P>

      <P>There is, first of all, the Taoiseach, then there is the Tanaiste, and, in the event of one being out of office, the other immediately operates. Presumably, the Executive Council will, in the event of the illness of the second person, appoint a third Minister.  But why bring in officials? After all, the seal must have some importance.  It is apparently given a position of some significance.  We want to make sure that a person with ministerial responsibility alone will have the use of it.

      <P>With all due respect, to say that does not answer the point. The Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act never applied to the people who will become electors under the new Seanad Act.  At any period in its existence it never applied to the seven people who will be selected by Deputy Corry's friends on the Cork County Council as electors under the new Seanad Act.</P>

It is certainly no answer to the point for the Minister to get up and say that this Bill he is introducing is bringing the Act back into force, and that it is now going to apply to the people who will be put on the electoral colleges, because there is nothing in this Bill or in the original Act to say it does apply to them.</P>

      <P>Then will the Minister give facilities for the introduction of a Private Members' Bill to make it quite clear that those nominees of county councils who are to form portion of the electorate for the election of members of the Seanad will be prevented from accepting bribes for their votes?  I raised this point on the last stage of the Seanad Bill, and I raised it in all seriousness, because I regard it as a matter of paramount importance that any dealings in votes by those people who are nominees of county councils, or by members of the Dáil, if you like to put them all on the one plane, should be clearly and specifically provided against by law.  It is a matter of very vital importance in connection with an election of this kind.  If any abuses once creep in, in connection with the election of Senators, then not merely will we get a bad type of Senator but we will get the new Seanad brought <Col N="2670" /> into very considerable disrepute, which is a thing that we on this side of the House, at all events, want to avoid.  I raised this point in all seriousness.  I am not yet satisfied, because of the fact that a new type of electorate is being created <i>ad hoc</i> for the purpose of the Seanad election, a type of electorate which never existed before, that the provisions of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act will apply to that new type of body which is to be selected by the county councils.</P>

      <P>With all respect to the legal luminary who supported the Minister, there is this very definite point raised by Deputy Costello&mdash;that there is a new type of electorate coming into being under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill.  The point has been put, and can be met in <Col N="2671" /> an easy way, as to whether or not that electoral body is subject to the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, and if so, what is the linking up of the different sections?  All the Minister has told us is that something was prohibited by the Act of 1936, and that now the whole thing is revived.  There immediately, of course, jumps to one's mind that there was not this particular type of electorate when the Act of 1936 was passed, and there was not, of course, this type of electorate when the Act of 1933 was passed.  It may be the situation that the words are so general in those Acts that they meet the new body, but it may also be that the old Acts are so tied up with references to Seanad elections and Dáil Eireann elections that they do not meet the new electoral bodies of seven. If the situation is that those Acts do apply, that is capable of explanation, and is capable of very simple explanation. Would the Minister give it to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  If the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act has been found satisfactory for both Dáil and Seanad elections, where the electors were the ordinary people of the country, since 1923, why should that Act not be sufficient to deal with the new electorate?</P>

The promise was that what we may familiarly call the Corrupt Practices Act applied to the new group of seven nominees put up by each county council.  A suggestion has been made that it does not, and the suggestion has been backed up by those references to the novel situation that the new body never was in existence before and the new body never could have been contemplated by the old Act.  It is possible that the old Act does not apply to the new body.  If it does, it is easy to see how it does, and we want that information.</P>

      <P>I just wish to raise one other point.  I hesitate to do so. The fact is I am terrified of being accused by Deputy Corry of obstruction and of endeavouring to improve or sharpen my legal practice at the expense of Deputy Corry's patience. Section 4 of the Act of 1923 provides a definition of treating.  I base this issue that I am putting forward here by reference to that section, which I take at random.  Sub-section (2) sets out that &ldquo;every elector who corruptly accepts or takes any such meat, drink, entertainment or provision as is mentioned in the preceding sub-section shall be guilty of treating.&rdquo;  I have searched through the Act of 1923 to see if the definition of elector there has the smallest application to the elector who will be represented as the nominee of the county councils.</P>

A Seanad elector is defined and a Dáil elector is defined in that Act, but the word &ldquo;elector&rdquo;<Col N="2674" /> as used in this section that I took at random is in a different category, and I want to know how that can be applied to the new elector who is to be selected as the nominee of the county council.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 13, what precisely is the meaning of giving power to the Government to defer punishment?  It is certainly a novel form of authority to give a Government. I can conceive of a Government being entitled to remit punishment or to give free pardons, but why they should be entitled to get a sort of cat-and-mouse power&mdash;that appears to be what it is&mdash;in respect of persons convicted by the Military Tribunal I do not know.  Apparently, they can say to a person who has been convicted by that tribunal and sentenced to six years: &ldquo;We shall let you out for a couple of years but, at the end of that time, you will have to serve the rest of your sentence.&rdquo;  Is that what is intended?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is wrong in saying that I was responsible for the drafting of Article 2A.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who used to be a solicitor, and who is now Parliamentary Secretary to the President should know, because of that position, if not of his own knowledge, that the Attorney-General is not the draftsman and has nothing to do with the drafting of Bills.  <i>(Interruption by Deputy Corry.)</i>  If I could hear Deputy Corry, I might have some chance of understanding him.  When he is bawling, it is hard enough to understand him, but when he whispers, it is impossible.  Even assuming that this is a copy of a corresponding provision in Article 2A, it is conceivable that, in the circumstances giving rise to the putting into force of the provisions of Article 2A, the Government might usefully have a power of deferring punishment, but Article 2A and the powers of the Military Tribunal automatically come to an end on the 29th of this month.  Are the Government going to let some of these men who are now in jail out under the power given to defer their punishment?  Are we to understand that the men in jail may be released with the warning, &ldquo;Remember that at any time we take it into our heads, back you go to serve the rest of your sentence.&rdquo;  The Minister should realise that there is a complete difference in the operation of the section embodied in Article 2A and the operation of the power now proposed to be conferred on the Government.  I want to know what is the meaning of that power.</P>

      <P>What is the power?  At the moment, there are a few people <Col N="2677" /> incarcerated under orders of the Military Tribunal.  Perhaps the Minister is having a sitting of the Military Tribunal as a sort of farewell party whereat they will appoint punishment to some former friends of the Government, as a farewell gesture, before they pass out of existence under the Constitution. The Government would then have power to say: &ldquo;We have caught you now.  We may let you out for the next few years but, if we should happen to be Government at the end of that time, back you will go if you do not behave yourselves.&rdquo;  I cannot conceive of any other circumstances in which this power would operate.  The punishment of people already sentenced by the Military Tribunal cannot be deferred even under the power proposed to be given here.  I want to know if it is intended that people will be rushed hurriedly to a farewell sitting of the Military Tribunal and that the Government want to be vested with this peculiar cat-and-mouse power in respect of these persons.</P>

Are there any persons detained under sentences imposed by this Special Tribunal on capital charges?  What will be the position of any such person in future?  I observe that the Government are not taking power to defer punishment in that case.  What is it intended to do in the case of a person serving a sentence by the Military Tribunal on a capital charge?  If such a person is serving a commuted sentence on a capital charge, is it intended that he should remain in prison for the next 40 years, if he lives so long, or is the ordinary practice to be followed?

I was distinctly told last week that this was to preserve the prerogatives of the Uachtarán, that it was he had power to remit capital punishment, that the reason this exception was made was that the Government had not power but that, under the Constitution, it was the Uachtarán who had the power. We get an entirely different answer now, so far as I can understand the answers, and I will admit the limitation. There is, I understand, one person under sentence, and here I should like to put this question: on what is this supposed to operate? There has been a man sentenced to death by this Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, and that sentence has been commuted to penal servitude. Therefore, the commutation has already taken place.  What, then, is the point of the section?  On what is it supposed to operate?</P>

That sentence was subsequently commuted by the Executive Council to penal servitude for life.  I take it, therefore, that a sentence of life imprisonment in such circumstances is in a category somewhat similar to a sentence of three years' imprisonment.

      <P>Will the Minister address himself, not to the powers being given to the Government, but to the powers being specifically withheld from the Government?  There is an &ldquo;except&rdquo; in the section.  It is no good saying that certain powers are conferred on the Government.  The argument is about the powers that are excepted and not conferred on the Government.  To get up and tell us that certain powers are conferred on the Government is not answering the point in discussion at all.  The point in discussion is: why is there an exception? What are the capital charges contemplated on which this exception is to operate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a submission to the President, because I suppose this is the President's child and he probably knows something about it? What is the purpose of saying in this section that &ldquo;except in capital cases the Government may remit, in whole or in part, any punishment imposed by the Constitution (Special Powers) Bill&rdquo;?  I understand there is one person at present serving a term of imprisonment who was tried by the Military Tribunal, sentenced to death, and which sentence was commuted to penal servitude for life.  I am speaking subject to correction.  I take it that a sentence of that kind is in somewhat the same category as a sentence of three, five or ten years' penal servitude, but in any event, it is not now a capital case, because it is an ordinary definable term of imprisonment for <Col N="2683" /> life or for five or ten years.  I take it, therefore, that that is the kind of case in which the Government may, in their discretion, exercise certain clemency by way of modification or deferment of the punishment.</P>
      <P>If that is so, what is the purpose in this section of this phrase: &ldquo;Except in capital cases&rdquo;?  I do not think there are any other capital cases.  The Minister for Education told us it was necessary to have these powers after the Constitution comes into operation. I cannot understand that reason at all.  I take it that the Constitution (Special Tribunal) Act lapses and that probably the only type of capital case to be dealt with by the Military Tribunal would be a case that would arise between now and the 29th of this month.  What is the precise explanation of the words &ldquo;Except in capital cases&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>When running through documents it is not easy to give the right one.  Article 13 (6) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President, but such power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain powers conferred on the Executive Council, and these are being carried on.  This is to bring them into accord with that clause, so that the power in capital cases may <Col N="2684" /> still be reserved to the President, on the advice of the Executive Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The point is this: suppose that before the 29th December, there may be or may have been, capital cases in which the power of remission would probably belong to the President, on the advice of the Executive Council, the general intention, as I understand it, is to continue the powers which the Executive Council has at the moment for remitting punishment in certain cases.  The desire is, in the case of any prisoners that might be in prison after the new Constitution has come into operation, that these powers of remission should still continue.  Otherwise, there would be a difficulty, in case it was thought advisable by people interested that remission should be given.  My view is that the introduction of this, except in capital cases, is for no other purpose but to bring this clause into agreement with the general principle of the Constitution which gives to the President power to deal with capital cases, on the advice of the Government. In other cases the Government is going to replace the Executive Council in this respect.  Are there any capital cases?  I do not know whether, in fact, there are capital cases that would continue to be referred to as &ldquo;capital cases.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that in regard to drafting the general intentions are understood when a Minister is giving details of a Bill. That is the usual practice.

      <P>Article 36 of the Constitution provided that the right of pardon and the right to commute punishment inflicted by any courts exercising criminal jurisdiction was vested in the President.  It refers to a court which, during the period of office of the President, is exercising criminal jurisdiction.  In this particular case the tribunal will in fact not exist under the Constitution.  It will have ceased on the 29th December if this Constitution comes into operation. We will have a President elected, let us say, six months hence, and he may then be confronted with a situation whereby a person is in custody, on a charge in respect of which he was convicted by a court not then existing.  Has the President power in that case to commute the sentence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the case the Deputy is trying to imagine could arise.  This is a &ldquo;carrying-over&rdquo; Bill to try to meet the existing situation, and to carry over parts essential for the future.  The reason this clause is there, and is worded in this way, is to keep it in consonance with what will be done, and to give power to, the person who will have to act in capital cases.  Supposing that there was a capital offence and that judgment was passed between this and the 29th December, when the 29th came along that ended the decision.  If there was not &ldquo;carrying-over&rdquo; power such as this, there would be no power in anyone to remit the punishment inflicted. This is simply a safeguard, and is in consonance with the general spirit of the Constitution, which says that in capital cases it is reserved for the President, on the advice of the Executive Council, of course, to pardon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points raised here.  One is to this exception about capital cases; the second, as to deferring punishment; and the third, to the general scope of Section 13.  Taking the second one first, the President's explanation about deferring punishment is that the Government has already power to defer punishment, already deferred <Col N="2687" /> If it is not that, it has no meaning. As Deputy Costello pointed out, this Bill will not operate until after the 29th December, and by then we are told the body which imposed the punishment will have gone out of existence.  It must operate punishments awarded prior to the 29th December, and the President says not merely convictions but those deferred. Why was there necessity to put in a special clause?  Does not the Executive Council of Eire take the place of Saorstát Eireann?  We have a variety of clauses described as &ldquo;carrying on,&rdquo; and the whole purpose is to put the Executive Council of Ireland&mdash; with a note of interrogation after Ireland&mdash;into the same position as Saorstát Eireann.  If the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann have this power, the Executive Council of Eire will have the same power in previous clauses hereafter.  Why pick this out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice apparently consider that this safeguard should be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's colleague told us early in the evening that the Department demanded the bringing in of this, and when he was asked for the reasons that made the Minister accept the demand, he was not able to give one.  The President is now drifting into the mood that his colleague has been in for the last hour and a half.  It slumps down to this, that officials told him and he did not bother to question the officials whether their viewpoint was correct or not, or to get an example from them that he could put before the House.  The Minister simply came here and told us that the officials demanded the bringing in of this, but we could not get any reason from him.  It is no explanation for the President to come here now and say that the Department of Justice think it necessary to insert what he calls a safeguard.  I presume that, when the Department did that, the President, or some of his colleagues, asked for the reason, and my submission is that this House ought to get the reasons and not simply the answer &ldquo;the officials demand it.&rdquo;  Bureaucrats always want all sorts of things. <Col N="2688" /> Surely we have not yet got to the point that the House is going to be asked to say: &ldquo;The Department want this and we ought to pass it,&rdquo; and in that way resign ourselves into the control of a Department.  If this is necessary, then let us pass it with some better argument than merely to be told that the Department want it.</P>
      <P>The next point is with regard to capital cases.  Is there any change being made?  I gather not.  The situation, as I understand it, is that the Executive Council had control in this matter under Article 2A.  By this Bill the new Executive Council, with the Taoiseach and the Tanaiste at the head of it, is going to have the same powers as the present Executive Council.  What, therefore, is the need for all this?  The Executive Council has those powers by law.  The President's colleague told us on an earlier section that the whole scheme of this was to ensure that there would be no dislocation; that there would be smoothness in the running over from one period to the next.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the point about the capital cases is.  We are told that there is a constitutional provision that the remission in capital cases cannot be conferred upon anybody except the President.  If that is so, then the Constitution would rule it simply. The last point is with regard to the scope of the section.  Before the President came in, his colleague, briefed, I suppose, by the Department responsible for the Bill, told us that this was intended to operate in the future.  When I questioned the whole thing coming to an end on the 29th of this month the Minister was quite precise about that.</P>

      <P>I referred to the relieving power.  The Deputy is trying to give the House the impression that I said&mdash;I may unwittingly have given the impression&mdash;that the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal would continue in operation.  What I meant to say, and what I believe I did say, was that the relieving powers which the Executive Council have at present would continue after the 29th December, and that that was the object of this section.</P>

      <P>It was idle to have such an aim as that, because that aim was already achieved if, by nothing else, then by a preceding section which puts the new Executive Council into the same position as the Executive Council that preceded it.  The other point, I believe, is the correct one, that the phrase has no limitation with regard to time.  That phrase, if it comes hereafter to be construed, will certainly mean that any punishment imposed from time to time will be imposed by the new Special Powers Tribunal.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill &ldquo;to make divers provisions consequential on or incidental to the coming into operation of the Constitution.&rdquo;  One of the Articles of the Constitution is Article 38, which says that &ldquo;special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate.&rdquo;  It is contemplated, therefore, in the Constitution that courts corresponding to the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal will be set up.  Suppose one is set up next year, and that it bears the name of the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, surely this clause meets the case.</P>

      <P>Suppose there is a new body not called the Special Powers Tribunal, the Taoiseach has power by himself under sub-section (2) of Section 4 of this Bill to determine that the new body is equivalent to the new Special Powers Tribunal and his decision is final.  That sub-section has a <Col N="2690" /> definitely ominous meaning, because if any question arises as to the new body the Taoiseach determines it.  It is possible, therefore, under the new Constitution for a new body to be set up and called the Military Tribunal.  The Taoiseach can, by his determination which is final, say that that body represents the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, and thereafter we have the relieving effect of this section carried forward.  The Minister tried to retrace his steps.  He did say that that clause looked to the future.  He did not make any limitation with regard to the other relieving powers.  He was first of all thinking of the court which would be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to know that Article 2A goes out of existence with the disappearance of the old Constitution.  Therefore the Executive Council will have no powers that are not given to it by some Act of Parliament. If the Constitutional provision which gives those powers to the Executive Council disappears, then the Executive Council have got none, and the Deputy knows it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that the Executive Council will have no powers when the foundation <Col N="2691" /> of their powers disappears. With regard to this Bill, I am sorry that the Minister for Justice, who had charge of it, is unable, through illness, to attend in the House.  It is a Bill of a technical and legal character, and the Minister in charge has to make up the details to meet all the points likely to be raised.  Again I say that when the present Constitution disappears, Article 2A, which gives the Executive Council the powers they have at present, also disappears. Therefore the Executive Council have no powers that could be continued over, so that this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That answer is unsatisfactory, first of all, because under the Interpretation Act of 1923 a peculiar position was created.  When a Bill is repealed, there is a gap that is still left, and I suggest that the President has been misinformed if he suggests that his answer is the correct one.  I suggest that he has not got that answer, and that this interpretation of his can be disregarded for that reason. The second point is that under Article 2A there is a general prerogative of mercy, and general prerogatives of mercy are carried forward by the Constitution. Therefore there is no necessity for this.</P>

      <P>Well, the opinion I have given the Deputy is the legal opinion I have been given, and, in a case of that sort, I am going to depend on the advice of those who have the responsibility for giving a real legal opinion, and not on the advice of those who have not any responsibility and who are only concerned with what political points they can make out of the matter.  The reasons that I have given to the House for this are the reasons that have been given to me by people competent to advise, and I think that these reasons are good reasons.  If anybody else thinks differently, then the matter can be decided in a different way.</P>

      <P>Well, if a Minister brings a Bill before the House&mdash;and the President may realise this yet&mdash;he ought at least to try to convince the House about what the Bill relates to, and not say, in effect: &ldquo;Well, I asked the boys, and they said it was all right.&rdquo;  In bringing the Seanad Bill through the House, one of the chief arguments used was that this Bill would clarify certain sections of the Seanad Bill, but our experience of the last few weeks makes that a rather difficult pill to swallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the Seanad Bill was very different from that of this Bill.  In the case of the Seanad Bill, there were three or four alternative schemes in regard to the Seanad, and there was no use in trying to work out all the details corresponding to the various schemes proposed.  Accordingly, the Seanad Bill was entirely different in character from this Bill.  This is a Bill which was very carefully considered, and it is well known what is the usual practice in regard to such Bills.  I am talking now to people who know perfectly well what is the usual procedure in regard to such Bills.  If some of the criticism that has been levelled in this connection came from people who did not know how this sort of work is done it would be quite a different matter, but the Deputies opposite know perfectly well what is the usual procedure&mdash;what is necessary in order to get Government business done, and how it is necessary, once the general principles of a Bill have been established, sent to the draftsmen, considered by the draftsmen and returned, that the final carrying of the Bill through the House and the explanation of the Bill to the House is entrusted to one Minister so as to prevent unnecessary details being brought into discussion.  What happened in this case is that, unfortunately, the Minister concerned got ill at the last moment and another Minister had to substitute for him.  I have not myself <Col N="2693" /> been in charge of the Bill, but it seems to me to be quite obvious that, when you know what happens in regard to deferred sentences and so on, you can see the interpretation at once that should be put on this, and I say that the answer I have given to Deputy McGilligan is correct, and that is that the Executive Council, once Article 2A of the Constitution is removed, will have no powers except such as are given by Act of Parliament.  Therefore the question of continuing powers is not affected.</P>

However, what we are told in connection with this is that it is necessary because, once Article 2A is gone, the power of the Executive Council with regard to pardon is gone.  I say that it is not. First of all I ask the President to look at the Interpretation Act and, after that, to look at the clause that he himself put in the Constitution carrying forward the prerogative with regard to mercy&mdash;whether retained in law or not&mdash;and to find out what happened in regard to that.</P>

      <P>It may be very clever.  Of course, the President's Government is so much of a one-man business that he would not even discuss such a matter with his colleagues and advisers!  He knows that he would. If he would discuss these other comparatively harmless and minor matters, surely he would discuss the more important ones; and is it not amazing that a Minister, who made such a woeful exhibition of himself with regard to other clauses of this Bill, should suddenly have become aroused to the extent of having some definite idea with regard to this particular clause. The one thing that starts out from the whole thing is that this clause was considered as an Executive Council matter and the rest were not.  The only reason it was considered is because it is an important matter to make some provision for the future re-establishment of these special tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is extremely clever and very unconvincing. If he looks at the clause he will see that this is the power of remission. <Col N="2696" /> If we are even to take the Deputy's view that it was carried over, is it not clearly only the power of remission and the prerogative of mercy?  What do we want it for?  For the reasons we have given.  That is all that can be alleged, even under his own suggestion, which is, of course, absurd on the face of it.  The Deputy need not be afraid, if he thinks it is going to be of any political value, to say that special courts may be necessary.  They may be necessary.  If they are necessary, this Government, in carrying out its duty, will come to Parliament to set them up.  Do not think that we are running away from the possibility of anything of that sort.  If it is necessary, it will be done, and then the Deputy can talk as much as he likes about it.  I say in answer to the Deputy that if he thinks there is any political advantage in talking in that manner, I will give him all he wants of it, and he can take all the advantage he wishes out of the statement which I make here deliberately&mdash;that if public order here demands that there should be, under the new Constitution, special courts set up, it will be done; and if this Executive Council is in office, it will face its responsibility and bring in a measure to deal with it.  Is the Deputy satisfied?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this is concerned, it is carrying over the powers of deferment of sentences, of commutation and relief of sentences, which is already given by Article 2A but which will disappear when Article 2A disappears, because the foundation of the power of commutation and remission of sentence, which the Executive Council has at present in regard to prisoners convicted by the tribunal, is given to them by Article 2A.  We want to see, if there are any prisoners in prison at the time the new Constitution comes in and the old one goes out, that the powers of remission are continued over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says that is not an answer.  I say that people, in whose opinion I have much more faith than I have in any legal opinion which he would give, consider that it is advisable <Col N="2697" /> and necessary.  Even if it were not necessary, what harm can be done by giving these extra powers so as to make, if you like, assurance doubly sure?  It is ridiculous to say that these are powers in relation to some future tribunal which is supposed to be set up.</P>

      <P>There is one phrase in this section: &ldquo;The Government may, in their absolute discretion, at any time remit in whole or in part or modify (by way of mitigation only) or defer (conditionally or unconditionally) any punishment imposed by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.&rdquo; I take it that any person who is now in custody, under sentence imposed by the Military Tribunal, is actually undergoing sentence, and that that provision about deferment cannot refer to a person who is actually undergoing sentence at present.  We have to deal with remission or modification there. Is not that so?</P>

      <P>Let us leave out deferment. There are certain categories of powers which the Executive Council may exercise under that section.  They may remit in whole or in part, or modify by way of mitigation only.  I take it, therefore, that where a person is serving a term of imprisonment, the only function they can really exercise in that respect would be remission in whole or in part.  Then that is clearly not dealing with a case where you want to defer punishment.  Deferment is a different thing.  The only circumstance in which deferment might arise is in the case of any person who is brought before the tribunal between now and the 29th of this month.</P>

      <P>The section says: &ldquo;The Government may in their absolute discretion at any time remit in whole or in part or modify (by way of mitigation <Col N="2700" /> only) or defer, conditionally or unconditionally, any punishment imposed by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.&rdquo;  We are dealing with persons undergoing sentence by the tribunal.  They are in custody at  If it is desired to release any of these, I take it that the Government must exercise the power of remission. It is not a case of deferment, because you cannot defer a sentence already being served.  What must operate in that case is the power of remission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will read the section he will see clearly that the function to be exercised in these circumstances is the remission.  You say that you remit either in whole or in part.  You cannot remit the whole sentence; you can remit only the unserved portion of it.  Clearly, this provision to defer conditionally or unconditionally any punishment is entirely a different type of power.  There is, at present, under the Constitution (Amendment) Act, power to defer any punishment which may be imposed by the Tribunal.  Seeing that we have that power and can exercise it, up to the 29th of this month, when the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal disappears, what is the purpose of carrying this power into this Bill unless it is thought that that power can be exercised here after the 29th December? Why are we carrying over that power seeing that we can only exercise it up to the 29th December?  Surely we do not need it after the 29th December unless we were thinking of having a deferred sentence, and that we might revoke the deferment and reimpose the sentence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, some point has been made about the Minister saying that you defer.  From a layman's point of view in this matter, we might say you defer or you remit; as long as the remission is achieved it does not matter very much.  Technically, both can be used so that when <Col N="2701" /> the Minister speaks about deferring portion of a sentence remitted he strictly would not be inaccurate.  That may prevent misunderstanding.  The next question is: what is deferment? The power of deferring has often been exercised in this particular way.  We defer sentence for a certain period on the understanding that it will come up to be reviewed at a certain time.  In other words, you say that if you get satisfactory reports as to the conduct of the person whose sentence has been deferred, the sentence may be remitted completely.  If, however, the report is not completely satisfactory you may say: &ldquo;Very well; it is in the public interest that this particular person should have a further period of probation in which we shall see what his conduct will be like and we can get a further report upon him.&rdquo;  There you defer the matter for review at a certain period.  That is a power undoubtedly that under this section will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us say that the sentence was to be reviewed on the 1st January and that on the 1st January you found that the conduct, generally, of the person involved had been of such a character that, if this transition had not taken place, the Government would not have been prepared completely to remit the sentence.  In that case we might say: &ldquo;We have reviewed this and we consider it proper to put it back for a further review at the end of March.&rdquo; That power is given in the Bill and that is the sense in which deferment is used.  The power to defer is being used in that connection to give a period during which reports would be got as to the conduct of the individual concerned so that these reports could be considered when the matter would come up for review.  It is deferred for review.  If on that date it was found that his conduct had been satisfactory, and that it would be consistent with the general public interest that the sentence should be remitted completely, then it would be remitted.  If, on the other hand, it was considered that the public interest demanded that a further period should be given and that the <Col N="2702" /> matter should be reviewed again after the lapse of some months, then it would be deferred for that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any deferment in a case where a person actually served some portion of his punishment?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as I understood it was this: There are two powers that were very distinctly stated for those who want consideration of this section.  Deputy Norton has definitely stated one case.  There is a power of remission where a man had been sentenced and where he began to serve his sentence.  The rest of the sentence is remitted.  That is one power. He contrasted with that, very clearly, the power of deferring punishment. That has been explained by the President. Whilst Deputy Norton was discussing the matter, on two occasions the Minister for Education said: &ldquo;What about the prisoners who are now in prison?&rdquo;  In reference to the power of deferment that can only mean one thing.  I want to know does it mean this, and the President has not yet stated that it does.  Say a person was sentenced to 18 months and served six months.  The only interpretation that can be put on the Minister's interruption is this, and it can bear no other explanation, because Deputy Norton stated the alternatives clearly: &ldquo;He has served six months; we are now letting him out and deferring the other 12 months.&rdquo;  Is that possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have finished with sub-section (1), I desire to call the attention of the President to a matter arising out of sub-section (2).  This sub-section states that whenever a free pardon has been granted by the President to a person convicted by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, the forfeiture or disqualification occasioned by such conviction shall, as from the date of such pardon, be annulled.  I presume that one of the disqualifications there would be, for instance, the right to receive an Army pension.  Any doubts I had on that matter were removed when the scheme was going through this House quite recently.  It was stated that anybody who was convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction and received a sentence of six months would automatically lose his pension.  I asked the Minister for Defence would he include in that category convictions by the Military Tribunal, and he said &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; He said that the tribunal would be considered a court of competent jurisdiction. Now, under this Bill, when a man so sentenced is pardoned, it automatically follows that he gets back his pension.  He may be sentenced to death and his sentence is commuted. He serves ten years, the President pardons him, and then he gets his pension back.  Then take the case of a man caught with a gun, for instance, who gets 12 months' imprisonment.  He serves that 12 months, does his time, but he cannot get the pension back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardLMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He serves 12 months for a minor offence and he does not get his pension back, whereas a man who has, perhaps, committed murder does get his pension&mdash;in fact, must get it.  It is mandatory.  I suggest that is the interpretation of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is arguing something that is not here.  The fact that a free pardon will carry certain things does not mean that something contrary to this would be done in other cases.  It would be quite possible to deal with that case in an <Col N="2704" /> independent manner.  The clause set out here makes it quite clear that a free pardon, when it is given, means wiping out the offence as if it had not existed, and in so far as any disqualification or forfeiture is concerned, when the President gives a free pardon, as from the date on which it is given the disqualification and the forfeiture disappear.</P>
      <P>Now, to say that because you do that in that particular case you are implying that something else will happen in some other case, I do not think is accurate at all.  It does not flow from this.  If what the Deputy says is true, it may be a question of saying: &ldquo;That is a peculiar situation in law&rdquo;, but that does not arise as far as this section is concerned.  This section is of narrow import.  It simply gives legal and statutory assurance to this fact, that a free pardon when it is given is to mean that all those things are wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's use of what I may call the parable of the eleventh hour will hardly fit here, namely, because he is giving a big concession in one case no obligation is there to give it in smaller cases.  There is such a thing as even-handed justice which the Government is bound to mete out.  Deputy McGilligan's point is that if you are giving this big concession in this particular case you certainly ought to give it in minor cases.  There is a moral obligation on you to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not even-handed justice that a person guilty of a major offence will, because it is a major offence, probably get a pardon, whereas the person guilty of a minor offence who gets a minor sentence will probably serve it out and not get a pardon.  For that reason he is put in a disadvantageous position as compared with the other person, and that is not even-handed justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has gone to the moon away from all this.  I appreciate the point about even-handed justice, but that has no immediate relation to this, unless he wishes that we should insert something in this Bill in regard to the other case.  If that is the contention, I understand it. What is the position?  A free pardon &mdash;as I have understood it at any rate, whether I am right or wrong&mdash;has been as if the offence had not been committed; a complete wiping clean of the slate.  Where are free pardons given? A free pardon will not be given to everybody.  A free pardon is given when there are some special reasons for it, and that free pardon, in so far as the wiping out of those particular consequences is concerned, can be given, I understand, to a person who has served his sentence.</P>
      <P>This is important from the Deputy's point of view.  A free pardon may be given to a person who has served his sentence.  If it is considered by the Executive Council that a case for a free pardon arises, whether the sentence has been served or whether it has not, that free pardon can be given. When it is given, all this ensures is that that is a method by which you wipe out all the consequences.  In so far as they cannot make it retrospective&mdash;if a man has suffered certain punishment in the past, you cannot make it retrospective&mdash;that wipes it out.  I hope the Deputy understands.</P>

      <P>At the same time I <Col N="2706" /> consider it is doing it unjustly; that the justice is not even-handed.  Either this should be deleted altogether or the President should bring in something else to try to balance the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is what generally happens: A person has been convieted by the tribunal of an offence of a certain type.  He may have been punished, or perhaps before the punishment a petition comes to the Executive Council that for such and such reasons a free pardon should be granted.  The Executive Council may say: &ldquo;Very well.  We are prepared to consider that favourably if we get some assurance that the same sort of offence which resulted in this particular punishment being inflicted will not occur again.&rdquo;  In such a case the Executive Council has always tried to take as lenient a view as possible under the circumstances.  There is this petition.  It may be after the sentence has been served.  It is considered on its merits.  If the Executive Council is satisfied that they are exercising their functions for the interests of the community as a whole by giving a free pardon, then they can give it.  All that is here is that if it is given it will carry the consequence of complete wiping out, so that it is really even-handed if the Deputy regards it in that sense.</P>

The more it does cover away from a miscarriage of justice case, the more point there is in Deputy McGowan's objection.  He makes the objection that a man is brought before the tribunal, is considered to have committed some minor offence, and is sentenced to a year's imprisonment; he serves the year and his disqualification continues. He does something else which gets him a sentence for life.  After he has done five years, there is what the President now describes as a free pardon.

      <P>I want an assurance that it does.  &ldquo;Free pardon&rdquo; as used in ordinary law has no reference to a remission of sentence.  In fact, it is what it says; it is a pardon so as to put a man back into his civic rights because it is believed that the sentence never should have been imposed on him.  That is what it generally means. I am going back to Section I, notwithstanding what Deputy McGowan says. <Col N="2708" /> We are told this is continuing relieving powers, and we have had examination of what the relieving powers come to. One thing emerged.  A man is brought before the tribunal and given two years, not to be imposed if he is of good behaviour.  Deputy Norton gave the example, and the President accepted it, that you may call that man up next January and say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied that you are of good behaviour; we will have another look at you next March.&rdquo;  He comes up next March and you say to him: &ldquo;You will go to jail for two years now.&rdquo;  I do not call that a relieving power.</P>

      <P>I should like to take the Report Stage now.  It is rather urgent that this measure should become law. I think the points that have been raised by the Opposition have been examined fairly carefully.  There were only two important points and they were related to the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act.  We are satisfied that they are covered.  Our advisers have informed me that they have gone into that matter and they are quite satisfied that position is fully met. Therefore, there would be no advantage <Col N="2710" /> in postponing further discussion of the measure and I would ask the House to facilitate us by giving us the remaining Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amazing request.  During the course of this Bill, when the Minister was mainly in a fog, he said he would look into at least three matters.  He now tells us that the only point of importance was in connection with electoral abuses.  He says that his advisers are satisfied.  If he could convey that satisfaction to us and the reasons for it, we might allow him to get this measure through; but it is surely treating the House with contempt to come here and say, after a conversation across the gangway, that his advisers are satisfied that something has been met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not Deputy McGilligan know by this that when the Minister says he will consider a point, that is the last we will hear of it?  It has become merely a polite method of telling the House that Ministers do not care what the House thinks.  Frequently, when we raise important points here we are told: &ldquo;This matter will be considered and, by the next stage, we will have an opportunity of getting the matter explained or else an amendment will be introduced to meet the situation.&rdquo; When the next stage is reached there is no opportunity afforded of discussing the point because no amendment has been introduced by the Government and, therefore, it cannot be raised any further.  It has become a practice with the Government when they are up against any difficulty in this House to say: &ldquo;We will consider that point and by the next stage we will be able to clarify the position in regard to this particular matter.&rdquo;  That is merely the common practice.  It is the Government's method of deceiving the House. Indeed, it has become almost a sacrosanct procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it has become the practice simply because the Opposition have not gone to the trouble of putting down amendments to meet their own point of view.  As a rule, when there is a Second Stage there is <Col N="2711" /> ample time given between that and the next stage for putting down amendments. I am not applying that to recent measures, because I admit that in the case of this Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill we have been rushing things a bit because of the pressure of time.  But, ordinarily, when a Minister says: &ldquo;I will consider that and possibly put down an amendment,&rdquo; the moment the amendment sheet appears and Deputies opposite see their point is not covered, then it is up to them to go to the trouble of trying to put down an amendment to meet their point of view and get the sense of the House upon it.</P>
      <P>Very often it happens&mdash;it has happened in my own case quite often&mdash; that a point is made from the opposite benches and it appears at first sight to have some substance to it, but when related to other parts of the Bill it will become evident that the point has been met, or there is a reference in some other paragraph which covers the whole thing.  In those circumstances it is not necessary to put down an amendment.  When you have a long, complicated Bill it is very easy, when you are attending to one section, to lose sight of the effect or the force of another section.  You require to sit down carefully and consider the Bill. Certain things may be lost sight of when we are on our feet meeting a point raised for the first time.  If Deputies want a point properly debated, the way to do that is to put down an amendment so that Ministers will have an opportunity of considering it calmly and quietly and getting any advice, if there is a legal point raised, on the particular merits of it. Lawyers differ as doctors differ, and very often the construction of a particular paragraph or section of a Bill may give rise to a difference of view. You may have a difference of opinion, and even amongst your advisers you may have a difference of view, and, finally, the person in charge has to make up his mind what he is going to do in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attitude is that wherever there is a doubt I try to make assurance <Col N="2712" /> doubly sure, even if I were told that already the point was sufficiently sound.  When Deputies raise points and we say we will consider them, they are actually considered.  The judgment may be that the point has been met in some other section, or that the point is not sound.  Deputies ought not to take it that there is not proper attention paid to their points because Ministers do not come along with an amendment, for the reason that we are convinced and amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with my experience of the last couple of weeks.  It is absurd, for instance, in the particular case the President refers to, to expect that we could put down amendments.

Further, I explained to-day quite seriously that I thought it would be detrimental to a bad Bill if we made any suggestions.</P>

Why should we incorporate in our legislation a phrase appearing in other legislation and ignored?  The President says it was not the duty of the Government to enforce it.  Another Government thought it was, and another Government consulted the House regarding it.  It accepted the responsibility for taking the first step in the matter and the House agreed that its own legislation was being broken.  A new election was ordered.  Surely it is a disgraceful thing to have a House sit containing a man who was elected here in breach of its own laws.</P>

      <P>So that the Deputy will not be disappointed, I may tell him that I have gone into this matter, and the question of dates comes in.  If you are to make any provision other than for the Taoiseach filling up here, we are going to be completely out in time after the dissolution.  The time is very short.  After all, there is a warning to any particular body entitled to nominate that if it does not avail of it the Taoiseach will have to put in the necessary nominations.  It means that he has to put in two more than the number that could be elected.</P>

      <P>There is the question of summoning the Dáil.  It would take a long time to get over a whole series of things, and, at a certain stage, it was discovered that from the time the nominations have to be published and the work finished, it is only on the last stage that it can be discovered if all the nominations are in.  To summon the Dáil and to give time for postal voting leaves a very short period at our disposal.  In a matter like this we want to have a ready and simple means and I believe this will be an inducement generally to outside bodies to do their duty.  Otherwise they know that it is going to be done for them by the Government.</P>

      <P>It is only a warning to persons who are objectionable. I do not want to waste time, but so far as there is a difficulty, I realise that if the President makes up his mind he will not do it, and the <Col N="2727" /> House will not do it.  So far as there is a difficulty about time the Opposition is not to blame.  We did not fix limitations regarding the movement of time.  Certainly I think in the ordinary case there are three months between the dissolution of the Dáil and the time when the Seanad must be elected in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Conduct of Election.</P>
      <P>1.  On the day of issue of ballot papers at a Seanad election the Seanad returning officer shall issue, in the manner directed in the following Rules, a ballot paper to every elector named on the electoral roll for that election.</P>

    <P>4.  The Seanad returning officer shall issue a ballot paper to each elector by doing or causing to be done in respect of such elector the following things in the following order, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the number, name, address, and description of the elector as stated in the electoral roll shall be called out;</P>
    <P>(b)  the elector's said number shall be marked on the counterfoil of the ballot paper to be sent to him;</P>
    <P>(c)  a mark shall be placed on the electoral roll opposite the elector's name thereon to indicate that a ballot paper has been issued to such elector, but without disclosing the identity of such ballot paper;</P>
    <P>(d)  the ballot paper shall be marked on both sides with the official mark;</P>
    <P>(e)  the number on the back of the ballot paper shall be marked upon a form of declaration of identity and upon an envelope (hereinafter referred to as the ballot paper envelope) in the prescribed form;</P>
    <P>(f)  there shall be placed in an envelope (hereinafter referred to as the outer envelope) in the prescribed form addressed to the elector at his address stated in the electoral roll the following documents, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a ballot paper, and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2730" /> (g) the outer envelope shall be effectually closed;</P>
    <P>(h) when the foregoing provisions of this Rule have been complied with in respect of all the electors whose names are on the electoral roll, all the said closed outer envelopes shall be collected, counted, and posted.</P>
    <P>5.  Every request for the issue of a duplicate ballot paper shall, when received by the Seanad returning officer, be endorsed by him with the day and hour of the receipt thereof by him and with a consecutive number, and every duplicate ballot paper issued in pursuance of any such request shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing Rule so far as the same are applicable save that, in lieu of the number on the electoral roll, there shall be marked on the counterfoil of such ballot paper the consecutive number endorsed on the request in pursuance of which such ballot paper is issued and that when such ballot paper has been issued the said request shall be disposed of in like manner as the marked copy of the electoral roll is required by these Rules to be disposed of.</P>
    <P>6.  The Seanad returning officer shall post the said closed outer envelopes by delivering such envelopes to the nearest head post office, or such other office as may be arranged with the head postmaster, and the postmaster at such office shall stamp with the post office date stamp a form of receipt to be presented by the Seanad returning officer stating the number of envelopes so delivered, and shall immediately forward such envelopes by registered post for delivery to the persons to whom they are addressed.</P>
    <P>7.  The Seanad returning officer, as soon as practicable after the completion of the issue of the ballot papers and in the presence of such candidates and agents as are in attendance, shall make up in separate packets, sealed with his own seal and sealed by such of the said candidates or agents as desire to affix their seals, the marked copy of the electoral roll <Col N="2731" /> and the counterfoils of the ballot papers.</P>
    <P>8.  The Seanad returning officer shall provide a ballot box marked &ldquo;Seanad ballot box&rdquo; for the reception of the covering envelopes when returned by the voters, and on the completion of the issue of the ballot papers the Seanad returning officer shall show such ballot box open and empty to the candidates and agents (if any) present, and shall seal such ballot box with his seal and shall make provision for the safe custody of such ballot box.</P>
    <P>9.  The Seanad returning officer shall forthwith place unopened in the Seanad ballot box every covering envelope received by him before the close of the poll and shall seal up unopened in a separate package all covering envelopes received by him after the close of the poll and shall also seal up unopened in a separate package all outer envelopes returned to him as undelivered.</P>
    <P>10.  Not less than three days before the close of the poll the Seanad returning officer shall send by post to every candidate at his address as stated in the panels of candidates notice in writing of the time and place at which he will open the Seanad ballot box and count the votes.</P>
    <P>11.  As soon as conveniently may be after the close of the poll the Seanad returning officer shall open the Seanad ballot box and count the votes.</P>
    <P>12.  The Seanad returning officer and his assistants, any candidate and any agent appointed by a candidate, and no other person, except with the permission of the Seanad returning officer, may be present at the opening of the Seanad ballot box or the counting of the votes.</P>
    <P>13.  When the Seanad ballot box has been opened the Seanad returning officer shall do the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  take all the covering envelopes out of the Seanad ballot box and count and note the number thereof;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2732" /> (b)  open each such covering envelope and segregate any of those envelopes containing a declaration of identity issued as a duplicate form of declaration of identity;</P>
    <P>(c) take up separately each of the said covering envelopes not so segregated, examine the declaration of identity therein and compare the number on such declaration with the number on the ballot paper envelope in such covering envelope;</P>
    <P>(d) if the said numbers agree and the declaration of identity is found to be duly completed and made, he shall place the declaration of identity and the ballot paper envelope in separate receptacles;</P>
    <P>(e) if he is not satisfied that the declaration of identity has been duly completed and made he shall endorse the declaration of identity &ldquo;vote rejected,&rdquo; and shall attach thereto the ballot paper envelope, without opening such envelope, or if there is no such envelope, the ballot paper;</P>
    <P>(f)  if he finds that the numbers on the declaration of identity and on the ballot paper envelope do not agree, or if the envelope has no number on it, he shall open the envelope, and if the number on the ballot paper agrees with the number on the declaration of identity he shall place the ballot paper in the special receptacle provided by him for ballot papers;</P>
    <P>(g)  where the number on the ballot paper does not agree with the number on the declaration of identity, he shall replace the ballot paper in its envelope, if any attach such envelope or ballot paper (as the case may be) to the declaration of identity, and endorse the declaration of identity &ldquo;vote rejected&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(h)  where a declaration of identity does not appear to accompany the ballot paper envelope, he shall open the ballot paper envelope, and if it is found to contain the declaration of identity he shall deal with such declaration and ballot paper <Col N="2733" /> envelope in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Rule;</P>
    <P>(i)  he shall mark with the word &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; every declaration of identity which is not accompanied by a ballot paper, and every ballot paper which is not accompanied by a declaration of identity;</P>
    <P>(j)  when all the said covering envelopes not so segregated have been dealt with under the foregoing provisions of this Rule, he shall take up separately each of the said covering envelopes segregated as containing a declaration of identity issued as a duplicate form of declaration of identity, examine the declaration of identity therein (hereinafter referred to as the duplicate declaration) and ascertain whether a declaration of identity in respect of the same person has or has not been previously examined under this Rule:</P>
    <P>(k)  if a declaration of identity in respect of the same person has been previously examined under this Rule he shall mark the duplicate declaration &ldquo;vote rejected&rdquo; and shall attach thereto the ballot paper envelope, without opening such envelope, or, if there is no such envelope, the ballot paper;</P>
    <P>(l)  if a declaration of identity in respect of the same person has not been previously examined under this Rule he shall deal with the duplicate declaration and the ballot paper envelope and ballot paper accompanying the same in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Rule other than the two last preceding paragraphs thereof.</P>
    <P>14.  Where a ballot paper and a declaration of identity are received together and the numbers on such ballot paper and on such declaration agree, such ballot paper shall not be rejected solely on the ground that such ballot paper and such declaration were not placed in the proper envelopes or that any of such envelopes was not fastened.</P>
    <P>15.  The Seanad returning officer shall show any declaration of identity which he proposes to reject on <Col N="2734" /> the ground that it has not been properly completed and made to the candidates and agents (if any) present, and if an objection is made by any such candidate or agent to his decision shall add to the endorsement the words &ldquo;rejection objected to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>16.  The Seanad returning officer shall keep all rejected declarations, with the attached envelopes or ballot papers as the case may be, separate from other documents.</P>
    <P>17.  When all the covering envelopes in the Seanad ballot box have been opened and their contents dealt with under the preceding Rules, the Seanad returning officer shall open each unopened ballot paper envelope and compare the number on the envelope with the number on the ballot paper and if the number on the envelope and the number on the ballot paper agree, he shall place the ballot paper in the special receptacle provided by him for ballot papers, but if the number on the envelope and the number on the ballot paper do not agree, the Seanad returning officer shall fasten such ballot paper and such envelope together and mark them &ldquo;rejected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>18.  As soon as the Seanad returning officer has completed the placing of the ballot papers in the said special receptacle he shall seal up in separate packets (1) the declarations of identity which accompanied any ballot papers duly accepted; (2) any rejected declarations of identity; and (3) any rejected ballot papers; in the two latter cases with the envelopes (if any) attached thereto.</P>
    <P>19.  When the Seanad returning officer has complied with the foregoing Rules of this Schedule, he shall mix together thoroughly the ballot papers contained in the special receptacle provided by him for ballot papers and shall count, in accordance with the Rules contained in the Second Schedule to this Act, the votes recorded on such ballot papers.</P>
    <P>20.  The Seanad returning officer shall endorse &ldquo;rejected&rdquo; on any ballot paper which he rejects as invalid and if an objection be made by any candidate or agent to his <Col N="2735" /> decision rejecting the ballot paper, he shall add to the said endorsement &ldquo;rejection objected to &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>21.  The Seanad returning officer shall so far as practicable proceed continuously with the proceedings under this Schedule subsequent to the opening of the Seanad ballot box and with the counting of the votes but may at any time suspend such proceedings or counting for refreshment, night-time, or other reason appearing to him to be sufficient for such period as he thinks proper, and whenever he does so suspend such proceedings or such counting he shall take all proper precautions for the security of the ballot papers, envelopes, votes, and other documents relating to the election.</P>
    <P>22.  The Seanad returning officer and every of his assistants taking part in any of the proceedings under this Schedule or the counting of the votes and every candidate and agent attending any of the said proceedings or the said counting shall, before so taking part or so attending, sign an undertaking in the prescribed form to preserve the secrecy of the voting.</P>
    <P>23.  As soon as the counting of the votes is completed the Seanad returning officer shall prepare in duplicate in respect of each panel a certificate in the prescribed form setting out the names of the candidates elected from such panel, the total number of votes given for each candidate (whether elected or not), every transfer of values made under this Act, and the total value credited to each candidate at the end of the count at which each such transfer took place, and such other matters as shall be prescribed, and the Seanad returning officer shall then sign the said duplicate certificate and shall send one such duplicate to the Clerk of Dáil Eireann and (except in the case of the first Seanad election) the other such duplicate to the Clerk of Seanad Eireann.</P>
    <P>In the case of every certificate prepared under this Rule in relation to the first Seanad election, the <Col N="2736" /> Seanad returning officer shall, after he has sent one duplicate of such certificate to the Clerk of Dáil Eireann, retain the other duplicate thereof and shall send or deliver such other duplicate to the Clerk of Seanad Eireann as soon as may be after such Clerk has been appointed.</P>
    <P>24.  The Seanad returning officer shall also prepare and publish in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> a statement in the prescribed form of the names of the candidates elected from each panel.</P>
    <P>25. Upon the completion of the counting of the votes the Seanad returning officer shall seal up in separate packets the counted ballot papers and the ballot papers rejected as invalid.</P>
    <P>26.  The Seanad returning officer shall retain for six months from the close of the poll the several sealed packets of the marked copy of the electoral roll, the counterfoils of the ballot papers, the covering envelopes received after the close of the poll, the outer envelopes returned as undelivered, the accepted declarations of identity, the rejected declarations of identity, the rejected ballot papers, the counted ballot papers, and the invalid ballot papers, and shall at the end of the said period of six months destroy all the said sealed packets unless an election tribunal shall have otherwise ordered.</P>
    <P>27.  No person shall be allowed to inspect any of the said sealed packets retained by the Seanad returning officer nor any of the contents thereof save under and in accordance with an order of an election tribunal.</P>
    <P>28.  An election tribunal may authorise the inspection by any person of the contents of any of the said sealed packets as justice may require but on any such inspection care shall be taken that the mode in which any particular elector has voted shall not be discovered until he has been proved to the satisfaction of an elected tribunal to have voted and such tribunal has declared his vote to be invalid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2737" /> 29.  The Seanad returning officer shall comply with every order made by an election tribunal in relation to the inspection, production, and disposal of the said sealed packets.</P>
    <P>30.  Where an order is made by an election tribunal for the production by the Seanad returning officer of any document or packet of documents in his possession relating to a specified election, the production by the Seanad returning officer of such document or packet of documents in pursuance of such order shall be conclusive evidence that such document or packet of documents relates to the said specified election and the endorsement made by the Seanad returning officer in pursuance of this Schedule on any such document or packet of documents shall be conclusive evidence that such document or packet is what it is stated in such endorsement to be.</P>
    <P>31.  The production by the Seanad returning officer of a ballot paper purporting to have been used at any election and of a counterfoil marked with the same printed number and having a number marked thereon in writing shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the person who voted by such ballot paper was the person whose number on the electoral roll relating to such election was the same as the number so marked on such counterfoil.</P>
    <P>32.  Whenever the Seanad returning officer is required by this Schedule to seal up any documents in a separate packet he shall endorse on such packet a statement of the number and character of such documents and the election to which they relate.</P>
    <P>33.  In this Schedule the expression &ldquo;electoral tribunal&rdquo; means a court lawfully having cognisance of petitions complaining of undue return or undue election at a Seanad election.</P>
    <P>68.  In pages 29 to 34, to delete the Second Schedule and substitute the following Schedule:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECOND SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P Just="Center">The Counting of the Votes.</P>
    <P>1.  The Seanad returning officer <Col N="2738" /> shall reject any ballot papers that are invalid.</P>
    <P>2.  The Seanad returning officer shall then ascertain the number of first preferences recorded on the ballot papers for each candidate, and shall then arrange the candidates on a list (hereinafter called &ldquo;the order of preferences&rdquo;) in the order of the number of first preferences recorded for each candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of first preferences is recorded.  If the number of first preferences recorded for any two or more candidates (hereinafter called &ldquo;equal - candidates&rdquo;) is equal, the Seanad returning officer shall ascertain the number of second preferences recorded on all the ballot papers for each of the equal candidates, and shall arrange the equal candidates as amongst themselves on the order of preferences in the order of the second preferences recorded for each such candidate, beginning with the candidate for whom the greatest number of second preferences is recorded.  If the number of first and second preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal, the Seanad returning officer shall, in like manner, ascertain the number of third preferences recorded on all the ballot papers for each of such last-mentioned equal candidates, and arrange such candidates on the order of preferences accordingly, and so on until all the candidates are arranged in order on the order of preferences.  If the number of first, second, third, and all other preferences recorded for any two or more equal candidates is equal the Seanad returning officer shall determine by lot the order in which such candidates are to be arranged on the order of preferences.</P>
    <P>3.  The Seanad returning officer shall then arrange the valid ballot papers in parcels, according to the first preferences recorded for each candidate.</P>
    <P>4.  For the purpose of facilitating the processes prescribed by these Rules, each valid ballot paper shall be deemed to be of the value of one thousand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2739" /> 5.  The Seanad returning officer shall then count the number of ballot papers in each parcel, and, in accordance with the preceding rule, credit each candidate with the value of the valid ballot papers on which a first preference has been recorded for such candidate.</P>
    <P>6.  The Seanad returning officer shall then add together the values in all the parcels, and divide the full total value by a number exceeding by one the number of vacancies to be filled.  The result increased by one, any fractional remainder being disregarded, shall be the value sufficient to secure the return of a candidate. This value is in this Schedule called the &ldquo;quota.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>7.  If at the end of any count or at the end of the transfer of any parcel or sub-parcel of an excluded candidate or a candidate deemed not to be a continuing candidate, the value credited to a candidate is equal to or greater than the quota, that candidate shall, subject to the provisions of the subsequent Rules, be deemed to be elected.</P>
    <P>8.  (1) If at the end of a count the value credited to one or more candidates is equal to or greater than the quota and such candidates (if more than one) are on the same sub-panel and the number of vacancies then remaining to be filled from that sub-panel is equal to the number of candidates so credited, all such candidates shall be deemed to be elected, and the papers of the remaining candidates (if any) on the said sub-panel shall, before any other candidate is excluded or the surplus of any other candidate is transferred, be transferred in accordance with the provisions of these Rules relating to the exclusion of candidates, save that the papers of the candidate credited with the greatest value shall be transferred first and so on, and thereupon such remaining candidates shall for the purpose of these Rules be deemed not to be continuing candidates.</P>
    <P>(2)  If at the end of a count the number of candidates on a sub-panel credited with a value greater than <Col N="2740" /> or equal to the quota is greater than the number of vacancies then remaining to be filled from such sub-panel, only such number of those candidates as is equal to the said number of vacancies shall be deemed to be elected.  The candidates who are so to be deemed to be elected shall be the candidates who have the largest surpluses.  If two or more of such candidates have each an equal surplus the candidate credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to those candidates were unequal, or (where the values so credited were equal at all counts) the candidate who is highest in the order of preferences shall be deemed to be elected.  The remaining candidates on the said sub-panel shall be deemed not to be continuing candidates and their papers shall, before any other candidate is excluded or the surplus of any other candidate is transferred, be transferred (whether the values credited to them respectively are greater, equal to, or less than the quota) in the same manner as the papers of an excluded candidate are required to be transferred under these Rules save that the papers of the candidate credited with the greatest value shall be transferred first and so on.</P>
    <P>(3)  A candidate credited with a value equal to the quota shall be deemed for the purpose of this Rule to have a surplus.</P>
    <P>(4)  If at the conclusion of any count two or more candidates are by these Rules required to be deemed not to be continuing candidates, and such candidates are not all on the same sub-panel, the papers of the candidate then credited with the greatest value shall be transferred first.  If two or more of such candidates are credited with the same value the papers of the candidate credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to them were unequal, or (where the values so credited were equal at all counts) the candidate who is highest in the order of preferences shall be first transferred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2741" /> 9.  If at the end of any count the value credited to a candidate (in this Rule referred to as the elected candidate) is greater than the quota, the surplus shall be transferred to the continuing candidate or candidates indicated on the voting papers in the parcel or sub-parcel of the elected candidate according to the next available preferences recorded thereon, and the following provisions shall apply to the making of such transfer, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the value credited to the elected candidate arises out of original votes only, the Seanad returning officer shall examine all the ballot papers in the parcel of the elected candidate and shall arrange the transferable papers therein in sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the nontransferable papers;</P>
    <P>(b)  if the value credited to the elected candidate arises partly out of original and partly out of transferred votes or out of transferred votes only, the Seanad returning officer shall examine the ballot papers contained in the sub-parcel last received by the elected candidate and shall arrange the transferable papers therein in further sub-parcels according to the next available preferences recorded thereon and shall make a separate sub-parcel of the nontransferable papers;</P>
    <P>(c)  in either of the cases referred to in the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b) the Seanad returning officer shall ascertain the number of ballot papers and their total value in each sub-parcel of transferable papers and in the sub-parcel of non-transferable papers;</P>
    <P>(d)  if the total value of the papers in all the sub-parcels of transferable papers is equal to or less than the said surplus, the Seanad returning officer shall transfer each sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, <Col N="2742" /> each paper being transferred at the value at which it was received by the elected candidate, and (where the said total value is less than the said surplus) the nontransferable papers shall be set aside as not effective, at a value which is equal to the difference between the said surplus and the said total value;</P>
    <P>(e)  if the total value of the papers in all the sub-parcels of transferable papers is greater than the said surplus the Seanad returning officer shall transfer each paper in such sub-parcel of transferable papers to the continuing candidate indicated thereon as the voter's next available preference, and the value at which each paper shall be transferred shall be ascertained by dividing the surplus by the total number of transferable papers, fractional remainders being disregarded except that the consequential loss of value shall be noted on the result sheet;</P>
    <P>(f)  a surplus which arises on the completion of any count shall be dealt with before a surplus which arises at a subsequent count;</P>
    <P>(g)  when two or more surpluses arise out of the same count the largest shall be first dealt with and the others shall be dealt with in the order of their magnitude;</P>
    <P>(h)  if two or more candidates have an equal surplus arising out of the same count, the surplus of the candidate credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to those candidates were unequal shall be first dealt with, and where the values credited to such candidates were equal at all counts, the Seanad returning officer shall deal first with the surplus of the candidate who is highest in the order of preferences.</P>
    <P>10.  If at the end of any count no candidate has a surplus and one or more vacancies remain unfilled, the Seanad returning officer shall exclude the candidate (in this Rule referred to as the excluded candidate) then credited with the lowest value and shall transfer his papers to the continuing <Col N="2743" /> candidates respectively indicated on the ballot papers in the parcel or sub-parcels of the excluded candidate as the voter's next available preference, and shall credit such continuing candidates with the value of the papers so transferred, and the following rules shall apply to the making of such transfer, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the parcel containing original votes shall first be transferred, the transfer value of each paper being one thousand;</P>
    <P>(b)  the sub-parcels containing transferred votes shall then be transferred in the order in which and at the value of which the excluded candidate obtained them;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the purpose of determining whether a candidate is a continuing candidate the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel shall be regarded as a separate count;</P>
    <P>(d)  in the transfer of each parcel or sub-parcel a separate sub-parcel shall be made of the non-transferable papers which shall be set aside at the value at which the excluded candidate obtained them;</P>
    <P>(e)  if, when a candidate has to be excluded under this Rule, two or more candidates are each then credited with the same value and are lowest regard shall be had to the total value of original votes credited to each of those candidates and the candidate with the smallest such total value shall be excluded, and where such total values are equal regard shall be had to the total value of votes credited to each of those candidates at the earliest count at which they had unequal values, and the candidate with the smallest such total value at that count shall be excluded, and if those candidates were each credited with the same total value of votes at all counts that one of those candidates who is lowest in the order of preferences shall be excluded;</P>
    <P>(f)  if the number of continuing candidates on a sub-panel is equal to the number of vacancies remaining to be filled from such sub-panel, <Col N="2744" /> this Rule shall cease to apply in respect of such continuing candidates.</P>
    <P>11.  On every transfer made under these Rules, each sub-parcel of papers transferred shall be placed on top of the parcel or sub-parcel (if any) of papers of the candidate to whom the transfer is made and that candidate shall be credited with the value ascertained in accordance with these Rules of the papers so transferred to him.</P>
    <P>12.  If, when there is no surplus to be transferred and, by reason of the number of candidates a l r e a d y excluded, the number of vacancies remaining to be filled from each sub-panel is equal to the number of continuing candidates on such sub-panels respectively, all such continuing candidates shall thereupon be deemed to be elected.</P>
    <P>13.  At the end of every count the Seanad returning officer shall record on a result sheet in the prescribed from the total of the values credited to each candidate at the end of that count and also the value of the nontransferable papers not effective on that count and the loss of value on that count owing to disregard of fractions.</P>
    <P>14.  While the votes are being counted the ballot papers shall so far as it is practicable be kept face upwards and all proper precautions shall be taken by the Seanad returning officer for preventing the numbers on the backs of the ballot papers being seen.</P>
    <P>15.  In these Rules&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the expression &ldquo;continuing candidate&rdquo; means any candidate not deemed to be elected and not excluded;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2745" /> (3)  the expression &ldquo;next available preference&rdquo; means a second or subsequent preference recorded in consecutive numerical order for a continuing candidate, the preference next in order on the ballot paper for candidates already deemed to be elected or excluded being ignored.</P>
    <P>(4)  the expression &ldquo;transferable paper&rdquo; means a ballot paper on which following a first preference a second or subsequent preference is recorded in numerical order for a continuing candidate;</P>

    <P>(11)  the expression &ldquo;determine by lot&rdquo; means determine in accordance with the following directions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the names of the candidates concerned having been written on similar slips of paper, and the slips having been folded so as to prevent identification and mixed and drawn at random, the candidates concerned shall as amongst themselves be arranged on the order of preferences in the order in which the slips containing their names are drawn, beginning with the candidate whose name is on the slip drawn first.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 67 is purely machinery.  The Second Schedule sets out how proportional representation can be applied to this particular form of election.  As Deputies are aware, we must elect a certain number of those nominated from inside, and a certain number nominated outside and, in addition, we must elect a certain number on each sub-panel.  There are ten sub-panels. Various things may crop up.  One thing that might happen is dealt with earlier in the Schedules.  Suppose there were five to be elected to a sub-panel you might have a surplus of seven or eight on the first count, and we have to deal with that situation.</P>

Of those nominated from outside to the agricultural panel, there are, say, nine nominated to the sub-panel and they all get over the quota.

      <P>If at the end of a count the number of candidates on a sub-panel credited with a value greater than or equal to the quota is greater than the number of vacancies then remaining to be filled from such sub-panel, only such number of those candidates as is equal to the said number of vacancies shall be deemed to be elected.  The candidates who are so to be deemed to be elected shall be the candidates who have the largest surpluses.  If two or more of such candidates have each an equal surplus the candidate credited with the greatest value at the earliest count at which the values credited to those candidates were unequal, or (where the values so credited were equal at all counts) the candidate who is highest in the order of preferences shall be deemed to be elected.</P>
      <P>The point that I want to make is this, that where this system will differ from proportional representation, as we know it, is that the non-continuing candidates will be the first to be eliminated, and that it is the highest rather than the lowest candidates who will get out first.</P>

On some panels you will have people getting elected with less than the quota.  Surely that is doing violence to the principle of proportional representation. That is done to give a certain weighting, if I may use the word, to minorities.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act and without prejudice to the powers of refusing applications for registration of premises conferred on him by the Principal Act, the Minister may in his absolute discretion refuse an application for registration of any premises.</P>
    <Col N="2753" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 2, sub-section (1), line 22, to delete the word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, line 23, to add the words&mdash;&ldquo;subject to the right of the applicant for a licence to apply to the Circuit Court for the issue of licence notwithstanding such refusal on the grounds that all the statutory requirements for the issue of a licence have been fulfilled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to Section 2 here.  Section 2 says:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act and without prejudice to the powers of refusing applications for registration of premises conferred on him by the Principal Act, the Minister may in his absolute discretion refuse an application for registration of any premises.</P>
      <P>I have moved an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; and to add the words</P>
      <P>&ldquo;subject to the right of the applicant for a licence to apply to the Circuit Court for the issue of licence notwithstanding such refusal on the ground that all the statutory requirements for the issue of a licence have been fulfilled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us later on what set of circumstances, since the original Act came into operation six or seven years ago, arose to make it necessary for the Minister to seek the extra powers he wants in Section 2. That is the first thing that strikes me. In the original Act we had two pages of restrictions, or, at least, of regulations on which an applicant for registration had to satisfy the Minister before he got a licence.  I do not want to weary the House by enumerating what they are, but they are sufficiently strict and cover almost all possible circumstances in connection with premises and the conduct of a person's business, so that almost one could envisage that when the original Bill left the House it was as watertight as a Bill could be made and that nobody could get on the registration list unless he was absolutely above-board and his <Col N="2754" /> premises everything that could be desired.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes along now with this particular section&mdash;Section 2&mdash; which goes on to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) Where the Minister in exercise of the power conferred on him by this section, refuses an application for registration, sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 8 of the Principal Act shall not apply.</P>
    <P>Now, sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 8 of the Principal Act were the only two sub-sections that gave an applicant for registration any right at all.  They provided the only possible safeguard he had.  Sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Principal Act says:</P>
    <P>Whenever an application is made under this section for the registration of any premises, the Minister shall cause such premises to be inspected by an inspector.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of the same section goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Before refusing an application for the registration of any premises under this Part of this Act, the Minister shall send by post to the applicant at his address as stated in the application one fortnight's notice of the Minister's intention to refuse such application and of the reason of such refusal, and shall consider any representations made by the applicant before the expiration of such notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister now asks the House not only to give him absolute discretion in the refusal of any licences, without any excuse, but to prevent the operation of those two particular sub-sections to which I have drawn his attention. If this section here is passed in its present terms, it is practically giving, if the Minister wishes, a vested interest to those who already hold licences because the Minister can refuse to give anybody else a licence and need not give any grounds for his refusal, or any case stated.  That is as I see it.  I think the House should not agree to pass this particular section without at least some statement as to the causes that led up to his seeking these powers.  Did anything occur during <Col N="2755" /> the operation of the Act in the last few years which made the registration of premises so difficult that the Minister had to seek these extra powers?</P>
    <P>In connection with very many of the Bills that went through this House at various times I have always objected to the principle of giving absolute discretion to anybody, outside of regulations, and I have to offer the same objections in connection with this particular section.  It does not seem to me that any elaborate explanation&mdash;at least on the introduction of the Bill&mdash; was given as to why we should depart from the provisions of the section in the original Act, which gave the Minister what would appear to any ordinary Deputy to be sufficient powers in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be quite true that Deputy Bennett has always objected to this power of discretion being given to the Minister in Acts of this kind, but in all those Produce Acts that have been passed, both by the last Government and this Government, the same discretion rests with the Minister, I think, in every case.  Under the Dairy Produce Act, for instance, passed as far back as 1924, the Minister had discretion to refuse a licence to any person or society to carry on the business of a creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the original Act introduced by my predecessor the position was somewhat different.  At that time the business of exporting fresh pork, which was the principal business to be dealt with then, was being carried on by a great number of people all over the country and some of them were acting in a very improper way so far as cleanliness and proper trading were concerned. The Act was brought in to deal with them and to see that only the very best pork should be permitted to leave the country so that our pork exported would get a good name.  As I say, there were quite a number of people all over the country engaged in the business at that time, and the Act provided for rather stiff fees being paid, both fees on registration and minimum fees half-yearly.  In that way it was hoped actually to put a great number of the people who were not <Col N="2756" /> desirable people out of the business entirely, and indeed the Act had that effect.</P>
    <P>As I say, there was a different position then.  Therefore, the Minister at that time did not ask for complete discretion for the granting of new licences. But, I think, in every other Produce Act of that kind which was passed that discretion has been claimed by the Minister.  In an Act passed dealing with the export of potatoes that discreation was also given to the Minister. That Bill was passed, I think, in 1931, and discretion was given to refuse to grant a licence to a new exporter.  In other Acts passed within the last four or five years the same discretion has been given; in the case of the Cereals Act, for instance, for the granting of a licence for a maize mill; in the case of the Bacon Act, which was passed not so long ago, in connection with a licence for a new bacon factory.  By putting in this we are only bringing the Bill into line with all Bills of that type by giving the Minister an absolute discretion.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy on the opposite benches can accuse either my predecessor or myself of having exercised that discretion under any of these Acts in an unjust way, because we know what is wanted so far as these trades are concerned.  We have inspectors and officials who are out to see that the trade in fresh meat, in potatoes, bacon, and so on, is carried on under the best possible circumstances. I think Deputies will admit that an inspector of my Department is in a very much better position to decide whether it would be advisable to grant a licence than a Circuit Court judge. I do not see what a Circuit Court judge would know about it at all.  He is not a suitable person for this particular job.  He would have to decide, I suppose, somehow or other on the law.  We would have to give him some rules of law to go by.  If the amendment were inserted all the Circuit Court judge would be asked to decide would be whether a particular applicant had complied with the law or not. It is possible that an applicant might comply with the law who would not be at all a desirable applicant from the point of view of building up a proper trade in fresh meat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2757" /> On the Second Reading I said that we were anxious to get a good name for our mutton and pork in particular. We do not want any such thing as trade rivalry entering into it&mdash;one man setting up, out of jealousy or trade rivalry or anything else, against another and trying to cut one another out of the trade instead of carrying on the business in the best possible way.  Generally speaking, I think that this discretion should be given to the Minister as it has been given in all the other Acts.  As I say, I do not think any Deputy will be able to point to any instance where the power has been abused under any of these Acts either by my predecessor or myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says about the discretionary clause in most of the Acts is, I believe, right, but that does not affect the force of my argument that the Bill would not suffer very much by the absence of this power.  The Minister said that it was left out of the original Act and that he is only trying to bring this into conformity with the rest of the legislation.  He has not said that the absence of this discretionary power has caused any considerable inconvenience to the Minister or anybody else.  Everything seems to have gone on very well and we have not had any reasons advanced why it is necessary to give these absolute powers. Apparently, it is thought necessary not only to give these absolute powers but to take away some of the privileges given to an applicant for registration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that inspectors were the best people to judge these matters.  They might possibly be better judges of many things than a Circuit Court judge as he can only go by the regulations and the law; but that would be some safeguard anyhow.  The Minister spoke of inspectors being better judges than most people.  But he has taken away the power of inspection.  Section 8 (2) of the original Act says: &ldquo;Whenever <Col N="2758" /> an application is made under this section for the registration of any premises, the Minister shall cause such premises to be inspected by an inspector.&rdquo; He is now taking that away, because Section 2 (2) of this Bill says: &ldquo;Where the Minister, in exercise of the power conferred on him by this section, refuses an application for registration, sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 8 of the Principal Act shall not apply in respect of such application,&rdquo; so that the premises need not be inspected even by an inspector. The Minister can refuse an applicant a licence without even having the premises inspected.  He is also taking away the privileges given under the original Act to an applicant for registration. Under that Act the Minister was required to give the applicant a fortnight's notice of his intention to refuse the application and to state the reasons, etc.</P>
      <P>I have never said that the present Minister or his predecessor used their discretionary powers in any way that they should not have used them, and I do not suggest it now.  I do say that the Minister should not ask for absolute power and in addition take away the privileges that an applicant for registration got under the original Act which the Minister has made no case for eliminating now.  The House should not be asked to pass this particular section.  As I said, it will leave it open to any Minister to refuse a licence without any grounds being stated.  In other words, if any future Minister wishes he can give a vested interest to people who already held a licence so that there can be no opposition to them.  I do not say that that will happen but it could happen under this section.  There is not even the right of inspection to operate against it.  The Minister has taken away the privileges the applicant had that the premises should be inspected and that he should be given a fortnight's notice of the refusal of his licence.</P>
