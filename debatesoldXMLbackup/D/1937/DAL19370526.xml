    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Article 12.&mdash;In Section 3, sub-section (1), line 4, before the words &ldquo;be eligible&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;not.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion last evening was, I think, on the question as to whether it should be possible for a President to be eligible for a second <Col N="1085" /> period of office.  I think we would all agree as to the purpose to be aimed at. So far as we can secure it, we ought to try to provide that whoever will occupy that office would be in a position of independence in the sense that he would not be likely to neglect his duty for the purpose of winning favour with any political Party.  A difference of opinion arose, apparently, on the point as to whether that can be better secured by leaving him eligible for re-election or not.  I think that even on the opposite benches some of the speakers argued on one side and some on the other, each trying to secure the same purpose.  I, naturally, in putting down this Draft had to make up my mind on the matter and, in my view, the balance of the argument for independence lay on the side of leaving it possible for him to be re-elected. Remember, that to be re-elected the President has to get the support of the people.  He is answerable to them. They will judge his actions during his first period of office by his conduct in that office and, consequently, if a man has proved satisfactory, I see no reason why he should not be allowed to go forward again for re-election.  Those who will oppose his re-election, if they have any reason for it, will put forward as a ground: &ldquo;Well, he has not acted in such wise,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He is no longer suitable for the office,&rdquo; or some other reason of that kind.  Therefore, it seems to me that the balance is in favour of making it possible for him to go forward for re-election, remembering all the time that it is the people will have to decide the question. They will be the judge of all his actions.  It has been said that he can only go forward if he is supported by a Party.  That is true, but the Party will not support a man who is going to be unpopular with the electorate. If a Party does try to support a man who has not acted in the way which his duty would demand, the people have a very good way of answering any such candidature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the proposal of allowing him to go forward for more than two periods of office, two periods of office cover a considerable time, no doubt, and there has been some sort <Col N="1086" /> of suggestion that he should be eligible for a second period but not for a third period without a break. Again, my previous argument would apply to that case.  If a man is held by the people to be suitable for the office, there does not seem to be any good reason for what I might call artificially excluding him.  The only argument that I can think of is that sometimes after a prolonged period of office, a man is not active.  He does not bring as fresh a mind to his work as a new man going into the office. There might possibly be a suggestion that if a man had held office for two periods&mdash;a comparatively long period in a person's life, 14 years&mdash;he might have got stale but we must remember that his functions are those of a judge rather than those of an executive. Notwithstanding all that has been said about it, the fact is that under this Constitution he has no executive powers in the sense of willing and deciding on doing things himself. Certain documents are sent to him to sign in regard to petitions which may come to him from the Seanad.  He has to examine these petitions and make up his mind as to whether it is a matter that should go, let us say, to the people, or a matter that should go to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, it seems to me that the argument that you want a fresh mind does not necessarily arise.  It may arise in the case of the proposed re-election of a particular individual and the people may say: &ldquo;Very well, this man is getting a bit old, it is better to get a fresh man.&rdquo;  My own view is that the less we put in the Constitution in the way of restrictions of that kind, the better. The people will have to be the judges themselves and if they do not think that a person is suitable to be elected as President, it may be assumed that they will not vote for him.  However, if there is any strong view held that, after two periods of office at least, there should be a break I am quite willing to concede that but my own instinct is against it.  I think you should put no artificial barriers at all there.  Let these things be decided by the people in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> Of course, the possibility of a person being elected for two terms or three terms is almost altogether out of the question.  I was given the records of Presidents of the French Republic where the period of office is a term of seven years.  I cannot at the moment give you the details but they are not germane except for the fact that only one of them over the whole period has continued for a second term of office and then he held office only for a period of two years in the second period when he resigned. Most of them refused to go forward for a second period, the reason apparently being that the office of President, whether of the French Republic or of any other country, is not a bed of roses.  The tendency will be that a man who has spent seven years in office will not go forward again unless there is some very good reason for his doing so, not merely a personal reason.  There might be a good national reason for doing so. That is my attitude towards the amendment.  I would resist an amendment excluding a person automatically from a second period of office but if the House feels that there should be a break after two periods, so as to make it quite clear that this is not intended as a life office for any person, I am quite willing to agree to that. If, however, my wishes were to count, I would say that we should put no restriction of any kind like that in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The President stated that arguments had been put forward on this side of the House for and against the question of whether a person should be eligible for one period or two periods of office. I heard no argument put forward against the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;except by Deputy MacDermot, and I do not think that Deputy MacDermot put forward his argument very seriously. The only argument which Deputy MacDermot attempted to put forward was that a man might be looking for <Col N="1088" /> a pension.  That was the only argument I heard put forward and, as I say, I do not think the Deputy put that forward seriously, because I presume the question of whether the office of President is going to be pensionable&mdash;and I sincerely hope it will not &mdash;will be settled by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney wants me to correct him or not; I do not want to interrupt him if he would rather not be interrupted.  What I suggested was, in fact, what the President said, that it seemed to me that if a man knew he could have only one period of office, that he was not going to have a pension afterwards, and perhaps had no means of livelihood to look forward to, he might be forced into the position of courting a particular political Party more than he would do if he knew he could be elected to office again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, I am in possession.  It is perfectly obvious that any person who stands for the position of President must have a Party machinery behind him.  He could not succeed if he had not, no matter what the excellency of the man might be.  He could not canvass; he could not arrange for transport; he could not arrange for personation agents, all of which will be necessary in the election of a President made by popular vote.  He must have a Party machine behind him.  How is he going <Col N="1089" /> to secure that Party machine unless he makes himself very pleasant to the Party which is the strongest Party, to the Party which is then in power, the Party which at the moment is the popular one in the country?  It is probable that the Party in power, if they are a new Parliament at any rate, will be the popular Party, and he will have to make himself popular with that Party.</P>
      <P>That is a very strong reason for putting him out.  What is the reason for keeping him on?  The suggestion seems to be that there will probably be one man, and one man only, in the country who is fit to hold the post. That is what lies behind the whole of the President's argument.</P>
      <P>There will be in the country one man, and one man only, fit to hold the post.  The holder of this post, as the Constitution stands at the present moment, will be a man to whom the most extraordinary powers can be given, a man to whom the most extraordinary powers can be transferred, according to the Constitution as it stands at the moment.  That office is one which can be made a life office. The President would like to see the possibility of a life office for an individual. I submit to the House that that is completely wrong, that if a person has filled this post for five years, he will have had a very good innings.  If he holds it for seven years he will have got a very long innings. My view is that he should not hold it for fourteen years.  My view, and the view which I press on the House as strongly as I can, is that that is an office which ought not to tend to become a permanent office for one individual. It ought to change from time to time, and I have not seen or heard of any argument from the President or from anybody else to show that a second man cannot be got as good as the first man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact the President, it seems to me, cuts the ground from under his own feet when he tries to minimise the powers which this new President is to get.  If the powers are so limited as the President spent a considerable amount of time yesterday in endeavouring to make out they <Col N="1090" /> were, then it becomes more and more apparent that there must be more than one man in the State capable of filling the office.  If there is more than one man capable of filling the office, then surely there is no necessity for keeping on the one man.  As far as having a man perfectly fair and perfectly impartial is concerned&mdash;or as nearly fair and as nearly impartial as human nature allows any individual to be&mdash;you certainly attain that end far and away more by giving a man one term of office and then terminating it.  He has got his one term of office.  Upon that he will be judged, and judged for all time.  He has got nothing to think of except the reputation which he will earn for himself in his one term of office.  He has got no axe to grind.  He has got no electorate to look after.  He has got no Executive Council to be nice and polite and, if necessary, subservient to, in order that he may get in again.  I press upon the President to accept this amendment by Deputy Costello, that nobody shall be eligible for election a second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I should like it to be the normal thing for a President to have two terms of office and no more.  That is why I was anxious to reduce the term of office to five years, so that two terms should not cover too long a period.  My reason for wishing it to be the normal thing that the President should have two terms of office is because, I think, it is a safeguard against his yielding to the temptation of playing up to a particular Party.  The fact that he may be standing again with a different Party in power is surely a motive to him to abstain from partisan conduct, if he were tempted to such conduct? Let me take the analogy not of the Ceann Comhairle in the Dáil, because perhaps that would be a disrespectful analogy to take, but let us say of the Chairman of the Seanad.  He is appointed as a result, shall we say, of the support of a political Party.  It is expected that, during his term of office, he will exercise his functions impartially and without subservience to any Party.  Would that expectation be more likely or less likely to be <Col N="1091" /> realised if he knew that he could never hold office after the first period; if he knew that for his future he had to look to the gratitude of his own Party and not to the trust of all Parties?  In this case, the President will not only have a motive for trying to secure the trust of all Parties in the Legislature, but he will have a motive for trying to secure the good opinion and the trust of the people.  The thing that has impressed me in the argument put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and some of his colleagues has been the extraordinary distrust of the native good sense and sense of fairplay of the Irish people as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney speaks about somebody having got a good innings.  I suggest that that is not the point of view to take on this matter, as if it were a question of giving an opportunity to individuals to have an innings.  That is not the point, I take it.  I take it what we want to have is a functionary, an officer of the State, of the type who will perform his duties properly and do the best for the State, and the people are to be the judges. This idea of giving people innings, I think, is altogether wrong.  I need not speak of the Deputy's complete perversion, it seemed to me, of the argument put forward by Deputy MacDermot; Deputy MacDermot dealt with that himself.  As regards this question of the powers of the President, the powers which the Constitution gives are not the powers that the Opposition tried to represent the President would have, and that it makes it immaterial who is there.  I think that is a swing round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about it.  In my opinion the people would have an opportunity of putting in any man they pleased at the end of seven years.  They will have an opportunity of voting on whatever man is put up.  I dare say there will be a number at each election.  It is <Col N="1092" /> true the President has not got the powers that the Opposition by their speeches last night suggested that he could have.  It is an important position, a position of dignity.  It is a position which, if properly filled, will do a good deal for the importance of the State.  While it is a position of dignity and responsibility there is a difference between a position of dignity and responsibility and one of power.  I hold that the President has very little power.  He can be a great influence in the State generally, by his conduct in the office, and for that reason it is important, if you get a man who has shown during his period of office that he has filled the position properly, to his own credit and to the credit of the country, that he should not be debarred by an artificial enactment there from having a second period of office.  That brings me to the argument of Deputy MacDermot. He said that normally he would agree to the President having a second period as at the end of his period there was bound to be an election. You cannot arrange that.  My own belief is that it will work out clearly as we have it here.  I shall read what has happened in the case of French Presidents.  Normally when a man has spent seven years in that particular office he will be likely to retire rather than to continue for another period.</P>

      <P>It is wrong to try to draw an analogy between the two positions. A much better analogy would be that of the French Republic.  I do <Col N="1093" /> not think it is on parallel lines, but it would be nearer to the position here.  My view is that we cannot count on his having a second period of office.  Therefore, I believe the normal period ought to be such as to avoid frequent elections and to run across the normal life of one Government which we may take roughly at four years, on the average.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that, and I will give reasons.  With regard to the length of the President's term, there has to be an election at the end of seven years.  He may or may not continue in office, or he may go up for election again.  If he does go up, and if he has not satisfied the people, he will not be elected.  What is the sense of interposing a barrier which, to my mind, is unnecessary? On the whole, I think the right thing is to leave it open to the people to decide.  If there are good reasons for the re-election of a man for the two terms, they will re-elect him.  As a very considerable period will have to elapse, it might be advisable to indicate that no longer than two terms could be served by anyone.  That is not my own view, but I have no objection. It might be well to indicate that no person should go up for a third term without a break.  I have no strong views on the matter.  It seems to me, if we do that, and if we take as an example what happened in France, very few people will come up against the barrier. This is the note about the position in France.  The President of the French <Col N="1094" /> Republic holds office for seven years and is re-eligible for office.  So far, one President consented to be re-eligible and five resigned.  The one President who consented and was re-eligible held office for only two years of the second term.  The others frankly said that they did not wish a further term.  That is the position there, and I think that is likely to be the position.  The only thing I do not like is to see an artificial barrier interposed here which might be very awkward at some particular time.  I suggest that we should not put in a barrier.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the amendment and I will support the Government on it, but as regards what the President said, if he studies the chapter on France in Bryce's &ldquo;Modern Democracies&rdquo; he will see that a feature of French politics has been the intense jealousy of Parliament towards the President.  Of course, the President there is elected by Parliament and not, as we propose here, by the mass of the people; and we have no reason to think that the mass of the people here will have the same strong prejudice &mdash; amounting almost to a principle in France&mdash; against giving a man a second term, that the French have.  I repeat that I am in favour of a man having a second term; but an amendment after this one in my name provides that nobody shall have more than a second term, and I would press the President to make the concession he has indicated he might make by accepting that amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Each of the following persons shall be disqualified from being elected to or holding or retaining the office of President:</P>
      <P>(a)  a person who is undergoing sentence of imprisonment with hard labour for any period exceeding six months or of penal servitude for any term imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction,</P>
      <P>(b)  an imbecile and any person of unsound mind,</P>
      <P>(c)  an undischarged bankrupt, under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction,</P>
      <P>(d)  a person who is by law for the time being in force in relation to corrupt practices and other offences at elections incapacitated from being a member of Dáil Eireann by reason of his having been found guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction of some such practice or offence,</P>

    <P>(f)  a member of any police force on full pay,</P>
    <P>(g)  a person employed in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This amendment sets out that certain persons shall not hold the office of President.  It makes those persons ineligible for the office of President who are ineligible for election to the Dáil. It is very much the same as the provisions in the Electoral Act.  I submit to the House that it is obvious that some such sort of provision is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a similarity certainly but I think that it is not an appropriate thing to put into a Constitution. I do not know of any Constitution where you have a number of categories set out like that of people who are ineligible.  Surely we can depend upon the good sense of the people not to elect a person who is in any of these categories.  Remember it is the people themselves who are electing the President.  It would be different if it were some minor group who are to make this selection and who possibly might not make it properly for the people.  But in this case first of all you have to get the people who are going to be candidates nominated by a number of councils or by a number of members of one or other House of the Oireachtas and then they have to go forward for election by the people.  In what circumstances is it likely that a person who is undergoing a term of imprisonment is going to be nominated by 20 members of the Oireachtas and put forward for election by the people?  If there was any chance of that happening then I would be inclined to think that there was something strange about the imprisonment.  Again in the case of <Col N="1098" /> a person being an imbecile or of unsound mind, would it not be perfectly needless to put in a restriction like this?  The third in the list is an undischarged bankrupt under an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction. I think, if such a person were going forward for election as President, he would not have any chance of being elected.  He would have to get 20 members of the Oireachtas or four county councils to nominate him. What chance would such a person have of getting himself nominated?  Then we have the case of a person who is by law guilty of corrupt practices.  I think that in a campaign of that sort a person guilty of corrupt practices would have a poor chance of being elected.  Surely if it could be pointed out against that person that he is guilty of corrupt practices, that would in itself make it impossible for him to be returned.  Now we come to the other category and it proposes that we are to have a restriction on one who is a member of the Defence Forces on full pay.  It can be made a regulation that no such person can go forward.  There might possibly be a case where it would be possible to include that as a definite disqualification. I can imagine such a disqualification being inserted because there might be a danger of a person who is actually an officer in the Army going forward for election and possibly having a coup of some kind brought off. I can see a case for that.  With regard to the question of the police I do not see any case to be made for it.  With regard to a person employed in the Civil Service I do not see any case either.  Perhaps some case could be made in the matter of a civil servant. If there is to be a constitutional barrier in any one of these classes the only one to which we need pay any attention is (e) a member of the Defence Forces on full pay.  There might be a danger there.  My own attitude is that as the Article stands it is all right.  I think that we should take out certain possibilities in that text and amend it by way of deletion rather than by way of addition.  I will meet that amendment by bringing in an amendment on the Report Stage which would debar serving officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It only shows the difficulties you get into when you put up these barriers at all.  Does the Deputy feel there would have to be a period of years?  The question is whether it is advisable that a man who acts in good faith, having nothing behind it and no suggestion of using his military position in any way, should be debarred?  Is there any reason why a person who has served in the Defence Forces should suffer disqualification when he resigns, disqualifications that are placed on nobody else?  I can see that somebody might talk in a similar way about civil servants&mdash;that a civil servant might use his position in order to ingratiate himself with a political Party.  But I think a civil servant actually serving has not, ordinarily, any way of coming before the public and trying to enlist support for his candidature.  On the other hand, if a civil servant has done such good work as will bring him favourably before the notice of the public, such work as would suggest that he might be elected to this office, I do not see why he should be debarred. If you do not debar him altogether or debar him for a number of years, there is a very simple way out of it&mdash;that is simply to resign before the election. In due course, when people are discussing the election of a particular candidate, this will be properly taken into account.  I do not see any good purpose to be served by interposing these barriers here.  However, if there is some view about a special danger from the Army, and if it is possible to suggest <Col N="1100" /> a type of amendment which would meet the case, then I will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Every single argument which we have heard from the President is an argument against having a single restriction in relation to the election of an individual even to membership of the Dáil.  They are not likely to be elected, is the President's argument.  Could not exactly the same argument be made, that they are not likely to be elected to the Dáil? Here we have certain categories of undesirable people.  Why should they not be set out?  They are set out in the Electoral Acts.  Why should they be eligible in this instance?  Why should an undischarged bankrupt, for example, be eligible to be elected as the President of the State, or a member of the Defence Forces on full pay? And, if you please, Deputy MacDermot cannot see the difference between a member of the Defence Forces on full pay and a person who has resigned from membership of the Defence Forces. Nobody ever suggested that an ex-Army officer should be ineligible for the post, but I suggest that a serving Army officer should not be eligible, and in the same way a police officer or a person employed in the Civil Service should not be eligible.  Nobody ever suggested that an ex-civil servant should not be eligible, but we do suggest that a person serving as a civil servant should not be eligible.</P>
      <P>These are precisely the classes which are, in our opinion, ineligible for a legislative position.  They are ineligible for membership of the Dáil, and why should a lower standard be taken for the office of President?  We are told that this is to be an office of great dignity, and then we come along and find that it is to be an office possessing not even the dignity of the Dáil and persons shall be eligible for this post who are undischarged bankrupts or who come under the other categories set out in the amendment.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect which the President and Deputy MacDermot very carefully ignored&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;elected to or holding or retaining the office of President.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, an imbecile or any person of unsound mind is capable of holding <Col N="1101" /> or retaining the office of President, or a person who is declared a bankrupt while he is President.  All those would be covered by this amendment.  That aspect has not been dealt with at all. Surely a man should be ineligible to hold the office of President if he comes under any of these categories?  It is admitted by President de Valera that it would be highly undesirable that any person in any of the categories set out here should be elected to the office of President.  Why not say so?  If they are undesirable, what is the objection to say so?  You have your precedent for it.  If it is desirable, in the opinion of the House, that this class of person should be eligible for the office of President, of course this amendment will be rejected.  If the House holds the contrary opinion then, of course, the amendment must be accepted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has drafted this amendment with great care, and it is interesting to see the types of people that he has left eligible.  He only makes ineligible those undergoing sentences exceeding six months.  If they have served a sentence of six months they are quite eligible.  A man who has got 15 years for killing his mother would be eligible, according to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  In the same way an habitual thief, a man who has served several sentences, would be eligible under this amendment.  We must assume that the Deputy has some such people in mind when he holds they are eligible for the position.</P>

      <P>I do not see why we should be bound here by the Electoral <Col N="1102" /> Acts.  I might hold that putting in these classes in the Electoral Acts is unnecessary.  There is no similarity between the two positions.  Here it is a question of one man.  He is put before the whole country and he is discussed over whatever period of time there is before the election.  I hold it is not worthy of a document like a Constitution to put these things in.  It rather suggests the people are capable of electing this type of person, and I hold they are not.  In the case of the Electoral Acts I would say, do not put them in there either.  If such people are to be elected, there must be something very extraordinary about the position they occupied before.</P>
      <P>I think it would be unworthy of the Constitution to put them in.  It suggests that something is possible which, in fact, would not be possible.  The only case one has to look out for would be the case of a serving officer, one who was serving and who resigned for the purpose of going up for election.  But there is the point that the President can occupy no other office in the State but the one, and when he occupies that he is definitely limited in regard to his functions by this Constitution and they cover the position of the Army amongst other things.  On the whole, I will resist the amendment.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the difficulties that have arisen here have arisen owing to the omission of any possible qualification for the position of President.  The President has surely some conception of the great qualities that will add to the dignity and the overpowering position of the new President, but in the actual Constitution there is nothing laid down in the form of a qualification except that he must be of a certain age.  From that it would follow that even persons not eligible to be elected on a county council or to membership of the Dáil would be quite suitable for the position of President.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Either we are going to have democracy or we are not.  The whole position in this Constitution is that the people can judge when a person is put before them whether that particular individual is, in their opinion, the most suitable.  Once you have the supreme authority in that matter consolidated, as it is directly by this method, I do not think you want to put in any qualifications whatever. The whole object of the Constitution is to see that during periods when the people are not themselves judges or able to judge on any particular matter, that judgment can be carried out in their name in the proper way. Whenever there is a question being referred directly to the people, I see no reason at all why there should be any qualifications, and, in fact, I am very doubtful whether we are wise in putting in the limitation of 35 years of age.  There may be a certain set of circumstances in which a younger man might be elected.  I do not say that if I were voting myself, I would be inclined to take a person younger than 35, but 35 years is found in a number of other Constitutions.  My own feeling, then, is that I would take away the 35 years of age and say that whoever is going to be elected will be the choice of the people themselves.  They have the right to choose and once it is referred to them they ought to be the judges of capacity, or incapacity, or anything like that.  As we are talking about this, I would propose on Report Stage to delete the words in Section 4, Article 12, &ldquo;and is not placed under disability or incapacity by law,&rdquo; because I think they are dangerous.  The danger was pointed out in another connection and I think they are dangerous here.  The section will then read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every citizen who has reached <Col N="1104" /> his 35th year of age is eligible for election to the office of President.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And if I get any support from the other members of the House, I should be inclined to say that I would wipe out the 35 years of age provision, too.</P>

      <P>In Section 4, sub-section 2º, line 1, to delete the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;including.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to provide that a retiring President must require the same type of nomination as any other candidate.  It is very difficult to see how the provisions in the Draft Constitution can be justified. It is, apparently, desired that a former President should be able to nominate himself for re-election at the conclusion of his term of office.  It may be that, at the end of the term, he will have so lost the confidence of Parliament that he will not be able to get the necessary number of Deputies to nominate him.  It may be, too, that he will not be able to get the necessary number of county councils to nominate him.  I cannot see any reason why there should be a differentiation between him and his co-candidates for the position at the time he leaves office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said he could not see how the provisions of the Draft could be justified.  The justification is the putting of the President-candidate in a position of independence so that he will not have to go round and look for nominations from members of any political Party in the Dáil or from the members of any political Party which you might have in the Second House.  He is elected by the people to watch the people's interests directly and immediately. His duty is, in the cases in which he is brought into action regarding disputes between the two Houses, to act impartially and fairly.  In doing that, he may possibly displease the majority in one House.  It is undesirable that the President should have to look for 20 nominations from the Second House if he were again going forward for election.  This provision applies mainly to a person who is going forward for a second period of office and the intention is to put him in a position of independence.  If the people are likely to elect him because he has faithfully discharged his duties and watched their interests, I see no reason why he should not be eligible to go forward and obtain their judgment upon his conduct without being beholden to the members of any political Party.  The justification of the provision is that it secures the independence of the President who may be a candidate for a second term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in entire agreement with the President on the necessity for putting this new functionary into a position of independence. In moving an amendment last night the object of which was to provide that the President should not be eligible for a second term of office, I said that if there was any justification for this new position at all, it could only be that the holder would be impartial and stand above politics. The President, apparently, hopes that that will be the position.  I would like to see that position, but once there is the necessity for the President to seek re-election by popular vote, then in my view at all events that cuts the ground entirely away <Col N="1108" /> from his position of independence and from his position of impartiality.</P>
      <P>The President said that it would be invidious for him to have to look for four county councils or 20 members of the Dáil to nominate him, but he has got to look for about 250,000 votes.  I do not know the precise number of electors in the country, but with adult suffrage I understand the number will be over 1,000,000.  He has to get a majority of those votes in order to be re-elected.  Not merely has he to get 20 voters, because after all that is what Deputies are, but he has also got to seek the votes of over 500,000 people.  The President said it would be invidious and undesirable for him to have to go to four county councils or to 20 Deputies to nominate him, but there is much more than that in it.  If he is to be re-elected he has to get either by his own personal prestige, through the Party machine or by some other method over 500,000 votes.  That, in my view, completely takes away from him his position of independence.  When it is stated as the only justification for this that it would be invidious for him to have to look for 20 Deputies or four county councils to nominate him in order that his position of independence shall be maintained, then I fail to follow the justification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add as a further argument that this person we are thinking of has already got a large number of votes to elect him to his office.  He has got, therefore, not 20 or 30 people who may be presumed, if he has carried out his duties faithfully, to support his election, but he has got the vast number who formerly elected him.  The fact that he has been elected by popular vote to this position singles him out as a man who has got sufficient support to warrant, if he cares to go forward again, his name being entered on the ballot paper.  That is all that it means.  I hold that it does add to his position of independence of political Parties to be put in that position.</P>

      <P>If the general electors in the State have elected one individual in the hope that he will <Col N="1109" /> make good that is not any proof that he will make good.  Neither the electors nor anybody can be infallible. The electors can do their best to choose a perfectly suitable man.  That man may appear to them to be suitable before he has been tried, but once he has been tried, and has been seen doing the work of his office, he may appear to them entirely unsuitable. Surely a man taken from any Party in the Dáil or Seanad who could not get 20 members willing to nominate him would be eminently unsuitable for the position.</P>

      <P>Why should that not apply to everybody else as well as to the person we are discussing? There may be some man prominent in the public life of the country who may have liked to go forward, but who, owing to his public actions, had aroused the hostility of the Dáil.  Why should he be compelled to do what this person is not being asked to do?  The President is envisaging a man who will not get the support of one-sixth of the members of the Dáil.  I wonder does the President see that we have here a clashing between two authorities: the one elected directly by the people, and the other their elected representatives sitting here.  Once more the President refuses to face that particular issue. Is it not much more likely that what may happen is that when this man comes to the close of his term of office he will play Party politics against the popularly elected Dáil?  That should not be encouraged.  You are asking him to play Party politics by this provision. That is what the House is doing.  You are cutting across what you pretend you want to do by putting him in a position of this kind.  If, at the end of his seven years in office, he intends to go forward for election, then at the close of his term he will try, or may try, to play Party politics against the Dáil.  Apparently, the present President envisages that that is done practically against an unanimous Dáil, and against the other House as well. If he cannot get 20 people or four <Col N="1110" /> county councils to nominate him, why should he be put in this position of preeminence on the ballot paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the principle of allowing an outgoing President to nominate himself is against the very fundamental idea of democracy in elections. If he has been a success in the position, the present President would like to maintain him in that position, to keep him above ordinary matters, but, at the same time, in the case of elections in a democratic country, all who go forward ought to be put in a position of equality.  When he has completed his seven years in office, and if he has been a success in it, he should be prepared to go back, so to speak, into the political arena again and meet his competitors on level terms.  To allow him to nominate himself would, in my opinion, be undemocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, on the whole, the President ought to accept these amendments.  I warmly sympathise with his idea of securing the sort of independence which he speaks of, but, after all, the Dáil and the Seanad together will amount to some 200 people.  It is not conceivable that the outgoing President, if he has performed his duties with propriety, will not be able to get 20 members to nominate him out of a total of 200.  There is a further point.  Under the Article, as it stands, not alone can the outgoing President nominate himself, but a President who may have retired years ago, and wishes to come back, may nominate himself. What justification can there be for that?  As I have said, I warmly sympathise with the desire of the President to preserve the dignity and the independence of the office.  If it were necessary to get 20 persons from the Dáil alone, I would not have been in favour of submitting the outgoing President to that necessity, but, when he has the Seanad to turn to as well, I do not think that one can contemplate a situation in which he would suffer any loss of dignity or independence by being obliged to get 20 nominators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point of nomination anyhow?  In the case of Dáil elections, certain fees have to <Col N="1111" /> be paid when candidates are being nominated.  That is to prevent such a large number of candidates going forward that it would be quite impossible for elections to be held at all. No such factor enters here.  There may be two or three living persons who have held office, and, therefore, capable of having their names added to the ballot paper.  Is not the purpose of nomination preceding an election simply to restrict your ballot paper so that you will have one of convenient size for the people to vote on?  Deputy O'Neill spoke about democracy.  Nominations, in my opinion, have nothing to do with democracy.  They are simply a method of preventing large numbers of people going forward.  At the time of nominations for election to the Dáil, for instance, certain fees have to be paid, and in certain circumstances some of those who go forward forfeit the fees.  In this case you do not add more than one or two or three names to your ballot paper, and therefore do not make the election more difficult.  Notwithstanding what has been said on the other side, I am definitely of the opinion that the fact of being able to put his name on the ballot paper does put the individual, whether the retiring President or one who has formerly held the office, in a position of independence in which he can go on his own merits before the people because of the fact that he has served loyally and well during his period of office.  I think that the fact that he has served well and faithfully during that period should make him eligible to go forward.  If he should go before the people, not having served well and faithfully, I think reject him very easily: but if he has served well and faithfully, I think there is no reason why he should not be capable of being re-elected by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong unduly discussion on this particular point, although we regard it as a very fundamental matter, and therefore I shall only make one or two final observations.  I think it <Col N="1112" /> will be admitted that anybody who has occupied a position in this country for six or seven years has very little chance of being re-elected to that office unless he has been a very outstanding personality and a very successful man.  We have our own quota of jealousy in this country, as everybody knows, and the very fact that a man had occupied such a position for seven years would tend to prevent people from re-electing him, and they would say that it was time another man got the job.  I think that that would be the normal outlook of any person who might be thinking of seeking re-election, and that it would only be on rare occasions that he would seek re-election. If he is a man of very outstanding personality and if he has been successful and served well and faithfully, he will have no trouble in getting the necessary nomination by the Oireachtas.  On the other hand, if the person who has occupied that position in one who will not be elected and who has very little, if any, chance of being elected, as the Article stands at the moment, he can put the country unnecessarily to the expense of an election which will cost, perhaps, £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose for a moment that this man has been in office for seven years, or for 14 years, as the case may be, and that the people say &ldquo;seven years&rdquo;&mdash;or 14 years, as the case may be&mdash;&ldquo;is enough for him; we want somebody else,&rdquo; and supposing that the Dáil and the Seanad are unanimous that another person ought to occupy the position&mdash; the Dáil and the Seanad, in fact, representing the wishes of the vast majority of the people&mdash;nevertheless, as it stands at the moment, this outgoing President may, wholly unnecessarily, nominate himself for the position and put the people to the expense of an election.  I should be glad to hear the President's views on that point, and I should be glad to hear what justification he can put forward for that.  To say that this person will be put in a position of independence of political Parties because he can nominate himself, is absurd, and it also overlooks the fact that it takes away the method of <Col N="1113" /> popular election.  As I have said, if an individual has been there for seven years, and has served faithfully and well, he should have no difficulty in getting a number of people to back him; and if he cannot get them to back him, then he ought not to be allowed to go forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is the possibility that you might have an uncontested election if it were not permissible for this man to go forward for election.  The same thing could happen in connection with the Dáil, where you can have people putting forward members for election to the Dáil and also causing an election.  We have got to face the possibility of having an election for the office of President, and, in my view, the times when you are going to have an agreed election will be very, very few, indeed.  From my experience, I should say that the chances of getting agreement and an uncontested election are going to be very slight.</P>

Perhaps, Sir, I should not be speaking of personal things, but on a former occasion, speaking about the Deputy, I pointed out that, when <Col N="1114" /> he tried to get his own judgment as an officer of the law reversed, he was playing the part of a politician.</P>

Unfortunately, however, I am precluded from getting their opinions as lawyers and can only get their opinions as people who want to put a certain political colouring on this document. That is most unfortunate, but I suppose it is inevitable.  However, we can agree to differ, and I still hold that this is a better provision than the one suggested in the amendment.  I think that the chance of anybody, who had not served well and faithfully, being re-elected, or of having an uncontested election, is so remote that it is not worth providing for.</P>

I think that he has never so clearly or so truthfully summed up his position as on this occasion.  It is a perfect summing up, and truthful, but not from Fine Gael. Now, I just want to direct the President's attention to one particular matter in connection with the method of election.  The ordinary individual must get 20 persons from this House to nominate him&mdash;from this House, on the first occasion, at any rate, because the Seanad may or may not be in existence then&mdash;or four county councils.  Now, I can quite conceive that there might be quite a number of people who would like to go forward for election but who may not be able to get that nomination.

What I meant was that it is unfair that, in a matter of this kind, a man should be enabled to start with something in his favour that other people have not got.  I think that each man should start equal in a matter of this kind.  Even though the man has held the position formerly, and has served loyally and well, and with <i>éclat</i>, and so on, nevertheless he should start on the same level as he started on originally, and he should start on the same level as the other competitors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>To delete Section 10.</P>
      <P>Again I shall try to be as laconic as possible, although the amendment raises a matter of very great principle. The proposal in Article 12 (10) 1º, 2º, 3º and 4º is that the President may be impeached.  The official amendments in the President's name take away one bad element that was in the original Draft.  The original proposal was that it was only the Seanad or a certain proportion of the Seanad, that could impeach the President.  The proposals that are put forward in the amendments, as I understand them, envisage an impeachment by either House, and a trial by the House that does not impeach.  That serves, to some extent, to take away some of the bad portions of the sub-section.  At the same time, I think that impeachment of the President is in this 20th century an absolute absurdity.  Impeachment is something that happened in the old days in the British House of Parliament. I do not really know what it means.  Impeachment here in this clause of the Constitution sounds very well.  It is terrifying to say that a man may be impeached.  In fact, all that will happen is that there will be an awful lot of talk either in the Seanad or in the Dáil, and in the end nothing will happen, if ever anybody is impeached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Assuming that there was any intention to carry out this direful method of trying a person for grave misdemeanours and high crimes, whatever they are, what would be the result of it?  The man would be brought here, presumably, and held within the precincts of the Dáil if the Seanad were impeaching him and a lengthy document, drafted in the archaic language appropriate to impeachment, would be read out by one of the officials, if not the Ceann Comhairle.  He would stand solemnly and in the most solemn accents read out this archaic document containing a long list of dire crimes that merited impeachment and the Dáil might or might not pronounce impeachment.  Then the President would say &ldquo;Good-bye and thanks; I am impeached but I am carrying on all the same until I am removed.&rdquo;  What punishment is going to be inflicted upon him except that he is going to be deprived of his lucrative post as guardian of the liberties of the people? Having been impeached in this archaic language, and with all the solemnity which will doubtless surround that particular ceremonial, he will lose his job.  That is all there is to it.  Then he will be set free to offer himself for re-election and he can be re-elected by the people, having been solemnly impeached.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the justification for all that?  There seems to me to be none.  It is the height of absurdity, something that is likely to be the cause of the greatest amusement. I cannot see that it is in any way likely to be a deterrent against a man committing what are called high crimes in the Constitution.  Having committed a few high crimes, which might or might not be high crimes in law, he would go around to his Party machine and get himself elected again.  He is on the top of the world then.  He is above the law and he can snap his fingers at the Dáil.  He may be impeached again and again.  It seems to me to be a ridiculous performance and why such a provision was put there, I do not know.  At all events, it would be no harm to leave it there if, and only if, the other part of this particular provision, giving him immunity from the <Col N="1118" /> law, is taken away.  While he has immunity from the law it is no protection for the people.  Perhaps the President would tell me what is a &ldquo;high crime?&rdquo; I do not know.  I know what a misdemeanour is but I do not know whether this clause means that he may be guilty of a high crime and a low misdemeanour or then again that he might be guilty of a low crime and a high misdemeanour. Does the word &ldquo;high&rdquo; as used in the clause qualify misdemeanour or qualify crime only?  I know what a crime is.  I have some idea of what a misdemeanour is and I have a vague notion of what a felony is but I see that the word felony is not included in the clause.  How the Dáil, having been advised, by one of those lawyers about whom we are so contemptuous, will discover when the occasion arises, whether an offence is a high crime or misdemeanour I do not know.  At the present time, I do not know what a high crime is and on the construction of this clause, I do not know whether he is to be impeached for a high misdemeanour as well as for a high crime &mdash;whether the word &ldquo;high&rdquo; qualifies the word &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; as well as the word &ldquo;crime.&rdquo;  Perhaps the President would tell me what a high crime is, or whether there is any difference between a high misdemeanour and a low misdemeanour.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Costello's dislike for this Article.

Is it not that the President should be removable on account of gross misconduct?  If that is what is intended, would it not be far better to express that simply and to leave out these words &ldquo;high crimes and misdemeanours&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Dáil probably, the court which will try him.  It will have to sit obviously before this process can be set going.  There must be a motion that the conduct of the President has been such that it would come under this section. That would have to be agreed upon by two-thirds of the Seanad, the initiative coming in this instance from the Seanad.  Two-thirds of the Seanad would have to say that the conduct of the President was such that it came under the section and that what he had been guilty of was, in fact, a gross crime or gross misconduct. It occurs to me that &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; might appear to be even a wider term than &ldquo;high crime&rdquo; or &ldquo;misdemeanour.&rdquo;  Impeachment is a term which was probably inserted in the American Constitution from the example of the British.  The British example was followed.  It is part of the American Constitution and there have been, I believe, a number of cases under it, though not very many, but I think this Article will never have to be used in fact, against the President.  There is nothing archaic about it if you admit that there are certain things that the President might do which would make him unworthy of his office.  It simply means that the Parliament becomes the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He might be guilty of treason. Fortunately, that is defined here, and Deputy Costello or anybody else will not have to go far to find what it covers.  It is not so easy to define in any rigid way what are the other types of crimes for which it would be advisable that his conduct should be called in question by the Parliament. Consequently, the House that initiates will have to satisfy itself by a two-thirds majority that his conduct has been such as would make it come under this Article.  They would be the judges.  Then they would have to come and make that case before the other House&mdash;we will say the Dáil.  Again, the matter of whether the conduct was of a type <Col N="1120" /> which could properly come under this Article would be called into question, and if there was agreement the trial would take place.  Procedure, no doubt, would be found by law by which this trial would take place. The need of the Article is that you do want to have some means by which to try a person who has been guilty of conduct which ought, in the opinion of two-thirds of each House, be punished by, first of all, removal from office.  I should not like to venture an opinion at the moment&mdash; although it occurred to me before to have it examined&mdash;as to whether, when a President is removed from office as the result of a resolution, he would not be immediately amenable to the ordinary law.  If the crime were cognisable under the ordinary law, I think he would.  It may be necessary perhaps to amend it. Under other Constitutions in some cases they explicitly exclude any other punishment except removal from office.  They provide that, if the President is removed under a clause such as this, no other punishment save that of removal from office shall be inflicted, but I am not quite sure&mdash; as I say, I should not like to venture an opinion at the moment&mdash; whether under this Constitution the President should not be proceeded against immediately he was removed from office for any crime of which he was guilty.  However, you do want to have some such provision as this; if only as a deterrent it would be useful.  I think you do want some provision of this sort, and I think this is as good a provision as any other.  Trial before an ordinary court, I think, would not be the proper procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would submit to the House that this suggested procedure is absolutely absurd.  Now, let us consider what would happen assuming that there is a crime for which the President is to be impeached here.  The Dáil will assemble.  Witnesses will be brought in and examined before the Dáil.  I am assuming now that there is a trial before the Dáil. You can change the word to &ldquo;Seanad&rdquo; if the Seanad happens to be the court. <Col N="1121" /> The members of the Seanad will come in here and appoint their five or six impeachers, who will make long statements, as Burke and Sheridan did on the impeachment of Warren Hastings. Counsel will appear for the defence, as they did on the impeachment of Warren Hastings.  They will raise points as to whether such and such a thing is or is not evidence.  That will be argued out solemnly and this House will divide as to the admissibility or inadmissibility of that point of evidence.  That will go on, and the procedure will last for weeks and weeks.  That is an attempt to try a case by witnesses before an Assembly like the Dáil which has got no precedent to rule on points of evidence or points of procedure.  It is an absurd method.</P>
      <P>As to the things that can be tried before it, any misdemeanour I take it can be tried.  Let us say the Governor-General is guilty of forgery. Let me take that one example.  He can be tried here and dismissed from office.  He cannot be tried before any court, but he can be tried here.  Let him be brought before another court and natural justice as well as the law of the country will say <i>autrefois convict.</i>  That is the old legal phrase, and that is according to natural justice, too.  If the man has been found guilty and sentenced to be deprived of his office he must have a complete answer before any tribunal before which he is tried.  <i>Autrefois convict</i> is a perfect answer, or, if the Dáil voted the other way and he is brought before a court, <i>autrefois acquit.</i>  The French translation used in the law is not perfectly up-to-date. The final &ldquo;t&rdquo; is sounded.  Whatever happens here will be a final bar to any subsequent procedure, and the Dáil or the Seanad is surely not the best or even the proper tribunal before which a man should be tried for his reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a statement in the Constitution&mdash;I need not refer to the exact number at the moment&mdash;that everybody is to be entitled to a trial by jury, but by this section you are taking away from the Governor-General his right to trial by jury for <Col N="1122" /> a high crime, for say a misdemeanour. This is quite inconsistent with the clause which gives every citizen the right to trial by jury.  If he is charged with a serious crime, or a misdemeanour, as distinct from a summary offence, this denies to him the right to trial by jury which every citizen of the State has got.  The President seemed to think&mdash;I may have interpreted him wrongly, or he may not have conveyed his view clearly&mdash;that any misconduct in office would be a high crime or misdemeanour. It is not.  I take the example of that case so very regrettable in Irish history, the Parnell case.  Suppose a similar thing were to happen; suppose whoever is President were to fail as Parnell failed, there would not be a method of removing him from office under this.  He has not been guilty of a high crime.  There is no misdemeanour under the law and he still remains in office.  He cannot be indicted under this Article because it is not a high crime, not a misdemeanour and not an offence at all.  Surely it is a very unsatisfactory position, that a man who has been found guilty by the Dáil or the Seanad of having committed a crime known to the law is to remain as President.  If he has committed a crime then he is tried here, removed from office and nothing further happens.  The method of trial will be grotesque.</P>

      <P>We may take it that the procedures outlined by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would be certainly very heavy types of procedure.  Surely the procedure can be laid down by law. For example, you could arrange that a certain part of the investigation could be carried on by a committee of the Dáil.  I am only thinking of the possibility of procedure being arranged by law.  At this stage I am not going to say that it would not be possible to devise a method of procedure by which this trial could be carried out with reasonable facilities.</P>

      <P>My recollection is that of Johnson.  There were 11 of them.  I am not going to accept it from anybody that if we had the task of providing a fair trial for a person, and that the Dáil was the court, we could not devise procedure to give a fair trial.  It is not going to be easy to convince me that it could not be done.  The next point is this: are we not to make some provision by which if a person is guilty of treason, or, even if we are not able definitely to define what we mean by high crime, a crime that will be regarded as such by the Seanad and the Dáil, so as to have a means of getting rid of a person who was guilty of such?  Whether you accept this or not, some procedure must be devised, and I will be very happy if anyone can suggest a better method.  I think the President's office, being such as it is, is one that ought to be dealt with by Parliament, and not by the courts.  I do not see how you could definitely bring him before the ordinary courts.  This is like the vision we had of the extraordinary powers that a President might take in such and such circumstances.  I <Col N="1124" /> think if we had to deal with a case it would not be impossible to do so.  I do not want to suggest to anyone that I am quite happy about this.  I wish human nature was such that there would be no necessity for anything of this kind.  But we want to have some means by which, if a President in office is guilty of treason, or of any crime which would be regarded, in the opinion of the Houses of Parliament, as a high crime, it would be possible to investigate the charge and, if proved home, remove him from office.  With respect to the question of further trial, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney more or less indicated that it would not be possible to try a man again.  I quite understand that principle of justice if he were being tried definitely with a view to getting a sentence, if, for instance, the Dáil or the Seanad could save a person from the infliction of a death penalty.  I think the penalty here being of a restricted character, that his trial would be on the point, not on what punishment should be meted out for what he had done, but rather on the question of having done this thing, and having been found to have done it, whether he was in fact a fit person to keep in office.  In other words, the trial would be of a restricted character.  I doubt very much if it would run counter to natural justice, as suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, if he was found unfit for the office and removed, and if he could not in that case come under the cognisance of the ordinary courts.  That is a point I do not want to argue now.  The main thing is that I think some provision is necessary. This is the best I can think of anything that has been suggested.  If anyone on the opposite benches can improve on the provision I will be ready to meet it.</P>

      <P>It seems to be an anticlimax to impeach a person for a high crime, and in conclusion to do no more than to remove him from office.  The President is satisfied that, if removed by the Dáil, he might come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts in respect of the matters complained of. Is it clear that he could?  There is the principle in law that a man should not be tried twice.  I think the President used the exact words of the Article, and that when impeached before the Dáil and convicted, a man might say he had suffered the full penalty that the law required.  The President has asked for some alternative.  Is there any difficulty in providing merely that, if a charge is made against the President which unfits him for his office, the Dáil, or the Dáil and Seanad, or any other tribunal which is considered appropriate, should investigate that charge and remove him from office?  Surely, that is the whole result of the Article as it stands at present, and that will be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy MacDermot that it is very unlikely that the President will be guilty of treason.  Firstly the opportunities open to a President to commit the crime of treason against the nation are not very great.  Usually folk in the position of a President do not come before the courts on charges of treason.  That is left for lesser lights of the community.  A President usually manages to escape any liability in that connection.  As Deputy MacDermot pointed out, I think it is more likely that the President would be guilty not of crime of the magnitude of treason, but of a much less important crime.  For instance, we might have a situation where we pay the President £5,000 per year&mdash;perhaps we might even be generous enough to pay him £10,000&mdash;yet we might discover that, notwithstanding the fact that he was receiving a substantial salary from the State, the <Col N="1127" /> President would not pay his bills. Suppose we had the position where the President would not pay his grocer.  Perhaps he would not pay his rent; perhaps he would not pay his income-tax; or perhaps he would engage in the pastime of backing horses and would be constantly in the courts pleading the Gaming Act.  I think everybody will agree that that kind of President would be a disreputable President and ought to be removed from the office as quickly as possible.  I think the Legislature would desire to remove a person of that kind.  Will this Article enable us to do it?  It seems to me that this is sledge-hammer language, although the task to be performed is one which does not require the use of such a heavy instrument.  I assume that under &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo; it would be possible to bring a President who would not pay his debts before either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;High crimes or misdemeanours.&rdquo; Does the &ldquo;high&rdquo; govern &ldquo;misdemeanours?&rdquo; I think it would be a sufficiently high misdemeanour if the President were in the courts every week pleading the Gaming Act.  Are we entitled in a situation like that to bring the President before either House of the Oireachtas and say to him: &ldquo;Look here, we think this conduct of yours is thoroughly reprehensible and disreputable and that you are not a fit person to hold office.&rdquo;  I think it is that kind of crime and misdemeanour that a President is likely to commit than the crime of high treason.  That is the situation we are dealing with and which must be met, perhaps even more so than the possibility of the President committing high treason. If we are entitled to indict the President for that kind of disreputable conduct, it seems to me that such a word as &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; is altogether out of place in dealing with misdemeanours of that kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President should look at the phrasing of the paragraph with a view to adjusting it to the situation which is likely to arise.  The word &ldquo;impeachment,&rdquo; which seems to govern the entire category of crimes the President can commit, could be altered to that type of trial he is likely to get and adjusted to the phraseology of the kind of crime he is likely to commit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this problem which I should like to put before the President.  We have been concentrating on the powers of the Dáil or the Seanad, as it may be, to impeach.  I do not like this new functionary at all, but I feel bound to say that he is entitled to some protection. We have been seeing how we can lay hold of him and remove him if he does not pay his debts or commits high crimes or misdemeanours.  Much as I dislike him, I think he is entitled to a little protection from the Dáil.  We might take it into our heads some time or other, and I hope Providence and my constituents may spare me to witness this extraordinary trial by impeachment of some unfortunate President, as I think it will be a matter of considerable amusement.  At the same time, I think the President ought to be protected from vexatious impeachment either by the Dáil or Seanad.  There is a little protection for him in the Article as it stands, because I think he can go to the courts and prevent this Assembly from impeaching him for matters that were not high crimes or misdemeanours.  It is just as well that we should face the matter seriously.  Certainly the word &ldquo;misdemeanour&rdquo; has a technical meaning. <Col N="1129" />&ldquo;High crime&rdquo; has no technical meaning, but the word &ldquo;crime&rdquo; may have. I think the President, if he was vexatiously impeached, or if some sort of procedure was started to impeach him, might possibly seek the protection of the courts against it.  I cannot say, but I think he could.  He ought to have some protection against vexatious impeachments.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Norton that we ought to have some procedure by which scandalous behaviour, not amounting either to a crime or a misdemeanour, such as bankruptcy, profligacy, corrupt practice, undue interference in politics, could be dealt with. A lot of matters of that kind might be committed by a President which would unfit him for his office as President and still not be either a crime or a misdemeanour. While we ought to envisage that situation, at the same time, I think he is entitled to some protection.</P>
      <P>It might be that you would have a position where you will have a President, who must be a man of some appeal, and probably of powerful personality; where you will have a Prime Minister of a similar type, who must necessarily, in the ordinary course of events, be a man of outstanding personality. If there is a clash between those two, it may be that the Prime Minister, desirous of getting rid of the President, might rig up a charge against him of a vexatious or frivolous kind and, by virtue of his outstanding personality and force in the Dáil, and possible influence in the Seanad, might be able to get an impeachment sentence and removal carried out against a man who is properly carrying out his duties. I put the point of view that, while we are entitled to say that we can remove a man who ought to be removed, at the same time, I think this new functionary, if we must have him ought to have a little protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still have, strange as it may appear, some weakness for the Courts of Justice in this country.  I cannot see why we cannot provide that the courts shall investigate a matter of this kind at the instance of two-thirds of the Seanad, or any other instance, say, the Attorney-General. The taxpayers pay independent judges.  As I say, I have a weakness <Col N="1130" /> for the judiciary and, no matter who they may be, I think they will give everybody a square deal.  They will stand between the President and the Dáil or Seanad and equally between the Dáil or Seanad and the President and give both parties a square and fair deal.  The alternative to that is to provide specifically in the Constitution for the cases where a man would become disqualified from holding office. It may be a blot upon the Constitution, as an artistic document, to provide specifically for matters such as bankruptcy, breach of duty, and things of that kind, that would <i>ipso facto</i> disqualify him.  But, either that method, or the method of having a charge investigated before the Courts of Justice, appears to me the only solution of the problem, and the Dáil ought to look at it in a serious fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Costello has turned the attention of the House to that particular aspect of the case, namely, that the President needs protection.  I think Deputy Norton will realise that the person put into that position will be a mark for a number of people who will want to start vexatious actions against him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that it would be a species of blackmail which they would not attempt to proceed with in the case of an ordinary individual.  The man in that position does not want to have his high office dragged up in the courts. There have been instances where that sort of thing has been done before.  I am sure that those on the opposite benches will have the same sort of experiences as we will have of that sort of thing.  It is therefore very necessary to protect the President from actions of that kind.  The problem is how to give the necessary protection against individuals who think that any sort of case against the President will be sufficient to make him pay because of the publicity that would attach and the damage that may be done to his reputation by bringing him into court.  He would also need protection from political <Col N="1131" /> Parties.  Deputy Costello instanced cases where he might act against the wishes of the political Party of the day.</P>
      <P>So you have, on the one hand, the need of giving the President adequate protection and, on the other hand, you have the need of protecting the community from what would arise if you have a President in office who would be unworthy of his high position. That is the trouble.  We have looked into a number of Constitutions. Deputy Flinn asked if I could tell the House what is done in other Constitutions. Here we find in the case of the Polish Republic this provision:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President of the Polish Republic does not incur any Parliamentary or civil responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now we have heard a great deal from those who were talking about the President here being above the law.  That is the provision in the Polish Constitution.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President of the Polish Republic does not incur any Parliamentary or civil responsibility for acts done in the exercise of his functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a provision in one of the Constitutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether this in itself is the dictatorship Constitution in Poland.  The point about it is this, I do not know whether the dictatorship is in accord with this Polish Constitution at all or what it has to do with the dictatorship that was set up.  The dictatorship will be found to have been set up contrary to the Constitution.  That is a thing that you have to face&mdash;that no Constitution that you will make will completely save you from the possibility of a dictatorship being set up in certain circumstances. This was the Constitution set up by the new Polish State, a democratic State with a form more or less democratic.  That was the provision we had in this Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The President of the Republic does not incur any Parliamentary or <Col N="1132" /> civil responsibility for acts done in the exercise of his functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the next provision reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President of the Republic may be impeached by the Diet only upon a vote approved by a majority of three-fifths in the presence of at least half the number of Deputies fixed by law, if he guilty of high treason, of violation of the Constitution or of penal offences.  The trial shall take place before and judgment be delivered by the Tribunal of State according to the provisions of a special enactment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President of the Republic shall be suspended from office from the time he is put on trial before the Tribunal of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We will have to look up the Tribunal of State and see what the procedure is.  In Czecho-Slovakia.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President may not be proceeded against on any criminal charge save high treason, in which case he shall be tried by the Senate upon the indictment by the Chamber of Deputies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is more or less the provision here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only penalty that may be inflicted upon the President shall be the loss of his office of President and permanent disqualification therefor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The details shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the case of the French Republic, there is a provision that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President of the Republic shall be responsible only in case of high treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then provisions are made for dealing with matters of that sort.  I quite agree that these provisions do not deal with the cases that might have to be dealt with.  The trouble is that if you open your net wide enough you are catching fish that were never intended to be caught.</P>

      <P>It is continued up to the present time.  There is no doubt if you want to give a number of cases and try to arrive at some sort of definition as to what is the class of crimes called by crimes and misdemeanours you will find that it will be impossible to do so.  There have been 11 cases of impeachment in America.  The result of your examination of these would enable you to arrive at a definition. Then there is this provision in the American Constitution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honour, trust or profit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The officer, after removal, is also</P>
      <P>&ldquo;liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can, obviously, if you want to avoid any clash with that principle, make it clear that the purpose of the trial is only to see whether the President is fit for office or not and leave him open afterwards to proceedings in accordance with ordinary law.  We would all like to see a provision by which a person who is unworthy to hold office should be capable of being dealt with.  We would all like to see that done in such a way that the individual holding office would be protected in the case where the individual was not really guilty of these crimes at all, the individual who would be proceeded against for vexatious reasons by a political Party who tried to get rid of him because he was not amenable to their counsels, or by some individual who, seeing the position occupied by the President might be inclined to proceed against him in order to get money.  If anybody can improve on <Col N="1134" /> this section of the Article, I would like to get suggestions from him.  One suggestion which has been made is the ordinary court.  I think Deputy Lavery's suggestion was that the class of crime was of a general catalogue of gross misconduct, but the method of procedure would be the same.</P>
    <P>Having heard all the arguments, now I am practically in the position I was when I first agreed to this particular proposal.  The word &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; seemed a bit cumbersome and has a terrifying sound.  The person who is going to be impeached is, however, a very high officer, and the wording of the Article suggests that this impeachment is a thing that should not be done lightly and that this sledge-hammer ought not to be employed except where there was a genuine necessity.  By putting in this word &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; you indicate that this should not be set in motion except for very grave reasons.  That is the advantage of getting this archaic word; whereas if instead of that you put in the ordinary courts, the President could be brought up on a petty matter.  My view is that I am in no better position and there has been no advance, except, perhaps, the suggestion of gross misconduct, which is dangerous, in my opinion, because any misconduct might be suggested in the House that is initiating it as gross misconduct.  However, I will think over the suggestions that have been made and see if we cannot do something with them; but I think it is just as well to have this heavy machinery of trial by Parliament kept in the belief that, at any rate, we can devise here, if necessary, by law a procedure which will make for justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only a case of heavy machinery; it is a case of heavy and even misleading terminology which might prevent us dealing with cases that ought to be dealt with.  What Deputy Lavery suggested was that it could be stated in much simpler language that a charge against the President of gross misconduct, such as might disqualify him from office, could be brought by two-thirds <Col N="1135" /> of either House of the Oireachtas and submitted to the judgment of the other House.</P>

      <P>Will the President indicate what legal advice he has had as to the precise scope of the term &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo;?  That is an important matter in considering the phraseology of the paragraph.  No matter what the scope of high crimes and misdemeanours may be, I think the term, impeachment, is hardly the one to use in respect of misdemeanours. Probably this paragraph might be divided into two parts, one stopping at the word &ldquo;Constitution,&rdquo; in the second last line, and then using such language as &ldquo;a charge in respect of such offence as high crimes or misdemeanours.&rdquo;  When one talks about impeaching a person for a misdemeanour it seems to be a misuse of terminology and some other term than impeachment ought to be used where we talk of misdemeanours. The important point is, what is the precise scope of the word misdemeanours? Has it any definite legal significance?</P>

This is the Polish Republic, the 1922 Constitution, and it sets out that the Tribunal of State is composed of the President of the Supreme Court, who presides, and 12 judges, eight judges selected by the Diet and four by the Senate, who shall not be members of either House.  Only persons who do not exercise any public functions and are in full enjoyment of civil rights can be members of the Tribunal of State.

      <P>It is quite possible the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; there simply means people appointed to judge a particular matter, not <i>ad hoc</i> appointments, but appointed for this particular purpose.  That is a type of tribunal which could possibly be tried if there is any strong view in the House for it.  If there were certain persons to be selected to deal with a charge of that sort, so many might be elected by one House and so many by the other. This is one of a number of drafts dealing with this matter.  At one stage I had a proposal that the charge should be investigated by the Supreme Court, who would examine it and give a report to the House that was to <Col N="1137" /> pronounce final judgment as to whether the President was fit to hold office or not.  There was a good deal of procedure necessary to insert it in the Constitution and it seemed much more direct to leave the procedure to the House to be dealt with in the case of any special trial.</P>
      <P>If Deputies wish, I will have this matter examined again in the light of the discussion that has taken place in order to see if we can do any better, but I have no clear indication as to what the leaning is.  Apparently there is a dislike to the cumbrous machinery of impeachment.  There is a dislike even to the word &ldquo;impeachment&rdquo; itself.  There is the difficulty, on the other hand, about what class of case should be cognisable by whatever court is arranged for in this process. I do not know that we would be able to get solutions for this.  You will have the difficulty I have indicated, namely, that when you open the net to deal with all possible cases, you increase the danger of purely vexatious actions against the President.</P>

      <P>My information is that you cannot define it immediately and directly.  It is pretty elastic. Deputy Costello said he knew what a misdemeanour was, but he did not know what high crime was.  Perhaps one way to find out that information would be to investigate the circumstances in the United States, where the same terms are used, and one could see by examining the cases of impeachment what classes of cases had been regarded as high crimes and misdemeanours.</P>

I am not saying it would not be the better term to use here, but whatever term we use, it will be extremely difficulty to define it and to say whether a particular offence does come under that heading or not.  What you have to depend on in that case is that, in the first instance, the initiating body, either the Senate or the Dáil, by two-thirds majority, will decide that this particular case appears to be one for which the President ought to be impeached.  It goes forward then to the other House for trial, and they will also ask, &ldquo;Have we jurisdiction in this case?  Is this a case in which the trial should proceed?&rdquo; I take it the decision of these two Houses will determine whether a particular case comes under the definition or not, and you cannot do better.</P>

      <P>In this case, the only safeguard he has is that one House must, by a very substantial majority, decide that he should be impeached, that his conduct is such as to merit impeachment, and in the second House they have the chance of saying: &ldquo;This is not clearly under this Constitution at all,&rdquo; and then, finally, there will be the question of his guilt or otherwise. With regard to Deputy MacDermot's point, we might be able to widen the net.  &ldquo;Gross misconduct&rdquo; has been suggested, but I think, on the whole, this procedure is as good as any that can be devised.  By the way, in the case of some Bills I was putting through the question of the removal of a judge for stated misbehaviour was brought up here.  I wonder who is to define misbehaviour and what procedure would be followed if there was a case of that sort before <Col N="1140" /> the Dáil.  It would not, I take it, take the form of a trial such as should be provided for by proper procedure here, but if the case came up before us, the question to be decided is whether the conduct in any particular case was such as to be regarded by the Dáil as misbehaviour, and also by the other House, under the new Constitution.  I do not think you can define these things.  You have to leave them to be decided.</P>

      <P>I understand that Poland was brought up as an example of a comparable situation and I want to speak very briefly on that matter. It is impossible to talk here of the functions of the President, or of anything that may happen to him for disregard of the directions given to him in the discharge of those functions on the analogy of the Polish situation, because the situation here is that the President is going to be allowed to do certain things and nobody is to take responsibility for those actions.  In Poland, the situation is entirely distinct. In Poland there is the clear cut phrase that &ldquo;to be valid, every governmental act of the President must be signed by the President of the Council and the Minister within whose Department the matter lies,&rdquo; who thereby accept responsibility.  In Poland, you have that democratic point of view carried out, that whatever the President does, some Minister must stand for him.  It is only then, for something beyond that, that the Polish phrase comes in, and he is to be impeached for high treason, violation of the Constitution, or penal offences. It is not a mixed phrase such as the word &ldquo;misdemeanours&rdquo; which has certain attachments in the criminal law, and then, that word some way diverted by the probable carrying forward of the adjective &ldquo;high&rdquo; from the word to which it is particularly affixed. There is no comparison between the two matters.  If the President is put into the Constitution here for the future as, in every act he does, being under the control of the Government, in so far as they, by refusing a Minister's signature, can prevent him acting, and if a new position arises in which, every time he does act, some Minister signs for him and takes responsibility, <Col N="1141" /> there is a new situation, and it is the situation to be compared with the Polish situation, but that is not the situation, or anything like it, that has been put before us.</P>
      <P>The other matter on which there is likely to be conflict is Article 13, paragraph 8:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President shall not be answerable to either House of the Oireachtas for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his Office for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a clean getaway from any liability to the House and it is followed by special paragraph 3, which precludes any action at law or in equity, or other legal proceedings, civil or criminal, lying against the President during his term of office.  That was the Constitution as presented to us&mdash;a cast-iron situation, completely fortifying the position of the President. No action at any time could lie against him, and, in addition to that, there is this phrase that in regard to the exercise and performance of his duties or any purported exercise of them, he is not answerable to either House, and then, as a sort of weakening of that position, you have this peculiar phrase that he may, however, be impeached for treason.  It is only treason as defined in the Constitution, and not treason as defined in the Treasonable Offences Act or any extention of that word to be made by the law.  Following that you have the vague phrase, &ldquo;other high crimes or misdemeanours.&rdquo;  How that phrase is going to be interpreted, when that word is attached to it in the context of treason as defined in the narrow definition in the Constitution, and that word &ldquo;high&rdquo; in front of &ldquo;crimes,&rdquo; and probably these two words carried forward to the word &ldquo;misdemeanours,&rdquo; is a very doubtful situation, but let nobody think that they are getting a proper comparison when they bring in Poland because there is not the same situation.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The Bill is entitled an Act to amend and extend the Army Pensions Acts, 1923-1932.  It amends the previous Acts (1) by increasing the allowances <Col N="1143" /> payable to certain persons; (2) by altering the method of investigation in certain cases; (3) by changing the date of application for pensions, allowances or gratuities, and of the commencement of such pensions and allowances; (4) by clarifying certain sections.  In addition to amending previous Acts, it also extends their scope&mdash;(1) by extending the date by which disability due to disease must reach the required statutory minimum of 80 per cent.; (2) by providing for certain types of cases not covered by previous Acts, such as (a) cases where the disability due to disease is less than 80 per cent. but not less than 50 per cent.; (b) cases of disability due to aggravation; (c) cases of death or injury on service but not due to service; (d) by providing special allowances for dependents of persons who were members of organisations and were killed during or died as a result of service; (e) cases of accidental injury by members of organisations.</P>
      <P>The allowances of certain persons are increased by Sections 3 and 16 (b) of the Bill, and they relate to the dependents of those who either signed the 1916 Proclamation or were killed or executed during the Rising.  Under the Act of 1923 all persons killed during the Rising were treated as officers, and under that of 1927 the Signatories of the Proclamation were specifically dealt with, their dependents being given double the ordinary allowances. This Bill goes a stage further, and on the analogy of the Griffith Settlement Act, 1923, increases&mdash;(1) widows' allowances from £180 to £500 a year; (2) children's allowances from £80 to £200 a year until they reach the age of 25; (3) sisters' allowances from £52 to £100 a year during life.</P>
      <P>As regards the widows of those who were killed or executed in 1916, the allowance of £67 10s. per annum which may be awarded under the 1932 Act is increased to £90 a year; i.e., the amount payable to the widow of an officer under the Act of 1923.  The total cost of these amendments is estimated to be about £1,591 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second class of amendments deals with administrative procedure. Under Section 7 (3) of the 1927 Act, for instance, members of the forces <Col N="1144" /> applying for pensions in respect of wounds received after October 1st, 1924, cannot have their cases dealt with by the Army Pensions Board.  Experience has, however, shown that this is inadvisable and, accordingly, Section 4 of the Bill provides that all such cases will be referred to the board. Again, Section 13 of the Bill alters the nature of the certificate to be furnished by the Military Service Registration Board, because the section as at present framed throws too much onus as regards medical certification of disease on the board, composed as it is of men who are not medical experts.  The section also gives the Minister power to have a certificate reviewed because, as the 1932 Act stands at present, the certificate, being final and conclusive, is incapable of review even in cases where clearly a mistake has been made. In Section 46, the findings in certain respects of the Army Pensions Board are placed on the same level of finality as the findings of the Board of Assessors under the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924; and of the Referee under the Act of 1934.  The object of the section is to prevent vexatious appeals, and to give finality to the investigations and decisions of the board.  Power, however, is being taken to refer any genuine case back to the board for investigation.</P>
    <P>The third type of amendments deals with the dates for applying for pensions, and the dates from which pensions, if granted, will commence. Under the 1932 Act, for instance, a member of the forces had to apply for a pension in respect of a wound within 12 months after the date of being wounded or after the passing of the Act of 1932.  Many soldiers who have been injured on service have failed to apply within those dates and have, in consequence, been deprived of pensions. To rectify that, Section 7 of the Bill permits such men to apply either within 12 months from their discharge or within 12 months from the date of the passing of this amending Act whichever is the later.  It is estimated that this amendment will cost about £400 a year.  In like manner, Section 17 of the Bill extends the date of application for pensions, allowances and gratuities under the Act of 1932, and <Col N="1145" /> it is estimated that the total cost will be about £8,300 a year.</P>
    <P>The fourth type of amendment simply clarifies sections or expressions used in the previous Acts.  Under the previous Acts, for instance, certain grants of pension were regarded as final, but under the 1932 Act, a pensioner could, within ten years of the date on which a pension was granted to him, apply to have his case reopened on the grounds that his disability had meanwhile worsened.  If his claim succeeded, a revised pension would have been awarded, but such pension though temporary in effect, had legally to be regarded as final, and we were, therefore, prevented from affording medical treatment.  Sections 11 and 22 of the Bill remove this anomaly and make such pensions formally as well as materially temporary in their effects. The estimated cost, £414 a year, of this amendment will, we consider, be more than offset by decreases in pensions following on hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments extending the scope of previous Acts is simply to provide for cases of hardship not covered by existing legislation, and may be best illustrated by means of some typical examples.  A member of the Defence Forces or of the organisations mentioned in Part II of the Act of 1932 may have contracted a disease during his service and that disease may be directly attributable to such service, but if on examination by the Army Pensions Board, his disability is found to be less than the required minimum of 80 per cent., no award of pension can be made.  Now, in many cases of this nature, time does not lessen but increases the disability, and we are, therefore, extending the time limit by Sections 5, 6, 7 and 15 (2) of the Bill so as to enable such persons to be re-examined by the board and their disability reassessed.  The total cost of those amendments is estimated at £3,000 a year.</P>
    <P>The amendment just referred to will afford those grievously disabled by disease, due to service, an opportunity of qualifying for pensions already provided by the Acts of 1927 and 1932, but it will not deal with two other distinct types&mdash;those who have had or will have such pensions but whose disability <Col N="1146" /> has fallen or will fall below 80 per cent., and those whose disability has not reached or will not reach within the prescribed time the required statutory minimum of 80 per cent.  In the case of disease due to service we have decided to reduce the minimum required for disability pensions from 80 to 50 per cent., but we are also reducing considerably the rates of pension in such cases.  If a person has never reached 80 per cent. disablement, he will get, simply, a final pension at a flat rate of 15/- a week, provided that his disability is due to service and its degree is less than 80 per cent. and not less than 50 per cent.  If, however, a person has ever had a pension for a disability of 80 per cent. or over, and the disability becomes less than 80 per cent. but not less than 50 per cent. he will be given the option of taking a final pension of £1 a week or of doing without any pension on the chance that his disability on a subsequent re-examination may again reach 80 per cent. This extension of the Acts is estimated to cost about £15,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Another type is that of aggravation. A person may have a predisposition to a certain kind of disease, or he may have had some disease previous to service, which may have been excited, accelerated or aggravated by his military service.  The person as a result may be 100 per cent. disabled, and yet, as the previous Acts stand, he is not entitled to pension.  The purpose of Part VI of the Bill is to cover such cases by giving persons who qualify thereunder pensions at two-thirds of the rates applicable to persons whose disability is directly attributable to service.  The total cost of this amendment is estimated at about £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Another type not covered by previous Acts is that of a person who lost a leg, arm or eye during internment or imprisonment but whose loss cannot be attributed directly to his service; and there is the somewhat analogous type where a person dies while perhaps engaged with a column but whose death is not due to a disease attributable to service.  Provision is made under Section 15 and 17 of the Bill to cover all such cases, and the estimated cost is a recurring annual sum of £90 <Col N="1147" /> a year and a non-recurring amount of £100.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill deals with special allowances for the dependents of deceased members of the organisations and special gratuities by way of compensation to persons who were not members of the organisations covered by the Act of 1932.  As regards the first category, the Act of 1932 provides an allowance for certain relatives who were totally dependent on deceased persons at the time of death, or a gratuity for those who were partially dependent at the time of death.  The Act leaves untouched the problem of the same relatives who may have been in comfortable circumstances at the time of death, but who have since been reduced to very straitened circumstances. It is with such as these that the Bill deals, because it is felt that in view of their deceased relatives' contribution to the national cause, it is the duty of the State to give these dependents some special recognition. Hence it is proposed to give such dependents according to their means available from all sources an allowance not in any case to exceed 15/- a week. The annual cost of this provision is estimated at £2,800 a year.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides special gratuities by way of compensation for persons who were wounded or injured as the result of keeping arms belonging to, or being accidentally shot by a member of one of the organisations. Such a type of case was not covered in any way by the previous Acts, and the total cost is estimated at a non-recurring amount of £1,000.</P>
    <P>The total estimated cost of the amendments to previous Acts proposed by this Bill is an annual sum of £41,181 and a non-recurring amount of £8,400.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first observation that I have to make on this Bill is, that I think it is highly undesirable to be bringing in a multiplicity of Bills described as Army Pensions Bills, each Bill designed to deal with the fringe, and only the fringe, of Army pensions, and thereby giving the impression that there is a pensions scheme for the Army.  My first inclination, when I saw this fifth or sixth Pensions Bill, was to <Col N="1148" /> put down a motion to refer it back until such time as provision was made for pensions for the officers, N.C.O.'s and men of the Army.  I think it is nothing short of a grave public scandal that in the sixteenth or seventeenth year of this State, when the Government has apparently gone into the highways and the byways to try and find people to pension, that such a highly-important State service as the Army of the country should be still without any pension scheme for service. We know it is promised.  It has been promised for the best part of a decade. It is always &ldquo;next month,&rdquo; but the fact of the matter is that it is not there at the present moment.  I refer to that because when people hear of another Army Pensions Bill they may get the impression that the Army is over-pensioned.  Now, I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that when every other State service, and individuals outside of State services, are being provided for, their dependents looked after and their future safeguarded by one form of pension or another, that the serving personnel of the Army should be left unprovided for. The State, in all matters of employment, should be the example for all employers, but the example of the State in its relation to the Army in this respect is one which any of us would be thoroughly ashamed of if any employer in the country were to follow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to this particular Bill, I suggest that we should facilitate its passage in every possible way for the simple reason that we are all aware of the fact that there are a large number of cases of extreme hardship: that a number of very tragic cases have been left out, or ruled out, by date or for some other reason, from the Wound Pensions Act and from the previous Acts dealing with diseases due to service.  I do suggest to the Minister that there is a very big difference between opening the door to let in somebody who is entitled to shelter and taking the door off its hinges so as to let in a storm.  This particular Bill, which is intended to do the proper thing by deserving cases, is unquestionably going to invite, in addition to the deserving cases, possibly hundreds of <Col N="1149" /> thousands of applications of a bogus nature.  The language is rather loose, the dates are rather elastic and the phraseology in many, many respects unwise.  It would appear on the face of it as if the idea is to open the door very, very wide to applications, and then to find, when you go further into the Bill, to limit rather drastically the number of potential pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that the normal sequence of steps towards pensioning every form of disability arising out of service is, first to confine it to the words &ldquo;attributable to.&rdquo;  That was the phraseology heretofore. The next logical step to &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; is &ldquo;acquired on.&rdquo;  The step that all authorities agree is rather the big step and the doubtful one is the term &ldquo;aggravated by.&rdquo;  Now, here in this Bill we have jumped from &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; clean over &ldquo;acquired on,&rdquo; and arrived at the last step &ldquo;aggravated by.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to accept this much from me: that there is no term in the medical dictionary more generally abused, and around which it is more difficult to get agreement amongst any two medical examiners, than around that term &ldquo;aggravated by.&rdquo;  There is no standard. There is no scale.  It is purely a matter dependent, not on the condition of the patient, but on the condition of the doctor's liver on the day he examines the patient.  You will never get any two medical men, or rarely, to agree as to the extent that any disease is, or has been, aggravated by any set of circumstances over a long period.  Agreement could not possibly be procured on that.  I am well aware of the fact that it frequently crops up in British Pensions Acts, and I have reason to believe that, if either the legislators or the administrators or the medical examiners working under these particular Acts were doing the job over again, they certainly would avoid that particular term.  I think that that term &ldquo;aggravated by&rdquo; is a most unhappy term.  The term &ldquo;acquired on&rdquo; is a definite term.  It dates the origin of the disease or the wound, as far as the Army records or outside evidences go to show, and it would cover every <Col N="1150" /> case that the Minister is aiming at including in this particular Act, but it is a term that can be linked to a period or to a date, and it is a term that cannot be either interpreted too harshly, too rigidly, or abused by making it too elastic.</P>
    <P>Now, I was reading some of the particular phrases used in Part VI of the Bill.  Taking the case of wounds, we have three sub-divisions to that.  We have the case of a wound aggravated by a wound attributable to service. That is the first class.  Apparently, it refers to a wound which is aggravated by another wound, the other wound being attributable to service.  That is one class.  The next class is that of a wound aggravated by a disease which was attributable to service&mdash;any wound aggravated by any disease which was attributable to service.  The third class in that particular section is that of a wound aggravated by service. Surely, the third class includes the first and second classes.  I would take it, in any case, that a wound aggravated by service would include a wound aggravated by a wound attributable to service or a wound aggravated by a disease attributable to service, and that, if the paragraph merely read &ldquo;a wound attributable to service,&rdquo; it would cover the previous two classes.  If that interpretation is not a correct interpretation of the intentions of the promoters of the Bill, I certainly think that either the intentions are expressed very badly or that the particular form selected is, to say the least of it, rather laboured.</P>
    <P>We have the same differentiation when we are dealing with disease. We have the case of a disease aggravated by a wound attributable to service; then we have the case of a disease aggravated by a disease attributable to service; and the third class is that of a disease attributable to service.  When we come on to the question of disablement, we have quite a new choice of words.  We have the case of a disablement due to a disease which was accelerated or excited by a wound attributable to service, and we have a disablement due to a disease which was accelerated or excited by a disease <Col N="1151" /> attributable to service; and then we have the third class, of a disablement due to a disease which was accelerated or excited by service.  Again I think that No. 3 includes Nos. 1 and 2. It may not, but if it does not, some simpler choice of expressing the Minister's intentions might be found. My reason for saying that is that some of us had experience of previous Army Pensions Acts to deal with wounds and disabilities, and to a very great extent this Bill is justified mainly because of omissions from the other previous Acts&mdash;omissions by people not applying in time, omissions by people not understanding the previous Acts and not understanding the claims that they had under previous Acts.  This Bill is more difficult to comprehend and far more difficult to follow because it is an amendment of three other Acts, and seeing that the ordinary ex-Serviceman could not grasp much simpler Bills, I certainly cannot see any hope of his understanding what is intended in this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>In some respects, it is definitely beyond my understanding.  I can see a certain amount of point in what I have read out, but I cannot even guess at the intentions behind it. I do not know what type of case they are aiming at.  I take it that it would be simpler to say that, where a degree of disability has reached the required pensionable standard, whether due to a disease attributable to service or to a wound attributable to service, or both, the case will then be pensionable under this Bill; but this mixing of wounds and diseases and this mixing of different types of wound and different types of disease, in my opinion, will lead to nothing but confusion. I would suggest to the Minister and his advisors that, in the interests of genuine claimants, much greater steps than were taken heretofore should be taken with regard to adequate publicity.  Putting a poster in a post office or at a Civic Guard barracks is all right for most of us who live in towns and cities, but many soldiers come from remote and very backward places.  It is within the knowledge of the Department of <Col N="1152" /> Defence that many cases failed to apply under previous Acts until the statutory date had passed because they never knew that such an Act had been passed.  I do not presume to advise the Department as to what steps they should take for further and greater publicity, but it is within the knowledge of Departmental officers, both civil and military, how best to reach the ex-Army men living in a remote part of the country.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another matter in connection with this Act to which I should like to refer.  When dealing with disease in previous Acts, the degree of disability required in order to qualify for pension was 80 per cent. In this Act it is proposed to reduce this to 50 per cent.  When we are talking in terms of pension, we are talking in terms of permanent final pension, permanent disability, and we are using these terms in connection with disease, not wounds.  The degree of disability when dealing with disease is not just the easily defined and automatic business that it is when you are dealing with the degree of disability as a result of a wound.  The degree of disability arising from disease is again very much a matter of the particular type of doctor that assesses it and the particular mood in which he is on the date of assessment. The difference between the degree of 50 per cent. disability from disease and 80 per cent. degree of disability from disease is, in my opinion, nil. With a very rough standard dealing with disabilities due to disease, a common or garden standard, the rule would be that a man, though not bedridden, is unfit for work, is not able to work, is a &ldquo;crock&rdquo; and a chronic &ldquo;crock.&rdquo;  All such cases would be pensionable whether you make it a 50 per cent. degree or an 80 per cent. degree of disability to require a pension. In practice, every progressive disease that unfitted a person for normal work has been all the time classified as an 80 per cent. disability.  The Minister knows from the information at his disposal that even the earliest case of tuberculosis was always marked down as an 80 per cent. disability; in other words, in the opinion <Col N="1153" /> of the Board, it was a type of case that should be pensioned, a type of case in which the applicant was not going to get sufficiently well to resume a normal occupation.</P>
    <P>I am arguing this point, not in order to close the door on any genuine case, but because I think that the alteration from 80 per cent. to 50 per cent. in fact means nothing, that the genuine, deserving, disabled case is already pensionable, and that the reduction in the percentage to qualify for a pension will only have the effect of vastly increasing the number of new applicants.  I think that there is no worse mistake in administration than to invite applicants by the thousand, to raise hope in the hearts of unfortunate people, and then to issue out pensions in dozens.  With this altered phraseology you are going to get at least as many applicants as ever you had under the combined Acts of the past.  Through the reduction in the disability standard, you are going vastly to increase that number, and when all that is over and done with, we all know the limited and well-defined group of persons that you intend to reach and make pensionable by these amendments.  It is because I feel that is so that I think it is unwise, by phraseology, even with the best intentions in the world, to think that you are altering a thing which you are not altering by reducing the 80 per cent. to 50 per cent.  In practice, you will find that what I am saying is correct, that the man who was more than 50 per cent. disabled as a result of disease was, in fact, graded 80 per cent. and got his pension.</P>
    <P>There is one matter further to which I should like to call the Minister's attention before I get away from this aspect of the matter.  If there was any fault to be found with previous Pensions Bills in respect to wounds or other disabilities, it was in the rigid interpretation of words and phrases. I had the ordinary vocabulary knowledge of the meaning of the words &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; but my experience, when I had something to do with the administration of previous Pensions Acts, was that I found that I had not even begun to learn the meaning of <Col N="1154" /> the words &ldquo;attributable to.&rdquo;&ldquo;Attributable to&rdquo; means one thing to the man in the street; it means quite another thing to the officer in the Department.  It was the over-rigid interpretation of terms like that that ruined moderately good pieces of legislation and it was the insistence on the narrowest interpretation, rather than on the freest and broadest, that was responsible for very many grave injustices to deserving applicants. That is really more a Departmental matter than a legislative matter, but I am very strongly of the opinion that in all these Bills there is a very definite want for such an appointment as is known elsewhere as the &ldquo;soldiers' friend&rdquo;&mdash;somebody who will speak for and act for the applicant and fight his case.  The applicant is there, perhaps semi-illiterate.  The whole weight of officialdom is there on the side of the taxpayer.  In any argument that can be used or any interpretation given&mdash;unintentionally, if you like, but it is the custom&mdash;the hop of the ball is always against the applicant.  That was recognised long ago in other countries and there was some person conversant with the conditions of this type of legislation whose particular office and business it was to act as the applicant's spokesman and advocate in every case when it came up for hearing.</P>
    <P>There is one thing further to that. In a common way we are dealing with a multiplicity of organisations.  Only one of that multiplicity of organisations has definite records available to the Department of Defence, the Department of Finance and everybody else dealing with the administration of pensions.  The state of health of the man who has passed through the regular Army on the date of entry is on record.  His state of health from month to month is on record.  He cannot get away with a bit of a wangle.  The circumstances under which he met with that knock or blow, that wound or injury, whether on or off duty, are there in black and white.  As compared with the others the dice is definitely loaded all the time against the man who served in the Army and became disabled during his Army service or as a result of his Army service. <Col N="1155" /> We are all familiar with the interpretations which were put on those words, &ldquo;on duty.&rdquo;  It is because of that that I made the suggestion earlier that the wisest term and the fairest term would be &ldquo;acquired on service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have one other point to make, and it is by way of a request.  We have in Part II of this Bill a proposal to give pensions to the dependents of the people called &ldquo;signatories.&rdquo;  I do not think there is a single member of this House, irrespective of his political alignment either at the present moment or in the past, who is not going to welcome the proposals there. I do not think there is one, no matter how strongly he may have opposed the action taken by those signatories at the time, who is not going to support this proposal in order to pay his tribute of respect to very brave men who were prompted by patriotic urgings.  The signing of that Proclamation was the beginning of a phase of war.  The ending of that particular phase of war witnessed the signing of another document&mdash;the Articles of Association.  Many people in this House disagreed also with the action of the men who signed the Articles of Association, commonly called the Treaty, but they were both milestones on a road.  Just as I say that those who opposed, politically and otherwise, the action of signing the Proclamation of 1916, would gladly subscribe to the proposals made here as a tribute to men who did their duty irrespective of risk, now I would suggest to the Minister that he might do the same for the dependents of those who signed the Treaty, committing himself in no way to an endorsement of the act, but merely to reciprocate what is being done with regard to others.  Clearly it would be within the scope of the Bill.  The term &ldquo;signatory&rdquo; is defined here in this section in the following terms: &ldquo;In this section the word &lsquo;Signatory&rsquo; means a person who signed the Proclamation published on Easter Monday, 1916.&rdquo;  If a few words were added to that, &ldquo;and those who signed on behalf of Ireland the Articles of Association on such and such a date,&rdquo; it would meet both sides.  I think it would do a lot as a <Col N="1156" /> contributory factor to burying the hatchet.  It would be committing the Government to no extent as approving the action taken by those men. We can all hold our views with regard to that, but it would be at least a recognition of the fact that, whatever they did, right or wrong, they did it stimulated and urged by a high sense of patriotic duty.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Dr. O'Higgins giving us the medical mind.  It is the first time, I think, that I ever heard the medical mind so fairly and squarely put before this House, as far as their methods of assessing and adjudicating on pensions are concerned.  I should like to raise an appeal here in this House in support of some of his remarks.  It has been my experience in another direction&mdash;on a very large scale in another direction&mdash;and on this whole question of pensions and appeals&mdash; that with all the regulations, subsections, references back, and new clauses in long lines, marshalled in paragraphs, the ordinary ex-soldier has no hope whatever of being able to present his case in such a way as to give him any decent chance of success. The soldiers' friend and the officers' friend was one of the great means that the British ex-service men had of penetrating the armour-plated barrier with which the Ministry of Pensions had surrounded itself.  Over and over again claims met with success due to the soldiers' friend taking up the cases and going into them, warning the applicant of the pitfalls, telling him that if he claims there he fails, if he comes here he has a chance of success, or if he goes there he succeeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Postmaster-General in the British service was one of the greatest friends the British ex-servicemen had in the British House of Parliament. By his incessant questions in the House he ultimately became so popular with the British ex-servicemen that he was appointed Minister of Pensions.  All the British ex-servicemen thought that now at last, with a friend there as Minister, they were going to stand a chance of great success.  What happened?  When he went into office he found that the whole place was so closed up in red <Col N="1157" /> tape and regulations that he could make very little effort indeed to alleviate matters for the numbers who are waiting for a fair and square chance.  The result was that he more or less fell into unpopularity rapidly.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has made one remark with which I do not agree, and that is that the words &ldquo;aggravated by&rdquo; should be taken out.  If there was ever a loophole or an opportunity for success for a man in respect of his claim after it has been defeated it is those words &ldquo;aggravated by.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; or &ldquo;acquired on&rdquo; can always be used to the detriment of an ex-serviceman if the doctor has a bad liver.  The words &ldquo;aggravated by&rdquo; give him a chance. I am sorry to disagree with my colleague and friend Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, when I say that the words &ldquo;aggravated by&rdquo; ought to be kept in. I am sure that, through those words, many ex-servicemen can succeed in getting some form of pension.</P>

      <P>I have only a few minutes in which to wind up this debate.  I just want to say that I believe we know the extent of the problem with which we have to deal.  We had a big number of applicants under previous Acts, and because it was stated in these Acts that no one could get pensions unless the disease was attributable to service, I do not believe that stopped any one from applying.  Because it was stated in these Acts that a man must have 80 per cent. disability before getting a pension for disease, I do not believe that stopped any one from applying for a pension for disease attributable to service.  I had a very thorough investigation made in the Department as to the cost of the Bill and the estimate I gave, £40,000, is the limit.  The figures we got for &ldquo;aggravation&rdquo; show that that would cost £10,000 a year.  The fact of the matter is that the applicant has not alone one friend but two friends on the Board.  Whether or not a man suffered from disease or whether it was due to service is not assessed by permanent civil servants. First of all you have the Registration Board consisting of three men who had active service.  Then you have the <Col N="1158" /> Army Pensions Board consisting of an Army doctor, an outside doctor who had service, and an outside chairman who had active service.  They administer the Act as fairly as possible to the applicants.  They do not approach the applicants as enemies going to rob them.  They view applicants as deserving soldiers entitled to anything that the Act can give them.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the Acts of 1923, 1927 and 1932 contained a couple of words that prevented the board giving, what I considered to be, the applicants' rights.  You had it that disease must be attributable to service, and that, in the strict interpretation put upon it by the legal advisers, meant that if it could be said that the disease was not wholly due to service it was not attributable to service.  To give an instance of what I mean by aggravation, and the cases that would be covered by that, you have cases of T.B.  If it came out in cases of T.B. that a man had at some time or other before service pleurisy or some complaint like that, on the legal interpretation we could not give that man a pension, even though he had served all the time, and was now 100 per cent. disabled, because no medical man could say, seeing that he had pleurisy beforehand, that the disease was due solely to service.  It could not be said that it would not have arisen if he had not had service.  In the same way there are cases of men 100 per cent. disabled owing to heart disease.  A man who served four or five years and went through hardship, but had scarletina or some disease like that which affected his heart before service, even though in a normal way it might not have developed so rapidly or be in such a dangerous state, as he had heart disease before, it could not therefore be held to be attributable to service, although it was gravely aggravated by it.  Under the present Bill we will be able to deal with cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you have mental cases.  If there is any history of insanity, even in a grandmother, or in any part of the family, you cannot hold that a mental case is solely attributable to service. It may have been grievously aggravated by service.  We all know that many men who suffered severe hardship <Col N="1159" /> developed mental disease owing to war conditions, when they would not have done so at their normal occupations. There again this Bill will help us to deal with that type of case.  On the Committee Stage we will go into some of the points raised by Deputy O'Higgins.  There is a difference between wounds and disease, and there is also the question of aggravation to be dealt with.  In the Acts there is a difference between &ldquo;wound&rdquo; and &ldquo;disease&rdquo;.  A wound is pensionable from 20 per cent. upwards, but disease only from 80 per cent. upwards.  I want to deal with the point that this Bill is going to create a storm around the word &ldquo;aggravation&rdquo;.  I do not think that is so.  We know the number of claims, and we have all the forms and assessments of the doctors as to the state of disability due to disease.  In regard to aggravation, a man must have reached 80 per cent. disablement before he can get a pension at two-thirds of the normal rate. It is only in the case of disease solely due to service that we go as low as 50 per cent. for pensions.  Between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent. we get 15/-or £1 a week.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Higgins knows, there are some very hard cases, because when a man falls below 80 per cent. disablement for disease due to service he is cut off.  A number of hard cases occurred of men who took care of themselves and fell below 80 per cent., where we must cut off the pensions.  In this Bill we are providing that men who take care of themselves, and who are once assessed at 80 per cent., that we will follow them and give them a £1 a week for life, and have nothing more to do, even if their disability goes up, or we give them the option of going back on the 80 per cent.  I think most of the men who will fall below 80 per cent. will take £1 a week to enable them to buy medicine and to keep below the 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is not directly framed with regard to service pensions, it does in fact do away with some hardships from which the serving personnel has suffered under previous Acts.  The ordinary Service Pensions Bill, like Police Pensions Acts is in draft, and I <Col N="1160" /> am hoping to get it any day.  This Bill does away with several hardships of a smaller type that the Army at present serving suffers from, from the point of view of wounds and disability.  They are of a minor character but, on the whole, I can say this, that we are hoping that the Bill will do away with what I feel are legitimate grievances of men who have given service to the nation.  It will not do away with all hardships, but it will relieve the greatest of them.  No matter what we do, and no matter how we extend the scope of this legislation, there will still be people outside.  I do not believe it would be possible to deal with the suggestion of Deputy O'Higgins as to the signatories to the Articles of Association.  As this Bill is framed the widows and dependents dealt with in it are the widows and dependents of men who died actually on service or from disease arising out of service.  I do not think the Deputy's point could be covered.  As I say, no matter how far we extend Bills of this nature, there will still be something left to be dealt with and to be met by other means.  I am hoping that the Bill will have the effect it is intended to have, and that is, to relieve a lot of what I consider are legitimate grievances.</P>

      <P>The point we were at when this debate was adjourned was, whether or not the particular method of dealing with a President, whom it is desirable to remove, as laid down in the Draft could be improved.  I suggested that the Dáil, as such, would not, in my opinion, be a good court to <Col N="1161" /> try a matter of fact.  I was suggesting that, while I thought the Oireachtas a perfectly proper body to initiate a proceeding of this kind, and one which would be very definitely concerned in the public conduct and suitability of the President, and have a very definite duty in the supervision of and making effective any assurance that that conduct would be right and proper, I did not think they were themselves the body actually to try him.  I was suggesting that we might, by leaving out the word &ldquo;impeached&rdquo;, make sub-section (1) of Section 10 of Article 12 read: &ldquo;The President may be charged at the instance of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Seanad or Dáil for treason as defined in this Constitution, or for other misconduct unfitting him for his office&rdquo;, and that then it should go on to say that the question of fact shall be decided by a court acting for the Oireachtas set up hereunder, whose decision shall be accepted as the decision of the Oireachtas.  I can quite see that the Oireachtas itself might desire to keep it within its own control and to take full responsibility for any action taken in relation to that officer; but it might very well hand over the trial to some body, set up under the Constitution, which could not obviously be set up <i>ad hoc,</i> which would not be influenced in any way by the personality of the man himself, or the particular circumstances&mdash;some particular body which would exist before the offence for trial and which would exist after the offence for trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point which has been raised with which I should like to deal and that is the question suggested that any form of trial here, whether you call it impeachment or otherwise, is equivalent to a criminal trial in the ordinary sense of the term. I expressed disagreement with that view on the Second Reading and I think that that disagreement has been endorsed by Deputy Lavery, when he states that the only specific sanction and the only sanction which is contemplated in this clause is deprivation of office.  It seems to me to be equivalent to a case in any local authority or civil service or anything of that <Col N="1162" /> kind where a man might be dismissed from the service for an offence without any relation whatever to what action would be taken afterwards by a court. That is borne out by the actual wording of sub-section (3), clause 8, of Article 13 which says: &ldquo;No action at law or in equity or other legal proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against the President during his term of office&rdquo;.  That, I think, makes it perfectly clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is going to be an equivalent put in to cover a difficulty of that kind.  At any rate, we are dealing with the Constitution for the moment as it stood.  The Constitution did, so far as I can see, if you read these two clauses together, contemplate that, for certain action which rendered a man unfit to be President, the only sanction of the only court which would try him was to declare him unfit and to remove him from his office; while, at the same time, they did contemplate that his immunity for any act, criminal or otherwise, which he committed would only exist during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the previous point, I should like to see some method of trial of the matter of fact in relation to the criminality or otherwise of any act of the President other than what would really amount to a vote of this House.  The only case that I remember in this House&mdash;it is almost a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&mdash;in which the House was asked to decide upon a matter of fact, was when they were asked to decide, as a matter of fact, which of the two Jim Larkins Junior was the Jim Larkin Junior who was elected.  If the House will go back in recollection to the actual circumstances of that case, how we came to try it and how the judges voted when they came to decide the question of fact, they may think that in the only case in which we have acted as a court in relation to a fact we did not show any very marked impartiality. It is because I think that, of its own nature, an Assembly of this kind is not the best way to try a matter of <Col N="1163" /> fact, that I should like to have it in some other hands.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is, as the President pointed out, that lots of other people have been up against this problem, and they have, in fact, used the particular machinery set down here.  I think that the President might well consider in the interval whether or not, while leaving the initiation of the proceedings and responsibility for the charge upon the Dáil&mdash;where, I think, it ought to rest&mdash;he would leave the decision as to the question of fact, as to whether that charge was proved or not, to some tribunal which would not be influenced by the influences which normally influence us here.  That decision would then be accepted by the Oireachtas as their decision.  That arrangement might possibly be better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are making any further progress now. There is a good deal of common ground which I probably could meet on the Report Stage.  I think I have already indicated that the difficulty of the Dáil under the Constitution investigating the charge was present to my mind at an early stage.  I remember that the Draft contained a provision <Col N="1164" /> like this, that when a matter came before the Dáil they would cause it to be investigated by the High Court, which would furnish a report to the Dáil, and the Dáil would then decide. In other words, I think it would be wrong for Parliament to take away from its own hands the pronouncement of judgment.  That should be a duty for the Dáil itself.  Perhaps with the leave of the House we could postpone this to see whether we could get something that might get better acceptance on the next stage than we have here.  There is the question of the word &ldquo;investigate.&rdquo;  That is to say whether the Dáil itself would have to sit as a court in full session or whether &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; would not mean causing it to be investigated and get the court to pronounce judgment. It is possible that that interpretation of the word would be regarded as straining the language a bit too much.  However, it is better to pass from it now and see whether we could do better on the Report Stage.</P>

    <P>In Section 1, sub-section 2º, line 1, and in sub-section 3º, line 1, to <Col N="1169" /> delete the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;Prime Minister,&rdquo; and to make consequential amendments throughout the Bunreacht.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is merely to provide that in the English version, not in the Irish version, of this Constitution we should have the words &ldquo;Prime Minister&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;Taoiseach.&rdquo;  It seems to me to be mere make-believe to try to incorporate a word like &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; in the English language.  It would be pronounced wrongly by 99 per cent. of the people.  I have already ascertained it is a very difficult word to pronounce correctly.  That being so, even for the sake of the dignity of the Irish language, it would be more sensible that when speaking English we should be allowed to refer to the gentleman in question as the &ldquo;Prime Minister.&rdquo;</P>

It is just one more example of the sort of things that are being done here as if for the purpose <Col N="1170" /> of putting off the people in the North.

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that Section 12 of Article 28 sets out:</P>
      <P>The following matters shall be regulated in accordance with law, namely, the organisation of and distribution of business amongst Departments of State, the designation of members of the Government to be the Ministers in charge of the said Departments...</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction is this: a member of the Government has more or less two functions, one being that of an administrator of a Department of State and the other as a member of the Government to give his views and to assist in decisions which have to be come to by the Government as a collective body. <Col N="1171" /> There are two different functions, and the chief and main one, in my opinion, is that of deciding, of being a part of the body that is the Executive and deciding questions of public policy or general questions of administration. It is not necessary that we should have an Act which would provide that each member of the Government should have a Department of State to administer.  You might have, as was suggested, Ministers without portfolio. That is quite possible and we are not here determining that question. That is to be settled by law and I think it is wise that it should be settled by law.  We distinguish between two functions of a member of the Government, one as part of the body called the Government which is collectively responsible to the Dáil for decisions, and the other as an administrator, at the same time.  We are not settling here that question.  It is left to law to determine how the Departments of State shall be distributed amongst the members of the Government. I think the distinction is a useful one and ought to be preserved.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy should act in debate as other Deputies have acted.  We will not be able to carry on if there is to be question and answer across the floor, and if an <Col N="1172" /> answer is to be given before I have finished half a sentence.  I make this point, that the distinction between members of the Government as members of the Government and members of the Government as administrators is useful, and that there is no harm in preserving it, and it is being preserved uniformly here.  If any situation arose in which it was considered advisable to do so, we can have an Act in which you would have the Departments which have to be administered divided in such a way that it would be possible to have some of the Ministers without the administration of a Department at all.  I see nothing lost by having that term &ldquo;members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation is that notwithstanding the fact that so many years' experience has never thrown up a case in which this phrase would have proved useful, the President wants to meet all the possibilities the future may throw up.  Notwithstanding that argument, vague and unsubstantial as it is, he could still meet it by keeping the word &ldquo;Ministers.&rdquo; There is no logic or reason in what he has said.</P>

      <P>I move amendments Nos. 32 and 33, which, I think, may be taken together.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>32. In Section 1, sub-section 3º, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;resignation&rdquo; line 2 to the end of the sub-section, and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;of the Government or of any Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>33. At the end of Section 1 to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The President shall on the advice of the Government terminate the appointment of any Minister.</P>
      <P>I propose in these amendments to have a division along the following lines. Sub-section (3) reads at the moment</P>
      <P>The President shall, on the advice of the Taoiseach, accept the resignation or terminate the appointment of any member of the Government.</P>
      <P>That means that the Taoiseach has it in his power to get the President either to accept the resignation, which is a proper matter, or to terminate the appointment of a single member of the Government.  I want to break that up in the following way: to have sub-section (3) read:</P>
      <P>The President shall, on the advice of the Taoiseach, accept the resignation of the Government or of any Minister</P>
      <P>or, as we have it now, of any member. Then, I want an additional sub-section put in:</P>
      <P>The President shall, on the advice of the Government, terminate the appointment of any Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not want to have a situation in which the Prime Minister, acting by himself and without the authority of the Government or assuming to have the majority of the Government, can get the appointment of a Minister brought to an end.  The Taoiseach ought to be able to go to the President and say: &ldquo;Accept the resignation of the whole Government, which I offer to you, or accept the resignation of a member of it&rdquo; but, when it comes to terminating an appointment, that ought to be done on the advice of the Government and not on the advice of a single individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1174" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, let us consider our whole procedure.  When a new Dáil meets, a President is elected who is given the privilege of nominating the other members of the Government. That is the existing practice and that is the practice which is being provided for in the Constitution.  It is true that, before appointment, the Government, as a whole, has to be accepted by the Dáil and that it is only when that is done that the appointments of the individual Ministers are made.  The whole theory behind that practice, I take it, is that the Dáil puts on one of its members definite responsibility for selecting a team.  With that team, he is responsible for the whole conduct of the Government.  We have been trying to meet all sorts of possibilities on this Draft.  Nobody is going to deny that it might happen that a member of the Government would either make Government work impossible&mdash;make it impossible for the Government to work as a team and be jointly responsible&mdash;or that it might happen that, for one reason or another, it would be advisable generally to change the team&mdash;perhaps by a single member.  Suppose such a case arose at present, what means have you of dealing with it?  The Government, as a whole, has to come before the Dáil and resign.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that the person elected Taoiseach would again be elected Taoiseach by the Dáil.  If the Dáil does not like him immediately after a situation like this occurring, they can very easily get rid of him. Nobody can suggest that such a thing as a forced resignation or the determination of the appointment of a member of the Government is a thing that could be done without people hearing about it.  A new member of the Government would have to be appointed in his place.  The Taoiseach would have to come before the Dáil and make his new proposals and the whole question would come up for discussion. It is not a thing that could be done in the dark for which there would be no redress.  At the present time, how can you deal with such a situation?  The whole Government resigns and one person only may be responsible for that resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> I think that that is cumbersome and wrong procedure for doing a thing for which there is a direct method.  If there were a situation in which the person responsible, in the first instance, for nomination found that one of the persons whom he had nominated made Government work impossible, he should be able to say to that Minister: &ldquo;Very well, we are not able to get along here as a team. It is clearly right that, holding the views you do, you should resign.&rdquo; That suggestion might or might not be accepted, but I think there ought to be a simple way of dealing with the matter instead of the cumbersome method obtaining at the present time by which the President would have to come to the Dáil with the resignation of the whole Government because one individual was working quite contrary to the policy regarded as the right policy by the rest of his colleagues. To my thinking, this Article provides simple, straight machinery for doing something which can be done at the present time only in a roundabout manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of order, I suggest that the amendment and the section have to go together. I am talking about the method of procedure.  With regard to the point as to the &ldquo;advice of the Government,&rdquo; the Government has collective authority.  Is it suggested that this question is to be decided by a majority?  Was it the practice, when members of the opposite side were in office, to have questions decided by a majority of the Executive Council? If so, I think it was a bad practice. Are we to have procedure like that of <Col N="1176" /> the League of Nations?  Shall we have the opinion of all the members except the members affected?  Are we to have majority rule or else the decision taken by other members of the Government?  It seems to me that that is altogether wrong and that the right procedure is to hold the person who has made these nominations responsible to the Dáil for having a team that will work harmoniously together.  If a situation arises in which that cannot be secured, if one member is making common action impossible, then he should be asked to resign and, if he does not resign, his office should, on the advice of the Taoiseach, be terminated.  That is not a thing that will be done in the dark. It is obvious that it is a thing that will come before the Dáil immediately for discussion and, if the action of the Taoiseach should appear to the Dáil to be high-handed, there is no doubt they will deal with the matter.  I hold that the procedure in the text is better than the procedure suggested in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the President objects to this amendment because it is, to his mind, inconceivable that other members of the Government should decide matters. He referred to decisions not being made by the majority of the Government, and he referred, then, to &ldquo;other members&rdquo; deciding.  The &ldquo;other members&rdquo; are the ordinary members of the Government.  I take it that he referred to a hypothetical experience in the case of our Government.  I gathered from the President's statement that only one member of the present Government decides.  Now, that does not seem to me to be a solid argument against this amendment, and still it is the only argument, you will admit, Sir, that has been put forward by the President.</P>

I gather that the procedure at present is that there is only one man that counts in the Government. <Col N="1177" /> That is an interesting sidelight on the President's conception of governmental solidarity.  I do seriously make the suggestion that if there is a majority of the Government against the dismissal of a member, it is proper that the whole Government should resign and not merely the majority. If there is a majority of the Government for the dismissal of a member, and I presume it is possible that a difference of opinion may be allowed in the Government.  It is the normal thing in most Governments but apparently it is not allowed in the present Government, judging by experience, and here I am relying on the arguments put forward by the President. The idea of a difference of opinion is not tolerated there.  The fact that a difference of opinion should go by an expression of opinion by each individual member is looked upon as something absurd and not to be thought of. That is all the more reason for pressing this particular amendment, because if that is the practice that obtains in the present Government it should not be perpetuated in the future.</P>

      <P>One of the outstanding points that struck me about this Draft Constitution, when I read it for the first time, was the very humiliating position in which the Government to be set up under the Constitution appeared.  It was given, as far as I could see, a position completely in the background.  A further reading of the Draft has confirmed the first impression that I got from this Constitution. I stated last night that our theory of the government of this country was based upon a responsible Government, a Parliament elected by the people, which would in turn elect a Government responsible to that Parliament, and, as a necessary corollary of that particular type of policy, that there should be collective responsibility in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Draft Constitution purports in one of its clauses to retain the idea of collective responsibility, but the particular section of the Constitution that we are dealing with now, in my very clear view, goes very far indeed to cut away from this new Constitution the idea of collective responsibility.  We <Col N="1178" /> have the provision in Article 13, Section 1, as it stands at the moment, making the Prime Minister the dominant personality in the Cabinet.  We have the Government referred to as &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; and the members of it referred to as &ldquo;members of the Government.&rdquo;  In only one part of this Draft Constitution is the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; mentioned&mdash;that is, in Article 28. The members are not even referred to throughout the Draft Constitution as Ministers.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that a distinction was drawn between the members of the Government and the Prime Minister, but whether that be so or not, whether this is unintentional and that I am reading into it something that is not intended to be there, the position under Article 13, Section 1, clearly contemplates that the Prime Minister is to be the dominant factor in the new Government. If that is so, then there is an end to the theory of collective responsibility of the Government.  My idea of the collective responsibility of the Government is perfectly clear and perfectly simple.  A problem comes up for discussion and solution before the Government.  Each member of the Government may have his own views on that particular problem, and each member of the Government, if he is any use in his job, ought to have his own ideas on each particular problem that comes up for discussion and solution. No hope of a proper decision being arrived at can be entertained unless every member of the Government pools his knowledge, experience and views so that a proper decision on the problem may be arrived at.  Each member of the Government then, having given his views, having, if necessary, if he feels them so strongly, fought for his views in the Cabinet, and having done his very best to put his own particular views across his colleagues, some point must be arrived at where a decision has to be come to.  Each member of the Cabinet having put his views clearly and, I hope, very strongly in fighting for his convictions, <Col N="1179" /> then, if necessary, by a majority vote of the Cabinet, which is good enough for a country, a decision must be arrived at and is arrived at, and when arrived at it is the decision of each and every member of that Cabinet.  When they come to fight for their decision, or to implement it, either in the Dáil or in the country, each member of that Government pleads for it, he fights for it and he advocates it irrespective of his own particular views before the decision was come to.  He abides by the decision of the majority of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>That, to my mind, is the idea of collective responsibility.  In practice it is the best type of Cabinet Government that you could possibly have. But the type of Cabinet Government that we have in this Draft Constitution is a Cabinet of one man, the Prime Minister.  He is called the Prime Minister, and the others are members of the Government who may be dismissed at his will and pleasure.  If he is, as he necessarily must be&mdash;to repeat what I said a moment ago&mdash;a man of dominant personality, put in that position and with the power that is given to him, it will enable him to impose upon his colleagues, irrespective of their own particular views or convictions&mdash;even against their convictions&mdash;his own particular wishes and views.  Now I think that is not in the public interest.  We stand strongly for the pre-eminent position that the Government has in the Constitution at the present time.  The Executive Council are the real rulers of this State at the present moment, and they are collectively responsible to this Dáil. They have their own discussions in private, but when these discussions end and a decision is taken they all come here to this House and the country and act as one unit, responsible for the one decision and endeavouring to have the one decision put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in my view, is a very fundamental principle in this Draft Constitution. It links up with the other provisions in Article 12, dealing with the President.  As I said on the Second Reading of this measure, there is contemplated in this Draft Constitution a <Col N="1180" /> system of government which ultimately resolves itself into government by two men.  That, in itself, is a bad thing, and the consequences may be worse. We must look at this Constitution operating in different circumstances from what they are at the present moment.  I think it would be invidious to test this provision in reference to any particular individual, whether on this side of the House or on the other side of the House or on the Labour Benches.  We must look at it calmly and in circumstances that perhaps we cannot conceive at the moment, having regard to our own particular lines of policy and our own particular cleavages.  But I do say that this Draft Constitution, providing for a President with very wide discretionary powers, and alongside that man another man of equally powerful personality, deriving his authority from the same source&mdash; the votes of the people&mdash;and being in a position to dictate his views and to override the wishes of his colleagues in the Cabinet by virtue of the threat that is contained in the power proposed to be conferred upon him in this particular provision, is a bad system fundamentally, and one that certainly cannot commend itself to me in any circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Government is a team.  On the President, who originally was responsible&mdash;that <Col N="1181" /> is, the head of the Government, Prime Minister, Taoiseach, call him what you like&mdash;on him was placed the responsibility, in the first instance, for getting that unity of thought and ability that would enable the Government to last as a team.  Now, what happens in a good team?  Let us imagine a Government considering a serious question&mdash;a proposition, let us say, of considerable importance, which may have come from one of the members of the Government, as the administrator of a Department, or coming from him as a member of the Government with a view to general policy.  Let us take that case.  The matter is considered, and every member of the Government will express his views on it as strongly as Deputy Costello suggests.  Then, finally, there is the question of a decision.  Is somebody going to tell me that if we had, on a very important matter, a division, say, of six to five&mdash;that the matter was such that there were strong views expressed by the five and strong convictions held by the five&mdash;is anybody going to tell me that, in a case like that, it would be wise to proceed with the proposal?  Not at all.  What happens in these cases is that the matter would generally be postponed if there was any reluctance on the part of the members, who held strong views, to accept what seemed to be the views of the majority, and it would be foolish in a case like that to strain what I might call the loyalty of the five members to the team policy as a whole by pressing for a decision with a majority of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is done in such a case is that it would be said: &ldquo;Very well, we do not seem to be of one mind in this matter, so we had better postpone a decision on this until we can get some greater degree of unanimity&rdquo;; and if the matter were urgent, the President, or the Taoiseach, Prime Minister, or whatever he is, would have to see some of his colleagues, individually, perhaps, and to reason with them, and try to impress upon them, if he were himself one of the majority, the need for acting in a certain way.  The decision would not ordinarily be arrived at until there was substantial unanimity achieved.  I <Col N="1182" /> hold that that is the best practice, and I hold that it is the practice that any Government would follow.  I have heard, of course, of the case where somebody said: &ldquo;I am in a minority of one, but the minority have it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it may or it may not be actually true, but I have heard of it.  The point is this: that if there was a position which the Prime Minister held very strongly, even in opposition to his colleagues, and the situation was that he had to accept, completely and absolutely, something with which he differed strongly enough, he would have to resigned.  He could not carry on, because it would mean that he was being forced into a policy which he felt was altogether against his judgment.  The same line is open to any member of the Government.  No person is bound to remain a member of the Government.  If there is a position in which any member of the Government holds very strongly against any combined action that is suggested, he has a way out; but I think there ought to be a way out also to enable the team to work, and if it should happen that one member, or even one or two members, for instance, were completely holding up the work of the Government and taking up the position that they would not agree, and if as a result it was found to be impossible to work with them and carry on as a team, then the situation, clearly, should be changed.  At present, it would be changed by the President&mdash;the head of the Government&mdash;coming to the Dáil and the Government, as a whole, resigning, although it was due, let us say, to the particular attitude that a single member was taking up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that is wrong.  I think it ought to be possible to say to that member: &ldquo;Obviously, you are not working with us as a team; you do not think the same as we do, and <Col N="1183" /> you are holding up our work, and we think you ought to resign.&rdquo;  Then, if he does not resign, it ought to be possible for the man who is responsible in the first instance for nominating him as a member of the team, to go to the President and ask that his appointment be terminated.  As I say, that cannot be done in the dark, because the head of the Government would have to come to the Dáil and explain the situation.  Questions would be asked as to why the resignation took place or why the appointment was terminated, and he would also have to face the Dáil on the question of a new appointment.  So that it seems to me that, in this Constitution here, you have a simple way by which the thing should be done, and I think the responsibility should be placed definitely on the person and that he should take full responsibility for the person on whose shoulders originally was placed the responsibility of nominating the team.</P>

      <P>Speech No. 2, delivered by the President, was very typical.  Speech No. 1 was very clear and definite.  Speech No. 1 let us completely understand the President's idea of the relative merits of the President of the Executive Council and of the other members of the Executive Council.  The general tone was that the final decision was the President's; you had everything vesting in the President&mdash;the other members of the Executive Council of no importance of any kind, and the President deciding everything.  Anything like majority opinion being considered in the Executive Council made the President, in the course of his first speech, almost hold up his hands in horror.  Then we had what is very typical of the President&mdash; speech No. 2, very long and very verbose, and, to such poor intelligence as I possess, completely and entirely obscure.  Now, I think the President might put his mind to considering the amendment before the House.  The President does not like it.  The President wants complete power to be in the hands of the Prime Minister.  He is to dismiss and reappoint any Minister he likes&mdash;when I say &ldquo;reappoint&rdquo; I mean to appoint somebody in place of the Minister whom he dismisses. That is not to be in the hands of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the President on this amendment, as the attitude of the President throughout the entire discussion we have had on this Constitution, shows that he is a man who, in his heart and soul, is wedded to dictatorship. His idea is that inside the Executive Council you are to have a dictator and though every other member of the Executive Council may think differently from the President of the Executive Council, the President of <Col N="1185" /> the Executive Council is to be the person that counts and the others have got to do what they are told.  That is, as is obvious and perfectly plain from speech No. 1, the attitude which he takes up.  We do not like that attitude. We believe in collective responsibility and we believe that no member of the Executive Council should be dismissed unless that be the view of the Council as a whole.  There is only one way in which a body composed of a large number of persons can act and that is by the decision of the majority of them, if it becomes necessary to have a vote.  Unless a majority of that Council agrees that a Minister should be dismissed, that Minister should not be dismissed.  The President said, in an endeavour to twist Deputy O'Sullivan's words, that Deputy O'Sullivan had declared that there should be a majority vote on every matter that came before the Executive Council.  Of course, Deputy O'Sullivan never said anything of the kind.  Persons are chosen and go into the Executive Council because they have the same way of looking at problems.  They belong to the same Party.  They have got something that unites them and the occasions on which they would differ, or on which there would be any very substantial difference of opinion between them, would be very rare indeed.  It is only when some problem of first instance crops up that any possibility of disagreement of a serious nature can arise.  The number of occasions on which a matter would be put to the vote would be very few, in any Executive Council, constituted of members who think the same about the State.  That the Prime Minister, because he has taken a personal dislike to a Minister or because he may wish somebody else to take the place of a perfectly competent Minister, should, without consulting his colleagues, be able to dismiss that Minister, certainly strikes me as not being the way in which a Government should be conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, in endeavouring to justify the provisions of this Article, has talked of the desirability of giving the Taoiseach power to deal with a member or members of the <Col N="1186" /> Government with whom it is difficult to work.  Of course, in actual practice, that may mean that it is not because it is difficult for the Taoiseach to work with the other members of the Council, but that, in fact, it is very difficult for the normal members of the Executive Council to work with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach may develop all kinds of peculiar views on particular matters and may desire, in his fanatical enthusiasm for these views, to remove from the Executive Council persons who differ from his views or challenge his right to implement views of that kind.  The President, in the discussion on this Bill, is definitely standing for a scheme which makes the Taoiseach the boss of the Executive Council and of the Government.  In other words, every other member of the Executive Council holds office at the will and pleasure, not of the Dáil, but of the Taoiseach, and it is possible for the Taoiseach under this Article to remove from membership of the Government any particular member. It is not necessary for that particular member to commit an offence.  It is not necessary for him to be a negligent Minister.  It is not necessary for him to commit any acts of wilful neglect. All that is necessary under this Article is that the Taoiseach should take a dislike to any member of the Executive Council for any particular reason, whereupon he can tender that advice to the President and ask for the resignation of that member of the Government or have his appointment terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is inevitable that a scheme of that kind will create an atmosphere in which each member of the Government will regard himself as holding office at the will and pleasure of the Taoiseach.  That kind of insecurity will inevitably beget an Executive Council, not of the type that is necessary if the collective responsibility of a Cabinet is to work with a reasonable degree of satisfaction.  Taking the views which the President has expressed on this section, and comparing these views with the present position, I think there is a much stronger case to be made for the present position, namely, that the Executive Council stands as a unit.  If the <Col N="1187" /> Executive Council cannot agree amongst themselves, the Taoiseach should come to the Dáil, resign, and get a new lease of life if he desires a new lease of life, eliminating the obstreperous members of the Executive Council with whom, for one reason or another, the Taoiseach thinks he cannot work.  That is a reasonable method of adjusting a difficulty within the Cabinet.  I think it is a democratic method of adjusting the difficulty within the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I think the proposal to give the President power to dismiss any member of the Executive Council on the advice of the Taoiseach is giving the Taoiseach unreasonably wide powers which I do not think the Taoiseach as a member of the Government ought to have.  I do not think that the Taoiseach should be able to wield such power over his colleagues in the Executive Council.  I think the present method is much more democratic.  The proposed method is calculated to make &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; out of the other members of the Government, calculated to make them all agree with the Taoiseach whether they like his policy or not.  In the interests of the people generally I do not think it is right, certainly I do not think it is democratic, that members of the Executive Council should be dragged willy-nilly after a foolish policy of the Taoiseach merely because if they do not agree the Taoiseach may go to the President and say, &ldquo;I cannot agree with this person; I think you should get rid of him.&rdquo;  That is an undemocratic procedure, and a procedure which, in my opinion, tends definitely to give arbitrary and autocratic powers to the Taoiseach.  To that extent, therefore, it is not nearly as satisfactory as the present method, which I think has the reliable democratic principle of having a Cabinet acting as a collective institution, a Cabinet which stands as a unit and which as a unit advises the President or the functionary to be created under this Draft Constitution.  I think, therefore, that the amendment which has been proposed will create a better position than that envisaged in the Draft Constitution.  It will ensure <Col N="1188" /> what I think is preferable in the long run, namely, the collective responsibility of the Cabinet as a whole rather than endowing the Taoiseach with the arbitrary powers which he will have under this section if it goes through in its present form.</P>

      <P>There are two questions which I should like to ask the President.  The first is whether it is usual for the Prime Minister to have this power of dismissal in other countries where Party government prevails.  The second is&mdash;this is something which, perhaps, I ought to know but, unfortunately, I do not &mdash;have there been any cases, since this State was founded, of Ministers having to be dropped from a Government, and if so, what procedure was adopted in order to drop them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward by Deputy Norton and some of the other speakers would be all right if they were close up to the facts.  We talk about the President acting in an arbitrary way.  He cannot act in an arbitrary way.  He is not dealing with children.  He has a number of colleagues who are grown men.  Do you think it would be possible for a Taoiseach, in a purely arbitrary way, to compel the resignation of a member unless there was concurrence on the part of the other members of the Government?  Of course, it would be impossible.  Again, it would be quite impossible to do that in an arbitrary way, because he is also responsible before the Dáil. In the first instance, you elect one man and put on him the responsibility for selecting a team.  That principle is borne out better, in my opinion, when you leave on him the responsibility for maintaining a good team, a team that will work effectively together.  In practice there is very little difference, I will admit, between the proposition that has been put forward from the opposite benches and the proposition that is here.  In practice they will work out very nearly alike, except that I would say you would have to go very much further than simply having a majority vote. I think that no President or head of a Government would be likely to ask <Col N="1189" /> a Minister to resign on getting merely a majority vote of the remaining members.</P>
      <P>As I say, here you will again have the difficulty as to what you mean by the advice of the Government.  I do not want to see the advice of the Government restricted to being mere majority advice.  My own view is that it ought to be advice given after decision, in the same way as other matters are decided.  Those other matters are generally decided by taking the views first and trying to get a common view.  If a decision cannot be arrived at with substantial unanimity you postpone the decision, if it can be postponed, and let the matter be further considered until a situation is reached in which you can get at this unanimity.  I do not think that, even though the head of the Government found he was supported by six out of 11, he would care to take the responsibility of compelling the resignation of a member.  Well then, there is in fact not very much difference between the two, except for the meaning of &ldquo;the advice of the Government.&rdquo;  When you put on a man the responsibility of collecting a team, is it not better to put on him the responsibility definitely before the Dáil of keeping it together and seeing that it is of a proper character?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this particular section, if there is a general feeling that you should get concurrence, I am not going to quarrel with it.  My only trouble is that he himself is a member of the Government until the removal.  What do you mean then by concurrence on the advice of the Government?  We will suppose, according to this amendment, that the Taoiseach goes to the President and says: &ldquo;We are not able to get along with a certain member.  His views and ours are quite at variance.&rdquo;  Or let us take another position in which the duties of the office were not being properly performed.  The Taoiseach would go to the President and say: &ldquo;I have asked this man to resign and he will not resign.  The remainder of my colleagues, or such a number of them, agree with me in this.&rdquo;  Ordinarily, I take it, that would be the position. Except that it introduces a certain complication, I think in fact it will <Col N="1190" /> amount to the same thing.  I should be prepared to take it, if we could avoid this complication as to what is meant by the advice of the Government. Clearly the Government is not acting as a unit, because here is one man standing out.  We will take it he has refused to resign.  He is, therefore, standing against the opinion of the Government as a whole, and you cannot speak of the Government as a unit in that case.  That is the complication I see if we accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I can only say that if such a thing happened it would simply mean that that was the end of that Government.  The Deputy has worked with colleagues on various committees&mdash;committees where there is a certain amount of responsibility, although not perhaps as definite a collective responsibility as there is here.  Can the Deputy think, if he had power to remove one of his colleagues, that he would dare to do it in an arbitrary fashion?  He would know that he would immediately be resisted by the other members, who would say: &ldquo;It may be my turn next.&rdquo;  Obviously he could not do it.  Certain circumstances in which he could do it are completely and absolutely visionary. They can be conjured up by anybody of imagination, but do not in reality exist.  However, I am quite prepared to accept it, if we can get over this difficulty as to what is meant in those circumstances by the advice of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello has been talking about practice.  I have no fault to find with his explanation as to what is good practice, except that he seems to <Col N="1191" /> lay more stress upon a majority decision than I would.  His view, as far as I understand it, is that there are six one way and five the other, and the five will have to concur.  I think the cases where that would be done would be very rare.  Otherwise you are straining the point.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I think the Deputy will agree that a good practice would be this, to try to get unanimity. At least, get this point: if the majority were agreed, that here was one man who was going, as a result of a decision of that sort, to be dismissed from the Government or to leave the Government. Is it not pretty obvious, as in the case of the League of Nations, where there is one that you cannot count on, that you have to get away from what might be called common practice, and say that in this particular case we are going to work by majority vote?  That is the only difficulty I see in accepting the amendment.  In practice a good head of a Government, a good captain of a team, will work in such a way that he will not strain what I might call the loyalty of any member of the team.  That is the difficulty to be cleared up.</P>

      <P>You have to contemplate two situations after all the verbiage, one in which there is a division in the Cabinet and the Taoiseach slips off to the President and says &ldquo;dismiss that chap&rdquo; and he goes; and the other where it gets to the point that he must ask for the resignation of such a man from the Cabinet and his office terminated.  For some reason or principle that man says: &ldquo;I cannot give in&rdquo; and then the Executive Council takes a decision. Surely that is a better situation than to have the Taoiseach slipping off to the President and getting this man removed.  Remember, the new situation is most amazing.  The Taoiseach has not to face the Dáil and to ask for the appointment of new Ministers.  We do not know what is going to be the situation with regard to law and the designation of Ministers for these posts.  It may mean that the Taoiseach may have power to change Ministers from Department to Department without coming to the Dáil.  There might be a situation that the man dismissed may be a member of the Government, but has not a Department when there is no necessity to get anyone to fill the office for Departmental reasons. Someone may raise the point.  If there is a Party backing the Government that does not want that matter made an issue and dragged out in the Dáil, by a majority vote they can quash raising the question.  If we had the old situation, by which men assigned to Departments were assigned by the Dáil, and you had only men in the Cabinet with departmental duties, then the whole thing would be in the open.  That is not the situation that must arise.  It may arise.  Between the two situations Deputy Norton's argument has put the position very succinctly.  Are you looking for a situation in which a man like the Taoiseach is going to play up to that, or to sink his responsibilities to the <Col N="1193" /> country?  I think you are going to have better ideas of duty if you do not have them under the thumb of the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of going to the President is absolutely ridiculous.  In practice it could not arise in that way.  I said at first that the colleagues of the Taoiseach are grown men.  They would not have been approved by the Dáil, as they have to be in the first instance, if they were going to be people of that character. They have to be selected from their own Party, and the Party has generally got to support its election. Otherwise, the whole system would break down.  In the nature of things, there should be no such thing as running off to the President to get him to dismiss one of the members of the Government.  The net point is this, that when advice is given&mdash;the word advice occurs in the text&mdash;that advice is given by men and is a decision by the Executive Council in which every member concurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact he takes responsibility the moment it is given. He may have been opposed to the decision before it was arrived at, but the moment it is given he must concur. Otherwise you have not the decision that Deputy Costello wants, when he said, irrespective of what views they held before the decision was taken, they have to take personal responsibility for it in the country and in the Dáil.  It is clear that the decision can only be arrived at when you have substantial unanimity in the Executive Council and the Government.  I am not stating that the decision is such that every member of the Government will agree with it.  You will not get that concurrence in the case of a man for his own removal.  Therefore, you are vitiating in that particular case, and holding up to doubt the idea that the advice when given is a decision, and that the decision means the concurrence of every single member of the Government.  The theory, based on the old Constitution is this, that in selecting one man, and holding him responsible for keeping the team together, <Col N="1194" /> that that is the principal duty of the head of the Government.  If there are six and five he may have to go and talk to the five and, if there is an important decision, try to bring them to the point of view the majority has taken.  He has to try to get that concurrence which I say is vital when a decision is taken.  The amendment breaks through that idea.  That is my principal objection to it.  In practice, I say the same result will be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a terrible mistake to suggest that because the head of the Government selects the team, he is in the position that his colleagues are only &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo;  The position to be arrived at is one in which they look to him for responsibility to keep the team together.  If a certain member was not pulling his weight in the team, he would be the person who would have to talk to that member, to reason with him and to try to get him to work with the team.  Finally, on him would be the responsibility of giving advice. He would not give that advice without concurrence.  I am not sticking out for this point at all.  If I could get some way of avoiding it I would.  In this case you are clearly showing the country you are giving advice by a majority vote.  It might involve two members.  There again you have a situation in which it is very difficult to get the idea that the advice is given with unanimity, from the point of view of concurrence.  That is my only objection to it.  Deputy Costello said that when he first read the Constitution what struck him was the humiliating position in which the Government was put.  Does the Deputy seriously hold that opinion in view of the document that is in front of him?  Does he not see clearly that all executive power is in the hands of the Government, that it is their will and their decisions?  In fact, if there is a fault to be found with the Constitution I would say the fault is this that there is still too great power in the hands of the Executive or Government of the day.  That will be found from what I might call the democratic point of view.  I stand for it because I think it is necessary for the conduct of business in the State that there should be a really strong Executive.  Because I take that view <Col N="1195" /> of a strong Executive, I do not think the Deputy could honestly hold that the Government is in a humiliating position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might answer the President on that point. Instead of using the word &ldquo;humiliating,&rdquo; if I had used the word &ldquo;second rate&rdquo; or &ldquo;third rate&rdquo; it would perhaps more clearly have expressed the view.  I still maintain perfectly honestly on the Draft that, if the President gives way on the suggestion we are making, then he meets my objection to a certain extent.  I will be perfectly frank with the President. I found a new system created consisting of an Uachtaran who had certain very wide powers which he could exercise at his own discretion, and other powers which he exercised on the advice of the Government. I had no objection to those.  When I saw that the President would have power to exercise certain powers on his own discretion I, of course, included in that at all those powers and functions which he exercises after consultation with the Council of State.  The President admitted that that phrase is nonsense&mdash;that it means nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I found that the new functionary had very wide powers.  I then found a provision enabling the Oireachtas, by law, to confer more powers on him.  Then I came to the conclusion that this new functionary was going to be some very great all-powerful person in the State, or could be, in certain circumstances. That is how we have to test the Constitution. Looking here, I found that the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is only used once in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not right in saying it is not used more than once, because it is used in connection with the Prime Minister, the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is only used once, and that is in Article 28.  Then I found here the Article which we are discussing&mdash;that they hold office at the will and pleasure <Col N="1196" /> of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister is the boss.  We have then two bosses, the President and the Prime Minister, and they can run the whole State between them.  The President may shake his head.  He cannot get into his head that what is happening now will not continue to happen for all time.  Let us forget the present and try to project our minds into some future time when he will not be here, and I will not be here, and certain other people will not be here. That is how we have to face the Constitution. In that state of facts, viewing the Draft Constitution as a whole, it appears to me perfectly honestly to be a two-man show.  Some people take it as a one-man show.  It can be turned into a one-man show.  But the scheme as it appeared to me on analysis was a two-man show&mdash;the President and the Prime Minister.  The dangers will arise if they coalesce into a one-man show or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we are fighting a lot about words in this particular case.  A very excellent explanation was given by Deputy Costello of the suspicions which are in his mind and the atmosphere in which he comes to examine this.  If one does go through the Constitution in a spirit of cumulative suspicion, then one is bound to regard every single clause of this Draft as something which has about 15 niggers in a wood pile behind it.  The net point is this.  The Opposition say that, as the clause is now drafted, they think it could read that this advice for the acceptance of the resignation of a Minister might be the irresponsible personal act of an individual, and they say that should not be so; they say it should be the act of the Government.  The President has told us that the meaning he attaches to it <Col N="1197" /> is that it should be the advice of the Taoiseach, with the concurrence of the Executive Council.  The difference between the two is extremely small. It is only a question of finding a method of commonly agreed expression. One could use the term, &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Government&rdquo;; one could use the phrase, &ldquo;on the advice of the Government.&rdquo;  The President has a technical objection to the phrase, &ldquo;on the advice of the Government,&rdquo; in the sense that it would not be the advice of every one of them, in so far as it would involve someone who had already refused to co-operate. I take it that all that remains between us is that some phrase will be found which will, without involving that technical difficulty which the President has in his mind, fulfil what is the wish both of the President and of the Opposition in the matter.  We might leave it at that until the President has an opportunity of seeing whether some such suitable commonly agreed phrase can be found for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the rubbish talked about the difficulty of phrases.  What are we facing? The position in which there is a cleavage in the Cabinet.  The two solutions are: (1)  the Taoiseach goes off to the President and gets a man removed from his office; (2) the Taoiseach goes up and says, &ldquo;I am not doing this on my own; the Executive Council are behind me.&rdquo;  In both cases there is clearly contemplated, from the very circumstances, a division. What is the good of talking about getting a phrase that will hide that division?  No man in his senses could speak in these terms in face of these circumstances.  The facts themselves shout aloud that there is disagreement of some type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the good of saying that a phrase which ordinarily means the advice of the Government&mdash;there is nothing new about concurrence&mdash; mainly through the Constitution, demands either concurrence or acceptance of something by more than a bare majority, when there is clearly a cleavage?  The circumstances demand an explanation to the people that there is a cleavage that cannot be <Col N="1198" /> hidden for any length of time.  Within an hour after the Taoiseach has walked down from the President, after getting a man dismissed from his office at his sole request, the news is out. There is no great sanctity in this phrase, &ldquo;on the advice of the Government.&rdquo; There is nothing in its use in the Constitution that indicates that there is to be virtual unanimity among the Cabinet when there is advice of such a type given.  If there are the circumstances of a man being dismissed, what is the good of saying that the phrase is distorted when clearly the dismissal implies that there is a man who is reluctant to go and has to be forced to go?</P>
    <P>As to the powers of the Taoiseach and the powers of the President in this Constitution, to what Deputy Costello stated I only want to add this: that the new Constitutions of Europe, in regard to one particular power of the President, attracted such attention that certain literature has grown up on that point.  I have here one small book written in regard to all the new democratic Constitutions.  It was written in 1928 and deals with the Constitutions of eight States and marks out as the common point in the whole lot the weakening of the Executive and the granting of powers outside the Executive either to Parliament or to the President, but in the main to the President.  It has to be noted that that book was written in 1928 and republished in 1929, and eight Constitutions were referred to.  In five cases since the book was written Parliamentary government has been suppressed because of the powers given to the President.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the President is conjuring up needless difficulties in connection with this matter.  He has told us of a situation where five members of the Executive Council might take one view and six members might take another view, and it is consequently necessary to abandon the proposal, whatever it may be, until such time as the President of the Executive Council convinces the minority that they ought to agree with the viewpoint of the majority.  That, I take it, is dealing with the ordinary <Col N="1199" /> proposals for legislation of a positive or negative character.  I do not think that the situation at all fits in with the set of circumstances envisaged under Article 13.  Here we are considering the question where an obstreperous, recalcitrant member of the Executive Council either will not work with his colleagues or attend to his Parliamentary duties and has adopted an attitude which is bringing discredit on the Executive Council.  It would be the desire of everybody that, in these circumstances, that person should be got rid of.  The method of getting rid of the person is the issue that is causing this discussion.  I want to ensure that if he is to be got rid of he is to be got rid of on the advice of the Government, and that it would not be within the scope of possibility that the Taoiseach should go to the President and say, &ldquo;I have had a quarrel with the Minister of a particular Department, who has said things that have wounded my feelings, and I feel now that I can no longer work with that Minister.&rdquo;  In such circumstances, if this Article remains as at present, the President will have no option but to accept the resignation of that particular Minister, even though the majority of that Minister's colleagues might take the view that the Taoiseach was wrong in his action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President says he is dealing with grown-up people.  It is because he is dealing with grown-up people that it is even possible to remedy that situation.  A lot of members of the Executive Council may say: &ldquo;I do not think the Taoiseach had any right to go to the President on that matter; it was a storm in a teacup; the Taoiseach was unnecessarily vain and impetuous, the thing would have blown over and would be all right.&rdquo;  But they would also say at the same time: &ldquo;Much as we regret what the Taoiseach has done, there is the Party and the Government to be considered; the political situation is none too good at the moment, and in these circumstances while we might like to tell the Taoiseach what we think of him, having regard to the bad political situation outside and to the fact that our stock is running low and the probability <Col N="1200" /> that, with all his idiosyncrasies, he is the best Taoiseach that we could get, we have to put up with this attitude of his.&rdquo;  The more grown-up men are and the more mature they are, the more likely they will be to take that line.  If they were young, impetuous men, you might not be able to restrain them.  Their maturity is the best possible guarantee that they will not cause any upheaval.  The President says he is afraid that the advice of the Government would mean that it would have to be the unanimous voice of the Government or that every member of the Government would have to agree. Probably the fact that the Taoiseach would have to go to the President would be evidence that you could not possibly get agreement on an issue of that kind.  The fact that the Taoiseach finds it necessary to ask for the removal of one man would prove to everybody that there is a row in the Cabinet.  It would be impossible for anyone to imagine that the person who was going to be made the victim of the Government's wrath would say: &ldquo;Very well, I propose to agree to the views of the Executive Council, who propose to carry out this political execution on me.&rdquo;  The member of the Government is never likely to consent to that kind of thing, to consent to ending his political career.  He will fight to go on remaining there.  If there ever was a case for going to the President and saying &ldquo;by a majority, the Government give you this advice,&rdquo; this is the case where it can be justified.  A democratic Government could not dream of allowing an obstreperous Minister to prevent the will of the Government being given effect to.  We have no fears whatever that there will be any commotion or riot in the country if the Taoiseach went to the President and said: &ldquo;The members of the Government want this Minister removed; the decision is not unanimous.&rdquo;  If the Taoiseach said that to the President, the President would be an imbecile if he did not appreciate the circumstances, and the country would appreciate that in circumstances like that the Taoiseach never would get unanimity.  He would have to take the next best method, which was to get the greatest possible measure of unanimity <Col N="1201" /> in favour of the removal of the Minister. The President would have to face up to the position of taking the advice of the Government instead of the advice of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach might say: &ldquo;I have got ten-elevenths of the Government in favour of my proposal.&rdquo;  There would be small difficulties compared with running the risk that the Taoiseach would say that this Article was drafted in order to give vent to the wrath of one member of the Executive Council.  You could alter this Article to read: &ldquo;The President shall on the advice of the Government tendered by the Taoiseach accept the resignation ... of any member of the Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sorry that no one has given us the enlightenment I asked for as to how Party government works elsewhere.  I am under the impression that the system in Great Britain has developed so that the Prime Minister takes the sole personal responsibility in such matters as this. I am not impressed at all by what Deputy Norton has said about the probable attitude of the Ministers towards arbitrary or irresponsible action by the Prime Minister.  I think if such action took place at any time, if the Ministers are worth their salt, they would resign rather than put up with it.  The Deputy said there might be circumstances in which they felt it necessary to retain the Prime Minister and keep up his prestige and they would not resign.  Our reply in that case is that this stipulation about advice by the Government has no value because all the Prime Minister has to do is to call his Government together and say: &ldquo;I want you to get rid of that man; I dislike him so much that either he goes or I go.&rdquo;  If the Ministers are to give way in one case they would obviously give way in the other case.  I suspect the personal responsibility of the Prime Minister is the system that has in practice proved itself best.  Take a concrete case. Supposing at the time of the Budget scandal last year Mr. Thomas had <Col N="1202" /> refused to resign, would it not be better if the Prime Minister had power to call on him to resign, rather than that the Cabinet should be called together, a vote taken and his fate decided by a majority of the Cabinet? It seems to me that that is creating an unnecessary and undesirable amount of unpleasantness and in this personal relationship some one man in the Cabinet ought to have chief responsibility and that one man should be the Prime Minister, and the security against arbitrary and unjust and irresponsible action by the Prime Minister is, as the President has said, the character of his colleagues.</P>

It is not that a division is revealed at the moment; it is this&mdash; that advice, by the fact that it would be tendered there in the special case where it may have to be got by the majority vote, is generally weakened; the character of the advice generally is weakened; it is attacked on what I regard as of great value, and that is that, when advice is given from the Government, it must be advice in which all the members of the Government concur.</P>

      <P>I understand that amendment No. 100 is bound up with it, but I am not sure.  However, I will accept your ruling on it, Sir.  I move amendments Nos. 34, 35, 36 and 37:&mdash;</P>
      <P>34.  In Section 2, sub-section 1º, to delete the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; line 2 and substitute the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>35.  In Section 2, sub-section 2º, to delete the words &ldquo;may, in his absolute discretion, refuse to&rdquo; line 1 and <Col N="1205" /> substitute therefor the words &ldquo;shall not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>36.  In Section 2, sub-section 2º, to delete the words &ldquo;Taoiseach who&rdquo; line 2 and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Government which&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>37.  In Section 2 to delete sub-section 3º.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of Article 13 deals with the very important matter of the dissolution of the Dáil.  It also deals with the summoning of the Dáil, not so important a matter, but still of importance, and particularly so when joined with this very important matter of dissolution.  As Section 2 stands, the President shall dissolve and summon Dáil Eireann on the advice of the Taoiseach.  Secondly, the question of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann, and has power to get a dissolution, emerges.  The phrase in Article 2 is so cast as definitely to convey the meaning that, ordinarily, a Taoiseach who has failed to command the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann ought to get a dissolution if he demands it, because the phrase has suffered the peculiar twist that the President may refuse to grant a dissolution to such a Taoiseach, that is, a Taoiseach who has lost the support of the majority in Dáil Eireann.  Then, finally, we have the smaller matter that the President may&mdash;and I am reading that as &ldquo;at his own discretion&rdquo;&mdash; convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas, because the phrase has it that he may do it &ldquo;after consultation with the Council of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That position is to be contrasted with the present position which, I think, is the democratic one.  The ordinary position is that the dissolution of a representative House is under its own control.  The summoning follows almost as a matter of course. It is a smaller matter but it is generally under the control of that representative House also.  It has been a constitutional provision in this State since the beginning that the head of an Executive Council who had lost the support of the majority of the House could not demand a dissolution.  In contrast to that, we <Col N="1206" /> have sub-section (2) of Section 2 of Article 13 which, from the way the sentence is thrown, conveys the implication that even a Taoiseach having lost the support of the majority of Dáil Eireann should be able to get a dissolution.  I think that is wrong. I think the present position, in which there is an absolute prohibition against the head of an Executive Council who has lost the support of the majority in Dáil Eireann getting a dissolution, is the correct position.</P>
    <P>As far as the first paragraph is concerned, I have got considerable enlightenment from the last argument, because I gather that the President's view of phraseology in this Constitution is that where the phrase &ldquo;on the advice of the Government&rdquo; occurs, there is implied virtual unanimity of the Government, but where the phrase &ldquo;on the advice of the Taoiseach&rdquo; occurs, so far from there being any implication of a unanimous, or virtually unanimous, view of the Government, the phrase is used where the Taoiseach is acting more or less off his own. Certainly, there is no context of unanimous support, or virtually unanimous support, for the Government, so that the new situation proposed in the Constitution is that a dissolution of the Dáil could be demanded by a Taoiseach, even though he had lost the support of the majority of his colleagues, and, secondly, a dissolution of the Dáil may be demanded, and the implication of the framework of the sentence is, &ldquo;and should be granted,&rdquo; to a Taoiseach, head of an Executive Council, who has ceased to command a majority in Dáil Eireann.  That is completely against the ordinary constitutional provisions as known in the Constitution; it is against the practice; and I wait to hear the argument to be put forward for the change proposed.</P>
    <P>The last point is why should the President at any time be given power &mdash;after meeting this body, the Council of State, his own bodyguard of yes-men whom he simply must call together, hear the views of the members and then can completely disregard their views&mdash;to convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the <Col N="1207" /> Oireachtas?  This Parliament has been enabled, through its Standing Orders, to secure a speedy summoning of the Dáil to meet an emergency situation.  We can carry on with that. I do not see any reason for the intervention of this outside person.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted, and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present</i>,</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to explain why the existing system is to be changed.  My answer to that is that the existing system is, in my opinion, a bad one.  Let us take this question, in the first place, about advice by the Taoiseach alone.  I hold that it is very much better practice that, in this matter, the responsibility for giving advice should be placed on one pair of shoulders&mdash;the shoulders of the Taoiseach.  He may find a division in the Executive Council.  If he were to consult the Dáil he would be bound to find a division of opinion and possibly if a vote were taken in the Dáil at any particular time, there would be no dissolution at all.  There may be big questions on which it is advisable, in the opinion of the person who has the chief responsibility placed upon him, that the opinion of the country should be got.  Again, we have to take the actual situation.  He is, in all probability, the leader of the dominant political Party.  There is no use in pretending that, in this case, he is taking arbitrary action, because, if there is going to be an election, the whole position with regard to his Party is going to be settled by the vote taken at that election.  Considering the situation as a whole, he may come to a decision which would be supported by, let us say, parts of the organisation which might not necessarily correspond with the division the Government of the day.  Ordinarily, as in the other case, be would not face such a situation without getting substantial unanimity.  But it may not be possible to do that.  There may be a question in which the Cabinet itself is divided.  From his view of the difficulties of the question that is to be settled, he may come to the conclusion that his proper duty is to <Col N="1208" /> let the people decide.  Therefore, I think that, in this case also, it is advisable that the dissolution should take place, or be given on the advice of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The first point of difference is that, whereas a dissolution would be given on the advice of the Government, according to the amendment, it is, according to the Draft Constitution, to be on the advice of the head of the Government.  The next point of difference is: In this Constitution, a Government that has failed to have a majority can ask for a dissolution.  I hold that that is right because, if we are going to accept the principle that the people are ultimately to judge, there can be no objection to the people being asked to decide.  Therefore the power given here is simply the power of saying that a situation has arisen in which the people themselves ought to decide and not merely the majority in the Parliament.  You interpose the will of the President, and the President has no discredion if the Taoiseach and the Government of which he is the leader have the majority.  The President cannot intervene in these circumstances; he has to give the dissolution.  But if the Government should happen to be defeated on a particular question and they felt that that was a question in which their view, although they were a minority, would be held by the people as a whole, I think it is right that a dissolution should be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take the circumstances in which it would be reasonable that a dissolution should be given and the circumstances in which it would not be reasonable that a dissolution should be given.  I grant you that there are certain circumstances in which the leader of a Government, or a Government, should not be given a dissolution but there are circumstances in which they should.  In order to try to distinguish between these two cases, we bring in a third person, so to speak, as arbiter.  He will give his decision and grant a dissolution, or refuse it, at his own discretion, having heard the views expressed on the matter by the Council of State.  Again, I lay stress on the fact that the function of the Council of State is simply to make the <Col N="1209" /> President aware of the possible consequences of his action and of the matters which he should bear in mind before he arrives at his decision. There is no use in putting that aside with a wave of the hand as if it were of no consequence.  Let us assume that the President is a just man who wants to act fairly and wisely.  He will, undoubtedly, give great weight to the views expressed by the Council of State.  He has to give his decision having heard those views.  That does not preclude the possibility, having heard these views, of his giving a dissolution where other people might say a dissolution should not be given.  In this case, I have just been reminded that the President acts without the Council of State.  The question is whether the Council of State should come in in this case or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It does matter very much.  We must assume that the people elected to office are not all the time trying to do wrong things, but that they are properly carrying out their duties and acting with justice.  But a man may be very just and fair, and yet may not be able if he were alone to make up his mind: to see all aspects of the particular question or the possible consequences of a particular line of action proposed.  That is the value of the Council of State. The reason why the Council of State is not put in here is this, that when the Taoiseach who is defeated goes to the President, if he is told straight off &ldquo;I cannot give you a dissolution; the circumstances under which you have been defeated are such that I do not think there is any question which should be put to the people,&rdquo; he may be prepared straight away to say: &ldquo;Very well, we need go no farther with it.&rdquo;  But, ordinarily in the Council of State, you will have members of the Opposition.  Consequently, if he asks for a dissolution, the fact that he is looking for it, and has been refused, will become known, and there would be greater confidence between them if he goes and says to the President:&ldquo;I think the circumstances are such in which I should have a dissolution.&rdquo; The President would probably <Col N="1210" /> not give him an answer then but would consult some members of the Council of State, the members of the judiciary perhaps, as to whether in these circumstances it would be wise to give a dissolution or not.  If there is any question of putting in the Council of State there, I have no objection to that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does not arise then.  The President, although he is not obliged in this case to consult the members of the Council of State, would, in fact, consult, say, the members of the judiciary, so that he might see all the pros and cons with regard to the decision that he was asked to make.  Consequently, I think this is a better practice because there can hardly be a doubt that a situation will arise, or may well arise, in which a Government may be very narrowly defeated and in which the view taken by the minority would be that taken by the country as a whole.  You are here then enabling the possibility of an appeal being made to Cæsar, namely, the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter is the meeting of the two Houses, the right to cause the Houses to be assembled.  Now, circumstances may well arise, at least so. we were told very often in recent months by members on the opposite benches where a Government may try to do things and not summon the Dáil. Deputy McGilligan now tells us that we have the Standing Orders and that they are adequate.  That is a curious reversal of attitude because laws were not good enough before.  Now, we have Standing Orders, and we are told <Col N="1211" /> they will be good enough to meet the situation.  This is a situation which, in my opinion, ought to be met by the Constitution and the Executive, no matter what may be said from the opposite benches, is being given tremendous powers in this Constitution. If an Executive was doing something which it was felt they could not do if they were faced with Parliament, I think again that you are not giving extraordinary powers to the President if you give him the right to cause Parliament to assemble.  He only brings the supreme legislative body into session.  Surely there can be no objection to that. He is not likely to cause Parliament to meet and face the humiliation of being told by Parliament that his calling of it together was unnecessary and not proper.  You are providing the safeguard that the Executive, which is responsible to Parliament, will have to face their masters under any circumstances in which the President thinks it is right that it should be done.  These are the three points that were raised, and these are the explanations that I have for the text as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like the President to deal with.  In sub-section (2) of Section 2, Article 13, it is provided:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the President may in his absolute discretion refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann on the advice of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Are we to visualise that as meaning the Taoiseach personally, or is that to be taken as embracing the whole Executive Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Taoiseach personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, I think that provision would need to be amplified.  Suppose the Taoiseach had ceased to retain the support of a majority of Dáil Eireann in his personal capacity, should there not be a further provision, when you give the President an absolute discretion to refuse a dissolution, <Col N="1212" /> to enable him to get Dáil Eireann to appoint a new Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, if the Government has failed to secure support and faces the Dáil again, a new Government would be elected.  For instance, if there was a measure which was regarded by the Government as one of primary importance, one which they felt it was essential they should get if they were to continue in office, there might be the question of getting a vote of confidence.  If they felt that in those circumstances they could not, in fact, get a vote of confidence in the Dáil, then the Prime Minister would go to the President and say: &ldquo;Our Government has been defeated on a measure of primary importance, and if I go for a vote of confidence on this question I do not think that I can get it, but the matter on which I have been defeated is of such a character that I am satisfied that if the people, the ultimate court for deciding these matters, got the opportunity they would decide in my favour.&rdquo;  Under these circumstances the President has the right to say to him: &ldquo;Well, you were defeated, and I am not going to give you dissolution.&rdquo;  What, then, would be the position of the Taoiseach? He would go back to the Dáil and resign because obviously he could not carry on if he has to face a Dáil in which he is in a minority.  It is stated here definitely that he has to resign if he fails to command support in Dáil Eireann.  Therefore, the position for him was that he had to resign. Dáil Eireann would proceed to elect another Taoiseach and there would be a new Government formed.  That is the position on that hypothesis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if he goes to the President, and the President agrees with him that the situation is one in which the people ought to be given an opportunity to decide the question, he can say: &ldquo;Very well, you prepare the proclamation and I will sign it, and we will dissolve Parliament.  Then there is an election on that issue, and the electors will settle whether the Taoiseach, when he comes back, has a majority to carry on, or whether he is in a minority.  What that simply means is that we are making provision in the <Col N="1213" /> Constitution for the possibility of referring a question of primary importance, on which the Government has been defeated, to the people for a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And others will hold the contrary view, and say that such a power should not be given, but I hope I have made it clear what will happen if a dissolution is refused.</P>

      <P>This is only preparatory to an amendment which occurs later on.  The sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas shall require the signature of the President for its enactment into law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, a later clause says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President shall promulgate every law made by the Oireachtas.&rdquo; Instead of the words &ldquo;shall require the signature of the President&rdquo;, I want to substitute the words &ldquo;shall be signed by the President&rdquo;.  Later on, there is an amendment to the effect that if the President fails or neglects to sign a Bill when the Constitution says that he should sign it, then, within a certain period, the Chairman of Dáil Eireann shall sign, and the Bill becomes law.</P>

    <P>Now, the foregoing provisions of the Article make certain provisions, and in any case, while these do not cover every contingency, there is the reserve power here and, under these circumstances, the Council of State would have placed upon it the duty of making the necessary arrangements.  Accordingly, if the President were to refuse <Col N="1215" /> to sign a Bill, under conditions in which he was not at liberty to refuse according to the Constitution, the work would be done for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  My point is that Article 14 deals with the appointment of a commission in certain eventualities, such as the absence of the President, his temporary or permanent incapacity, his death, his resignation, his removal from office, and so on.  Does paragraph 5 enlarge that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of the new Article 14 and the purpose of writing it at that length was that I was not pleased with the form in which these three or four Articles were placed. They were long Articles, and the desire was to cut them up, in accordance with the general scheme, by having short sentences and short paragraph as far as possible.  As well as that, there is the change that you have the provision that the commission shall consist of the following persons, namely, the Chief Justice, the Chairman of the Dáil, and the Chairman of Seanad Eireann, and so on.  That is a matter of form, as well as these ones about the Deputy Chairman of Dáil Eireann or the Deputy Chairman of Seanad Eireann.  Then you have a provision which says that, in any contingency which is not provided for by the foregoing provisions of the Article, the Council of State may, by a majority of its members, make provision for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of the President <Col N="1216" /> under the Constitution.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see.  First of all, I would be inclined to say that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; there is mandatory. Then in Article 25 (2), on page 50, we have the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" />&ldquo;Save as otherwise provided by this Constitution, every Bill so presented to the President for his signature and for promulgation by him as a law shall be signed by the President not earlier than five and not later than seven days after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.&rdquo;</P>

Amendment No.54 introduces a new Article 14, and says that &ldquo;in the event of ... failure to exercise and perform the powers and functions of his office or any of them&rdquo;, then the commission is to carry out the duty.

The body to act in this general contingency would be the Council of State.  They would clearly, if they had to act, have to be satisfied that there was failure, just as we had it to-night on another matter that a certain court will have to decide whether it had jurisdiction.

      <P>40. To delete Section 4.</P>
      <P>41. To delete Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two amendments explain themselves. This Constitution wants to vest in the President supreme command of the Defence Forces.  If that merely meant that the President became, as kings do elsewhere, an honorary colonel of various regiments and that we should allow him to spend part of his salary in providing himself with various uniforms or decorating himself in any way that might tickle his vanity, provided there was no extra emolument given to recoup him for the extravagance which he had indulged in in that way, it would do no harm, but when we come to the next section, which states that the exercise of the supreme command shall be regulated by law and that all commissioned officers of the Defence Forces shall hold their commissions from the President, then we are definitely getting into dangerous ground.  I see no reason whatever for having the officers hold their commissions from the President. I know that there are Constitutions which have a phrase in them corresponding to this paragraph 4.  I know that in the majority of Constitutions where that phrase occurs the supreme command is vested in the President, but it may not be exercised by him in time of war, or any approach to war. It is quite clearly indicated that it is only a ceremonial business.  I suggest that it is exceptional in Constitutions to have a clause corresponding to 5 (2), that all the commissioned officers of the Defence Forces are to hold their commissions <Col N="1222" /> from the President.  If we had some prohibition in this that nobody who had ever been, say, a member of the Executive Council, nobody who had ever been head of the Executive Council, if we had even the prohibition that people who held certain officers were not eligible for and could not be elected to the Presidency of the country, there might be something to be said for this.  But in that condition in which we must contemplate that the President, hereafter, is going to be somebody who was closely connected with a political party, and certainly will have been a member of the Executive Council, possibly will have been head of the Executive Council, and where politics are all around the President, and particularly in the new condition where he can present himself for election at least once more, and will, therefore, have the temptation to play politics during his first term of office, I see no reason whatever for giving such a man&mdash;who will be a politician, getting into power through the persuasion of a political party&mdash; complete control of the Forces, when he will not be subject to the immediate authority or the close impact of the Dáil upon him.  I see no reason for giving that man this right that all the commissioned officers of the Forces should hold their commissions from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the position here that the supreme command of the Defence Forces should be vested in the President, it is quite clear that that is only nominal.  It could only be nominal.  Any powers that he might exercise there will have to be exercised under the Constitution, and, therefore, any powers that he might exercise in virtue of that vesting will have to be exercised on the direct advice of the Government.  Is not that so?  Any power given to the President can only be exercised on the advice of the Government, which is responsible to the Parliament.  Next, there is the question that the exercise of the command should be regulated by law.  This envisages a situation in which the Army in this country, as in every other democratic country, would be immediately controlled or under the ultimate <Col N="1223" /> effective control of Parliament.  The Government is responsible to Parliament and Parliament makes the law. Is it not obvious that Parliament would regulate the command of that so as to make it effectively under the control of the Executive Council?  Therefore, you cannot imagine that a law would be passed by Parliament which would give the ultimate control of the Forces out of its own power and hand it over to the President.  In fact, they could not do it under this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose they do; we are assuming that we are going to have such an extraordinary situation that Parliament, which is so jealous of its powers, is going simply to hand them away, but in any case the handing of them away would not be constitutional, because we have a law that any powers or functions given to him by law will be exercised on the advice of the Government. If the Parliament is going to give away its powers, then the Government can give away its powers, and the Government does not mean anything.  There you have the position that the people have nothing to depend upon.  If you envisage such a situation, then of course Parliamentary and representative institutions are a mere farce.  To get any dangerous position, such as would seem to be indicated by the speeches from the opposite side, you would have to get this state of affairs: that Parliament was going completely to hand over its powers, and that the Government was going to be such&mdash;although it would have to be nominally giving advice&mdash;that it would be just the advice that the President wanted.  As I say, if you are going to envisage that state of affairs there is no use in writing any Constitution.  We are assuming here that the representatives of the people will continue to be as jealous of their ultimate control of the Army as representative institutions have generally shown themselves to be. I say that if you assume anything else, then you will get a situation in which the President, whether he has active control or not, is able to dominate the <Col N="1224" /> situation to such an extent that his will becomes law.  If that situation is envisaged, one cannot frame a Constitution to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I want to make, and that is that the President does not seem to recognise the difference between the Constitution and ordinary law.  The Constitution is precisely meant to guard against dangerous cases.  If the President would allow me to finish a sentence and would attend to the ordinary rules of debate&mdash;I think I am quoting him fairly accurately&mdash;we might get on.  The Constitution is precisely meant to guard against dangers. Every Constitution does envisage a case where there would be an attempt to interfere with the people's liberties. That is the reason why you have certain guards against Parliament, and also against people in the position of President.  Therefore, that argument does not hold.  I can well envisage a case in which a discredited Party as a Government might use its power to make the command exercised by the President a real command, and not merely a nominal command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as I think ought to be the case, the President were merely a functionary, merely a nominal person at the head of the State, or for most purposes at the head of the State&mdash;not strictly head of the State, I admit&mdash;if he were merely a ceremonial representative of the State, I could understand the line taken up by the President, but our contention all along has been that he is something very different.  The possibility is there under this Article.  You will notice it is put in under the powers to be conferred on the President.  It is there put in dealing with the powers of the President.  I think that is dangerous.  The President is living in the 20th century&mdash;I often wonder if he does live in the 20th century&mdash;and he calmly tells us that the representatives of the people will never give control of the Army to the President.  Does he know that such a place as Europe exists?  Will the President get it into his head that there are places other than Great Britain in the world?  He finds it difficult to do that.  There are places on the Continent in which the <Col N="1225" /> representatives of the people have given that power over to the President. He tells us calmly that generally the representatives of the people have shown themselves to be particularly jealous to preserve their rights in this respect, when they have done exactly the opposite.</P>

      <P>It could not have happened if the people did not consent. It certainly happened in one case.  In the first instance the people will have to elect their representatives, and they will have to choose people who will safeguard their interests. If the people are prepared to change the form of government and to allow another system to be set up, then I say they cannot be protected. If Parliament is going to do these things, and if it can be done without the will of the people, the Constitution is not going to bring them very far.  The supreme control of the Army has to be vested somewhere.  It is vested in the Executive Council at the moment.  Under this Constitution, while the vesting will be in the President, as a non-political personage, the actual point is this, that the President in his office is supposed to act not as a Party person.  We have for a number of years a Ceann Comhairle selected from one particular Party.</P>

      <P>With regard to this matter, I say that you cannot get a person absolutely and completely without political views.  When I say political views, I mean views on government and the conduct of affairs. If he is worthy at all he must have opinions from day to day.  They may not be the opinions held by a Party, but he will have views.  He enters office and takes an oath to carry out his functions in a certain way, but as far as it is humanly possible to remove him, he is removed from Party politics.  The question is: Should he have supreme control, or should it be vested in the Executive Council?  I say this is better, as it indicates the continuity of the State.  It is better that it should be vested in him as being less political than the Executive Council of the day.  But control is, in fact, in the Executive Council or Government of the day.  It is their advice has to be taken in regard to the exercise of these functions because it is solely a Government Constitution and as far as the Constitution can make it right there it is.  If the law is passed it will be passed by Parliament. Supposing the law regulates that it is to be done in a particular way, and that he cannot be given the power of acting except on the advice of the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy introduced the subject.  To return to the Army, it seems more appropriate that the President should hold supreme command and that commissioned officers should hold commissions from the President than that authority should be in the Minister for Defence or the Executive Council as a whole. I do not understand the object of Section 5 (1) which says: &ldquo;The exercise of the supreme command of the Defence Forces shall be regulated by law.&rdquo; What is the point in that?  Is it meant to indicate that some supplementary legislation has to be passed in connection with it?</P>

      <P>The only point is that if you put it in, or if you leave it out, a point will be made about it.  I am afraid it has enabled a great deal of propaganda to be made that would not be possible at all if we had put into every section &ldquo;on the advice of the <Col N="1229" /> Government&rdquo;.  We have put it into one section on page 20.  I am afraid I will have to see that this is brought prominently before the attention of the public so that the propaganda going on will not be made effective.</P>
      <P>On page 20, Article 13, Section 9 says: &ldquo;The powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution shall be exercisable and performable by him only on the advice of the Government, save where it is provided....&rdquo; So that in any other place where you see the President does anything and you have no other provision after it, or no other qualification, such as, &ldquo;at his own discretion,&rdquo; or &ldquo;after consultation with the Council of State&rdquo; or &ldquo;on the nomination of the Dáil,&rdquo; or something of that sort, but simply that the President does this or that, then you add to it &ldquo;on the advice of the Government.&rdquo; It was simply to save a certain amount of verbiage.  The basis for a great deal of the pretence that has been possible here, that the President will be a dictator, is because we saved verbiage and put in one clause, instead of 40 or 50 times in the course of the Constitution, that the President shall do it on the advice of the Government.  It is clearly on the advice of the Government that he will exercise any functions in this Constitution.  To remove all possibility of doubt, we have put down an amendment making it quite clear that, if he is given any functions by law, those functions, no matter of what character they are, even though they are of a character that, if they were in this Constitution, he could do them of his own discretion or after consultation with the Council of State, shall be exercised only on the advice of the Government.  It is provided that if he gets any power whatever by law he shall exercise that power only on the advice of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting afterthought, but it is an afterthought. The situation in the Constitution, as presented to us was that, in all matters generally arising under the Constitution and given to the President, he had to act on the advice of the Government.  We will see afterwards <Col N="1230" /> what that means.  But there was an omission, whether deliberate or not, that matters given to him by law were not caught by that phrase.  Now, as an afterthought, by amendment, it is suggested to us that this is going to be amended.  What does that mean? The President is going to act on the advice of the Government&mdash;sometimes on the advice of a member of the Government, the Taoiseach, sometimes on the advice of the Government.</P>
      <P>But supposing he does not act on the advice of the Government, what happens?  There is again an amendment brought in to meet a situation that was debated on the Second Reading, that there was no way of coercing the President to act as the Government intended him to act or wished him to act, where the Constitution intended that the Government should have power.  Now, we get this Article 14 re-written and introduced in amendment No. 54.  We were told this evening, when the President was asked to analyse that, that he did not know to whose satisfaction failure to exercise his powers had to be established.  In the end he throws out that it is to be established to the satisfaction of the Council of State; and the Council of State is a body of people who can be appointed or dismissed by the President until he gets a group who will agree with his viewpoint.  That what the advice of the Government comes to when analysed down through all the circuits in this Constitution. The President is bound to act on the advice of the Government and, in the end, a decision as to whether he comported himself in accordance with the Constitution, according to the President's statement, is to be determined by the Council of State.  That is no constitutional safeguard for anybody.</P>
      <P>On the special matter of the exercise of the supreme command of the Army, Deputy MacDermot referred me to France.  The French Constitution says that the President shall have a variety of powers, one being: &ldquo;He shall dispose of the armed forces&rdquo;; and the last paragraph of the Article is: &ldquo;Every act of the President of the Republic must be countersigned by a Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot also referred me to Norway and Sweden.  In Sweden, first of all, there is an Article which states that the King shall be the commander-in-chief. Then there is an Article which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Matters of military command, that is to say, decisions in which the King personally acts in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the land and naval forces, shall be decided by the King, when he is personally exercising the executive power, in the presence of the head of the military Department within whose province the matter falls.  The head of that Department is bound, under his responsibility, to express his opinion upon the measures adopted by the King, at the time when such measures are under consideration; should he disapprove of the decision of the King he shall enter his objections and advice upon a minute which the King shall authenticate by his Royal signature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The matters of government which are to be considered matters of military command shall be determined by law enacted by the King and the Riksdag jointly.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's argument was that commissions were held from the King in Norway and Sweden and from the President in France. I do not care whether they are held <Col N="1232" /> from the King or President as long as they are completely and entirely under the control of a Minister, as long as there is somebody here who is responsible to Dáil Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain he is not.  He is only under the control of the Council of State, a body of &ldquo;yes-men,&rdquo; a group of his own.  Consider putting up as a constitutional safeguard a body which is to be appointed in this way.  There are certain people <i>ex officio</i> members, and then, &ldquo;such other persons, if any, as may be appointed by the President under this Article to be members of the Council of State.&rdquo; The Article then goes on: &ldquo;The President may at any time and from time to time by warrant under his hand and seal appoint such other persons as in his absolute discretion he may think fit to be members of the Council of State, but not more than seven persons so appointed shall be members of the Council of State at the same time.&rdquo; He can get that body shifting around from hour to hour.  It is a rubbishy safeguard, if that is the body which is to determine whether the President is acting on the advice of the Government or not.  If we are going to have something embodied in the Constitution, it ought to be a little bit more respectable than a group that can be changed at any moment that the President dislikes them.  The alternative offered is this. This seeks to put in, as an Article of the Constitution requiring a Constitution Amendment Act, that all officers shall hold their commissions from the President.  Why should it be so?  Why should not the Dáil dispose of the armed forces of the community?  Why should not the Minister for Defence, subject to Parliamentary question from day to day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is subject to advice&mdash;the control that the President has?  I will deal later with that argument. It is made a constitutional provision, <Col N="1233" /> unchangeable except in a very rigid way, that all the commissions must be held from the President.  It is a bad, dangerous, insecure position in which to have the President and the Army without a single link.  If there is nothing else in it, I object to that.  Let us look at the rest of it. The supreme command of the forces is to be vested in the President.  The President says that there is a great safeguard, that it is to be regulated by law, and gives us his usual tirade, &ldquo;Do we think that any representative Government or Parliament is going to surrender its authority?&rdquo; I do not think that Parliament will surrender its authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I think of is this: a Government on the eve of going out of office, knowing it is going to be beaten, with a President elected a year before, in for six years, and that Government, by a majority in a dying Parliament, decides that it will pass a law which will hand over certain powers with regard to the military command to the President.  What happens afterwards? The President is to take the advice of the new Government.  But it is the Council of State which will decide whether he is acting on the advice of the Government or not.  That is no safeguard.  The new Government can challenge the new law.  Can the President <Col N="1234" /> determine whether it is a constitutional amendment?  He can.  Then, it goes off to the people and there is delay.</P>
    <P>The President is not so blind to what is happening in Europe.  He told Deputy O'Sullivan that on the Continent he did not know of any place where democracy had been trampled upon, and where representative institutions had been trampled upon, through any such abuse as we raised here. Surely the whole trouble on the Continent, in any country where democratic institutions have been trampled upon, is that people had to pretend that they got the power from the Constitution; but they did it by coercing the people at voting time.</P>
