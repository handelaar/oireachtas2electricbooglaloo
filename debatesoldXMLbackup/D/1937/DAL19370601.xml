      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what is the cause of the delay in giving sanction for the erection of 95 houses on the old workhouse site in Carrick-on-Suir and the scheme for the erection of 12 houses in Carrickbeg; whether he is aware that this scheme has been under consideration for two years, and if he will indicate what steps he proposes taking to expedite its consideration by his Department.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the tenders received the cost of these schemes is very high. The position has, therefore, to be carefully considered in relation to the financial capacity of the urban district as the rates therein are over 19/- in the £.</P>
      <P>The 12 house scheme referred to was postponed by the urban council themselves in October last on the ground of excessive cost in view of the type of tenant proposed.  The matter is to be discussed at the Department this week with representatives and officials of the council.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question no price is fixed for milk produced within the Dublin production district that is supplied to institutions or other bodies for their own use, and it is, accordingly, incorrect to state that the contract entered into by the board of assistance is 3¾d. under the price fixed by the Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) the number of (a) fitters and (b) winchmen, resident in Dublin, who are now unemployed; (2) the number of fitters and winchmen respectively, citizens of Dublin, who have found employment on the erection of the oil refinery buildings at the North Wall, Dublin, and (3) the number of foreign fitters and winchmen respectively who are employed on this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of fitters resident in the Dublin County Borough who were registered for employment at the Dublin Employment Exchange on the 29th May, 1937, was 426; these fitters belonged to 13 different classifications of that occupation.  There were no men registered on that date specifically for employment as winchmen; it is possible that men with experience as winchmen were registered under a number of other classifications but to determine this would have involved the examination of a very large number of applicants.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am informed that no national fitters and eight national winchmen were employed on the 29th May, 1937, on reclamation and dredging work being carried out by Messrs.  Bos and Kalis, a Dutch firm of reclamation and dredging contractors under contract with the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which I assume to be the work that the Deputy has in mind; it was not possible to ascertain if the nationals employed as winchmen were all resident in the Dublin County Borough. In regard to the third part of the Deputy's question I am informed that on the same date no alien fitters and nine alien winchmen were employed on this work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 1, sub-section (1), line 2, and in sub-section (2), line 2, after the word &ldquo;years&rdquo; to insert in each <Col N="1322" /> case the words &ldquo;who can read and write&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to make literacy a condition of the right to vote.  In these days of universal compulsory education, that does not seem unreasonable.  I am sure it is within the knowledge of Deputies, moreover, that the existence of the illiterate vote is sometimes used as a method of intimidation, because men and women who are perfectly well able to read and write and vote in the ordinary way are sometimes intimidated into declaring themselves illiterate so that they shall vote openly and it shall be known which way they vote.  Therefore, both on the ground of the general propriety of expecting literacy from a voter and on the ground of getting rid of the particular abuse to which I have referred, I suggest the advisability of accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has made a very brief and, I think, a very incomplete attempt to establish even a shadow of a case for the amendment. Deputy MacDermot wants to make sure that only persons who can read and write are entitled to vote.  Nobody voluntarily declines to learn to read and nobody voluntarily declines to learn how to write.  People who cannot read or write are the victims of a very imperfect system of education, and the main responsibility for the fact that persons do exist who cannot read or write is a community and a State responsibility; but apparently Deputy MacDermot wants not merely to see these people continuing under the affliction of being unable to read and write, but he wants to impose a further burden on them, namely, to disfranchise them completely.  Imbeciles are at present prevented from voting in an election, and Deputy MacDermot would also prevent the man suffering from the disability of being unable to read and write from voting in an election.  That unfortunate citizen would consequently be bracketed with that class in the community which is at present prevented from voting in an election.  The corollary to this amendment is that anybody who is not entitled to vote and to have a voice in an election of the Government ought <Col N="1323" /> not to be liable for the taxes which the Government impose.  Deputy MacDermot is prepared to say to these people: &ldquo;You cannot vote; you must take the Government which somebody else selects for you&rdquo;; but, at the same time, he is going to make that person responsible for the payment of taxation imposed by the Government in the selection of which that person had no voice.</P>
      <P>If ever there was an amendment reeking with class bias this is it, although Deputy MacDermot frequently tells the House that he has no use whatever for class sentiment. Under this amendment the person who has no reasonable degree of literacy would be prohibited from voting.  He might be a very good citizen; he might be a very conscientious citizen, and he might be a very industrious citizen. He might be a man with a family, and some members of that family might have done honour to the nation by the crafts or occupations which they pursued, but Deputy MacDermot would prevent the man from voting.  Presumably, Deputy MacDermot would not disqualify from voting a person who is a most dishonourable citizen, a most unscrupulous person, who might frequently, in the course of a year or a lifetime, be before the courts and be convicted in a number of definite instances of misbehaviour.  Under this amendment it would be possible for a released burglar or a ticket-of-leave man to vote, but it would not be possible for the honest man who can neither read nor write.  That is the obvious situation which would arise from the passing of an amendment of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy MacDermot that, on thinking it over, he will agree that if there is to be any disqualification at all, it ought to be in respect of persons who are not good citizens. The man who can neither read nor write may be a very good citizen, but the Deputy would disqualify him from voting, while giving to the person who had been convicted of a very serious criminal offence the right to vote.  I think this is a most undemocratic and reactionary amendment.  It reeks with class bias, and instead of disqualifying <Col N="1324" /> such people from voting, we ought to set out on a campaign to ensure&mdash; while we may not be able to correct the present position whereby people of advanced years are not able to read or write&mdash;that it will be impossible in future for any person to declare himself as being unable to read or write, and that it will not be necessary to have a class amendment of this kind submitted in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremly difficult to define good citizens.  If one could confine the vote to good citizens there might be a strong case to be made for it, but I know of no way of defining good citizens.  As regards criminals, convictions are sometimes wrong and the guilt of crimes varies tremendously in degree.  Criminals are sometimes reformed and become good citizens, so that it is plainly impracticable to exclude, even if desirable, from voting, everybody who had been convicted of a crime.  The question of literacy, however, stands on a very different footing.  Deputy Norton calls it undemocratic to exclude illiterates, but I think that if he studies the subject he will find that some of the most reputedly democratic countries in the world exclude them. It is, in a sense, a corollary of universal and compulsory education to exclude illiteracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton speaks of our educational system as being very imperfect. Imperfect it may be, but not so imperfect that anybody with the most modest amount of industry cannot learn to read and write.  Deputy Norton has painted a pathetic picture of the worthy and industrious man who has not learned to read or write, but such individuals must be few in the extreme.  There may be a few very old people who have shown no lack of industry in failing to learn to read and write, but they must be very few, and I suggest that, in these days of compulsory and universal education, the person who does not make himself or herself literate is failing in his or her duty to the community.  The class is a dying and diminishing class and, so far as my experience goes, the chief effect for a good many years of this illiterate vote at election times has been to <Col N="1325" /> cause an undue amount of intimidation to be applied.  People who declare openly what side they are voting for are naturally more subject to intimidation than anybody else, and that very democratic system of the secret ballot is made absolutely futile so far as they are concerned.  As I say, people who are not illiterate at all are sometimes induced to declare themselves illiterate under threat.  It is for those reasons that I think this amendment has a good deal to be said for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy MacDermot ought to withdraw this amendment.  I have always found that illiterate voters in any constituency are always guided by one great principle.  It is the principle which should guide most people, that is, the principle of common sense.  It does not follow at all, as Deputy Norton has said, that because people may have super-education, they have got all the common sense in the world, and illiterate voters are not so easily intimidated at all as Deputy MacDermot might think.  There is ample protection under the Ballot Act for every illiterate voter, and, when an illiterate voter declares how he is going to vote in the polling booth, the agents, the presiding officer and the poll clerk are sworn to secrecy.  If they are honourable people they will not come out of that polling booth and say how a particular person voted.  As a matter of fact, there is a penalty for it.  I think Deputy MacDermot would be well advised to withdraw the amendment. It is hitting a section of the community which should be spared such a blow, and if Deputy MacDermot's experience is that illiterates have been intimidated, and if he had personal knowledge of that sort of thing, it was his obvious duty to look after it at the time.  Apparently he did not, and he feels now that all these people should be disfranchised.  They would be a very big percentage of the register in some places and a bigger percentage than we might like to take credit for.  It is not a worthy amendment and, in all sincerity, I suggest that the Deputy should withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I am not disposed to accept this amendment, apart altogether from any criticism as to whether it does what it is intended to do.  I take it that reading or writing in any language would be quite sufficient for Deputy MacDermot.  I think the Deputy himself gave a good reason for not inserting it.  It refers to what is a diminishing class, and the less we have in the Constitution in the way of disqualification, the better.  There is also considerable substance in some of the points made by Deputy Norton.  There are possibly a number of people at present who are unable to read or write, a condition which is not exactly their fault, and my view is that we should put into this Constitution only what is necessary, and that in regard to the fundamental questions which are at the basis of the whole system of government, we should leave them as open and as free as we can.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 61 refers to disqualifications.  There are certain difficulties in regard to the matter.  We want to make sure that there will not be disqualification solely on the ground of sex.  There is also the question of making the provision so watertight that, if there are disqualifications of any kind, they will not be made on that basis.  As the question has been raised, we want to make the Article as watertight as we can. <Col N="1327" /> We want to provide that citizens, irrespective of sex, will have the franchise and will be entitled to election and, if there are disqualifications, that they will not be disqualifications solely on the ground of sex.  I shall not move the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>In section 1, to delete sub-section 3º and substitute two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3º.  Every head of a family shall have two votes and no more and every other voter one vote and no more at an election for Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>4º.  Voting shall be by secret ballot.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this amendment will be regarded as a &ldquo;monstrously class amendment&rdquo; or not.  It follows, to my mind, as a corollary of Article 41 (1) of the Draft Constitution.  The Article reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1º.  The State recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>2º.  The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I am proposing suggests the recognition of the position of the family, so eloquently described in that Article, by giving an extra vote to the head of the family.  I put the amendment down quite roughly and I am aware that further definition would be needed if the principle were accepted.  We should have to define just what we mean by &ldquo;family&rdquo; and just what we mean by &ldquo;head of the family.&rdquo;  The broad question is whether the position of the family in our social life should be recognised by giving extra voting power to the person who carries the family responsibilities. It seems to me that it is <Col N="1328" /> reasonable we should do so and I should like to hear what the President had to say of the suggestion.</P>

He admits the amendment is very imperfect, yet he wants to put an imperfect amendment into the Constitution. Under this amendment, we should have to define &ldquo;head of the family.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding that there is no definition, the Deputy suggests that this amendment should be inserted.

      <P>There is now going to be a competition between Deputy MacDermot and the President as to who will put the most ráiméis into the Constitution.  So far, I think the President is leading by a substantial distance. If Deputy MacDermot continues to submit amendments of this kind, I warn the President that he had better look out, because he will be in danger of being beaten for first place by Deputy MacDermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no case for this amendment. Deputy MacDermot, having read Article 41, proceeds to search for a way in which he can endow the family and put it in a specially privileged position in the nation.  The only method he can discover of doing this is to give the head of the family&mdash;whoever that may be&mdash;a second vote every five years. That is the endowment which Deputy MacDermot would confer on the family.  If we want to endow the family, we could do so in a thousand more effective and more praiseworthy ways than by merely giving the head of the family&mdash;so far, an indefinable person&mdash;the right to a second vote at elections held, on an average, every four or five years.  We can endow the family with all the majesty and authority we desire by making sure <Col N="1329" /> that, as a family, it can live without being subjected to the misery and hardship that goes hand in hand with unemployment, by housing it properly and by seeing that the members of the family enjoy decent rates of wages and are thereby enabled to fulfil their natural function in life.  If Deputy MacDermot had put down an amendment of that kind, I could understand it.  But the only method which Deputy MacDermot can discover of endowing the family is to give the head of the family a second vote every five years. That is a puerile method of attempting to confer a benefit on the family.</P>
    <P>After he had submitted his amendment, Deputy MacDermot must have realised that it was quite unworkable. You might have a case of a family consisting of an old, infirm mother and a number of sons.  The mother is probably incurable and unable to perform any work&mdash;even her maternal duties in the home.  Three or four sons may be contributing to the maintenance of the household.  Deputy MacDermot would give that chronically infirm mother, who is unable to discharge her maternal duties in the household, two votes and the sons one vote each.  There may be a good reason for doing that but I have not heard it.  Deputy MacDermot has been at pains not to let the House into his secret as to the reason for conferring a double vote in circumstances like those, while giving only a single vote to other members of the family who probably pay the maximum amount of taxation.  Why should they, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the mother, be confined to a single vote?  I think this amendment which Deputy MacDermot has proposed is one that has not any parallel in any other country in the world.</P>

If the Deputy were able to show that the present system is unsatisfactory, and that it did not <Col N="1330" /> confer upon citizens the right which citizens ought properly to have of expressing their viewpoint through the ballot box, one might understand the object of an amendment of this kind, but when you have examined the thing from every standpoint, and make allowances for all the idiosyncrasies that one can discover on the question as to how people should vote, I think that, inevitably, sensible men and woman are driven back to the conviction that the soundest method of arranging a system of voting is one vote for every adult citizen.  Once you get away from the sheet anchorage which that principle gives, you are dragged into all kinds of highways and by-ways and driven to create precedents which are undesirable and anomalies which can never be explained away.</P>

      <P>I am personally of the opinion that we always ought to regard everything upon its merits.  If there is a sensible innovation, then by all means let us adopt it. But when I come to this particular amendment, of course I am in the same position as Deputy Norton and Deputy MacDermot himself: I have not got the remotest idea of what it means. Deputy MacDermot, gravely and seriously, has brought before the House an amendment which he tells us he does not understand himself.  He told us, and told us correctly, that <Col N="1331" /> before you could make it intelligible you would first have to define what it meant by &ldquo; head&rdquo; and that, secondly, you would have to define, a far more difficult thing, what is meant by &ldquo; family&rdquo; I suppose he had at the back of his mind the old Latin phrase, very familiar in Roman law which has passed into currency in these countries, &ldquo;paterfamilias.&rdquo; If so, he knows that a woman can never be the head of a family, so that Deputy Norton need not be troubled as to whether it is an elderly lady or the adult son who is to get the double vote.</P>
      <P>How is the unfortunate officer who has to fix the votes&mdash;in practice, I think, this work is done now by the county registrars&mdash;going to go into the details of every family and decide as to who is the head of that family. Suppose you have two families living under the one roof, a father and a mother and a married son.  Are these two families or one family?  It would be absolutely impossible for the county registrar to decide.  This certainly, in my opinion, is not a thing which should be in the Constitution.  I think the Constitution should have as little as possible in it.  I agree entirely with Deputy Norton that a terrible waste of time would be involved in putting general propositions into a Constitution, general propositions which really, in effect, mean nothing.  This certainly should not be in the Constitution at all.  If I am not mistaken, the President has agreed to accept an amendment to substitute the words &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; for single transferable vote.  If that is so, then it would be unconstitutional to have the single transferable vote exercised by means of proportional representation, because on occasion it is not the single transferable vote you would have but the double transferable vote. I say again that this is not a thing that should be in the Constitution. Since no man can put an intelligible meaning on the amendment it should not, in my opinion, be acted upon and should not appear in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney cannot afford to be quite as critical as he is about the inexactitude of others, because in his concluding <Col N="1332" /> remarks he overlooked the fact that in sub-section (3) of Section 1 of Article 16 it becomes unconstitutional to introduce any legislation whereby a voter may exercise more than one vote at an election for Dáil Eireann.  The fact of that being there makes it, of course, impossible to deal with this subject of extra family vote otherwise than by putting it into the Constitution if you are going to have it at all.  I make the confession about this amendment that it is not the fruit of my own brain.  There are a good many people in this country who are eager to see some extra stability given to the State by this special family representation, and who, moreover, do sincerely believe in, and agree with, the declaratory Articles that I read in introducing the amendment about the importance of the family, the importance of extending its authority and the importance of emphasising the family outlook in political affairs as compared to an irresponsible individualistic outlook.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I was asked to put this amendment down.  I think the subject is worth discussing because this question of the importance of the family is something more solid, more influential and more active to-day than it has been during the past century. It is a subject that is to the fore in a great many other countries besides this.  It arises very directly out of the various Encyclicals which this country and others desire to make, as much as possible, the foundation of their social policy.  It is worth while, at any rate, considering whether nothing can be done to give the family extra authority in political affairs.  If the principle were once adopted that it was desirable to give the family some extra influence and authority, then in spite of what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Norton have said, I do think that we could devise some formula for doing it.  We might require the head of the family to be not only nominally, but economically, responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would rule out the bed-ridden old widow who, Deputy Norton suggested, might be the head of the family and substitute somebody who was the main support of the household.  At any rate, it is worth while bringing <Col N="1333" /> the subject forward for discussion with a view to finding out whether it has at all engaged the attention of the Government, as, I think, it should have engaged their attention; and, if they are so zealous to promote family feeling and family influence, as the terms of these Articles of the Constitution would indicate them to be, I think it might be worth while, if for that reason only, to bring this matter forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment either, Sir.  It must be obvious to every member of the Dáil that a change like that could not be introduced here without causing a lot of controversy.  If such an amendment were to be accepted now, it would mean that Parties would put that forward as, perhaps, a thankless programme; but that, thankless or not, there would be a great deal of controversy about it.  Accordingly, from the point of view of not putting into the Constitution something that would permit of a great deal of controversy, I am against this amendment.  I do not agree, however, with some of the arguments that have been used against it.  I think that, if we were beginning here, and if it were generally accepted that each adult should not have a vote, a good deal of a case could be made for this amendment and there might be quite a number of people in the country who, probably, would accept it; but you can make up your mind that, even then, there would be a great deal of controversy about it, and I think that we have enough matters about which there is controversy without raising this matter.  There is no doubt that, in its general principle, it would run in accord with the general principle or idea of the family being the principal unit group, but, as a matter of fact, I think that the number of families in the country which would take the opposite view might be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that there is a good deal of unanimity amongst the families of the country on this matter of voting. On the ground of principle, a good case can be made for the amendment, but there does not seem to be any need for it at the moment, and certainly <Col N="1334" /> I think that we should not bring it in&mdash;at least, in connection with a measure of this kind.  It is a matter that can be dealt with separately. Anybody can bring it in as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>As regards the practicability of it, I am not convinced at all that it would not be practicable.  On the contrary, I think that it might be practicable. I have no objection to the general terms of it.  Undoubtedly, when amendments like this are put down &mdash;particularly by private Deputies&mdash;it is not expected that the final form of the amendment would be in precisely the same terms in which it is first stated.  It is generally accepted as a principle that the idea would be that the parliamentary draftsmen, or some other skilled persons, would draft the amendment and bring it into line with the general scheme of the particular Bill concerned.  Apart, however, from the general question of whether or not this would be practicable, there is the point that we should not have it here, in my opinion, because, undoubtedly, it would be a highly controversial matter.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is that voting shall be compulsory.  This is a matter that, to use the argument that Deputy Norton loves to use, has been tried in other countries, I believe, and I understand that it was found to be a success in other countries.  It is a question for the House to consider, whether a person who can vote, and who is not prevented in any way from voting, should not be compelled by law <Col N="1335" /> to exercise his duties as a citizen, because, after all, it is one of the main duties of a citizen to carry out his functions as a citizen, and one of these functions is to vote, according to his conscience, as to whom he considers to be the best person to occupy the position of a representative of the nation.</P>

As far as I know, very few people in the country believe in it.  After all, there is liberty for any voter to vote or to abstain from voting as he thinks fit, and I believe that there should be such liberties.  I hold that it is a menace to the freedom of a citizen and to the citizen's liberty of action that he should be compelled to vote, and I do not believe that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney himself would hold with it, although he has moved this amendment.</P>

    <P>However, I think that if Deputy McGilligan had been sitting beside him, he would have been rather embarrassed this evening, because Deputy McGilligan, the other evening, treated us to a number of incisive speeches <Col N="1336" /> urging that particular features of this Constitution should be rejected because they had no parallel in any other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I did not catch what the Deputy said.  However, I imagine that if this were a real Party amendment, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney would speak with his customary enthusiasm and heat in favour of it, but instead of that he adopted a most demure and meek attitude in moving the amendment.  I imagine that he would be embarrassed if he were to be put in the position of actually having to vote for the amendment, and I think it might be worth while, perhaps, to compel him to vote for it so as to ensure that he would not again jump into the hazardous position in which he finds himself this evening. This matter of compulsory voting is a thing that has troubled many nations. As a matter of fact, there are two points of view on it in other countries. A good case can be made, in theory, for compulsory voting&mdash;the compelling of every citizen to exercise the duties that he owes to the State&mdash;and if the logical corollary of that is that the citizen should be compelled to vote at elections, we can only say that the proposal to make the citizen vote at elections has generated a good deal of heat in a number of countries; and while it may be worth while to require a citizen compulsorily to record his vote I think that we ought to consider this from the standpoint of our own people and their reactions to it to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very big principle is raised in this particular amendment.  It must be remembered that, big as this principle is, out of a House of 153 Deputies, a little more than 20 are discussing this <Col N="1337" /> matter.  It may be that a good case can be made for an amendment of this kind, but I rather think that, whatever that case is, it ought to be subject to an examination by some committee or some commission, so that we might have all the facts of the case collated with a view to the experience of the manner in which this arrangement works in other countries.  Then, if we were satisfied that it was something that would commend itself to the overwhelming majority of our people, it is not necessary to put this provision into the Constitution, because it is the kind of matter which should be dealt with in an Electoral Act and although Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is now presumably full of enthusiasm for compulsory voting, it is rather noteworthy that his own Party when in office, although they introduced a number of Electoral Acts, did not once think it was desirable to put a provision of this kind into them.  It may be that they were wrong and that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney is right but the fact remains that the Party for which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney now speaks did not, apparently, favour this proposal when they were in office. Apparently they do not seem very enthusiastic about it this evening either, because there are only about four members of the Party present in the House to support Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in this amendment.  I think that whatever merits a proposal of this kind possesses should be examined by a committee or commission, so that we might, if we felt it desirable, introduce compulsory voting only after the matter had been thoroughly examined. I do not think it is proper to deal with the position by having an amendment of this kind inserted by a small House at the end of a four-year Parliament, and without giving the matter that careful consideration which I feel should be given to this question before it is inserted in the Constitution as a principle of voting in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most obvious answer to the amendment which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has moved is the principle which he laid <Col N="1338" /> down himself a few moments ago, that we should put as little in the Constitution as possible, because there is nothing at all in the Constitution to prevent a measure for compulsory voting being brought in in the ordinary way and passed.  As we are discussing the subject of compulsory voting, I should like to say that I think that there is a stronger case to be made for it than has been made.  The proposal does not seem at all so absurd as Deputy Donnelly suggests.  In principle, I do not see why to compel a man to vote should be more tyrannical than to compel him to pay his taxes or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to compel him to serve in the Army as, of course, is done and has to be done in many countries.  It does not seem to me inherently unreasonable that a man should be compelled to present himself at the polling station and to mark a ballot paper.  The case is all the stronger where you have proportional representation, because a man has a list of names and he can mark them 1, 2, 3, 4 in the order of his choice.  He may dislike them all or disapprove of them all, but he has the opportunity, at any rate, of expressing the measure of his disapproval, which is rather different from voting outright for one candidate as opposed to another candidate. In other words, a man can find out as much as possible about the personality of the various candidates and indicate the order in which he thinks they ought to be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to leave him the freedom, if he goes to the polling station, of spoiling his paper.  The main thing is to get him there, and it seems to me that one argument of a democratic kind that has not been mentioned is that it would surely immensely diminish the expense of elections if Parties and individuals had not got to pay for conveyances in order to get voters to the booth.  If the voters had to go there, the unfortunate people standing for the Dáil would be relieved of very substantial expense.  It might be that that would put on the Government the onus of providing transport <Col N="1339" /> where necessary in order to get all voters to the stations, and I see no great objection to that.  I should be very glad indeed if the Government did have the duty placed upon them of providing whatever was necessary by way of transport to get voters to the poll, where these voters lived at such a distance from the polling stations that it would be unreasonable to expect them to go there on foot.  I think it was worth while to introduce this amendment and to get the matter discussed, because it is not at all absurd, as has been suggested, that people should be expected to go to the polling stations and to vote.  When a man has a vote, he should be expected to take sufficient interest in it to go to the polling station on election day.  After all, nobody proposes that the penalty for his not doing so should be anything very severe.  A fine is suggested.  If a man is too lazy to go to the polling station, why should he not have to pay a fine for his indolence and lack of public spirit in staying at home?</P>

      <P>I had not the good fortune of hearing Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's argument in favour of the amendment, but I did have the advantage of hearing Deputy MacDermot's arguments, and I confess they somewhat surprised me.  The point of his argument in favour of the amendment was that the real object should be to get voters to the poll.  That does not seem to me to be a desirable object at all, because if a voter has no opinion worth recording, his vote may be of very little use.  If he himself thinks his opinion is not sufficiently valuable to justify his recording it, then, <i>a fortiori</i>, he should not be compelled to vote.  It does seem to me that any question of tyranny in this matter points in the other direction.  I do not suggest that it is tyrannical to compel a voter who may hold certain opinions to record his vote, but it is tyrannical to make somebody who thinks that his opinion may not be worth recording, to record that opinion and thereby compel him to take part in shaping the Government of the country.  Those who have a very low opinion of their own opinions are likely to be right in their <Col N="1340" /> assumption, and it does not seem to me proper that we should insist that these relatively worthless opinions ought to be recorded, and should be regarded as of equal weight with the votes of those who have given some consideration to the question they are going to decide in the polling booth.  The essential question seems to be, in regard to any election, to get the opinion of those whose opinions are worth having. You may assume that every man has an opinion worth having, but if he does not join in that assumption himself, it does seem to me dangerous to insist on his recording an opinion which he thinks is not worth recording.  The really important question is the value of the votes recorded, not the number of people who are forced to vote.  It is a question of getting the opinion of people who vote voluntarily, without any element of compulsion, in other words, of getting the largest record possible of the opinions of people who themselves think that their opinions are worth recording.  I had not the good fortune of hearing Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's arguments on the amendment, but what I have heard from Deputy MacDermot increases my reluctance to support such an amendment.</P>

      <P>As will be seen from the remarks of those who have spoken, there are two schools of thought on this matter.  It has been tried, and apparently with a certain amount of success, in certain countries, and, of course, there is a number of other countries like ourselves where the vote is on a voluntary basis.  If you try to analyse the reasons which are put forward by the one school or the <Col N="1341" /> other I think that, in our case at any rate, the balance will be in favour of leaving it voluntary, as it stands. The reasons put forward by the advocates of the compulsory vote are very often based on such ideas as that the extreme Parties, the hot Parties, will always be able to get their people to vote; that what is called the moderate central group are not sufficiently interested to vote at all, and that somehow or other you must, by imposing penalties, compel that moderate section to come and express itself at the polls, the assumption being that if they do come they are sufficiently intelligent to exercise the vote properly.  But, I think, there is a number of assumptions behind that which are not fully justified at all. Then you have on the other side those who hold by the voluntary system and say: &ldquo;You can bring a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.&rdquo;  You can undoubtedly force a voter to come to the poll, but if that voter is not interested enough to come without compulsion then he has probably not interested himself sufficiently to be able to exercise a wise choice, and to know what exactly are the merits of the issues on which he has to vote.  The House has already heard both sides of the argument. My attitude towards the amendment, if pursued, is such that I should have to oppose it.  I should like to make one further point.  This could be done by independent law at any time if the need for it were apparent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 2, sub-section 50, line 1, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;upon principles of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is really to allow a considerable amount of elasticity in connection with the adoption of any particular principle of proportional representation. Under the original Article 26 elections were held on principles of proportional representation.  Under the proposal as it stands in sub-section <Col N="1342" /> 5 of Section 2 of this Article we pin our faith to one particular system of proportional representation, namely proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.  The provision in the original Article 26 allowed of complete elasticity in the selection of any particular system of proportional representation, provided only that it was proportional representation. The system that we have at the present time, which has been in operation here in this country for the last 15 years, may or may not be the best system.  In addition to that, it may be that some mathematician will at some future time devise a better method of giving effect to election by means of the principle of proportional representation.  I suggest that, as long as you maintain in the Constitution the principle that you will elect on proportional representation, that is adequate, and that it is a mistake to pin your faith to one particular system of proportional representation. The rules which are contained in the Electoral Act of 1923 were devised in this country.  They are the product of Irish brains, which I am sure will appeal to the President.  The point I make about that is that they had to be made here, but you will not find them in any book; you will not find them in any treatise on proportional representation or the single transferable vote. I do not know whether or not they are actually in accord with what would be the ordinary opinion as to principles of proportional representation.  At all events they were devised here in this country, and they have worked extremely well, I admit, but I wish to emphasise the fact that at some time or another some mathematician may find out that there is some mistake in those rules, or, alternatively, may devise a much better system than exists at the moment.  What my amendment aims at is to allow of such a system being adopted if circumstances should disclose that it would be wise to adopt such a system.  I think we should allow a little elasticity, and not make the matter as rigid as it is proposed to make it in this particular clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily I would be inclined to take the line that has been suggested by Deputy <Col N="1343" /> Costello in regard to matters of this sort, that is to leave the road open; but I think where there is a question of the foundation of the whole system of parliamentary representation we have got to be a little bit careful.  The Deputies on the opposite benches were very concerned to prevent the possibility of abuse by law of phrases like &ldquo;disqualified by law.&rdquo; You can abuse the whole system very easily if you work over the whole range of systems of proportional representation, and you can arrive at something which would be very far from being properly described as a system of proportional representation at all.  The line I took was rather the opposite to that taken by Deputy Costello on this matter.  I said it was very important that we should have the foundation generally accepted and pretty firm, a foundation that could not be changed unless by the express will of the people.  This is not absolutely rigid. This Constitution can be changed by a vote of the people in any respect that may be found necessary.  If Parliament is convinced that there is a better method, it will not be difficult to have an amendment on that line put forward at the time of an election, or previous to that if it would be too long to wait until the following election. If you have these referenda for changing the Constitution roughly at the time of elections, you will certainly save a good deal of expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country: we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of proportional representation here.  It gives a certain amount of stability, and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.  I understood when I was in opposition that this whole principle of proportional representation was being threatened, and I was rather anxious here that we would ensure in the Constitution a reasonable basis for proportional representation. I put the limit at three, because if you have a three-member constituency, any group that represents over <Col N="1344" /> one-fourth of the constituency can get a member.  If you have a five-member constituency, any group that has a strength of over one-sixth of the total vote ought to be able to get a member. I think that five is probably ideal.  Three and five will probably be ideal, but you want to leave elasticity so as to be able to deal with the difficulties that you have in various constituencies with different numbers, different areas, and all that.  Consequently what we are trying to do here in this is to set the lowest limit.  I think everybody will admit that if you get below three you practically have no proportional representation in the ordinary sense at all.</P>
    <P>No Party can go below three.  Above three you could have three or four groups.  On the other hand, I do not think when dealing with electoral law here we could get many Deputies to vote for a large number of Parties.  The result could be a grouping of Parties manoeuvring in Parliament which does not make for good government and does not make for real progress.  I am approaching it from the opposite angle to Deputy Costello.  My view is that it is better, when dealing with fundamental law, with the right to vote and how the vote shall be exercised, to define, and to take away from Parties the temptation to manoeuvre with systems so as to get Party advantage. Consequently I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is certainly open to abuse.  Even as it stands, this Article if used by an unscrupulous Parliamentary group, could nullify proportional representation.  The rules of the Electoral Act, for instance, could be amended by ordinary legislation.  I have no objection to the second part of the Article: &ldquo;whereby the number of members to be returned for any constituency should be less than three.&rdquo; What I am pleading for is that there should be a certain amount of elasticity in connection with the type of <Col N="1345" /> proportional representation which may at any time be adopted, so that if a better system than the one we have can be devised we could be at liberty to adopt it.  I rather fancy that this Article would prevent that if there was any better system subsequently thought of.  As regards the abuses the President fears from the grouping of Parties, or from the intrigues that might go on, as a result of a large number of Parties being returned by proportional representation, I think that, to a certain extent, is inherent in any system of proportional representation. We have been fortunate or misfortunate, if you like, in this country in having two big political Parties with big issues dividing them. It may be&mdash;and the probability is&mdash;that in the course of time the issues that divide these Parties will be completely swept aside.  Then we will have inevitably under the system of proportional representation we have, a large number of Parties returned to this House.</P>
      <P>Under the system of the single transferable vote we are bound to have a large number of Parties returned. Besides the main Parties, we might have a Farmers' Party, a Labour Party, a Country Party, a Town Party, and an Independent Party.  Whole groups of people might be returned under proportional representation.  We always understood that the real defect under any system of proportional representation, and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned, making for instability in government.  That is inherent in the system of proportional representation and the single transferable vote.  If I might say so with respect, the President is deluding himself about this single transferable vote going to prevent, at a future time of emergency, a large number of small Parties arising.  That is almost inevitable. However, I have drawn attention to the matter.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Costello has mentioned the matter, as the President knows, I was never in favour <Col N="1346" /> of proportional representation.  I believe the single member constituency and a straight fight would obviate the position that Deputy Costello seems to visualise.  If the big issues are swept aside and if proportional representation remains, it is quite possible, with the number of groups that will be manoeuvring and all the rest, the position will be chaotic in future when trying to get a Government.  I always thought the single member constituency the best.  I believe it is.  I told the President so.  Under proportional representation, I am afraid, you will always have difficulties.  As Deputy Costello says, if the questions that separate the big Parties were out of the way, and if proportional representation remains, I do not know what kind of confused form of representation would remain, having regard to the different alignments and different viewpoints there will be.  Proportional representation is what I would describe as a mathematical freak which was imposed in 1921 by Mr. Lloyd George, who took good care not to apply it to the British people.  It was tried on this country in 1921 for the first time.  I would rather see a straight fight and in that way eliminate the chaotic conditions that Deputy Costello seems to visualise. Instead of having three or five members, I would rather see the old single parliamentary constituency.</P>

I was rather anticipating something than dealing with the amendment before the House.  I mentioned a number of Parties.  My attitude on this amendment is that it is better to have the foundation as firm as possible, with as little likelihood of variation as possible, unless there is a definite likelihood of putting it before the country.  I am honestly afraid of the temptation there might be to political Parties to start manoeuvring with various systems of proportional representation for purely Party purposes.</P>

      <P>In Section 2, sub-section 6º, line 2, to delete the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to increase the minimum number of seats in a constituency from three to five. The President has stated one of the reasons for it, namely, that proportional representation can scarcely have the result sought from proportional representation in a small constituency.  That has been always the fundamental principle with all the advocates of proportional representation, that constituencies should be large.  Otherwise, the emergence of minorities into representation becomes practically impossible.  I have always felt that there was a good deal to be said for the single-member constituency system.  Certainly I would enjoy&mdash;and I am sure I am not singular in that&mdash;having a constituency of my own, with no one else to share it, and having to fight for it each time on my own.  That would be a pleasanter form of representation but we have not got that system for reasons which, perhaps deserved to predominate as they did.  Proportional representation was adopted, and if we are to have the name of proportional representation we ought to have the reality. I contend that the reality is not there if you have as many small constituencies returning only three members as were created by the last Redistribution of Constituencies Bill two or three years ago.  It is for that reason that I put down the amendment increasing the minimum from three to five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave some reasons already, by way of anticipation, for my objection to making the minimum five. I agree with Deputy MacDermot that, if you were looking to the results of proportional representation without having thought of anything else, probably a number like five would be the best.  Five would seem to be the ideal number&mdash;I think seven is too high&mdash; but an odd number is better than an even number.  Five would probably be the ideal, but then you have difficulties of various kinds.  The higher the number is, the more you make for multiplicity <Col N="1348" /> of Parties.  What we put here is a minimum.  We are not saying that an Electoral Act should not provide for five-member constituencies but, on the whole, I think we ought not to set the minimum too high.  As a matter of fact, there would be, of course, an immediate and direct difficulty, as the law as it stands would have to go and you would have to have a new Redistribution Bill.  We have to have Redistribution Bills at certain periods on account of the movement of population, etc., but it is advisable to get this fundamental law as fixed as we can.</P>
      <P>The fact that the existing redistribution has only just taken place would be a reason why we should not put anything in this Constitution which would run counter to that.  The idea is that the minimum would be three. At present we have three-member, four-member, five-member, and seven-member constituencies&mdash;very few four-member ones I think, the reason being that, with an even number, we do not get as good a result as with an odd number.  I think the majority of the constituencies at present are three-member, five-member and seven-member constituencies, but I do not know the Electoral Act very well.</P>

      <P>I object to the Deputy withdrawing the amendment which he has moved.  When the Deputy has a good case, and this is the best case he has had this evening, he ought to stand by it and not run away from it. Deputy MacDermot has quite correctly said that if the country commits itself to the principle of proportional representation, then we ought to try out proportional representation under circumstances that will enable us to get some of the substantial benefits from it.  The President has acknowledged, in effect, that you do in fact get the maximum benefits from proportional representation the greater the number of vacancies to be filled.</P>
      <P>In the present Electoral Act we acknowledge that it is desirable to have proportional representation, and we arrange constituencies in such a way that, for instance, in Tipperary it is possible for any group which represents one-eighth of the electorate there to secure representation for that particular constituency.  But, when we come to Wicklow, we say: &ldquo;You cannot get representation for Wicklow unless you are one-fourth.&rdquo; Then we move to Laoighis-Offaly and say: &ldquo;You cannot get representation there unless you are one-sixth.&rdquo; We move then to Carlow-Kildare and say: &ldquo;You cannot get representation there except you are one-fifth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a very good case can be made for a fixed number of Deputies in each constituency.  Let the fixed number be such a minimum as will give us the maximum benefits from proportional representation, blending the desire to get the maximum benefits with the territory that it is possible for any group to cover effectively in an election campaign.  When you come to ascertaining what are the benefits to be obtained from proportional representation, you find that these benefits are less visible in the case of three-member constituencies, because in three-member constituencies the opportunity for the exercise of the transferable vote <Col N="1350" /> is much less than it is where the constituency is a five-member or a seven-member constituency.</P>
    <P>The extent to which you have proportional representation in a three-member constituency is extremely limited indeed.  The maximum benefits of proportional representation are obtained from the larger constituencies. A case could be made against a seven-member constituency on the ground that, in the rural areas in particular, it is necessary to cover a very large area in order to extend over a territory or a constituency that would justify the return of seven Deputies.  But that case cannot be made in connection with a five-member constituency.  I think, therefore, that a good case could be made for Deputy MacDermot's amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly, of course, says that he does not believe in proportional representation at all.  Of course, if you want a Parliament to steam-roll legislation through, there is no purpose at all in proportional representation. We should not, in fact, tolerate an Opposition at all.  What we should do is to arrange things in such a way as to get a group into Parliament and take care to keep out everybody who interferes with them.  In that way, of course, you will pass Bills more quickly.  They will not be as good Bills as under the system of proportional representation and you will not have the Parliamentary checks that you have where you can secure, as a result of an election, a balancing of the elements that go to make up a nation. No nation is comprised of people of one particular outlook.  People are dissimilar in outlook and in economic and political thought.  The best Parliament, the Parliament that gives the greatest amount of stability and makes for the greatest measure of progress, is not a Parliament where there is an overwhelming majority in favour of the Government and an insignificant minority opposed to the Government, but a pretty well-balanced Parliament. Of course, if a Government is to function, clearly the Government will have to have a majority; but when it has a majority to enable it to function the next best thing is to have a well-balanced Parliament.  That is the <Col N="1351" /> Parliament which produces the best legislation.  I think Deputy MacDermot ought to make a stand for this amendment, because it is the best amendment he has submitted to-day.  I encourage him, therefore, to muster all his enthusiasm for this amendment.</P>

      <P>Proportional representation on paper is a perfect system, but when you come to practice you run up against all sorts of difficulties.  If you are going to increase&mdash;as Deputy MacDermot apparently originally wanted and does not want now, and as Deputy Norton apparently wants all the time&mdash;constituencies to a very big size, in my view you are going in effect to nullify the principles of proportional representation because we all know that when you put Carlow and Kilkenny together or Carlow and Kildare together you will find the Kildare men will be voting for the Kildare candidates irrespective of anything else and you will find the Carlow men voting for Carlow candidates irrespective of the fact that they are one constituency.</P>
      <P>It is all right in Kerry, where you have one county and they are all Kerrymen, and they will stand loyally by one another.  Corkmen will do the same and stand loyally by Corkmen.  When you find Leitrim and Sligo together you find the Leitrim man voting for Leitrim candidates, one, two and three, merely because they happen to be Leitrimmen, and Sligomen will do the same thing&mdash;they will vote one, two, and three for the Sligo candidates.  So in practice, the fact of having a big constituency is nullifying proportional representation completely.  But when you find, as in the Act in operation at the moment, that you want to get some sort of a constituency in which proportional representation may work, you are reduced to the position of putting bits of Carlow into Kildare or little bits of Carlow into Wicklow, and the thing approaches very near a nullity.</P>

Deputy Norton said if we had <Col N="1352" /> single constituencies we would have certain results.  Any Government that comes to pass Bills has to have a majority, and if the Government has got the majority of the votes of the people they are entitled to put through what legislation they wish.  No Government can act or get power without the votes of the people.  If people are a minority they are a minority by the votes of the people.  It is the privilege of minorities to suffer.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly and I will talk this thing out in private.  With regard to the figure &ldquo;five,&rdquo; I am willing to admit that if I were choosing a system, and that I could do it, I would choose &ldquo;five&rdquo; But look at what you would have. You would have to indicate areas where you would have &ldquo;five&rdquo; in every constituency.  Everyone knows that if we were to have constituencies of five members we would have to break up geographical units.  What we have to do is to work on the existing geographical units.  But then there are changes going on in population and if one tries to get equality of representation over the country as a whole, it is not an easy problem to try to preserve those constituencies in anything like rigid five-seat constituencies. Even if you were to start with a new country and you were to carve it up into units of five-seat constituencies, you would find that in a short time the movement of population would work in such a way that the constituencies would have to be carved up again.  The benefits of proportional representation are better when you have the most mathematical representation of the views of the population in the Parliament.  I must distinguish between the two.  I think we get, probably, in this country more than in any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you take the countries where proportional representation exists, you get better balanced results than you get in the other countries.  I think we get the benefits of proportional representation in reasonably balanced legislation here better than in any other country that I have read about or know anything about.  The future, however, may change that; but for the present that is the fact on which observers agree, that we probably get the best results here.  We are not mathematically perfect in getting representation, even though the representation is very good.  What we have not here is representation for a very small group divided throughout the <Col N="1354" /> country, with only a small number in each constituency.  These cannot get representation in Parliament.  That is a fact.  The moment you try to meet that by enlarging constituencies, or by any other device, you are facing difficulties and dangers of a worse character.  For that reason, I am anxious that we should not disturb the position we have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The real reason why we are arguing on this matter is that the President has already disturbed the position.  The recently passed Constituency Act had for its object the carving up of constituencies so that the number of 3-member constituencies was enlarged.  Let us take the North Dublin constituency.  That was not a gigantic constituency from the territorial point of view.  A twopenny tram would get one from one end of the constituency to the other.  The Government introduced a Bill, and that Bill divided the constituency into two. There was not any outery from the people of Dublin for the division of that constituency.  I happen to know the constituency well and I did not hear a single citizen getting excited or passionately enthusiastic about the carving up of that constituency.  Again the County Dublin constituency has been carved up into a five-member constituency and a three-member constituency. Kerry was carved up and created a three-member constituency and a four-member constituency, though the county had survived over a long period as a single constituency.  We find that the Cork constituencies have been carved up also, the whole idea apparently being to create as many three-member constituencies as possible.  The results of the legislation passed proved that that particular objective was achieved.  The Constituencies Act, or the Redistribution of Seats Act, left us with 15 three-member constituencies; eight four-member constituencies; eight five-member constituencies, and three seven-member constituencies. A much greater number of three-member constituencies existed when the Redistribution of Seats Act was passed than before it was introduced. Far from being asked to disturb the previous position, all the <Col N="1355" /> President was asked to do was to leave the previous position alone; in other words to get back to the position that he needlessly disturbed by the Redistribution of Seats Act.  There has been more carving under this Redistribution of Seats Act than was necessary. Carlow, which was formerly combined with Kilkenny for electoral purposes, returned five members, but as a result of the surgical operation performed by the Redistribution of Seats Act, a portion of it is now thrown into Wexford, another portion into Wicklow, and another portion into Kildare.  There are people in County Carlow who are still in doubt as to whether, for electoral purposes, they are in the portion combined with Kildare, with Wicklow, or with Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has made no case against this amendment.  All that is necessary under the amendment is, first of all, to retrace the step the President's Party took when they passed the Redistribution of Seats Act, and retrace that step in such a way that they will create a position whereby five-member constituencies will be the minimum.  That will ensure that you can exercise the principle of proportional representation to a greater extent, and get the maximum representation for the various elements of the community.  Of course, Deputy Donnelly would not bother about these small elements.  Minorities are made to <Col N="1356" /> suffer&mdash;that is the viewpoint of Deputy Donnelly.  That will be heartening information in Stormont this evening, when Deputy Donnelly's speech is published in the Belfast papers.  It will be great consolation in Stormont, and every nationalist who opens his mouth in the Six Counties will be told that in the view of Deputy Donnelly it is their business to suffer; that is their destiny and they ought to be glad to suffer. That was bad enough, but when we are told that the President is now slavishly carrying out the Lloyd Georgian electoral system, the position is worse. There is no other meaning to be attached to Deputy Donnelly's statement this evening than that this was a Lloyd George creation.</P>

      <P>I may be quite brief on this.  If I were asked to choose, I would take the length of time set out in our present Act as about the best I could think of.  I think five years is a reasonable time, and I think longer than that would be a mistake, but I feel&mdash;and remember that we are having a fairly rigid Constitution&mdash;that there might be some set of circumstances in which it might be justifiable to have a longer period.  This period of seven years is simply designed to give a little more room than the five years at present fixed.  As I say, if there was an Act being brought in, I would hold to the present period and would strongly oppose going beyond it. There might possibly be circumstances, however, in which it would be advisable to lengthen Parliament for some particular crisis or something of that sort, and this was designed to leave a little more space between what I think is the ideal period in the Act, five years, and the maximum which is in the Constitution.  That is the only reason.</P>

      <P>Do I understand from the President that he contemplates a Parliament extending its own life?  I think that is the only case he actually does contemplate in respect of a sudden crisis.  Is that not rather objectionable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very open mind on this.  The point is that you might have a condition of war, for example, or some other very difficult situation, and it might not be possible to have an election.  There might be general agreement in Parliament, and in the country generally, that it was advisable to extend the life of the Parliament.  I think there was a case in England where they extended Parliament&mdash;I think it was during the War&mdash;for some years.  Of course, they have not got the same situation as we would have with a rigid Constitution, but I was envisaging a situation that might arise in which it was necessary to extend the life of Parliament and yet, on account of the difficulty of changing the Constitution, it could not be done.  My view is that, ordinarily, you will have a greater opportunity of meeting any crisis that might arise by leaving a gap of two years between the normal period in the Act and the maximum which is in the Constitution.  As I say, I make no point on it.  That is the only <Col N="1359" /> reason I had in mind and I would be one of those who would very strongly oppose the continuation of the life of a Parliament by itself beyond the period stated, and also if we were dealing with a new Act of Parliament, I would hold for five years.  I think five years is a good mean.  It works out on an average at about four years, so that the electorate are consulted on an average about every four years.  Too frequent elections I do not think are advisable, both from the point of view of getting a programme put through and also from the point of view of the convenience of the public.  Again, it is a question of whether there is a danger we ought to avoid in leaving the possibility of a Parliament, without sufficiently good reason, extending its own life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>After hearing and carefully considering what the President has said, I would certainly urge that there should not be more than one year extra allowed to a Parliament. This business of Parliament prolonging its own life is, in principle, as the President agrees, very objectionable. One can imagine an emergency in which it might be desirable, but such emergencies must be very few and far between.  I doubt if such an emergency will arise in this country, and I think that such an emergency will be sufficiently taken care of if we substitute, as I propose in the amendment, six years for seven years as the outside limit of the life of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting my own judgment against that of the Deputy in this, and nothing more.  If I had to vote, I would vote for seven years on the ground that it would be a very awkward thing indeed if you had a situation in which you had Parliament terminating just in the middle of a period.  You want a reasonable period.  The point is: Will you ever have a situation in which there would be any likelihood in normal circumstances of an attempt to abuse this?  There might be, but I think it is unlikely, and rather than put the country in the difficulty in <Col N="1360" /> which it would find itself in any crisis by having no possibility of extension of Parliament, I would rather err in the opposite direction.  I will let the House decide, so to speak, but I would vote for the seven-year period.</P>

      <P>To a man of the profound democratic instincts of the President, it may seem improbable, but everybody who becomes Prime Minister may not be so fully democratic.

I think we should be very slow to give more than the minimum of elasticity in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last point in Deputy MacDermot's remarks is the case that can be made for this amendment. If this Constitution goes through in the manner provided in this Article, it will be possible for any Government to continue in office for a period of seven years, once it holds a majority in the House.  That is the temptation which this Article puts before the Government.  The President said that, in normal circumstances, the people will be consulted every five years, but there may be circumstances <Col N="1361" /> in which a Government, knowing at the end of the five years that its stock is not too high in the country, having perhaps come out of recent political events none too well, and perhaps having been engaged in some kind of disreputable transactions that have lowered its stock, might proceed to discover all kinds of specious reasons why Parliament should be prolonged to seven years.  Having made up their mind that it was desirable to avoid an election at the end of the normal five-year period, and being anxious to carry on for seven years, they look at the Constitution and ask: &ldquo;What does that permit?  It permits us to remain in office for seven years, so long as we command a majority. We have the majority and we propose to stay in office for seven years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The President says that normally there will be an election at the end of five years, but this is a Constitution which is not going to exist merely for the lifetime of the present Government. It is a permanent Constitution, and when you balance on one side the reasons given by the President for extending the period to seven years, and, on the other hand, the dangers inherent in this Constitution as drawn in this respect, I think that all the argument is in favour of not extending the period beyond six years.  In that way, we can avoid the possibility of a Government, without any justification whatever, clinging on to office, although the electorate may be only craving for an opportunity of driving them from office.  I think, on the balance, there is a better case to be made for six years than for seven years.  I think the danger to which Deputy MacDermot referred, of a Government being anxious to cling on to office, although it has no majority in the country, is a very real danger in these days, and we ought to guard against it as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>As against all that, I think the experience we have had up to the present ought to indicate very clearly that that is very unlikely to happen.  The previous Government had a constitutional right to have it up to six years, and they could have then <Col N="1362" /> changed the Constitution, if they had wanted to, and fixed any period they wanted; but there is a public opinion that would have to be faced in a case like that, and no Government is going to run the risks they would have to run if they were to extend their own life under circumstances of that kind. In any Constitution you will get things that will be abused, and if there is one provision which is not likely to be abused it is this, and I am genuinely anxious that we should not, in having a more or less rigid Constitution, run up against the position in which it was desirable to extend the life of Parliament and in which it was impossible to do it.  The previous Administration could have done so at one period if they had wanted to, and I think the reasons that operated in their case for not doing it would operate generally, that is, that there is a public opinion to be considered.  I think we could argue for a long time and would not get any further.</P>

      <P>Because you had not a rigid Constitution up to the present. Up to the present, you had power to change the Constitution by simple legislation. That is going to pass away when this Constitution becomes stabilised after the three-year period referred to in it.  After that period, you have a rigid Constitution, and I think it advisable that there should be a reasonable gap between the time normally accepted in an Act of Parliament as the time for the life of a single Parliament and the time rigidly fixed and beyond which you cannot go without constitutional amendment.  You might have a very serious situation and I think there ought to be a period within which you could take whatever measures might be necessary to deal with the situation.  I think that is ordinary wisdom and ordinary common-sense.</P>

      <P>In Section 1, sub-section 1º, line 1, to delete the words &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; and insert the words &ldquo;Within three months&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As drawn, this Article provides that as soon as possible after the presentation to the Dáil of the Estimates of receipts and expenditure for a particular financial year, the Dáil shall consider such Estimates.  That seems to me to be open to the possibility that we might have presented to us the Estimates in April of this year and might not have an opportunity of considering them until, perhaps, March of the following year, because it could all the time be pleaded under this Article that it was not possible &mdash;and &ldquo;possible&rdquo; might even be translated into &ldquo;desirable&rdquo;&mdash;to introduce a discussion on the Estimates in any shorter period.  The object of this amendment is to ensure that at least three months after we get the Estimates the Dáil will have an opportunity of considering them, so that we may be able to deal with the Estimates, and the administrative work contained in them, within a reasonable period of time.  It may <Col N="1364" /> be that it is intended in normal circumstances that the discussion will take place as soon as possible, but it seems to me to be possible under this Article that the discussion would not take place for a very considerable time after the Book of Estimates had been made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>What the Deputy wants in this is not quite clear.  Does he mean that the beginning of the consideration of the Estimates should take place within three months, or that it should be completed within the three months?  At present we in fact, begin before the end of the financial year a discussion of the Estimates for the next financial year. If it were to mean that the consideration of the Estimates should be completed, there is this danger, that a Government that wanted to get easily over some awkward Estimates might leave them until the last and then rush them on the plea that they had to be through within the three months.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of parliamentary control, I think it is very much better to leave it open.  There can be no excuse for rushing Estimates and not giving proper time to their consideration.  I have asked the Minister for Finance to come here and deal directly with this in case any question of procedure arose.  The matter has been discussed with the Department of Finance from the point of view of the conduct of financial business.  The opinion of that Department is that what is laid down here embodies, in fact, the present system: that, as soon as possible, the Estimates are considered by Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but I think it is just as well that Deputies should appreciate what is being done here.  This Article corresponds very <Col N="1365" /> closely to Article 36 in the existing Constitution, except in one respect.  It leaves out the rather vital words &ldquo;After the commencement of each financial year.&rdquo;  Article 36 of the existing Constitution provided that Dáil Eireann should, as soon as possible after the commencement of each financial year, consider the Estimates of receipts and expenditure.  Now, it was interpreted that that particular provision in Article 36 might prevent the Dáil from considering the Estimates in the month of March in each year, and, consequently, I assume, without having any other information except my own deductions, that the reason why the words &ldquo;after the commencement of each financial year&rdquo; were omitted in the clause we are now dealing with was in order to enable the Dáil to deal with the Estimates at any time they might be presented to the Dáil by the Minister for Finance.  But this particular clause has, as I have said, to be considered in its relation to Article 28, Section 4, (3) of the Draft Constitution that we are considering. In that Article it is provided:</P>
      <P>The Government shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year, and shall present them to Dáil Eireann for consideration.</P>
      <P>That Article follows pretty closely the provision in Article 54 of the existing Constitution, omitting, possibly from Deputy Norton's point of view, the rather vital words, &ldquo;before the close of the financial year&rdquo;.  The system on which we have been working for the past 15 years is that the Minister for Finance was constitutionally bound to present the Estimates to the Dáil before the close of the financial year, and that, as soon as possible after the beginning of the new financial year, the Dáil was to consider those Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system that is intended to be introduced in the present Draft is that the Minister may introduce them in January or February or December.  He may, in fact, introduce them at any time.  There is no particular period in either the financial year or the calendar year within which the Estimates must <Col N="1366" /> be presented.  Now, I think that is the reading of these two Articles of the Constitution taken together, and that it would have been much better if Article 28, Section 4 (3) had been up somewhere closer to Article 17.</P>
    <P>I think the effect of the two Articles together is as I have stated.  It may be that that is a good thing.  I would like to hear the Minister on it.  I think that there should be some period in the Constitution within which the Minister should be bound to give his Estimates of receipts and expenditure. We know, of course, that the present system, by means of which the Estimates are presented to the Dáil each year in the month of March, has the drawback that those Estimates are based on the rates of taxation existing at the time of the presentation of the Estimates, but it may be that when the Minister introduces his Budget in the following May he has either increased or decreased the rates of taxation.  So that, under the present system, the Estimates are not a real indication of the position at all, or even of what is going to happen during the forthcoming year.</P>
    <P>I think that is a matter that called for some reform.  I think that the system of finance, as indicated in the existing Constitution, fell very short of being a proper basis on which to build a financial structure in this State.  We have been operating in the last 15 years on a system of finance which, in my view, has no real legal authority whatever.  We have had only three or four articles in the existing Constitution dealing with the system of public finance.  We adopted in our finance system the law, practice and custom that obtained in the British parliamentary system when we took over here, under Article 73 of the Constitution, certain of the Acts of the British Parliament dealing with financial practice. But it was always a matter of very grave doubt, to some people at all events, whether some of those Acts were really brought over by Article 73 at all.  I could keep the House going for the next one-and-a-half hours at the very least in pointing out to Deputies the inconsistencies in our existing financial structure.  I think that it <Col N="1367" /> would be a very wise proceeding indeed if we adopted our own financial practice and embodied it in an Act of this House.  I think it would interest Deputies if I were to produce some of the Public Charges and Audit Acts, and showed them the system by which certain issues out of the Exchequer are made at present.  They would be rather surprised to hear that they are based on the King's Sign Manual.  In this draft we are not doing anything to improve a matter that really requires improvement in the existing Constitution.  The existing Constitution provides no real fundamental basis for our financial structure.</P>
    <P>We had, at the basis of the British system, the principle that no moneys could be expended by a Minister or by any Department of State, or the Crown as it then was, without the authority of Parliament, but by doing a certain amount of violence to one or two Articles in the existing Constitution you could spell out, and our Supreme Court did spell out, the existence of that principle in our financial structure.  In effect, we are relying on Article 73, not Article 17, Section 2, of this draft for that very fundamental principle.  I think it may be spelled out with the assistance of the Supreme Court decision.  With the exception of that principle, we have no real constitutional, or even legislative, basis for the system of public finance that exists here at the present moment.  It is a matter that requires to be examined into, and it is a matter that, I think, would repay examination by the Department of Finance. If certain changes are about to be made under this Constitution, then, at least, consequential legislation ought to be brought in to put our whole financial system on a proper basis, a basis such as it has not been on for the past 15 years.</P>

      <P>The statement just made, Sir, astonishes me.  We have had, on the authority of a former Attorney-General, a statement to the effect that our present system of financial control is not on a proper statutory basis.

      <P>I should be very glad to give the Deputy that memorandum if I could trace it, but my difficulty is that I have not been able to find any well-founded statement that there is not good statutory authority for our financial structure, with one exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <P>I have not got it at the moment, but I am sure the Minister should be able to find it.  However, Sir, since the statement was made that a memorandum was submitted to me which, apparently, satisfied me, I think that I am entitled to ask for the production of the memorandum that I submitted in reply.  So far from my being satisfied at the time, I think I am entitled to say that I wrote a long memorandum directing the attention of the Government and of the Department to the inconsistencies in our financial structure, and that I am entitled to ask for its production.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should not say this, Sir, but it arose out of the question of the authority for raising a national loan and also out of the question of what was to be done with public moneys, if there happened to be a surplus at the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>I do not know, Sir, whether this is the proper place to raise this matter, but I should be very glad to meet the Deputy privately and let him see the information in my possession. I think that this matter was raised subsequent to the issue of the Second National Loan.  It may help Deputy Costello if I tell him that his memorandum was dated the 24th May, 1929, while the date of the financial memorandum was the 17th September, 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, I know that the Deputy is somewhat at a disadvantage in regard to this, but I think it would not be in the public interest that the idea should go abroad that there is not a sound statutory basis for the financial procedure followed by this House.  It should be remembered also, in that regard, that this House is the judge and the final determinant of its own procedure in such matters: that the control of the finances of the State rests in Dáil Eireann and not in any other authority, whether the Supreme Court or any other body.  I think that we ought to be clear about that.  I think that the public ought to know that we are responsible for the drafting of our own Acts and for the phraseology by which effect is to be given in our own Acts to our intentions as a legislature, particularly where the control of public moneys is concerned.</P>
      <P>However, to get back to the narrow issue that is raised by this amendment. It is quite true, as Deputy Costello says, that certain words have been omitted.  The words omitted are &ldquo;as soon as possible after the commencement of each financial year&rdquo;.  Those words have been omitted from Article 17, Section 1, paragraph 1.  They have been omitted by implication in that Article, but they have been omitted specifically in Article 28, Section 4, paragraph 3.  The reason they have been omitted is, as the Deputy has indicated, in order to enable the consideration of the Estimates of expenditure on supply services to be undertaken as soon as possible after the volume of Estimates has been circulated to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> It has been the custom or practice to endeavour to place that volume of Estimates before the House as soon as possible after the Christmas Recess&mdash;in February, if possible, but in any event in sufficient time to enable the members of the Dáil to study the volume in detail before the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill are taken.  Sometimes, owing to the demands upon Parliamentary time and the difficulties in preparing the volume of Estimates, that has not been possible; but it is the endeavour of the Department of Finance, so far as possible, to see that that is done, because there is one thing, certainly, that the Minister for Finance does not want to burke or avoid, and that is as reasonably early a detailed discussion of the Estimates as is possible.  The reason for that is that, if that discussion is got out of the way at an early date, then the rest of the session, so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, is going to be very much easier.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I think that Deputy Costello was not quite correct in saying that Article 54, customarily, had been interpreted to include the volume of Supply Estimates.  It is true that that volume is presented to the House early in February or March, but it is not presented in order to fulfil some obligation or condition imposed by Article 54.  It is presented, as I have said, in order to enable Deputies to study the volume and to enable them, if they wish to do so, on the Vote on Account and the Central Fund Bill to take up some particular subject for discussion and to participate in that discussion with full information at their command.  What, in fact, our predecessors held Article 54 to imply was what is generally known as the White Paper on receipts and expenditure&mdash;that is, the White Paper which is issued some time before the introduction of the Budget and which, if it is examined, will be found to be entitled &ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure.&rdquo;  It was understood by our predecessors to mean that, and their practice in that regard has been followed by us.  In short, it has been taken that when Article 54 specifies <Col N="1371" /> Estimates of receipts and expenditure, it refers to what is generally known as the White Paper of receipts and expenditure.  To give the House some indication of the difficulties which are created by including a quite arbitrary time-limit&mdash;a time-limit which has really no logical justification for it&mdash; in an Article of the Constitution in the way, for instance, in which it has been done in Article 54 of the existing Constitution and in the way in which Deputy Norton suggests that it ought to be done now in regard to Article 17, Section 1, sub-section 1º, we have only to remember that in our predecessor's time, as well as in our own, the observance of the obligation imposed by Article 54 to prepare these Estimates and to present them to the Dáil before the close of the previous financial year has been as honoured in the breach as in the observance and that, in fact, in a number of years, it was not possible to present this White Paper until after the financial year had opened.</P>
    <P>As to the effect which the acceptance of the amendment would have on the consideration of the Estimates, I suggest first of all that it imposes, or that it would impose in certain circumstances, quite an arbitrary constitutional closure on discussion of the Estimates.  It would be quite possible if you had that time limit there to defer taking up consideration of the Estimates until the period of three months had almost lapsed, and then a Government with a sufficiently large majority could say: &ldquo;We must rush the Estimates through now, because we are compelled to do so under the Constitution within three months from the date on which they were presented.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it has been argued by Deputy Norton that the amendment has been put down in order that the Estimates will be discussed. If he would consider exactly what the present financial procedure is, he would see that under it the Estimates are bound to be discussed and that they will be discussed with a great deal more freedom in the Dáil if there is no time limit, because the provision which is made in any financial year by the Appropriation Act or a Central <Col N="1372" /> Fund Act comes automatically to an end on the 31st of March of that financial year.  On the other hand, there is no authority to spend money out of the Exchequer unless there is a specific enactment passed to grant that authority for Central Fund charges as well as for other charges.  So far, therefore as the general run of the Supply Services is concerned, the authority given by the Dáil to appropriate money for the purpose of these Supply Services exhausts itself on the 31st March in the year in which that authority has been given, therefore the Government must come to the Dáil and ask for a further supply if it wishes to carry on.  It has to come, then, with the usual Supply Resolution and Ways and Means Resolution, get a Vote on Account, and pass a Central Fund Bill. When the Dáil grants a Vote on Account it usually only grants provision for four months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any additional restriction in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, beyond this: that an Appropriation Act has to be passed. At least, following the practice which we have taken over and for which there is statutory authority in the Adaptation of Enactments Act, the money which is voted by the Dáil must be finally voted by an Act of the Legislature, which is the Appropriation Act, and that, normally, must be passed before the close of that financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, therefore, is compelled to give the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the Estimates, not by anything which is in the Constitution, but by the fact, first of all, that the authority to appropriate money for certain services exhausts itself at the close of the financial year.  You have then to go and get a Vote on Account. It is a Vote on Account.  That is to say, it is merely an instalment of the money required to carry on for the coming financial year.  As I have said, that, as a rule, is given for four months. Of course, nobody can deny that if the Dáil has such trust in a Government, it might give it for eight or nine months or for 12 months, but it would have to do that in the face of public opinion and in the face of criticism on the part <Col N="1373" /> of the Opposition.  There would be an opportunity in the debate on the Vote on Account, and in the debate on the Central Fund Bill, to compel the Government to give sound reasons for not taking the Estimates and not giving the Dáil an opportunity to consider the Estimates in detail.</P>
    <P>That raises another question, because it can be assumed that the Vote on Account itself implies and involves consideration of the Estimates.  The Vote on Account is, at any rate, taken immediately at the close of the financial year, and normally makes provision for four months supply. Therefore, even under the existing procedure with the Vote on Account, the Estimates must be considered within four months after the opening of the financial year.  I think if Deputy Norton will consider what I have said he will see that there is not any real service to be gained by asking for a time limit.  It is better from the point of view of Parliamentary control over the purse to allow these Estimates to be taken and considered at the earliest possible moment, as we propose it should be done.  Formerly we had the difficulty that consideration of the Estimates could not commence until after the 1st April of the year for which the Estimates were presented.  Now, by removing that Constitutional barrier we can begin detailed consideration of the Estimates in advance of the financial year to which they are to apply.  When we have that provision, there is no sound justification, in my view, for limiting the period in which these Estimates may be considered in detail to three months.  It might often happen that more than three months would be required.  There is other Parliamentary business as well as the Estimates to be dealt with.  We think&mdash; and I think that was the experience of those who preceded us in office&mdash;that it would be much better if we had not any of these arbitrary time limits preventing us from considering the Estimates in detail at the convenience of the Dáil, and when there is no other business to be taken.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied <Col N="1374" /> that the method and the phraseology used in this particular Article are satisfactory. For instance, the last line of Article 17 (1) says that the Dáil &ldquo;shall consider such Estimates&rdquo;.  I should like to know from the President or the Minister for Finance whether it is expected that the Dáil shall pass such Estimates.  Does consideration involve adoption of these Estimates?  If it does, &ldquo;consider&rdquo; seems to me to be a very inadequate word to use, because the Dáil could commence consideration, and while it would be considering and Estimate, without having it passed, it would still be fulfilling the precise phraseology of this particular Article.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will make his own statement.  This is the Government's Constitution.  The Minister for Finance made a lengthy statement in connection with the present position. He says that the present position is that the Estimates are circulated before the end of the financial year, that the authority given for the expenditure in that financial year ceases on the 31st March, and that consequently the Government cannot get money for expenditure during the financial year, unless it comes before the House and asks for a Vote on Account.</P>

    <P>The Minister says that the Vote on Account is usually for a period of four months, and that consequently being short of money at the end of that period the Government have to come <Col N="1375" /> back to the House to ask for more money.  But the Minister also acknowledged, in reply to an interrogatory by me, that there was no constitutional restriction compelling the Government to ask for a Vote on Account for a period of four months; that in fact the Government might ask for a Vote on Account for a period of ten months, and may not, therefore, find it necessary to come back to the Dáil until the end of ten months, when they might come back and say: &ldquo;We want the other two months' money to carry on to the end of the financial year.&rdquo;  My whole object in this amendment is to ensure that the Dáil will have an opportunity of considering the Estimates in detail within a certain period after the Estimates are available for that consideration.  I want to guard against the possibility that, having presented the Estimates to the Dáil, a Government may avoid detailed discussion of those Estimates until such time as there is only a very short period left available for that discussion if the Appropriation Bill is to be passed.  That, and no more, is the simple objective of this amendment.  I want to make sure that at least the Dáil will have an opportunity of considering the Estimates within a definite period, and that it will not be asked to consider the Estimates almost at the end of the financial year, when there will not be adequate time made available for that discussion.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants that, I suggest that the way to do it is to withdraw the amendment, because the effect of his amendment may be quite contrary to what he intends.  As a rule, it is very difficult for the Dáil to get through detailed consideration of the Estimates inside three months. In the seven years which commenced with 1931-2 the volume of Estimates was circulated to Deputies about mid-March of each year.  In four of those years the last Estimate was considered about four months after the circulation of the volume.</P>

      <P>To the seven years which commenced 1931-32.  In one year, <Col N="1376" /> 1932-33, when there had been a general election, the last Estimate was considered eight months after the circulation of the volume.  In one year it was considered slightly over three months after the circulation of the volume, and it was only in the current year that the last Estimate was taken within the three months' period which the Deputy suggests.  Clearly, that is the normal position in regard to the Estimates. If the House were to accept an amendment of this sort it would mean that it would be compelled, willy-nilly, to conclude its consideration of the Estimates within three months.  The enforcement of an automatic time limit of that sort certainly does not make for the full and detailed consideration of the Estimates.  If that is what Deputy Norton wants, he ought to allow the Article to go in its present form, because the Article has been drafted in order to provide for that full and detailed consideration. The Article only obliges the Dáil to consider the Estimates.  I think if the Deputy will consider&mdash;if I may use the word again&mdash;the normal exigencies of Parliamentary Government he will see that the Dáil cannot stop merely with the consideration of the Estimates; that, as a result of that consideration, it must come to some conclusion in regard to the Estimates.  The Government wants money to carry on the public services.  It will, at any rate, endeavour to get the Dáil to come to some conclusion in regard to the Estimates. In fact, on occasions when the Dáil has been dilatory about coming to such a conclusion, it has been necessary, by the use of special measures such as the closure, to compel the Dáil to come to a conclusion.  When it does come to consider the Estimates it must either decide to give the money or not to give the money.  The Government, which, as I say, wants the money for the purposes of the public services, will ask the Dáil finally to determine that question as to whether the money is to be voted or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Article must be read with Article 11, which states that the money will not be provided except by law. Article 17 (1), Article 11 and Article 28 (2) (3) all hang together.  They are all part of the one mosaic.  There is no <Col N="1377" /> point I think in putting any artificial limitation here which would, in fact, destroy the fluidity which is aimed at, that is to give the Dáil a freer hand in the discussion of financial matters, and to enable the public business to be conducted with greater efficiency and convenience than heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point in regard to this matter is that it does not give the Dáil a freer hand.  My object in moving this amendment is to ensure that the Dáil will not be presented with a situation wherein it may not be given even the three months suggested in my amendment for consideration of the matter.  It may be possible, under this Article as drawn, for the Dáil to be asked to consider the detailed Estimates of expenditure a month or two months before the close of the financial year.  The Minister for Finance has not at all shown the House in what way that would be impossible under the Article as now drawn.  I think that the danger of this Article as it is framed is that the Dáil may only be given an opportunity of considering the Estimates in detail two months before the close of the financial year.  If the three months suggested in my amendment seems too short, well, it is at all events a month longer than the two months which the Dáil might only get under this Article in its present form.  I do not want to tie the Constitution down to a fixed period of time.  I should be quite satisfied if the Government would look at the matter again with a view to seeing what it is possible to do to prevent any undue tightness from the standpoint of time, to prevent any undue rigidity, but at the same time to ensure to the Dáil that it would in fact have adequate time in which to discuss the Estimates, and that those Estimates would be discussed as soon as possible after they had been made available.</P>

      <P>I should like to put this consideration to Deputy Norton. I think he will admit that traditions when they are well established, and procedure when it is well established, are sometimes better than any written <Col N="1378" /> Constitution.  In our case where there has been any procedure which has worked out in practice I think everybody will admit that I have tried to observe it.  There has been a practice here in regard to financial procedure. It has not been strictly in accordance with the Constitution&mdash;it has been admitted that at the time the previous Administration grew up it was not possible to do certain things&mdash;and what we are trying to do here is to enshrine in the Constitution what is the present practice.  That is why the Department of Finance was brought into this.  It is necessary to get advice before the beginning of the year and to consider the Book of Estimates, if possible, and also to make provision for a Vote on account.</P>

In order to link this amendment with the other proposal in the Bill&mdash;because it is really an attempt to keep in step with the provision being made for the dependents of signatories to the Proclamation&mdash;I suggest to the Minister that he might consider adding a provision and allowance for sister as well as dependents of those who fell in Easter Week.

      <P>On that question, I should like to say that the Minister is probably aware that some of those who took part in the Easter Rising of 1916 are in bad circumstances.  During the course of the discussion of the Army Pensions Bill in the Seanad it was suggested that these men should be given a higher rank.  The usual pension allotted in these cases, I am told, is about £20 or £24 per year&mdash;in some cases it was less than that.  In cases where there is such a pension being paid it is held, I am told, to operate against men who are applicants for unemployment assistance.  The Minister ought to consider whether that measure should not be amended with a view to giving these men at least what would keep them in some sort of decent circumstances.  In any event the holding of such a pension should not debar men either from getting employment or unemployment assistance, or affect the amount they would be entitled to draw in respect of that.  It happens that in some cases these men are now in adverse <Col N="1383" /> circumstances.  While generous provision is being made for some people under this measure, it is a great source of dissatisfaction to men who took the risks these men did at that time, and who have not been particularly fortunate since, that they should be in possession of such a small annual sum as is now granted under the Act.</P>

      <P>The question of military service pensions is not strictly relevant to this debate.  Even if we were discussing a Military Service Pensions Bill I do not think the cases of hardship to which the Deputy alludes could be dealt with under it.  The position is that under the Unemployment Assistance Act the officials in charge have to take into account all moneys received by applicants, no matter from what source, so that in order to do away with the hardships the Deputy alluded to would require an amendment of the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  All I can do is to promise to bring his remarks before the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is mainly a machinery Bill in connection with the Bunreacht na hEireann (Dréacht) which Deputy Cosgrave says we are now hoping to give to the country.</P>
      <P>When the Draft Constitution which is now being considered by this House in Committee is finally approved, it will be submitted for adoption and enactment to the people by means of a plebiscite to be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>For the taking of the plebiscite, no elaborate machinery is necessary.  It is to be taken on the polling day at the general election.  In constituencies in which the Dáil election is contested, the voter will receive two ballot papers.  On the white ballot paper he will indicate his preference for candidates by the figures 1, 2, 3, and so on; and on the plebiscite ballot paper, which will be of a distinctive cream colour, he will place the mark &ldquo;X&rdquo; to indicate his approval or non-approval of the Draft Constitution, in accordance with the instructions on the face of the ballot paper set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  The voter will have the same guarantee of secrecy for his vote at the plebiscite as he has for his vote at the Dáil election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> The holding of Dáil elections is strictly regulated both as regards machinery and corrupt and illegal practices.  The plebiscite will be subject to the same regulation, and there is the same appeal to the courts if the plebiscite is not conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the electoral law.  The plebiscite votes recorded in each constituency will be counted in each constituency by the returning officer, and a return giving the number of votes cast, approving and not approving of the Draft Constitution, will be sent to the plebiscite returning officer. From these returns the plebiscite returning officer will ascertain the total number of votes approving and not approving of the Draft Constitution, and will certify whether the Draft Constitution has or has not been approved by a majority of voters.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the plebiscite to which I invite attention.  The question how the elector is to indicate his view in the matter of the Draft Constitution has received a very careful consideration.  It is contrary to practice at elections to write on ballot papers.  If the plebiscite rules required voters to write words of approval or non-approval on the plebiscite ballot paper they might misunderstand the instructions, and write on the general election ballot papers as well, with the result that their votes at the general election might be rejected.  A qualified or alternative approval or non-approval is not practical.  These considerations ruled out marking the ballot paper with words or figures.  The solution left is to place the mark &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the square opposite the word &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; if the voter approves, or opposite the word &ldquo;No&rdquo; if he does not approve. Supplemental instructions for voting at the plebiscite will be printed and exhibited in each polling booth.</P>

      <P>I have no great enthusiasm for these proposals, neither have I any very strong objections to them.  It is all so much elaborate setting for a still-born entity.  Its arrangements were made at a time when people estimated or calculated the thing would be a living entity, and <Col N="1386" /> this was just part of the impressive trappings that were arranged at that particular time.  If the Constitution were a matter of more real interest to the public than it appears to be at the moment, then I would have urged very strongly that the opinion of the electors on the Constitution should be taken at another time and on a different occasion than the particular time when the people are called on to vote for candidates for the Dáil.  Seeing that there is so very little interest in the Constitution, I think it is just as well that the opinion of the people is taken in conjunction with the general election, because, at all events, there will be other forces and other factors influencing the electors to go to the polling booths on that particular day.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that the matter that will take up least of the electors' interest and will come in for the minimum of consideration will be the Constitution. If opinions for or against a Constitution covering 115 difficult pages are to be studied, considered and voted on by the people generally, surely some better occasion should be selected than the occasion when the electors are going to the poll to vote for a certain group of candidates as against another group of candidates. Every possible issue, real and bogus, will be thrashed out and discussed by thousands of speakers from hundreds of platforms for three, four or five weeks before this particular vote is recorded.  I venture to say, the people being realists, that the subject that will get least attention either from speakers or from the audiences, will be the Constitution itself.  If the Constitution is to be the very important factor in the lives of the people that the President pictured, surely it is sufficiently important to have the calm consideration of the public and the opinion of the public recorded quite distinct and separate from the controversy and heat and excitement and din of a general election.  I believe that a Constitution to be put through in this particular way will be a Constitution put through without, in fact, any adequate consideration by the public generally or with any fair presentation to the public by public men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> There is not one speaker on either side of the House who can afford at the present moment, from a public platform, to devote any reasonable or adequate length of time to the presentation of the favourable factors in the Constitution, or the contrary.  It seems to me that the suggestion to put the Constitution through simultaneously with the polling for the general election is rather securing, as far as the Government can, that that Constitution will not be closely studied or calmly considered by the electorate. It is more or less ensuring that the registration of opinion for or against the Constitution will take definite political lines, that people brought in to vote for a certain Party will vote at the same time for a Constitution, and the opposite would hold as well.  That, I think, is rather unfortunate.  It is not the best for any of us, and it is not the best for the country.  To my mind, a Constitution should be introduced and discussed as far as possible away from the heat and divisions of a general election, even here in this Assembly, and the opinion of the electorate, if a plebiscite is the machinery to be used, should be taken at a time when there is no Party feeling, when there is no excitement, and when there are no animosities dividing people on other issues.  It is a most unfortunate choice of date.</P>
    <P>Possibly, one argument that may be used for it is that a plebiscite is a costly machinery and that it is economical to do it in conjunction with a general election.  Surely that argument will not be seriously advanced from the Government Benches?  Surely that argument will not be seriously put forward in association with an instrument that is inviting a multiplicity of plebiscites or referenda? Surely the thing that is furthest from the minds of the Government is a desire to save the money of the taxpayer, because the amount of money that would be saved by taking one plebiscite on the same day and at the same time and place as the general election poll will be squandered thousands of times over in subsequent plebiscites or referenda if the vote of the public on the first occasion <Col N="1388" /> happens to be in favour of the Draft Constitution.  I believe that a plebiscite not associated with a general election would be a very costly thing, a much more costly thing than a general election.</P>
    <P>Although the occupants of the Government Benches may talk glibly about the prevention of electoral abuses and all that kind of thing, and refer to the Act for the prevention of corrupt practices during elections and on the polling day, in fact and in practice the prevention of electoral abuses is left to the Party agents.  There is no agent of the State inside or convenient to a polling booth whose business it is to any extent to prevent electoral abuse.  They are there to keep order in the ordinary every-day sense of the word; they are there to prevent violence in the ordinary sense of the word; but there is no agent, from the presiding officer to the policeman, whose duty it is to prevent electoral abuses.  In spite of all our legislation and all our Acts, we do in fact invite electoral abuse and we leave it to the citizens themselves, by organisation and by the expenditure of money or voluntary effort, to see that there is none, or at least that there is a minimum of electoral abuse.</P>
    <P>I make that point because, in fact, that is the position, that it is the Party organisations and the agents of the different candidates who secure as far as possible that there will be a minimum of electoral abuse.  An argument for taking a plebiscite on a general election polling day would be that if a plebiscite were taken on another occasion, Party machines would not be available and any busybody could poll a parish with nobody to challenge him. If adequate steps were not taken by paid agents of the State to prevent that type of wholesale personation, then I fear that there would be a tremendous amount of electoral abuse associated with the taking of a plebiscite.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that this question of the Dréacht Bunreacht that we are discussing is of no interest to the people.  I do not suppose that anything I could say or <Col N="1389" /> anything any of us on this side could say in contradiction of his view would carry conviction to him or to his colleagues, but it is my belief that there are few measures that have been put before this House since I became a member of it that have excited as deep an interest in the public mind as this Draft Constitution.  That is my belief, and I think I see evidence of that every day I open a newspaper. There is nothing that has happened of a political nature in recent years that excited such public controversy as this Constitution.  Newspapers, magazines and reviews, the few of them that have appeared since the document was first published and that I have seen and read, have commented on and discussed in some way or another the provisions of the Constitution.  I think it is absolutely undeniable that there is nothing since the Free State was founded in which the people have taken a deeper interest than in this Constitution. They have discussed it, examined it and commented on it, and, while I have to accept Deputy O'Higgins's word that the people have no interest in it, I think the vast majority of his supporters&mdash;some of them I have met and talked to, and some of them I have heard criticise various aspects of the Bunreacht&mdash;would not agree with him that the Bunreacht is a matter of no interest.  However, on that we can afford to differ, but I think that any unprejudiced person who takes an interest in the matter and who likes to discuss affairs of that kind, can make up his mind as to the side on which the truth lies.  We will leave it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the time when the plebiscite on the Constitution is to be taken, I think Deputy O'Higgins must be talking with his tongue in his cheek when he criticises the Government for putting this Constitution to the people at the time of a general election.  He personally had no responsibility for the way in which the Constitution was put to the people in 1922, but I am sure that if he were asked he would say he saw nothing wrong with it.  The people have had this Constitution before them some months in advance.  The matter, as I have said, has been commented upon, <Col N="1390" /> and it has been published in full in newspapers in every part of the country.  It has been discussed through every available organ for discussion, and it has been debated at considerable length in this House, and the debates, I am sure, will go on for a considerable time.  The length of the debates here and the number of speakers who have addressed the House from amongst Deputy O'Higgins' own colleagues all bear tribute to the fact that they regard it as a matter of very considerable interest and importance to the people generally, thus contradicting, to my mind, his view that it is a matter of no interest or importance, and showing also that the people have what they did not have when the first Constitution was put to them, a great opportunity of learning what the Constitution is, what is in it and what is not in it and what its sections mean.</P>
    <P>They will have read the debates, <i>pro</i> and <i>con,</i> and they will have heard the views of the President and other speakers on this side and various speakers from the Opposition who have given their views of what it means.  If ever the public had an opportunity of understanding any measure, they have that opportunity in respect of this Bunreacht.  I do not see anything wrong at all in choosing such a time.  I would not put forward the argument as one of very great importance that we save expense by asking the people to vote on the Constitution on the day of the general election. That is not a matter that ought to weigh very heavily with the Government, I agree with Deputy O'Higgins, in deciding the day on which a measure of this kind should be put to the people, but I think the day of a general election is a suitable day.  I thought the Constitution would have been brought in earlier, but that could not be done, and the time of the general election draws near.  The end of the normal period of office of the present Government is drawing to a close, and the two things happen to coincide, and I think very happily coincide. There will be a bigger interest taken in both matters as a result of the political interest that is always evoked by a general election, and you will <Col N="1391" /> have a bigger vote.  It would be perhaps difficult to work up the same enthusiasm for a plebiscite on the Constitution if that plebiscite were taken alone.  The people would not have the same urge to vote on any Constitution, no matter what it contained, as they would have to vote at the time of a general election.  I think that those who are asked to vote for one side or the other at the general election, and at the same time to decide <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> on the Constitution will have a deeper interest in both matters.  You will have more interest displayed, and probably a bigger vote than you might have had on any Constitution put to the people by plebiscite at any other time.</P>
    <P>I hope, and this hope has been expressed several times by the President, that the people will be made to understand that whatever way they vote in the general election, they are free to vote any way they please on the Constitution.  If they are supporters of the present Government and dislike the Constitution, I hope they will understand that they are completely free to vote against the Constitution, if they so wish, or <i>vice versa.</i> I think the people are politically-minded enough to understand the job they have to do on the day of a general election, to understand what the general election and the Constitution mean to them, and to be able to differentiate between Party programmes and Parties and, at the same time, to make up their minds on the Constitution.  I do not think the excitement which has always existed on the day of the poll, and, later on, and will, I suppose, always exist, will be any less, but I do not see any reason why that Party feeling should prevent people from making up their minds independently and clearly and definitely on the Constitution.  Our own people will probably pay more attention to what we say, but I hope that the people, all of them, will understand that they are completely free to vote any way they like on this Constitution, and anything we can do to get them to put aside Party views when discussing it and voting on it we will do.  It has been done already, and <Col N="1392" /> it will be continued to the day of the poll.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of electoral abuses to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, it is the duty of the Gardaí to prevent them.  I cannot speak for the country&mdash;I have never been in the country at the time of a general election polling day&mdash;but here in Dublin the Gardaí are inside the polling booths and outside them.</P>

      <P>I do not think so, not in Dublin.  I can speak only of Dublin from personal experience. They are watchful and strict in Dublin and I think every Party will agree that electoral abuses are rare in the City of Dublin, anyway.  The Party agents do watch and it is a good thing they should.  In the old days&mdash;I am not talking about present-day politics&mdash; when the different Parties used to be just as watchful as they are to-day and sometimes succeeded in arresting their opponents for attempted personation or for personation, they used occasionally at the end of the day to count up heads.  If they found that one Party had got so many prisoners and the other Party had got so many, they simply withdrew their charges and paid whatever compensation was to be <Col N="1393" /> paid.  They ended the matter in that way.  That practice is over and done with.  One never hears of that now. If a Party agent does get a man arrested for personation, they go through with the charge.  In recent years men have been convicted on this charge and it is right they should. That is the practice at the present time.</P>

They urged that I should accept an amendment in the form of that which Deputy Dockrell has down. I pointed out that it was almost inconceivable that a Government would make the nominations until they had seen the whole field, that I could not understand why a Government would take the opposite course.  Consequently, I pointed out that it did not seem to me that there was any need whatever to introduce an amendment on the lines proposed, as that was what would happen.  Everybody who has to exercise a nomination of this sort is anxious to use the nomination to the best effect.  If you want to give the nomination the greatest effect, you will hold back until you see the whole field and you will then be able to see how the nomination can be utilised so as to be most effective in securing the purpose you have in mind.  The purpose the Government should have in mind is to produce the best possible Seanad.  If they had any other purpose in view they would also hold back. If they wanted to make the nominations on one particular side, they would hold back because they would then be able to see who was elected and how the greatest value could be obtained from their nominations. I think it was almost certain to happen in practice that the Government would hold back its nominations until the others were elected, and that the amendment is not necessary.</P>

I take it that this amendment is really consequential on the more important amendment which Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello have down.

We are doing the best we can in that direction in the Draft.  Perhaps it is that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello would like to have it easy to change the constitution of the Seanad by law.

If we are going to have a Second House in the Constitution, I think that we ought to go as far as we reasonably can here.  We will differ, I suppose, as to the exact time to which we should go.  Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello evidently take the view that we had better not go any distance at the present time except to admit that the Universities should have representation. There is no suggestion, I think, of a change in the number of members, but they do suggest that the whole method of election should be left to law.  We have gone a certain distance in what I may call stereotyping the frame-work of the Seanad, and I understand from his amendment that the view taken by Deputy MacDermot is that he wants us to go farther than I think we can go at the moment.  At any rate, I will have to oppose this amendment as leaving it too elastic, and unnecessarily so, and I may have to oppose Deputy MacDermot in his attempt to stereotype before we are in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the objection to a little elasticity with regard to the constitution of the Seanad at this stage?  With regard to the Seanad generally, provision has to be made by law for its constitution or resurrection.  I take it that most of the time of those who drafted the Constitution was taken up with the Constitution itself rather than with the details regarding the constitution of the Seanad.  Moreover, the President has repeatedly stressed the <Col N="1400" /> point, since the Draft Constitution was first introduced, that it is designed by its very construction to be loose in some respects and indefinite in other respects, and that the explanation of that lack of definiteness is that it is hoped it will be permanent and lasting.  Now, if the Constitution itself is to be regarded as a permanent structure, why bind us to a permanent and everlasting structure with regard to the constitution of the Seanad?  It may be that if we were given the opportunity, which the amendment asks for, to study the constitution of the Seanad in a perfectly detached way, not wedged in between hundreds of important clauses in the Constitution itself, a far better Seanad would be constituted than is likely to be brought about by limiting Parliament in advance as to the type of electoral schools that will be developed for the future Seanad.</P>
      <P>I think it is rather unwise and unfortunate that the President should adopt the attitude he is adopting on this amendment.  If the proposals made by the movers and sympathisers with this amendment are unacceptable to the Government, then the machinery that will vote them down is the same machinery that will decide the constitution of the Seanad as constructed subsequently by law.  However, any attempt to limit discussion in advance, when so much time has been taken up in the discussion of the Constitution&mdash;and people do not want to delay the matter unduly by going into it in any detailed way&mdash; is prejudicing the position.  I do not think that the President would be giving anything away by saying that he would leave this matter to be provided for by law.  That does not mean that he is giving anything away.  He can wait and see that the law is still in accordance with his viewpoint.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may have misunderstood the Deputy.  I understood him to use the words: &ldquo;We have had no opportunity of dealing with this in a detached spirit,&rdquo; and I took it that he was referring to himself and his Party; but, of course, he may have been referring to the whole House.  In any case, however, he and his Party did have an opportunity of discussing this whole matter when they were invited to send representatives to take part in the discussions of the Commission that was set up to deal with the matter of the Seanad; but they did not do so.  I think that, when a Constitution is submitted, with provisions contained in it for the setting up of a Seanad, the people have a right to know what is the general framework of the Seanad that is in contemplation. This Constitution is not unduly rigid in its provisions in regard to the Seanad.  I am glad of that.  It adopts, in general, the scheme recommended by the Minority Report of the Second Chamber Commission.  There are certain divergencies from the Minority Report of that Commission, and, naturally, as one of those who signed the Minority Report, my inclination is to regard any divergencies from that Report as divergencies for the worse. However, it does represent, in general, the report of that so-called minority. I use the word &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; in connection with that Minority Report, because actually it was the only report that got as many as eight signatures beneath it and that held together as an organic whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that report, we specially recommended that certain things should not be put in the Constitution&mdash;that they should be left open for further consideration. It is a very interesting and novel experiment, so far as this <Col N="1402" /> country is concerned, and, indeed, I think, so far as any country in the world is concerned, to form a Second Chamber on what may be called a vocational basis, and it was clear that it would be unwise not to leave something open to the effects of experience &mdash;not to leave it possible to make such changes as experience might show to be desirable.  If, however, you are going to construct an elaborate constitutional system such as we are constructing here&mdash;as system of checks and balances, with a Dáil and a Second Chamber, and a ceremonial Head of the State, who has also got certain powers&mdash;I think we have no right to abstain from laying down, at any rate, the general lines of what the Seanad is going to be.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Constitution are reasonably elastic.  In fact, in some respects, as the President has said, they are more elastic than, I think, they ought to be; but it would be an insult to the intelligence of the electorate to present them with something which was called a complete Constitution and which did not give any notion of the general system on which the Seanad was going to be constituted. It seems to me to be a curious thing that if Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello were taking the view that we should not make any arrangements at all about a Seanad except to say that we were going to have one, they should suggest including a provision to the effect that six members of the proposed Seanad should be elected from the Universities. If it is illegitimate to make certain other arrangements with regard to the proposed Seanad, why is it not illegitimate to make that arrangement?  Why should we go to the country and say, in effect, that we are going to have a Seanad: that we know nothing about what its constitution will be except that there will be six representatives from the Universities?  I hold that, if we were to go before the country on such a proposition as that, we would only stultify ourselves in the eyes of the electorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that they vary.  The views vary, but the expression remains the same. Here, however, we have a proposal for what the President himself confesses is not an ideal House.  He abolished a former Seanad which, according to him, was not ideal, but here is one proposed, which does not seem to differ so much except that, to an ordinary man in the street like myself, there is an absurd method of electing it&mdash; exceedingly absurd so far as paragraph 3 of Section 7 of this Article is concerned.  Now, I was quite interested in the President's statement to the effect that he could not change an iota, practically, in this Constitution without changing its general principle&mdash; that he could not give way in this, because it was too broad, and that he could not give way to Deputy MacDermot, because it was too rigid.  The President reminds me of an old tutor of his&mdash;a man by the name of Siéyes&mdash; who was very keen on constitutions and who held that every change that was made in a constitution of his liking thereby ruined the constitution, and that he would take no responsibility for it.  We have been watching the President for the last few days taking that attitude on practically every amendment that has been put forward to this Constitution.  His <Col N="1404" /> attitude has been that, to accept any of these amendments, would be to upset the Constitution as an organic whole &mdash;that any amendment would mean upsetting the Constitution entirely.  I will make one suggestion to the President, for what it is worth, and that is that sub-section (3) of paragraph 7 of this Article, which is an absurd method, fits in admirably with the Constitution as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, Sir, that we can get any further in this discussion. I think that Deputy O'Higgins would agree that it is advisable, in the Constitution, that we should go as far as we can in designing the framework of the proposed Seanad. Our attitude, in general, about the Seanad&mdash;I do not want to bother Deputy O'Sullivan now because I am afraid it would lead us into another Second Reading speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Our attitude on this was that we asked the Opposition, if they were anxious for a Seanad, to give us a plan for one.  We were setting up a Commission to deal with the matter, and we asked them to co-operate. They, however, felt that it was not their duty to do so.  We set up that Commission, and the Commission sat, and I think it will be admitted that anything I have said about the difficulty of framing a Seanad will be justified by the report of that Commission. There was one method indicated in what was called the Minority Report&mdash; as Deputy MacDermot justly said, that was probably an inappropriate name for it&mdash;and that was to give us a Seanad that would be different in character from the Dáil and which, possibly, would have advantages which could not otherwise be got.  Therefore this is an attempt to give effect in general&mdash;it is not followed out in detail&mdash;to the ideas put forward in that.  How far can we go to reach agreement ?  We have gone here to the point of indicating the panels which they have mentioned.  We have gone further than that in regard to the universities, because these are statutory bodies and could be depended upon to elect their own representatives. <Col N="1405" />&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;let them elect their own representatives.&rdquo; If we had functioning here councils or associations of a vocational character, if they were properly constituted or statutory bodies and recognised as such, a very good case could be made for saying, &ldquo;Let them elect so many from that panel.&rdquo;  The difficulty arose when we came to consider how many each group or council should get in the Seanad.  In this scheme we have got, first of all, a certain number of nominations, a certain number to be elected directly by the universities, and a certain number drawn from certain panels to be elected by the electors. Only two electorates were put forward in the Commission Report, as far as I remember.  It may be held that proportional representation would get a better reflection of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>No.  The idea is that these would be the electors, but the voting would be in proportion to the number of first preference votes cast. We have not in the present form a paragraph which we had in an original form, that the number of votes would be one for each 1,000 first preference votes, cast at the election.  That is not here at the moment but it could be re-inserted.  The report suggested that each of the candidates at the Dáil election should get one vote for every 1,000 <Col N="1406" /> first preference votes cast for him, and that in addition, for every fraction of 1,000 more than 500, he should get an additional vote, but that no vote should be given for any fraction of less than 500.  That would mean that a candidate who got 1,200 first preference votes would only have one vote in this election, while a candidate who got 1,700 votes would have two votes in this election.</P>

I have been for years considering the question <Col N="1407" /> as to whether there was any method by which we can get a Seanad which would go somewhere towards fulfilling the functions which we ideally associate with a Seanad and I have failed to find one.  I put it up to those who were in favour of a Seanad to try and devise some method of doing so, and this is what we have got from the commission.  It is the best of the recommendations that I have seen.  I am not at all saying that I am satisfied with it.  I think it is very difficult for anybody to be satisfied with any method of building a Second House.  This is the best we could get and it has come from a commission that gave very careful consideration to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider, if we are going to look at this thing in a broad way, what object we had in mind when we tried to establish a Second House.  I wrote an article about this matter, some months before the Seanad Commission sat, in which I asked for a Seanad entirely nominated by the Prime Minister and entirely unpaid except for such expenses as actually would be incurred by members in attending a sitting and some allowance for loss of time.  At £2 per sitting that would mean, if the sittings numbered, say, 35 in the year, as they have in the past, that the total amount paid to a member of the Seanad would be about £70 per year.  The feeling is that to argue in favour of an unpaid Seanad is undemocratic.  I do not agree with that view.  In some very democratic countries they are paid only the sort of amount I have just been indicating&mdash;a mere allowance for expenses.  Of course, the county <Col N="1408" /> councils are unpaid.  Thirty-five afternoons in the year is not an inordinate amount of a man's time for him to devote to the service of his country, and to the defence indeed of his own vocational and professional interests. It seems to me that, provided a man's expenses are covered in the way I have described, there is nothing undemocratic in that.  You must not try to set up a Second Chamber of whole-time politicians.  That is not what a Second Chamber ought to be.  It is laid down here that the object is to have people actively engaged in certain professions and occupations.  If they are actively engaged in these, obviously their duties in the Seanad will take up only a comparatively small proportion of their time.  There is, therefore, no need to pay a man enough to live on.  There is no need in the world for it.  The question of payment is very intimately bound up with the question of nomination, because, if you have nomination and have the sort of salary that it is possible to live on, the task of the nominating authority becomes impossible.  The Prime Minister of the day is bound to have an intolerable amount of pressure put upon him in order to provide for people who have done good service to his Party.  If, on the other hand, there is no monetary advantage in being in the Seanad, the duties of a Senator would come to be regarded as rather burdensome than otherwise, something that a man undertakes for the good of the State, and for the good of the particular section of the people whom he represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we, on the Second Chamber Commission, had known for certain that there was going to be a Second Chamber, if we had been told, &ldquo;There is to be a Second Chamber of some kind, and all you have got to do is to decide on the best kind,&rdquo; we might conceivably have come to different conclusions in this respect from the conclusions to which, in fact, we came. The truth of the matter is that almost everybody on that Second Chamber Commission was anxious to see a Second Chamber.  There was certainly a considerable majority who were anxious to see a Second Chamber, and, therefore, in our findings we were influenced by the fear that if we produced <Col N="1409" /> something which was likely to be unpopular the whole plan of having a Second Chamber might be rejected and nothing might be done, so a scheme like an entirely nominated and unpaid Second Chamber was one which was hardly practicable for the Second Chamber Commission to recommend.</P>
    <P>Whether the majority of the Commission would have recommended it in any case is highly doubtful, but I, personally, would prefer that system to any other, although I should like the nominating authority&mdash;the Prime Minister or head of the State or whoever he might be&mdash;to look to the sort of considerations and follow generally the sort of headlines that are set forth in this Constitution as it stands.  At any rate, for good or ill, it was decided to recommend that only a proportion of the members should be nominated by the Prime Minister or the head of the State.</P>
    <P>Then the question was how to get the rest.  We wanted to get a Second Chamber that would have a different atmosphere from the First Chamber. It seemed to us that the main objects of a Second Chamber are two.  One is to defend democracy against itself; in many countries Party passions have reached such a pitch that the country has been rent asunder by Party violence, and, as a consequence of people getting sick of all that, or as a consequence of one violent Party overcoming the others you got a dictatorship. Secondly, a great advantage of having a Second Chamber is that you have a chance of getting each question that comes forward discussed in a different atmosphere and from a different point of view from what has been surrounding it in the First Chamber&mdash;in the popularly-elected Chamber.  For both these purposes it is essential that the Second Chamber should be, broadly speaking, non-party. That is not to say that the members of the Second Chamber should have no previous affiliations to any political Party or that they should have no preference for one Party over another&mdash;of course, it would be impracticable to achieve that even if you wanted to&mdash; but that on the whole questions there should be discussed in a different frame of mind from the frame of mind of <Col N="1410" /> somebody who was obeying a Party Whip.  We would desire that in the Second Chamber it would be a rare thing to have Party Whips put on at all.  In fact, some of us even hoped that there would not be any Party Whips in the Second Chamber, and that things would not be on a Party basis.</P>
    <P>If you are not going to have a Party basis, you have got to have something to take its place.  That something is indicated here as being broadly vocational. Those panels were devised in order to get a broadly vocational Seanad.  That is something which I would have thought would be welcome to the members of Fine Gael in particular, because it is carrying out the idea which was embodied in the Fine Gael heads of policy which were formulated at the end of 1933 or the beginning of 1934.  It was there laid down that it was desirable to incorporate vocational bodies in our political system, not as an alternative to democracy but as something to improve the working of democracy.  This is an attempt to make a start in that direction.  It is not proposed, and never was proposed by the Fine Gael Party so far as I am aware&mdash;possibly it might be by some individuals who are no longer with them&mdash;that any corporative system should be substituted for the existing system so far as the popular House is concerned, but here is a chance to do something on those lines as regards the Second Chamber. That, it seems to me, ought to be welcomed by Fine Gael, having in mind what their first statement of policy was after the Party was founded. It should also be welcome to many people in this country who are constantly urging us to do more in the way of embodying the principles of various Papal Encyclicals into our political system here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot built up a very fine structure on a very faulty foundation.  I doubt if anybody listening to him was aware of the fact that he was speaking to a proposal that the construction of the Seanad should be as decided by law. There is nothing in that amendment to express the views of any Party, or to <Col N="1411" /> offer an opinion as to whether the Seanad should or should not be paid. There is nothing in that to indicate whether it is reasonable to have a corporative system of representation or otherwise.  The only thing in the amendment, which we understood the Deputy stood up either to support or to oppose, is a suggestion that we should go into all that at a time when we are not in the middle of an important Constitution&mdash;that we should study it by itself.  There is no argument which has been advanced by the Deputy that is not a pungent argument in favour of special consideration for the constitution of the Seanad. The fact that there was a special commission established to consider the Seanad&mdash;a commission which sat on very many occasions and over a great span of time&mdash;is an argument why the only consideration it would get from the Dáil should not be such as could be dovetailed in between another few hundred sections of an important instrument such as the Constitution. If the establishment of that particular commission and its labours are to be justified, and if a tribute is to be paid to the work done by the commission, it can only be by the Dáil considering the construction of the Seanad and the recommendations of the majority group and the minority group separate and aside from the other important clauses in this Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself cannot see where exactly the payment of Senators comes into this amendment to deal with the Seanad by law in the future, but if opinions are to be expressed on that, I should like to put it on record that it is the simplest thing in the world for anyone comparatively well blessed with the world's wealth to lay it down that all or some of the institutions of the State should be on an unpaid basis.  There are wealthy men in the Dáil and there are poor men in the Dáil.  The poor men have given as good service as the wealthy.  They could not give that service were it not for the fact that there were certain financial arrangements made.  There were poor men and wealthy men in the Seanad.  The poor men gave just as much service within the Seanad in the <Col N="1412" /> past as the wealthy, and it would not be in the interests of the Seanad or of the country to deprive the Seanad in the future of the services of that type of person.  However, that is entirely beside the point of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment and all the very weighty arguments advanced by Deputy MacDermot, and the historical account of what decided himself and other members of a certain Commission to arrive at a certain decision, are surely worthy of the very fullest consideration of Dáil Eireann.  Surely, the efforts of the Deputy should stand alone in the centre of the picture, and should not be treated merely as a little addition to the more important things.  Surely, when the Deputy so generously gave his time and services to that Seanad Commission, and when he thinks well to reprimand his late colleagues for not doing likewise, he should pay us the generous tribute of recognising the fact that we had such confidence in him, that once he was a member we thought it would be only pushing him out of the picture for others to be there.  It is neither here nor there what particular motives decided members of this Party not to participate.  They had been standing for an institution that was moderately good in the minds of some and moderately bad in the minds of others. Those who considered it moderately bad razed it to the ground, and it just ceased to be.  We stood strongly against that act of destruction.  Some of us felt that it would be condoning that act immediately on its ashes to participate in a tribunal to resurrect some other type of structure there, because obviously the destructionists had to justify and defend it.  Repudiation of the act of destruction would be read into the construction of a Seanad similar to the previous one.  I do not want to embarrass builders who had lately been destroyers.  Our only desire was that there should be another Seanad.</P>

If there <Col N="1413" /> was dry rot in the other, it certainly has eaten into the timbers of this one. Perhaps part of the dry rot is the best portion.  Be that as it may, the new Seanad deserves fair play and full consideration. It deserves close study, and I strongly urge the President and the Government that the constitution of the new Seanad should be &ldquo;as defined by law&rdquo; rather than that we should tie ourselves up to a certain type of Seanad now in a Constitution, which subsequently, if we have any reason or desire to change our mind as a Dáil or Parliament, might make it impossible to express that change of mind.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and others have had nearly a year to consider the Report of the Second Chamber Commission, and it is many months since the Government announced that they intended to incorporate in this Constitution a Seanad of the type roughly recommended in the Minority Report of the Second Chamber Commission.  Why then should they treat the matter as one suddenly taken out of their hands by the President and the Executive Council; something that is quite inappropriate to be considered in connection with the Constitution; something they have not thought of, something they are not ready to consider, and something that they have not anything valuable to say about at present? It seems to me that that attitude is most unreasonable.  They put a Seanad into their own Constitution.  Why should there not be a Seanad in this Constitution?  I am anxious to see it there, and to see the general framework indicated there.  I think it provides something of value, something that might be lost for ever, for all I know, if not embodied in the Constitution. I think it would be criminal folly for anyone eager to see the right sort of Seanad to miss the opportunity now of getting the general outline of the Seanad provided here.  The question of payment does not enter into the Constitution or the amendment.  I only referred to it in so far as it bears on the question of nomination, and, in view of what Deputy O'Higgins said, <Col N="1414" /> I wish to say this, I utterly repudiate and disclaim any thought of excluding a poor man from the Second Chamber. I would utterly disapprove of anything of the kind.  We are dealing with a House which is not to be a Chamber composed of full time politicians devoting really most of their time to politics, as we are here.  The sort of provision for remuneration appropriate here is not necessarily appropriate as regards the Second Chamber.  My view is that a poor man could be so compensated as fully to provide for any loss he might sustain.  We cannot discuss the question of payment now, but I wish to repudiate the suggestion that I want an undemocratic Second House.  I do not.</P>

      <P>It would be very foolish of us to think that we would get anything like agreement on this here.  The question of the formation of the Seanad is certainly one of the subjects on which each one holds an opinion, and also on which one differs very largely.  I think the best thing is to try to make progress with this.  This is the system which was suggested by the Commission that had to deal with it.  With regard to the electorate, I have been looking up the report, and I think I am right in saying that the electorate suggested by the Minority Report was the Dáil itself, and not this particular electorate.</P>

      <P>I took the wider one in the hope that there would be a better opportunity for minority representation, and also that there would be less opportunity for what a number of people feared of a sort of machine, that it was better to have a wider electorate.  With regard to Deputy O'Higgins' point, that we ought to leave this liquid, I hold the same view as Deputy MacDermot, that if we are to have a Constitution with a Second House in it, it is our duty to have the framework as definite as we reasonably can.  I will concede this to Deputy MacDermot's point of view, that to the extent to which we are not able to make it definite, there is a fault.  If <Col N="1415" /> anybody can go farther to make this definite in its form here, I will go and meet him so far as I can, if he can prove that he is advancing along this line and getting a farther distance than I think we can get.  I would regard as a fault the extent to which we would fall short of completely defining the Seanad, and it is our duty to do it so far as we can.  As the Minority Report points out, we have not the type of organisation here to make it possible to elect directly.  That would be the ideal thing.  If we had that organisation, you could elect directly.  The only bodies I found at my hand that could elect directly were the universities.  I do not think that was exactly provided for in the Minority Report.  Although they indicated generally that that was the desirable thing, I think they stopped short themselves of doing that in the case of a body that was organised in such a way that that could be done.  I must say then that I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The President gave us a reason for this particular method of election that he was anxious to avoid re-duplication of the Dáil so far as possible.  If he looks at subparagraphs 3 and 4 of Section 7 of this Article, he will find that really what he has done is to secure re-duplication of the Dáil with other machinery.  That is more or less what he has done.  His slavery to the bridge score idea brings it even closer&mdash;the idea that there will be a vote for every 1,000, and that every score over 500 shall count as being equal to 1,000.  That will lead to a re-duplication of the Dáil, and that is objectionable.  I quite agree that we should get a Second Chamber that is different from the Dáil as much as possible, but I do not think that this method of election will do it.  That is the reason for postponing it.  Is that the best the President can do, although he has had this under consideration for a number of years?</P>

      <P>I want to deal with another thing to which he referred and to which another speaker referred &mdash;our non-participation in a certain committee.  The other speaker, who seemed to find fault with that attitude, provided a very good justification for it.  He indicated that it was impossible that the members of that committee could consider proposals for a Second Chamber on their merits, because they did not know whether there was going to be a Second Chamber or not.  &ldquo;Dealing with such an unreasonable man as the President,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we tried to do the best we could; therefore, we will not put forward a Seanad that is good or that we think is the best, but we will give him one that we think he can swallow.&rdquo;  I think the House will agree that that is a fair paraphrase of what Deputy MacDermot said.

He stated the other night here that truth from anywhere except the Fine Gael Benches was more or less the motto he adopted.  These were very good reasons for not participating. This Article, as it stands, this method of election, is really fundamentally absurd.  The President speaks about leaving things vague. Section 4 is very vague.  We do not know what number of votes anybody will have&mdash;that is to be determined by law.  So vague is it that a distinguished member of the Commission did not know it was there at all in discussing this particular Constitution.  It is there.  We do not know but that a man who gets 10,000 preference votes <Col N="1417" /> and a man who gets 500 may have the same vote.</P>

I therefore repudiate the paraphrase which Deputy O'Sullivan has suggested. I maintain my view that it was an error of political tactics&mdash;it is courageous to say that when talking of such brilliant, or at any rate such practised, tacticians as the Front Bench of the Opposition&mdash;but also a fault in patriotism.  When Deputy O'Higgins gets up here this evening and speaks as if the constitution of a Second Chamber was something which he had not ever devoted a moment's thought to and something which was unreasonably sprung upon us in connection with this Constitution, he is giving away his Party completely <Col N="1418" /> They had nearly a year to consider the Second Chamber Commission's report.</P>

      <P>This amendment raises the whole question of the vocational character of this proposed Chamber. I have very grave doubts as to whether it is practicable in existing circumstances in this country to resort to the method of the election of the Second Chamber on a vocational basis.  When you come to consider the question of vocational organisation in this country the outstanding fact is that there is very little vocational organisation within the country, and certainly there is no type of organisation that justifies us in setting out in this simple, easy way of providing in this Constitution for quite a whole variety of vocational groups.  I think that any effort to implement this Constitution, providing for a Seanad to be elected on a vocational basis, will evidently produce considerable difficulty and will not be satisfactory.  For instance, the first panel referred to in Article 18 is one consisting of persons who have &ldquo;practical knowledge and experience of the following interests and services, namely (1) National language and culture, education, and such professional interests as may be defined by law for the purpose of this panel.&rdquo;  What type of organisation will be entitled to make nominations in this panel?  If you look at the category you will find there is quite a number of organisations, a number of them without any corporate character or corporate existence, and resumably all of them will be entitled to turn up and demand their nomination on the panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> When you come to (ii)&mdash;&ldquo;Agriculture and allied interests, and Fisheries,&rdquo; you will have every organisation claiming under that.  You will always have amongst these numbers of people demanding to get on the panel. Trying to get anything like vocational organisation in agriculture is praying that the moon will some day come down to earth.  Then we pass on to the third: &ldquo;Labour, whether organised or unorganised.&rdquo;  I would like to know what type of bodies or people will come in under that category?</P>

      <P>In the category of &ldquo;Labour, whether organised or unorganised,&rdquo; there are to be certain nominations.  I wonder whether the President has any conception of the kind of difficulty that will arise in defining the persons who are to be nominated in the way this category has been set out?  I presume under the category of &ldquo;National language and culture&rdquo; there are people who also labour.  I suppose people under &ldquo;Agriculture and Allied Industries and Fisheries&rdquo; also labour.  Why are they separated from group (iii), Labour, and why is Labour separated from them?  Then we come to (iv), Industry and Commerce.  That group, too, can be included in the category of Labour.  I think if you have to have a Seanad&mdash;and I still have the same view as I held previously, that no case has been shown for the creation of a Seanad&mdash;it ought to be a Seanad of the kind that will work without this sort of cumbersome machinery that will be set up under Article 18.  I think the former method of electing a Seanad was as good as any other method that could be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> That was a method by which people were nominated by members of the Dáil and elected by members of the Dáil.  That was just as good a method as the one set out here.  My fear is that we are simply marching ahead of time and we are trying to create a Seanad on a vocational basis without having vocational bases within the country on which to build.  It seems, therefore, to be an entire mistake at this stage in the circumstances of this country with its sparse population, with its relatively young commercial and industrial growth and with very little effective type of organisation to be setting out to build a Seanad on a vocational basis, when nothing else within the country is built on a vocational basis.  At all events, the proposal to constitute a Seanad on a vocational basis has not my approval.  We started out here to give this Constitution a novelty which is not justified in the circumstances of this country.  Deputy MacDermot said that the Second Chamber Commission felt that the order was something new and novel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was aware that the President had his knife in the previous Seanad, and if there was any case for going back to the President with the ghost of the former corpse you had to dress up the ghost in a way that would not excite the President's anger again, and this view of a Second Chamber was brought along in the hope that the President might be appeased on the second occasion and be sorry for his first act and that he would say: &ldquo;I will take this.&rdquo;  When you have said that you have put your finger on the only reason for producing a Seanad in this country.  That is the only explanation for the introduction of a Seanad now.  The idea was &ldquo;Try something on the President which is different from the last Seanad and give him some reason for saying: &lsquo;Oh, well, this is not the same Seanad as the <Col N="1421" /> last one.&rsquo;&rdquo; If you gave him back something that was there before in the existing Constitution it would have no chance of being accepted and they said: &ldquo;Let us give him something that is novel so that he will be able to accept it and that he will be able to say &lsquo;No one can now say I am inconsistent because I am introducing this Seanad&rsquo;.&rdquo;  The scheme has worked well.  The President has accepted this proposal to form the Second Chamber Commission.  The President is blowing hot and cold on the Seanad.  He made speeches here denouncing the Seanad. The Fianna Fáil Party stumped the country also in their denunciation of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it was suggested in the majority report.  I am saying that those members who signed it were very wise in their strategy.  They wanted a Second Chamber.  The President had abolished the Second Chamber.  The Fianna Fáil Party had acclaimed its abolition with enthusiasm and one would expect that they, at least, would stand for a unicameral system.  It was obvious after a time that the President had changed his mind about the Seanad question and Fianna Fáil felt that &ldquo;because father changed we should all change,&rdquo; and they began to cultivate the view of a Second Chamber.  The tacticians who worked with Deputy MacDermot on the Second Chamber Commission said: &ldquo;He is weakening on the Second Chamber question, but anything like a Seanad constituted like the old Seanad would be anathema to the President.  He will destroy any scheme for a Seanad that contains provisions like the first Seanad just as he destroyed the first Seanad; let us bring back a new scheme for a Seanad, something that will be novel to him so that he will not have to retrace his footsteps; having regard to the wobbly attitude he has shown on <Col N="1422" /> Second Chambers, he will probably embrace this scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the tacticians responsible for the minority report, the theory was successful. It happened that the minority report produced a scheme for a Second Chamber and the President, wobbling on the desirability of a Second Chamber, immediately grasped this thing and so we have it in the Draft Constitution to-day.  We have that scheme not because it is a method of producing a good Second Chamber but because it is different from the one abolished by the President.  That is the only reason for its being here. That being the private view of the President, he would recognise that, though the former Second Chamber had better machinery for its election, still because it was different from the Second Chamber that he abolished he was ready to accept it.  The old method of electing the Second Chamber gave you a certain type of people who were just as good as can be got under this method and they could be got just as easily.</P>

      <P>Easier because the method of selecting the previous Seanad was that certain members of the Dáil nominated them and in that way it was quite easy to affix the test of nomination to the candidates. Under this proposal you will necessarily have to create a big superstructure in order to find out whether the people selected belong to a certain panel.  Who is to certify that they belong to different interests and services? Who is to certify that a certain individual is connected with labour, whether organised or unorganised, that he is not a person associated with agriculture and allied interests, and fisheries?  Who is to certify whether he belongs properly to labour or industry?</P>

      <P>We saw the suggestions that are contained in the report, but they are not in the Draft Constitution. It is still possible to pass a law giving effect to an entirely different scheme and not one of the suggestions made in the Minority Report may be embodied in the proposed legislation.  I am opposed to a Second House, but if we are to have a Second House we ought to be able to get one with the greatest ease and simplicity.  I do not think we would be getting that under the proposals in this Draft Constitution. I think that under these proposals you are creating an unnecessarily heavyweight structure and the difficulties of that structure will become apparent once an effort is made to classify people under these different panels.  I am opposed to this whole conception of a vocational Chamber in the circumstances existing in this country.  I do not think you have vocational organisations adequate to enable you to resort to this method of election.  You merely will get endless difficulties, big obstacles and an unsatisfactory method of election when you try to put into operation a system to which the country in the existing circumstances does not lend itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that the atmosphere in which the Commission with regard to a Second Chamber brought in its variety of reports was that which was engendered by the President when he said in the House that Adams was no mean political thinker; he stood for the Single Chamber.  As Deputy Norton has said, after that wise pronouncement the Fianna Fáil Party went around the country shouting &ldquo;Up Adams,&rdquo; whoever he was, whichever Adams it was, because the President had said that Adams was no mean political thinker and he stood for the Single Chamber.  After the President announced that most modern minds had come round to the view that the Single Chamber government was the best, he decided that he would get as many simple people of the Deputy MacDermot type as there were in the country to go into a room and see if they could oblige him either by falling out over the details of the Second <Col N="1424" /> Chamber or doing what they ultimately did do, submitting to him several suggestions.  I do not suppose that the President's objective was quite clear even on the day the terms of reference came out.  At any rate, Deputy MacDermot went into that commission with others and he helped to give the President the justification for including this nonsense in the Draft Constitution because he provided him with what amounted to disagreement in detail and he enabled him to say that nobody could agree about a Second Chamber, but he would endeavour to provide something which people might regard as better than a Single Chamber and, retracing his steps, he submits this proposal in his Draft Constitution.</P>
      <P>We have in the Draft Constitution this entirely novel electorate.  It is an electorate which, when one reads about it first, cannot strike anybody as being a sensible one.  In opposition to that is a proposal that the members of the Seanad shall be elected on a franchise and in the manner and for the term to be provided by law. The suggestion is that this matter should be left over to be determined by law.  It would not be part of the organic law of this country.  The proposal here is that the Seanad should be composed of a certain number, that it should have certain powers and that it should be chosen from a particular electorate.  The majority here voted in favour of a Single Chamber Government and the President has had served up to him a variety of suggestions from a carefully handpicked committee.  It is surely a proper thing to suggest that in a country which has had experience of a Seanad there should not be an attempt to fix here for all time what is to be the method of selecting the personnel of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that Deputy MacDermot has some doubts as to whether there is anybody capable in this country of producing a plan for a Second Chamber. That is not so much the difficulty; the difficulty is that there are so many plans for a Second Chamber capable of being produced and they can all be considered admirable when viewed from a different standpoint.  Modern <Col N="1425" /> thinkers are generally in favour of a Second Chamber Government all through the world, and if you took the best of these minds in countries which have had experience of Second Chambers you probably would not get them to agree on the terms of reference the President put before the Commission previously.  I suggest that you cannot think accurately about a Second Chamber when the terms of reference more or less indicate &ldquo;If you decide to have a Second Chamber, tell us what you think it ought to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first pivotal point is, do you intend that the Seanad should take office at the same time as the representative House?  Do you intend that the Second Chamber should be an elected body?  Then, if you are going to have a change, with the wave of popular opinion that brings about a change, the particular powers you should give to such a body would be entirely different to those given to a House constituted under different conditions. If you think you are going to have a House so made up that it would not in its entirety go out of office or out of being on the day on which the representative House ceases to exist, if you are aiming at having an overlap and that the Seanad built up under one administration would hang over for a certain number of years, then I think you would give entirely different powers.</P>
    <P>The people who were collected together at that Commission did not even think fit to address a question to the President or to his nominees, so far as the records produced show, as to whether there was anything in the President's mind with regard to a Second Chamber, what was the type he thought of, whether he wanted a Seanad with powers of delay or a Seanad with powers of amendment, whether it was to be free, or would it be confined because of money matters or constitutional matters.  Anybody could have seen that confusion was bound to be the result of a commission set up in the way that that commission was set up.  Can anybody say that there is sufficient thought given to this matter in this document?  Can <Col N="1426" /> anybody say that he believes that what is here is better than any alternative suggestion that can be thought of?  Is there any argument sufficiently definite as to this fancy electorate?  Have the details been properly thought out?  Is there any reason why there should be panels of candidates chosen more or less on a vocational basis?  Is anybody convinced that the panels are exhausted or have been properly provided?</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why a Constitution which is to be changeable only by a process of referendum after three years should contain the details that are here with regard to these panels, the people they are to represent and the electorate that is to choose them? Will any harm be done by leaving these matters over for determination by ordinary law?  Is it ludicrous to suggest that any harm would be done in such circumstances?  I suggest that the powers of the Seanad should be left over for determination by ordinary law.  Even if you take the powers that are proposed to be given, can anybody say that this is the best suggestion that could be made?  Has the President discussed any alternatives? I suggest that there is a case for leaving over certain matters connected with the Seanad for determination by ordinary law.  For instance, the numerical strength of the Seanad could be left over.  Can anybody see any harm accruing to the State if radical changes affecting everything that occurs after paragraph 4 are left over for determination later?  I only limit it to paragraph 4 as a reasonable stopping point.  Can anybody see any harm accruing to the State if the whole Article dealing with the Seanad be changed, and changed several times, in the next three years?  Is there anything that would shake the foundations of the State if the particular policy in regard to the Seanad is not fixed and immovable?</P>
    <P>There is an interesting development in all this matter.  There are certain types of arguments from which one can see personality projecting and types of argument from which one can see arguments on personal experience proceeding.  That is definitely Deputy <Col N="1427" /> MacDermot's attitude on this question of a Second House.  On one occasion he spoke of what seemed to mean the desirability of having election with regard to the Second House.  That was at a time when Deputy MacDermot felt secure somewhere in the country as an elected member.  A little later, he became wedded to nomination.  He was getting a little insecure with regard to the elective process in respect of himself.  Now, he is all for the lot, which is the last gamble of a defeated man.</P>

      <P>I question that very much.  What the President said a few minutes ago is perfectly true. If you put up any workable scheme for a Second Chamber, almost everybody who looks at it will think of improvements upon it.  There is no perfect or ideal scheme.  The number of permutations and combinations that are possible with regard to a Second House is infinite, and the longer you put it off the more difficulty and the more confusion you will have.  Why are the leaders of the Opposition insisting on a course being followed here which they did not adopt themselves?  They put a Seanad in their Constitution and these clear thinkers made numerous subsequent alterations with regard to the arrangements for the Seanad.  The truth of the matter is that these proposals are not perfect&mdash;far from it. They are especially imperfect at a time when the vocational basis we hope some day will exist does not, as Deputy Norton has said, exist as fully as we should like to see it.  Even when these things develop further, the Seanad will not be a perfect body. Few people will be found to say that <Col N="1428" /> it is in all respects the best of all possible arrangements for creating a Seanad.  But if we have to wait until the House is unanimous, or nearly unanimous, on that question, we shall have to wait for ever.</P>
      <P>The arguments which Deputy McGilligan is putting up are extremely mischievous because they create a danger of our having no Second Chamber at all.  They are mischievous from the point of view of anybody who is anxious to have a Second Chamber, if at all possible.  I do not believe that the Second Chamber the President abolished was at all as satisfactory as the Second Chamber that can be created by these proposals.  I do not believe that for the reason that the last Second Chamber was a Party body.  On most measures that came before it, the Party Whips were put on and a decision was taken on a Party basis.  If you want a Second Chamber of that kind, which is frankly a reflection of this Chamber, except in so far as there is an overlap, adopt the Norwegian system, which many people do not consider a Second Chamber system at all, and have just a Revising Committee appointed from this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want something that is not a reflection of this House, you are driven to constitute it on some other principle and to make it unlike the last Seanad. If one is to be perfectly frank, the merit of the last Seanad consisted largely in the fact that it was originally to so great an extent nominated and that it was nominated not at a time when Party warfare was in full swing but at a time when the State was being created and when the nominating authority had other things to think of than Party considerations.  If the Seanad had been merely elected from this House from the beginning, without any sort of limitation as to who might be elected, if it had been elected purely on a Party basis from the beginning, I conceive that it would not have had the measure of merit to which I have referred.  That is why I consider that the Second Chamber was, in fact, on the down grade at the time it was abolished.  I do not mean by that that the people put into it were unworthy people, but that they went in with a <Col N="1429" /> Party outlook and stayed in with a Party outlook.  If you are going to have another Chamber in which opinions are divided on a Party basis, you are simply re-duplicating this House, and that is not worth while.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan refers to this &ldquo;fancy electorate&rdquo; with great contempt. I utterly disagree with this fancy electorate.  I do not favour the proposal.  It is not in the report I signed, and I hope we shall get it altered when we come to it.  But Deputy McGilligan himself admits that powers and composition are closely inter-related.  Now the powers of the head of the State, the powers of the Dáil and the powers of the Second Chamber are closely connected.  One depends on the other.  We cannot pass a Constitution which says that there is going to be a Second Chamber without saying what its powers are to be.  If you put in the powers, you must put in a general outline of the composition, because none of us is willing to arrange for the giving of powers to a body of whose composition we know nothing at all.  At the same time, you can, of course, go too far.  The minority report recognises that and says: &ldquo;In connection with the proposed machinery for the selection of the Second Chamber, we are of the opinion that only the broad principles on which our recommendations are based should be embodied in the Constitution, leaving the details to be fixed by ordinary legislation.&rdquo;  That is exactly what the President is doing. He is attempting to put as much into the Constitution as he appropriately can, leaving a certain amount of elasticity for the arrangement of the details later.  It is not a thing we are passing for all time.  The Constitution can be altered.</P>

If the Constitution is to be a Constitution in any real sense of the word and we are putting in a <Col N="1430" /> Second Chamber, we must give some sort of outline of the principles on which it is to be formed.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan says that modern thinkers are all in favour of a Second Chamber.  That is a statement that to me has no meaning.  I do not know how anybody can be in favour of a Second Chamber without some explanation of what a Second Chamber means.  Does it mean a revising committee, a Second House, that is a reflection of the first House?  If you mean that they are in favour of something that is to be more than a reflection of the first House, then it must be constituted on some different principle. You do not want to arrange that the Second Chamber should always be in opposition to the first Chamber, that it should be Tory if Radicals are in power and <i>vice versa.</i>  Nor do you want to arrange that it shall be identical with the first House.  Here is an attempt to get something on different principles from the first House.  It is perfectly easy for every individual who looks at it to sneer at it.  The first instinct of anybody looking at any Second Chamber scheme is to sneer at it and say that this and that is unreasonable and illogical.  Let anybody who is inclined to talk like that sit down and attempt to work out a Second Chamber scheme for himself and he will find the difficulties.  If we are to postpone consideration of this matter until everybody has done that, I predict with confidence that the result will be nothing but confusion.</P>

      <P>What is really wrong with the Opposition in connection with this proposal is that they were accustomed to a certain kind of Seanad which was really a reflex of this House.  That Seanad was a very serviceable instrument in the hands of the Opposition.  It was a very willing and pliant instrument and an Opposition accustomed to a Chamber like that, which was simply a reflex of a certain Party organisation, naturally object to any deviation from that type of Seanad.  Not only was it a reflex of this House but the present Minister for Lands said, before its abolition, that it was rapidly becoming a home for political derelicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> Nobody can say that a slight deviation from that form of Seanad is any harm.  Nobody who looks at the provisions of Article 18 will deny that there is a possibility of working out a better type of Seanad under it than the last Seanad.  I frankly admit that I was one of those bitterly opposed to the last Seanad.  Evidently, there is a volume of opinion which wants a Second Chamber and which wants delay in legislation.  Whether we like it or not, that section of opinion exists.  If a certain commission set up here puts forward certain proposals which are embodied in this Constitution, I consider that those constitute a better basis on which to build a Second Chamber than the basis on which the old Seanad was constituted.  That should be a closed chapter.  Deputy McGilligan, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputies of their standing in this House would be well advised to close that phase in the history of the Oireachtas.  Not a single voter would say, whatever may be his opinion about the plan for a new Second Chamber, that the old Chamber did not get its deserts.</P>

I take it that when that is the natural instinct on the part of everybody, he must be speaking from his own experience.  It is really after examination that this Article demands condemnation. Deputy Norton, in speaking of the vocational basis, must have recognised that there is no vocational basis for the election of the Seanad.  What is contained in Article 7 is not a vocational basis, since it does not limit in any real sense the power of the electorate or the proposers.  There is no real limitation.  It leaves the electorate perfectly free to elect anybody.  Can you imagine any Seanad of 43 elected people which would not contain representatives of any of the grades set out? No matter what you would do, it would contain representatives of these groups. There is no vocational basis.  That is one of the pieces of pretence of which we have several examples in this Constitution. I should call it a &ldquo;pious resolution,&rdquo; only I do not know why <Col N="1432" /> people describe as &ldquo;pious&rdquo; resolutions in which they have not the slightest belief.</P>

      <P>We are objecting to passing futilities, and this is merely a futility.  The Deputy thinks this is a step towards the corporative organisation of a Second Chamber.  It corresponds to Article 45; it is a thing without power.  Deputy MacDermot spoke&mdash;I presume the President will agree with him&mdash;about certain limitations on the power of choice.  There is no such limitation here.  I put it again to any member of this House: Take these five groups, get a Party organisation going, select a Party Seanad, and it will be very hard for them not to fulfil the terms of that Article.  They would have to go out of their way not to do that.  Here, at last, I gather, is something superior to the last Chamber, because it is non-political. We have one non-political personage in the new President, and the opinion of the President of the Executive Council as to a non-political personage is, apparently, akin to the opinion that the <i>Irish Press</i> is a non-political newspaper.  Here we are to have a non-political Seanad elected by political people&mdash;people who are first and foremost politicians and who are elected because of that and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with what is in this particular Article which is supposed to give us a non-political body.  That body is to be selected by politicians and nobody else.  It is quite obvious, judging from the arguments we have heard, that this proposal has not got a moment's consideration either from the President or from the Lord Chief Justice of this House, who sits in judgment on the <Col N="1433" /> various proposals that come before us. It has not got any consideration, and, for that reason, I think the House should adopt the amendment we have put forward.  In reality, what has happened is that, for some reason unknown to anybody&mdash;possibly unknown to himself&mdash;the President changed his mind on Second Chambers and said: &ldquo;Here is one; take it or leave it.&rdquo;  There has been no argument in favour of this method of election.  I have not heard a word said in favour of it.  It is different from election in the case of the Dáil.  Of course, it is.  Whether the results will be different is another matter.  I think they will be largely the same.  You will have a duplication of the Dáil.  It is fantastic.  The only reason for it is that it is absurd and therefore the proper place for it is here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the position of agreeing with almost everything that has been said by the leaders of the Opposition, but I disagree with them in thinking that they have established a case for the amendment they propose which takes away so many of the provisions of the Draft that is before us.  I gather that there was a certain amount of criticism of the conduct of the commission which sat during the summer months last year as to the manner in which it devoted itself to its duties and as to the attitude it adopted in considering the important question on which its opinion was asked.  It has been suggested, on the one hand, that this commission devoted itself to considering what the President would be ready to swallow in the shape of a Second Chamber.  As far as my knowledge of that commission goes, I repudiate that view strongly.  I do not think that many of the members of that commission thought that the attitude with which they should approach the question was one of considering what would suit the palate either of the Government or of the Opposition.  I think they devoted themselves to the duties that they were asked to undertake: to suggest the best sort of Second Chamber the country should have, if it was decided that we should have a Second Chamber, what sort of powers it should <Col N="1434" /> have, and to suggest in what manner it should be elected.</P>
      <P>I do not think it was any part of their duty to consider what view the President might have, what views his colleagues in the Government might have, or what views the Front Opposition might have except in so far those views might be of value in themselves. That is to say, the commission considered it its duty to design the most useful form of Second Chamber that it could and, in the minds of most of the members, I think that was associated with the desire that a Second Chamber, if decided on, would be such as to commend itself both to the President and to his colleagues on the one hand, and to the Opposition on the other.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy McGilligan criticised the commission for not having invited the opinion of the President as to what sort of Second House he would like.  I think that would have been a grave dereliction of duty on the part of the commission&mdash;to adopt from the very start a subservient position to the President. I think that would have argued a lack of self-respect on the part of the members of the commission who accepted service on the commission to carry out to the best of their ability the terms of reference of their appointment. I think it is extremely easy to criticise any Draft Constitution for a Second Chamber.  In substance, almost all the criticism that I have heard this evening both from the Front Opposition Bench and from Deputy Norton could, I think, have been brought with almost equal force against any other Draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confirmed in that view by remembering the development in view that was shown by several members of the commission who sat during last summer. The views of many of them after two or three months' discussion developed to a very great extent. They differed very considerably from the views they had put before their colleagues when the commission first sat.  That showed that to them the matter was a very important and a very difficult one.  It showed, too, that <Col N="1435" /> they were willing to listen to reason and to argument, and to modify their views accordingly.  In that way a large amount of agreement was got.  It is evidence, too, that where their views differed from those expressed by others they were ready to seek what might appear to be their individual opinions.</P>
    <P>On only one point can I remember that a reference was made to what view the President might have in regard to a particular matter that came up for discussion, namely, the question of nomination.  The President had expressed himself in this House very strongly on the difficulty of anyone in his position, or the head of any Government, in nominating the members of a Second Chamber.  As well as I remember, he has said that he himself would be unwilling to accept that responsibility.  That is the only point on which I remember any member of the Commission referring to what might suit the President's wishes.  The opinion of a very large number of members of the Commission was that, in many respects, the best Chamber we could have would be a Chamber which would be very largely nominated, while they recognised that at some time such a Chamber would be easily open to attack.  The same thing would be likely to happen in the future as had happened in the past: that, when those who had been in office with the power to make nominations had passed out of power, those coming in would feel themselves hampered by the nominees of their predecessors, and that those nominees would be attacked as biased and not suitable for their position. Such criticism is natural and inevitable and would certainly have occurred if a large element of nomination had been suggested for the Second Chamber. With a comparatively small amount of nomination now in the Draft apparently the President would be willing to undertake to nominate if he should be in a position to do so.  I think that anyone in the position of head of a Government will, in the main, exercise an honest and detached choice in those whom he will nominate to a position of such importance as membership <Col N="1436" /> of a Second Chamber.  It would be undoubtedly difficult for him to tear himself away from Party claims and Party ties, but still I think he could be relied on to show that he could choose men who might be opposed to him politically, whose services he believed would be of value in the Second Chamber.  I have no criticism to make of the number of nominees that it is proposed to include in the Second Chamber.</P>
    <P>I now come to the very difficult question&mdash;the suggested vocational, or quasi-vocational, basis for the Second Chamber.  I quite agree with Deputy Professor O'Sullivan that what is proposed is not really on a vocational basis.  I do not think it is divulging any secret to say that almost unanimously, if not unanimously, the commission was in favour of finding a vocational basis for a Second Chamber, but that when they came to consider the matter in detail they found the difficulties so great that they were deterred from pursuing it further.  I think that is a fairly accurate statement of the attitude of mind of a considerable number of the members of the commission.</P>
    <P>I admire the courage of the President in what he has done in regard to approaching towards a vocational basis, as he has done in this Draft.  I recognise, however, that when legislative measures are to be brought forward, and when this matter comes to be considered in detail, it may be found extremely difficult to apply the principles set out in the Draft and to work them out in practice.  A vocational basis for one house of the Legislature is found in many different countries, differing as much as Fascist Italy and Communist Russia, as well as in democratic countries.  There is a body of modern opinion certainly in favour of a vocational basis of some sort for one or other House of the Legislature.  I do think that there is going to be very great difficulty in framing a piece of legislation to carry the idea into practice.  All the difficulties that Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McGilligan pointed out are likely to occur.  The question for the Dáil to consider is whether they are insuperable, and whether such a basis as that is one which is desirable or not. <Col N="1437" /> When one considers the vocational basis one is very much inclined to slip into thinking mainly of those interests or vocations which are already well organised, forgetting that these represent really a comparatively small proportion of the community and that many of the interests which, at the moment, are in this country, relatively unorganised, deserve consideration also.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Norton said that we were trying to be before our time in this respect, I think there was a good deal of truth in his statement.  I think it was necessary, if the Government had it in mind that this should be a part of our Constitution, to leave it more or less vague for the moment.  As things are at the moment, I am sure that it would take a very long time to get any kind of reasonable agreement for carrying this into practice, and, therefore, I think that the matter has to be left vague.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the proposed electorate, and I think that Deputy O'Sullivan said that, so far, nothing had been said in defence of it.  Well, I suggest one point that can be said in defence of it at any rate, and that is that it will represent a considerable and widespread body of opinion in the country when it is called into action.  Many who have considered the matter of a Second Chamber recognise that unless the method of election is based, either directly or indirectly, on a popular vote, such a Second Chamber would lose much of its authority&mdash;that it would be peculiarly liable to be attacked as an aristocratic or an oligarchical body or something of that kind.  Now, this device which the President has adopted&mdash;not, I think, on the advice of the Minority Report in this case&mdash;does base itself, indirectly it is true, on a reasonably expressed popular vote in the country.  I think that the fact that those who have been candidates for membership of this House can show that they have received the support of a certain number of people and that they have a certain reasonable amount of support behind them in the country&mdash;500 in this Draft&mdash;should be <Col N="1438" /> sufficient to show that that number of people, at least, have confidence in the persons concerned, both as to their capacity and their probity, and that they consider them to be people of standing and suitable to represent them in the Government of the country.  Therefore, by giving such people a voice in the election of a Second Chamber, I think that, not alone are you having it on popular support, but you are getting a body of responsible people to exercise their choice, and I think that it is a distinct advance on the system that, as far as I could gather it, Deputy Donnelly was advocating for the election of members to the Second Chamber by members of the Dáil alone.  You will have a larger number and a more widespread authority, and you will have a body in which one could have more confidence than if they were a body elected by this House.  I think it would be impossible to avoid having an election by the members of this House on a Party basis.  The tickets would be drawn up by the Party whips and there would be an extraordinary mathematical calculation as to the numbers to be counted on by each Party.  That will not be so easy where one is dealing with a much larger electoral college and where many of the people who will be entitled to vote in that electoral college are not amenable to Party influences at all.  There will be a certain number of independent people&mdash; and, I have no doubt, a certain amount of cranks&mdash;who will be allowed to have some voice in the election of the Second House.</P>
    <P>I think that, when one considers all the various devices that have been put forward as regards the method of election to the Second House, it is possible that you will get some as good as this, but I think that you will get few that will be open to less objection or criticism than the suggested method. The scheme, of course, is open to criticisms, easy to make and genuine in substance, but I think that any other scheme put forward would also be open to criticisms, and I think that the scheme devised by the President, who probably has done as well as could be <Col N="1439" /> expected in view of the difficulties of the problem, and has considered the advice given by the Commission, which certainly gave a good deal of thought and a good deal of discussion to this question of a method of election, will be open to very little objection.</P>

Has this matter been discussed by people in the country, and can anybody say here, with regard to it, that they know that there is a definite feeling in their constituencies <Col N="1440" /> about this matter?  I doubt if anybody here can say that he has talked about that detail.</P>

      <P>Is that what the Deputy thinks?  If so, they will probably accept this as the nearest thing to no Seanad, and they will probably accept the method of electing it as being the nearest approach to bringing about no Seanad.  When you have this talk about certain matters to be determined by law, why do you stop at this one thing and say, with regard to the system of panels, that a man must, in some way or another, by hook or by crook, or by some change in the law, get himself fit to be elected by managing to have himself included under one of these heads?  Why should these heads be there?  I would not object if there was a proposal put forward for making certain changes by way of legislation, because I think that the only way to get a body of opinion behind any scheme in connection with a Constitution is after a series of changes have been made; but where you have written down certain things as part of the Constitution and then say that certain other things are to be determined by law, I hold that they should not be written into the Constitution. I say that this question of groups or panels should not be written into the Constitution, this thing of saying that a person must be a member of a certain group before he can qualify as a candidate for election.  Deputy Dr. Rowlette has talked with some praise of the panel system and has said that any other system would be subject to as much criticism.  You cannot test that until you have schemes put forward. Has there been time to put forward schemes?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Rowlette flatters himself, if he thinks it caused any discussion in the country. I suggest the Deputy should not be vain enough to think that anybody discussed that document, the methods by which it was brought forth and the circumstances surrounding it.  There was no argument about it.  I doubt if there were more than two newspaper articles in regard to it.  There has been no discussion, even as to whether the methods of election which the members of the Commission put forward in their various reports were founded on practical experience, whether they were a mixture of what had been taken from other countries or whether they had proved to be good, bad or indifferent in other countries.  There has not been one exciting night, one exciting hour, in the country over the report or what was contained in it. Yet, a Second Chamber is an important matter.  There are certain people in various groups who meet in various representative organisations that one would naturally assume should meet and discuss it, but they have not discussed it, whether it was that they had not the time or not I do not know.  It may be that some of them turned over quickly to see what were the powers of the Seanad and that, having seen them, they decided that it did not matter whether they got representation in it or not.  I do think that the powers and personnel of the Seanad are inextricably intertwined.  The proper way to start is not with the personnel but with the powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that this Seanad will be a better body than the old Seanad.  I could imagine people saying that but I cannot imagine that assertion being based on the argument that the old Seanad was a reflection of the Dáil. Let us consider how the last Seanad was elected.  First of all, you had a number of people who were nominated. Then there was an attempt to have an election with the whole Saorstát voting as one unit, but one experience of that condemned it.  There was then a change made and we came to the time when this House elected members to fill casual vacancies and vacancies occuring on the retirement of members. How did that work out in practice? <Col N="1442" /> You got this situation: that the new Seanad was not elected with the same wave of popular feeling as this Seanad will be.  This new Seanad, I suggest, will be far more a reflection of this House than the old Seanad was.  The old Seanad was not elected <i>in toto</i> after a general election.  It might, by degrees, be changed until it had assumed the same complexion as this House but, if it did, it retained that complexion when this House had lost it.  There was that advantage about it. How is the new Seanad to be elected? An election will be held for the Dáil. There will be a wave of popular feeling on which a certain Party will be elected and that Party will appoint the Government.  The new head of the Government will then nominate 11 members and then, the people who have got so many first-preference votes, getting them on that same wave of popular feeling, are going to be the electorate for the remaining Senators apart from those who are to be elected to the University seats.  The elections for the University seats will, it may be assumed, be affected to some extent by the same wave of popular opinion. Is that Seanad going to be a better Seanad than the last, with these 11 people elected by the new head of the Government and the rest going to be elected by a group of people who have stood the test of whatever new wave of enthusiasm has thrown up this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is much more likelihood of the new Seanad being a complete reflection of the new Dáil than the old Seanad was of the Dáil in the past and that circumstance is the one thing that marks <Col N="1443" /> these new proposals.

If it was possible to elect men of that type to a body which was supposed to consist of men who had done honour to the nation, this thing can be worked in exactly the same way, and will be worked in the same way.  It seems to me that Deputy Donnelly, whose chief endeavours over a long period of years have been connected with political organisations, knows how easily that can be worked, and Deputy Donnelly will be at the back of the movement when that <Col N="1444" /> change is proposed unless he has lost much of his energy and enthusiasm in regard to political Parties.  He is a man who ought to know how easy it is to work this method of nomination to a panel in the interests of a political Party.  I can imagine all sorts of arguments to the effect that this Seanad will be a better Seanad than the old body, but none based on the point that the old Seanad was a reflection of the Dáil and that this will not be.

      <P>No more than amateur miners.  Deputy MacDermot thinks that there is a condemnation of the old Seanad from the people who brought in the proposals about the new Seanad.  He cavilled at their wisdom because the old Seanad had to be changed.  It had to be changed.  It was recognised always from the start that it had to be changed, and there is a great deal to be said for the forethought of the people who brought in the Seanad and made the conditions such that it was possible to have a method of trial and error.  The conditions were such that the whole Seanad could be abolished, but I do not think there was any way of stopping that. But remember what was proposed here. The old Constitution had in it that the Constitution could be altered by way of ordinary legislation, originally for four years.  That itself was capable of enlargement; it was enlarged to eight years before the Constitution left the Dáil as an Act, and it was eventually enlarged to 16 years.  Every clause, including the one with the time limit in it, was capable of enlargement. This Constitution is brought before us with a clause in it which states that the Constitution itself may be amended <Col N="1445" /> by way of ordinary legislation within three years, except the one clause with the time limit in it, so that you cannot have any enlargement of the period with regard to the amending of the Seanad unless we change it here when we come to consider it.  If it is passed as brought in, you tie up the Seanad in whatever form you leave it when passed here, and whatever President is elected can control any little amendment which can be done in it.  Even though an amendment of the Seanad may be passed by a unanimous House in the three year period by way of ordinary legislation, he can send that off to the people by way of referendum as being a matter vitally affecting their interests.  You have two barriers.  One is that the period of ordinary legislative change is tied to a period of three years, and inside that period any change to be made in it can, if the then elected President thinks fit, be sent off to the people by way of referendum. I suggest that the idea with regard to the old Seanad was far better.  I suggest even that its method of building up was far better.  I suggest that, whether it was or not, there was sufficient experience about those who brought it in to realise that it had to be left capable of being freely changed within a certain period.</P>

      <P>There is the situation. Can anybody say that the proposals which have been put forward here have been canvassed and thought of and that the people are satisfied with regard to them to the extent that we should write them as part of our organic law?  Naturally the best situation would be that in which the limited powers of the Seanad could be determined by law.  That is a much more reasonable proposition in the circumstances than the novel features of this, in view of the fact that this Constitution has not been considered and is not going to be considered prior to its passing.  It is not going to be considered.  Deputy MacDermot says that if we were to wait until there was agreement on the plan about the Seanad there would be confusion. Nobody wants that period of waiting. There was no such argument.  The suggestion has been made that it is wrong to write this in as part of the fundamental law when there is not agreement.  Let the matter be subject to easy process of change, and by degrees and after many changes we will get some approach to agreement. All the while there will be some Second Chamber being tested by experience, and people will be watching to see what it is doing.</P>

      <P>The House is being asked, in fact, to agree to certain general principles with regard to the Seanad.  The question is not whether it is absurd to pass this without agreeing to it.  The question is whether we shall agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great many of the arguments which Deputy McGilligan addressed to <Col N="1447" /> the House seemed to me to contradict each other.  He talks about the wisdom of allowing the possibility of change.  We are allowing the possibility of change.  The extremely important and difficult matter of the composition of the panels is left to be dealt with by ordinary law.  One moment we have the Opposition complaining that they are being asked to vote on something blindfolded because they are not being given all those details now, and the next moment they are insisting on the wisdom of allowing for experience and being able to make alterations on the basis of experience.  The truth of the matter is that if we are going to try this vocational method at all we can only try it in this sort of way.  This division of certain matters to be put into the Constitution and certain matters to be dealt with by ordinary law was foreseen by the people who made the reports of the Second Chamber Commission.  Deputy McGilligan says that there must be something wrong with the reports of the Second Chamber Commission because they aroused so little interest throughout the country.  I venture to say that any plan for a Second Chamber that might have been produced would have had the same fate. The average man is not in the habit of addressing his mind to complicated constitutional questions.  The Opposition are constantly saying at the present moment that this Draft Constitution is arousing no interest.  There is a lot in that.  I think that complicated constitutional measures always will bore the man in the street; that is inevitable.  But the members of this House whose duty it is to address their minds seriously to the subject have had ample opportunity of considering the reports of the Second Chamber Commission during the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I personally agree with Deputy McGilligan in his objections to the particular electorate which has been provided here for choosing from the panels, but it is possible to make further suggestions with regard to that electorate, and I have not seen any amendments put down by the Opposition for doing so.  They seem to limit themselves <Col N="1448" /> to being obstructive.  It is very easy to be obstructive in this particular matter, because there is not a single arrangement with regard to a Second Chamber that is not open to a thousand objections.  Deputy McGilligan says that the new Seanad will be a more Party affair than the old one. I am not denying that this new Seanad can be turned into a Party affair.  In fact, I will go so far as to say that any Seanad in the wide world can be turned into a Party affair.  All you can hope to do is to provide some alternative to Party allegiance; and that is what we are attempting to provide by these proposals.  We are attempting to provide some other motive that should replace the motive of Party.  It may turn out that political Parties will not play the game, that leaders of the Government will be unscrupulous, and set aside all the ideals behind these proposals, but I do not see why we should be so pessimistic as to take that view.  It is quite true that in the case of the old Seanad there were supposed to be certain factors with regard to services to the State.  After all these were extremely indefinite.  The proposals here, though necessarily not as definite as they might be, in view of the fact that we want to leave something open to experience, something open to change, nevertheless do provide something more to give a non-Party atmosphere than existed in the case of the old Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot.  If the Deputy will turn to the report of the Commission, and the basis on which these proposals are framed, he will see that these groups have not been just thrown down on paper without consideration as to how they are to be formed.  We were fully aware of the difficulty.  Let us take the group in industry and commerce. We suggested that some members should be chosen from the Federation of Saorstát Industries, some from the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association, some from the Chambers of Commerce, <Col N="1449" /> some from the Standing Committee of the Irish Banks, some from the civil engineers, some from the chartered accountants, some from the Royal Institute of Architects, and so-forth. One does not want to bring all these bodies into the Constitution.  They may not always exist or they may change.  We were not sure that these were the most perfect bodies that could be found in existence at present.  That is the sort of thing that is properly left to ordinary legislation. It would be a dereliction of our duty in this Constitution not to give some outline of the way the Seanad is to be formed.  If Deputy McGilligan will join with me in trying to get a better electorate I should be exceedingly grateful.  The question of the mode of choice from the panels might perhaps be left over for ordinary legislation to fix.  That is a matter of opinion.  But as for a general outline of the groups composing panels, that it should be put into the Constitution seems to me to be obvious.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 73 in my name deals with the electorate that chooses from the panel.  I am very glad to hear Deputy Alton's remark about the panels.  The principle of the amendment is this, that by definition everybody who is put on the panels is supposed to be a person fit and proper to be a member of the Second Chamber. If vocational organisations were sufficiently developed in this country there would be no need of panels at all.  The organisation could elect direct to the Seanad and we could get rid of rather cumbersome machinery.  Unfortunately, that is not the case, and for that reason the panels were put into the scheme.  By whatever method the panels are constituted the aim will be to get on only people who are fit and proper for the Seanad.  It was assumed in the Commission's report that the panels would be small.  The recommendation was that where there are ten Senators to be elected the panel from which they are to be elected would number only 20.  Consequently, if you select ten from a panel of 20 by lot, it seems to me you are not trusting any more to Providence than is reasonable. Leaving Providence out of the question, it seems to me that, on the mathematical law of chance, you have a larger probability of satisfactory results than you are likely to have if you choose from panels by means of an electorate of such a political character as either the Dáil or an electorate composed <Col N="1451" /> partly of members of the Dáil and partly of defeated candidates.  The great trouble will be if you have the Dáil or political candidate electorate to keep Party politics out.  Here is the thing we had in mind.  Even when we had racked our brains to think of all the institutions that could possibly be made use of for the purposes of getting representatives for the panel and, even after we had racked our brains, to the best of our ability, to get suitable organisations, we were still left in this position, that there had to be a certain number of nominations in every group, except the Labour group, and we could think of no other nominating party except the Minister and, out of the suggested total of 80 persons who were to be on the panels, there were no less than 19, according to our scheme, who were to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education. You have, therefore, these Ministerial nominations and you have, in addition, the 11 nominations of the President of the Executive Council.  In the case of all of these, obviously a certain danger of Party politics creeping in exists.  If the President and Ministers play the game, that danger can be enormously diminished; but it does exist and it makes it all the more desirable that the remainder, those on the panels who are sent there by organisations of one sort or another, should not have to look to members of this House, or to defeated candidates either, in order to get on to the Seanad.  It seems to me that the danger of canvassing is tremendous and it is very undesirable that that danger should exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question as to whether the Dáil itself, or the Dáil plus defeated candidates, would be the best electorate. They both seem to me extremely bad as electorates, but as between the two, I personally would prefer the Dáil itself.  There is what Deputy McGilligan called a fancy electorate which seems to me really a bit too fantastic&mdash;that elaborate system of people getting so many votes for the Seanad according to the number of votes they themselves got from the electors.  After all, what are the <Col N="1452" /> people down the country going to know about engineers, or doctors or architects? They will know nothing about them at all, except in so far as those people have received some form of publicity, and the easiest and the most normal sort of publicity, I suppose, is political publicity.  The average member of that electorate who is seeking to choose people from the panels will have no other resource, if he is asked to vote for a lot of names he has never heard of before, but to go to the Party leaders and say, &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; and then follow the instructions given by the Party leaders.  We had reached a pitch in the case of the last Seanad, when at each election a member of a Party was not only told for whom he was to vote, but was told in exactly what order he was to vote for each of the candidates.  The thing became just as machine-made as anything could be.  It would be deplorable if the same thing were to happen in connection with the new body we are trying to create.</P>

      <P>I think we can avoid that, and we would obviously avoid it if we adopted the suggestion in this amendment, that the selection from this very small limited body of competent persons should be by drawing lots.  The other people will get their turn in a few years.  It would really be little more probably than a rotational system.  There would be no absurdity about it, because all the people you would be choosing from would be, by definition, competent. You do not have to go so far back in antiquity as Deputy Alton went for examples of people being chosen by lot.  You had the pricking of sheriffs which was choosing people by lot from a limited class of suitable persons.  The jury system surely amounts to a system of lot for all practical purposes, the assumption being that any man in the street is a suitable person to be a juror, and so they must each take their turn in serving.  So I suggest that any of the people put upon the panels must be regarded as fit and proper people to be Senators, and they may quite reasonably be selected by lot, rather than introduce a system which allows <Col N="1453" /> the Party motive to come in so easily as the system of this particular electorate would do.</P>

      <P>I do not feel very strongly on the subject, and I am prepared to deal with the two amendments together.  I am no enthusiast for selection by the Council of State. I would prefer selection either by the <Col N="1454" /> Prime Minister or the head of the State actually, where there would be a sort of personal responsibility.  The Council of State is put in because I was afraid that the Government might be unreasonable enough to refuse my excellent suggestion of lot, and in the event of their doing so, I would personally prefer the Council of State to the Dáil electorate, or to an electorate of the Dáil plus defeated candidates. I would hope the Council of State would function in the same sort of spirit as the Appointments Commission. I wish, however, to make it clear that, of the two, the suggestion which does appeal to me is the suggestion of lot.  I may say, incidentally, that far from this being a recent development, so far as my opinions are concerned, I advocated the use of the lot in connection with the Seanad even when I was enjoying all the safety and glory and companionship of sitting on the Front Bench of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of lot, I think the Deputy thinks you can have a limited panel to start with.  I am afraid he cannot.  I would be much more anxious about having this in the Constitution if I thought that there was any possibility that you would definitely have to get a number like 20.  I think you will have to leave it pretty open&mdash;that the filling of the panels will have to be fairly open.  You have all sorts of organisations.  Consequently, I think that you must envisage something like 20 on each panel.  I do not like to speak of the chances of a particular individual when you leave it to lot to pick out.  You are certain to get one type&mdash;certainly they ought to be generally of the same type from a panel.  It is necessary to leave elasticity at either end to do the thing at all.  I think that the system of lot is ultimately a policy of absolute despair.  That is my view of it. I think that it would immediately set up a desperate prejudice against the whole institution.  But I am not going to attack it in that sense.  If you have a very limited number and it is a toss up as to which of them you would take &mdash;each one of them a good representative of a particular interest&mdash;I would <Col N="1455" /> say it would not be right to toss up in a case like that.  It would be more reasonable to look at the individuals, to size them up and take your choice.  I think this would create a prejudice against the whole institution which would be very damaging to it.  Consequently, you should not do it by lot. There is every reason why you will have to leave a certain amount of elasticity as to the number on the panel.  If you increase the number on the panel on which you are going to vote, that will be a help if you have an intelligent electorate going through the panel.  Let us suppose there are eight or ten to be selected from that panel.  A number of difficulties, raised here with regard to the method of selecting the Seanad, are difficulties in practice which largely led me to believe that we are trying to get something which it is not practicable to get. When I was talking in that strain Deputy Rowlette said: &ldquo;Very well, let us accept this, that even a bad Seanad is better than no Seanad.&rdquo;  The arguments put forward here about the Seanad are not new to me at all.  The difficulties which I experienced when I tried to get a Seanad which would be fairly satisfactory were these: First of all the Opposition got itself into a very safe position.  They got themselves into the position that they could criticise anything knowing that there is no proposition that one can put up that cannot be criticised.  The Opposition left themselves free to criticise any proposition, and they are availing of that freedom to the full. Their arguments are not very logical because they are arguing two ways at once.  They say: &ldquo;We ought not to stereotype this and put in the panels,&rdquo; and Deputy McGilligan says they can vote on any particular individual they want to put in in any of these panels. Yet, at the same time they tell us it is too narrow to be stereotyped.  Then they tell us about its not being representative. If you look at the classes you can analyse them and see that they are fairly representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to getting <Col N="1456" /> down to the narrow question of &ldquo;lot,&rdquo; that will come in immediately. On the point as to whether you can at this stage limit the number you have on the panel, I do not think that can be done.  If you cut it down you will see one big difficulty which you have to face at the start and that is how many should you give to a particular organisation.  Each group may say: &ldquo;Why should another group have three and we have only two?&rdquo;  If you do not limit the number which you give to two organisations, each could possibly claim a different number.  Then if you restrict it to two each the fact is that as long as you give them as large a number as they can possibly elect, they will have no grievance.  Consequently it is essential not to restrict the number to twice the number the Deputy had in mind.  I think on the ground of prejudice it would be definitely bad.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Council of State, that is only one step removed from nomination.  You would have a great difficulty if you had a Seanad nominated in that way.  It would be suggested that it did not represent public opinion in any way.  But you will have it representative of public opinion in this way: you will have separate interests selecting the panel; there will be a certain number of representatives of the activities of the nation, and then you will have over and above that the selection from this class made by this electorate here.  As to the suggestion that it is not much better than the Dáil, I am prepared to give assent to that.  But the members who have been in the Dáil will preponderate in this election, particularly if they get a voice in the proportion of the first votes.  The members actually elected will have a great preponderance in the voting strength.</P>

I have looked ahead to the extent of saying: &ldquo;Can you do this?&rdquo; and I say you can.  I do not say that the methods I would recommend here would be accepted by the House.  There would probably be a variety of proposals put up from the House to deal with the arrangements for the members from each panel, but when you come to the question of how the names that are to go on the panel are to be selected finally, you will find that these are the things that will have to be put into the law.  That will give the first implementation principle.  I think that that principle can be worked out.  I believe on the whole it will lead to a type of Seanad different from the Seanad where you have in a way had direct election by the Dáil without a panel.</P>

      <P>3º.  The number of members of Seanad Eireann to be elected from each of these panels shall be determined by law, so, however, that not less than five and not more than eleven members of Seanad Eireann shall be elected from any such panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy MacDermot anticipated, it is intended to try to secure that there shall be fair play as regards the numbers that can be elected from each of the panels.  I think it would be unwise to do as Deputy MacDermot has suggested, to mention a definite number from each panel.  We cannot anticipate what will be the views that will be expressed or what may be the exigencies when we are making a law to implement the Constitution and when we are trying to meet different points of view.  I think the provision that I have suggested here, namely, not less than five and not more than 11 will meet the case.  You have five fives&mdash;25 &mdash;and that would leave 18. You will have to put five in each to start with, and you have 18 left over.  If you insist on not having more than 11 in each, you will <Col N="1462" /> at least have to put those 18 amongst three panels.  You would have to divide your loading over three panels at any rate, so I think that is fairly reasonable. With regard to the panels, six members are being elected from the universities and I think they ought to be regarded largely as supplementing the first panel.  Consequently, you would have to take that into account when considering what number should be given to the first panel.  As to public administration, I do not think a case could be made for putting as many representatives on that panel, if we are going to follow largely the economic side, as there would be in respect of agriculture, for example. This amendment is intended to give a certain amount of elasticity and, at the same time, to prevent such a thing happening as giving such a number to one panel as would completely overshadow the others.  Deputy MacDermot has approached it from the point of view that there is not too much room to play with and, if he is satisfied with this, I think, from the point of view I have in the matter, it would satisfy us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to argue again in favour of the Dáil as an alternative to the electorate proposed in sub-section (3).  I think the Dáil is far from being an ideal electorate for this purpose, but I think it would be a better electorate than what is proposed.  In the first place, the members of the Dáil would be likely to know more about the people they had to choose from than a good many of the candidates down the country, who might scarcely have ever been near the centre of affairs and who might have a much smaller fund of general information about the life of the country than members of the Dáil would have.  In the second place, I think that members of the Dáil would probably have a greater sense of responsibility; and in the third place, if you put that responsibility <Col N="1463" /> fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Dáil, everybody knows who is to blame if the Second Chamber is in fact turned into the political Party Chamber that it ought not to be.</P>

      <P>We have argued this and I do not know that it is necessary to say anything further on it.  The point is: if they know them better, what is the question about the lot? I think the other electorate is, on the whole, more suitable.  It has been suggested that Deputy Donnelly might try his hand at organisation if this system were tried.  I do not know that it would be as easy for Deputy Donnelly, or anybody else to succeed in that with the electorate provided, as it would be with the Dáil.  The Dáil is a group which can meet for several hours to deal with this matter, but it would not be so easy to bring all the candidates in an election together and deal with them.  I think, on the whole, the electorate proposed is better than the Dáil.  It gives a possibility of representation to minority groups and it is for these two reasons, as I said already, that we selected it rather than the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The President suggests that my argument about the lot implies that no knowledge of the candidates is necessary or desirable. My answer to that is that I would be perfectly willing to have the men chosen blindly.  My fear is not that they would be chosen blindly, but that, because Nature abhors a vacuum, if every voter knows nothing about the personalities of the people on whom he is voting, he will seek for some other motive to direct his vote and that motive will, I fear, be the Party motive.  The greater his ignorance of personalities, the more he is thrown back on the Party motive.</P>

      <P>Surely it is not intended that a person who has failed to secure election to the Dáil should have a vote, and that a man who has, in fact, been elected should not have a vote.  We all know that a person who stands for the Dáil may receive the vast majority of the first preference votes.  Take the case of the President. In Clare he receives a large number of first preference votes.  As a result of his transfers his colleague is elected, though he may not have received 500 first preference votes.  He is not to have a vote, although elected, while a man who got 700 or 800 first preference votes, and no transfers, will have a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this provision would mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that that is what it would mean.  The question is: is there any justification for that in principle?  Why should that situation arise?  Surely a person ultimately elected to the Dáil should have a prior right to a vote for the Seanad as against the man who is not elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying this provision is that the people who get the first preference votes are a second degree removed from the people and that they vote for the people who gave them their first preference votes.  They are a sort of college, created indirectly, by the number of first preference votes they get. Take the case the Deputy has suggested of a person who got a very small number of first preference votes and who got elected on the surplus votes of some other candidate for the same constituency.  The idea would <Col N="1466" /> be that that candidate would be voting these first preference votes and that he would have a number of votes that would correspond with them. That is the principle on which the whole thing is based.  You may object to it but you will find that you cannot carry out the principle unless you proceed on these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a danger, by reason of this provision, that a political Party may so arrange their candidates at an election as to secure the number of votes for particular candidates which will secure a vast preponderance of votes in the Seanad election?  They could put up a large number of candidates who would have no chance of being elected and arrange that they get 500 votes.  Consequently, a political Party may be in a position to secure a majority in the Seanad by reason of the votes of persons not elected to the Dáil.  That is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. Suppose we were to work on the basis suggested by the commission; that would give a vote for every 1,000 first preference votes cast.  In general&mdash; there may &lsquo;be odd fractions&mdash;there would be a vote cast for every 1,000 first preference votes cast in the election. There would be as many votes as there are thousands of first preference votes passed.  If you went into the matter very finely, there would probably be a little room for manoeuvring, but not very much.  These first preference votes may be cast for A or B.  From the Party point of view, it does not matter.  Assuming that the Party were able to machine the matter properly, it would not matter whether A cast five votes and B none or whether A cast three votes and B cast two votes.  It is based on the principle that there will be a vote for every 1,000 first preference votes. The voting power will be exercised on behalf of the electorate, as a whole, and in accordance with the number of first preference votes the candidates got at the election.  There is nothing inconsistent in that unless you say that the person who is finally elected ought to have a vote.  The point is that these votes will be cast by somebody <Col N="1467" /> else but not by him.  If cast from a Party point of view, it would not matter.  From the point of view of representing the people, the candidate is supposed to represent them by virtue of the fact that he got a certain number of first preference votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the principle on which it is based but the manner in which the election will be carried out is not embodied in the Constitution.  It is not provided that there will be so many votes for so many first preference votes.  That may be determined by law.  It is, therefore, open to any subsequent Parliament to devise a system completely different from what the President has in mind.  You leave it open to a subsequent Parliament to do by law something entirely different from what the President says it is his intention to do.  Consequently, my objecttion stands.  You may have a position in which a person will get a large number of first preference votes and his surplus votes may be cast for a candidate who is not a Party man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking the first preference votes as indicating his choice by the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>They mean a preference for a particular candidate's popularity or personality.  The transfers may go to different Parties altogether.  The fact that a man gets 13,000 first preference votes is an indication that he is personally popular. His surplus may go to any Party, and frequently does.  There is a principle behind all this, irrespective of the method by which the election will ultimately be carried out in accordance with a law to be passed.  Any form of law may be passed.  That is permissible under the Constitution.  Some future Parliament may pass a law different from what the President intends to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is unsatisfactory to leave this matter to be dealt with by law.  I myself had arrived at that conclusion earlier.  I came to the conclusion that it would be better to go back and put the whole thing down, <Col N="1468" /> as it was in an earlier Draft.  This was taken out because a great many matters were being left to be dealt with by law and it seemed to be an unnecessary complication.  I had come independently to the conclusion that it would be wiser to put this into the Constitution, so that the principle behind it may be clear.  The principle behind the scheme did not originate with me.  It originated with the Commission and was adopted by me.  The principle, so far as I understand it, is that you create a body of electors who got more than a certain number of first preference votes.  You give to each one of these electors a vote proportionate to the number of first preference votes the individual got.  That is the principle. Each of the electors would cast a vote for each 1,000 first preference votes which he got in the election, with a provision to meet the case where a person got an incomplete number of thousands&mdash;say, 1,200.  The person who got 1,200 votes would have only one vote, whereas the person who got 1,700 or 1,800 votes would have two votes.  They would get votes to the nearest thousand.  That is the only part in which you could have manipulation by Party managers.  You might possibly arrange to get the number of first preference votes that would give the Party the highest possible number of votes for the Seanad.  It would not, however, be easy to do that.  If Deputies who have spoken would be better satisfied to have the whole thing dealt within the Constitution, I can arrange to have it brought up on Report Stage.  In fact, without any promptings from the other side I feel that it would be better to bring in on Report Stage a clause which would indicate that the number of votes that each elector will cast will be one for each 1,000 first preferences, with the appropriate fraction according as the number is over 500 or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that on the Report Stage the President will make the Dáil the electorate rather than this composite body.  It seems to me to introduce a complication that is unnecessary and of no value.  It is a less responsible electorate than the Dáil would be.  A thought that has <Col N="1469" /> just occurred to me is this: that a man who knew he was going to be on one of the panels might conceivably stand for election for a constituency for the Dáil as well, even though he did not expect to be elected or want to be elected.  He would do so for no other purpose than to poll 5,000 votes, thereby gaining five votes that he could use to vote for himself for the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is very unlikely.  With regard to this electorate, one of the reasons in favour of it seems to me to be this: that it can be less easily machined.  You could, I suppose, if you spent enough time and trouble on it, practically machine anything, but I think this would not be so easily machined as the Dáil. That is one reason.  Another reason is, and I think this is why it was put forward in the report, that minorities would get a better chance under this system than they would under the system of a vote by the Dáil.  I have no strong views on it at all, and I would be inclined to say, &ldquo;Very well, we can let the members of the House decide that matter if they wish.&rdquo;  The only thing is that, if I were left to myself, my own judgment would be to take the electorate that is here in preference to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>On the point of minorities, in my view the President does not give or may not give the support to minorities at all that Deputy Alton thinks.  Take the case of a man who is popular in his constituency and goes up for election.  He gets all the first preference votes.  There is an independent candidate also standing in that constituency, which is a three-member constituency.  The surplus votes of the popular man go to the independent candidate and put him in.  He has not got 500 first preference votes, and although he is in the Dáil, he has no vote for the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I hope the President will not give way on this point.  I think he is securing a much wider basis of representation.  Although the choice is made at second hand, the man who establishes the right to vote at the Seanad election is really expressing the opinions of the people who put him in a position to do that.  Apart from the political reasons referred to by the President, there is this point in favour of what is proposed.  At the Dáil <Col N="1471" /> election one man is elected and another is defeated, but the successful candidate may have received, say, only five, ten or 15 first preference votes over the defeated candidate.  Therefore, in the opinion of the people both are of almost equal importance, and why should the supporters of the defeated candidate be debarred from exercising their choice in the election of a member to the Second House?  I hope the President will stick to this point.</P>

Denis O'Hara Estate are still paying their full yearly rents; that they have not received the reduction of half their annuities as provided for by statute and if he will state why half the annuities are being withheld from those tenants.</P>

      <P>The payments which the tenants in question are making to the Land Commission are not annuities within the meaning of the Land Purchase Acts and consequently the revision sections of the Land Act, 1933, do not apply.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that John Duffy, Sharaheen, Aughagower, Westport, a tenant on the Logan Estate (County Mayo) (R.O. 16817), made several applications to the Irish Land Commission for a receivable order to enable him to pay his rent; that he received no reply; that the Irish Land Commission gave instructions to the sheriff to collect the rent; that the tenant has been put to considerable expense and if he will take steps to have the sheriff's costs refunded to the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no record in the Collection Branch of any application for a receivable order having been received from John Duffy.  A receivable order was issued for lodgment of the June, 1936, instalment and as the amount due had not come to credit in July last a six-day notice was issued without result.  In January last a second six-day notice was issued for lodgment of the June, 1936 and December, 1936, instalments, and as no payment was made, a warrant was issued to the Under-Sheriff for collection of these instalments.</P>
