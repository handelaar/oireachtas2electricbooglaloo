      <P>Attention was called early last year to the flooding of lands caused by the impounding of water in Tacumshane Lough, and after due consideration of the reports of engineers who visited the area, a grant was made available from the Relief Vote, the only source from which money could be made available, for the purpose of opening a channel from the lough to the sea.  A channel was cut which released the impounded waters, but owing to the occurrence of severe gales at a critical time the newly-made channel was closed again and the work rendered abortive.  The matter is being kept under review in relation to the unemployment position in the area.</P>

The survey reveals that there are many difficult problems in the way of an effective scheme, particularly in regard to the maintenance of the outfall works.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that in the case of the Akeragh drainage district, County Kerry, whilst the annual improvement of the lands was estimated at £332 5s. 4d. in the year 1935, the total for repayment of loan and maintenance charges was £510 19s. 6d., and in the year 1936, £418 6s. 8d.; and if he will consider the advisability of introducing proposals for legislation to enable the Government to deal with this and similar cases, <Col N="9" /> bearing in mind that these heavy charges have been incurred almost immediately on the handing over of the district to the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of the annual improvement in the lands comprised in the Akeragh Lough Drainage District is estimated at £332 5s. 4d.  The annual sum payable to the Commissioners of Public Works in repayment of advances made by them pursuant to Section 13 (c) of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1925, is £232 4s. 8d.  In addition to this sum the drainage rates assessed upon the occupiers would include provision for the maintenance of the district.  The striking of the maintenance rate is a matter for the county council, and I regret I have not the information which would enable me to say how the figures of £510 19s. 6d. and £418 6s. 8d. referred to by the Deputy are made up; this information could, no doubt, be obtained at the offices of the county council.  They may include some arrears, but we do not know.</P>
      <P>The cost of maintenance on a drainage district varies from year to year, dependent on weather and other conditions, and experience over a period of years would be necessary before the average annual figure for the purpose could be definitely known.</P>
      <P>It is intended to set up in the near future a commission to examine into the various aspects of the drainage problem throughout the country and the question of any desirable revision of the drainage code will be included in their terms of reference.  Pending consideration of their report, it is not proposed to introduce legislation to amend the Act of 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the slates purchased under the contract referred to on page 259 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, December, 1936, were produced in a Saorstát slate quarry, and, if so, what quarry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it not a matter for surprise that, while the ordinary citizen of this State cannot get a grant wherewith to build his house unless he gets slates out of an Irish slate quarry, the Minister for Defence of Saorstát Eireann when he wants slates goes and buys them abroad?  I should like to ask the Minister whether public money was spent on those slates and on the building in the completion of which those slates were used, and, if so, why is it that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, will not allow citizens of this State to do what he is at present doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Those buildings may be 100 or 150 years old.  There was a certain type of slate used, and we had to get repeat orders of those slates. We did our utmost to get them of Irish manufacture, but the firms who were asked to tender could not give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In similar circumstances, is the Minister prepared to <Col N="17" /> say that applicants for housing grants will be secured those housing grants by the Executive Council when they in their case find they are unable to get slates from Irish quarries?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Ex-Connaught Rangers' Pensions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction exists among the ex-Connaught Rangers, who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for their part in the mutiny in India, at the delay in deciding their claims to pensions; whether he is aware that some of the men are in very necessitous circumstances, and if he will state the cause of the delay in deciding the claims, and when decisions may be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort has been and is being made to expedite decisions <Col N="18" /> on the applications for awards under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, and where satisfactory evidence has been produced regarding military service and imprisonment, awards have already been made.</P>
      <P>The delay in deciding claims has been mainly due to the fact that claimants have not realised the necessity of producing satisfactory verification of their military service and imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how many awards have been made, and how many applications on hands have yet to be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many awards have been made, but a fair number have been dealt with departmentally. I do not know how many awards have gone out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware&mdash;certainly members of his Party are aware&mdash;of the fact that some of those ex-Connaught Rangers are in very necessitous circumstances at the present moment.  Could the Minister not do something to expedite decisions in the cases of those who are in specially needy circumstances?  Does the Minister appreciate that those persons were sentenced by courtmartial in India; that they were clapped into jail by the British military machine there; and that they were not allowed to get their forms and other evidence such as would be useful to them now? Bearing the circumstances of their imprisonment in mind, would the Minister arrange for some official of his Department to communicate with those applicants, particularly the needy applicants, and tell them precisely what information will satisfy the Pensions Board that they are genuine applicants for pensions?  I have here, Sir, if it would be of any assistance to the Minister, a list of the persons who were sentenced for their part in this mutiny, a list of the sentences they received, a list of their names and addresses, and a certificate that the British released them as mutineers. Surely that kind of evidence ought to satisfy a committee of this kind investigating those claims?</P>

    <Col N="19" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is charged by the Dáil to give pensions to Connaught Rangers, not on the basis of need but of service.  In order that public moneys may be safeguarded, and in order that the Comptroller and Auditor-General may be satisfied that the Department of Defence did so safeguard them, investigations have to be made and evidence has to be produced which will satisfy the committee that the applicants were in fact members of the Connaught Rangers, that they did mutiny and did suffer imprisonment. We are doing our utmost to speed the matter up.  We know the difficulty that claimants have in regard to papers, and we do not insist on those, but they have to produce evidence which will satisfy the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor-General that they did, in fact, serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is not unsympathetic in this matter, but might I point out to him that the continued delay in dealing with some of those claims is causing considerable hardship?  Will the Minister endeavour personally to expedite decisions in those needy cases where the applicants satisfy the requirements of the Statute passed by this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing our utmost in that way, and some of the claimants themselves are to blame for spending their time kicking up a row instead of co-operating with the committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state whether he is aware that under the procedure adopted for recruiting men from employment exchanges for employment on relief works it is impossible for a man who is an Army reservist to get employment, no matter how large his family is, and that there is a tendency among a number of them to seek discharge from the Army reserve in order that they may secure employment, and whether he will take immediate steps to secure that their grievances in this matter be redressed and the hardship under which a large number of them are labouring at present removed, and if he will receive a deputation representing Army reservists in the City of Dublin so that he may appreciate the urgency of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether, in view of the fact that Army reservists are suffering deductions from their unemployment <Col N="22" /> assistance allowances because they are receiving bounty for their Army services, he will introduce proposals for legislation to secure that this hardship on men who are prepared to serve their country will be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose replying to Deputy Briscoe's question along with that put down by An Teacta Ua Maolchatha as they both deal with the same subject.</P>
      <P>It is not impossible for an Army reservist who is in receipt of unemployment assistance to secure employment on relief works.  I am aware, however, that, in relation to this kind of employment, Army reservists are affected in the same way and to the same extent as other persons who have means by the operation of the rule under which preference in such employment is given to persons in receipt of higher rates of assistance over persons in receipt of lower rates.  The application of scheduled rates of assistance is affected by the means of applicants, amongst which the grants payable to Army reservists have heretofore been reckoned.  I am having the whole question of the relation of these grants to the receipt of unemployment assistance examined with a view to seeing whether relief can be afforded and in what form.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to receive a deputation of Army reservists, but I am willing at all times to give sympathetic consideration to any representations which may be put forward by an individual reservist regarding his conditions of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is impossible for an Army reservist in the City of Dublin and in many parts of the country to get employment on relief works, because no Army reservist can get more than 16/- a week unemployment assistance, and any man who is not getting more than that cannot get employment on relief works, as the regulations are at the moment, if there are people getting 17/-, 18/-, 19/- or £1 by way of unemployment assistance? Do I understand that the Minister is going to have the matter considered so that any Army reservist <Col N="23" /> will not be precluded from getting employment on relief works under that particular type of regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not impossible for an Army reservist to secure employment on relief works.  No doubt they are affected because of the preference given to persons drawing higher rates of assistance, and there is a difficulty arising from the fact that the Army reservist's bounty is taken into consideration and is calculated as means. In order to get over that difficulty which affects Army reservists, even if there are no relief schemes in operation in a district, I am having the whole matter examined.  Our object is to see if we can get over that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question in relation to the difficulty Army reservists experience in getting work.  I say it is not possible for an Army reservist in the City of Dublin to get work so long as there is a person registered in the Dublin Employment Exchange in receipt of 17/- a week unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>In connection with the last reply I made to Deputy Mulcahy, I was dealing with a point raised by Deputy Briscoe, which goes beyond the narrow question the Deputy asked.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the disability that Army reservists feel is not so much that there is deducted the 4/- a week in the unemployment assistance&mdash;although that in itself is a big disability&mdash;but because they cannot get work, and is he aware that the difficulty the Defence Forces labour under is that it would pay an Army reservist to leave the Army reserve to-morrow, because if he did so he could then get work and be in a position to give his wife and family the assistance of an income?  Again, it shows how completely misinformed the Minister is on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to embarrass the Minister, but if he consults his colleagues he will find that questions arising from the printed question on the Order Paper may be legitimately put to a Minister.  I asked the Minister whether customs duty was paid on linen thread and yarns, and I think a proper question arising from that is to ask him were the articles dutiable or was the relief from duty the result of the issue of a special licence.  However, if the Minister has not the information I can put down my supplementary question formally and perhaps the information will be available on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to carry out a recommendation that was made by the Joint Committee set up to consider the Courts of Justice Act, 1924. One of their recommendations was that Section 336 of the Bankruptcy Act should be applied to Circuit Court judgments.  Since then representations have been made by other interested bodies, including the Incorporated Law Society, to have such provisions passed into law.  The position at present is that under this section (336) of the Irish Bankrupts and Insolvents Act of 1857, if the holder of a judgment in the High Court does not register that judgment within 21 days after it is entered up and he <Col N="31" /> subsequently levies on the creditor, in the event of that creditor becoming a bankrupt, the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy can recover from the person who has collected under such execution.  The Official Assignee can recover from him and regard the judgment of the court as null and void.</P>
      <P>Under the old County Court system there was no necessity whatever for the creditor to register that judgment. He came in and could levy execution and that money was not recoverable from him by the Official Assignee if the creditor subsequently became a bankrupt.  In the limited jurisdiction of the old County Court that was not regarded as being much of a hardship. But under the extended jurisdiction of the Circuit Court&mdash; now extended to £300, and in some cases unlimited jurisdiction&mdash;it may result in much hardship.  It was represented by the business community and the legal body concerned as a matter that may result in much hardship. It was also represented that in the County Court you could not register a judgment unless it was £20 exclusive of costs.  It is very easy for members of the House to realise, particularly with the extended jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to which I have referred, that it might be a considerable hardship on a successful defendant where an unjustifiable action possibly was brought against him, that he could not register that judgment and secure his rights in the event of bankruptcy or otherwise. That is being remedied under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the two main purposes of the Bill.  The other portions of the Bill are really repealing very antiquated sections spread over various Acts, one going back 86 years and another going back 72 years.  It is more or less an attempt to codify the law dealing with these judgments and to have it in one Act.  This is a Bill that is asked for by the solicitors' profession&mdash;we have the recommendations of the Incorporated Law Society &mdash;and it was asked for, I understand, when there was a commission set up <Col N="32" /> to consider the Bankruptcy Act some years ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That commission reported in favour of this amendment of the law and, as I have already stated, it has been recommended by the body that was set up here to inquire into the working of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  In the original draft of the Courts of Justice Bill of 1936 it was intended to have such an amendment inserted, but on reconsideration it was not considered a suitable place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He can now levy for his costs.  The Minister brings this Bill forward because of strong recommendations from various interested bodies.  At first glance I see one difficulty about which I should like to hear a reassuring word.  This Bill proposes that where a very diligent creditor sues and then hands the decree to the sheriff, who levies on the debtor, that the debtor can presumably go bankrupt and that his estate can get back from the diligent creditor all that he succeeded in extracting by levying his decree; that money goes into the hands of the Official Assignee and is divided amongst the other creditors.  The difficulty I envisage is this: Supposing I want to recover on a decree against John Smith.  After getting the decree John Smith meets me outside the courthouse door and says: &ldquo;Now I warn you that if you hand that decree to the sheriff I will go bankrupt, whereupon you will have to refund the money to the Bankruptcy Court; you will have to pay the sheriff's costs for the execution of this decree and out of that you will only get a dividend from Bankruptcy Court.&rdquo;  Would John Smith be able to say: &ldquo;You will only get a dividend on the costs of this trial and the <Col N="33" /> sheriff's costs?&rdquo;  If John Smith, the successful defendant's creditor is in a position to say that, nobody can ever levy a decree again because the position then of the diligent creditor will be far worse than the position of the indolent creditor, the man who does not resort to the law at all, because the diligent creditor will not be able to recover his own costs at all from the Official Assignee while the indolent creditor has been saved these costs. The diligent creditor will suffer great loss if what the Minister has said is a true statement of the case.  I do not see how the Incorporated Law Society can believe that this provision will improve the Bill; nor can I see how any business man can think it will improve the Bill.  I have always understood that the whole maxim of the common law was that the courts were not inclined to relieve the litigant from the consequences of his own indolence &mdash;that you had to satisfy the court that you had been diligent in securing your own rights before the court would move.  This provision reverses by statute that principle.  I think that principle of common law a very, very sound one and I have yet to hear from the Minister a convincing reason why we should depart from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy is that if the creditor registers his judgment then the Official Assignee cannot recover.  I do not know that I am quite clear as to what the Deputy is at, but take the position in the Circuit Court.  There is a successful plaintiff.  He gets a decree, and, as the Deputy knows, he has various remedies.  He can levy execution, and subsequently get a judgment mortgage in the court of equity and proceed to sale.  A difficulty would arise where this party afterwards became a bankrupt.  Now, at present the position is, as I have tried to explain already that, in the High Court, for the purpose of getting in at all on a bankruptcy and to rank as a creditor, to rank in the sense as if he had levied execution, a creditor would have to register his judgment within 21 days, whereas in the Circuit Court he need not have done anything whatever about registering.  He <Col N="34" /> could simply come along when the Official Assignee was dealing with the matter and claim to rank as a creditor, simply by sitting on his decree and doing nothing about it.  The purpose of this Bill is to remove that anomaly, and to bring both the High Court and the Circuit Court procedure into line.</P>

      <P>No, I am not trying to do anything of the kind.  I am trying to put on creditors now the onus that they must register their judgments within 21 days, the same as they have to do at present in the High Court.

      <P>The Minister and all of us who have had experience in these matters know well what happens. It is this: that the moment a man gets a decree from a judge, he hands it to the sheriff to be executed.  We have all known of cases of that kind.  The man does not register it.  The difficulty that Deputy Dillon refers to arises then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is an emergency procedure by which a debtor claims the protection of the court.  The <Col N="35" /> sheriff can be received at the debtor's premises with a notice that the debtor is claiming the protection of the court. In that case the sheriff levies at his peril.  He does not levy.  He goes away and tells the creditor that he cannot be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes into court, and if he can levy there and then he is all right.  If, subsequently, this man takes the protection of the court, then if he does that, what I am trying to do under this Bill is to have a Circuit Court decree put in the same position as that of a High Court decree at present.  What is done, and what always has been done in the High Court, is that if they anticipate any difficulty about the other party becoming bankrupt, or of taking the protection of the court, they go and register their judgment, just the same as other documents are registered, with a view to protecting the creditors, so that everyone has notice of the debts that are due or outstanding.  But the complaint has been that a Circuit Court creditor could have a decree in his pocket while other creditors knew nothing about it.  The purpose of this Bill is to bring the position of creditors in the Circuit Court into line with that of creditors in the High Court.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy might reserve his witticisms for a few minutes until I tell him what it is all about.  The Bill is intended to fulfil two general purposes.  The first is to bring up to date the domestic legislation relating to whale fisheries which has not been dealt with since <Col N="36" /> 1908, and the second is to carry out the terms of an international conven tion signed at Geneva in 1931.  The Whale Fisheries (Ireland) Act was passed in 1908 when a whaling station was started in Inishkea off our west coast.  The second station was opened in Blacksod Bay in 1910.  These stations operated on part of the stock of Arctic whales which frequented the deep water between our north-west coast and Rockall, about 200 miles to the north-west.  These whale fisheries have not been worked for some time. The principal whale fisheries that are being worked at the present time are in the Antarctic.  The control of these deep sea whale fisheries can only be made effective by international conventions. In July, 1930, the first proposals for a convention were circulated by the League of Nations, drawn up by the Economic Committee of that body.  The convention was signed by the various nations on the 24th September, 1931.  This Bill is in part to ratify that convention, and in part, as I have already said, to bring the provisions already embodied in the 1908 Act again into operation and up to date.  At the present stage I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country the present Government has been responsible for three classes of calves.  We have the calves of the white elephants which have cost this community £2,000,000 a year, and the calves of the cattle whose destruction cost this country from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 a year.  Now we have the whale calves, and of these the Minister has very little to tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be idle for me, or I believe for any other member of the House, to pretend that we have any expert knowledge in regard to this matter of whale fisheries.  I understand from the Minister that the Bill is largely designed to implement an agreement arrived at at the League of Nations between interested parties.  The only general questions in which I am interested in an academic way are these: first, what is the exact origin of the expression a &ldquo;right whale,&rdquo; and secondly, what information is the Minister in a position to give us as to <Col N="37" /> the general prospects of the whale industry in the world?  We have seen in a variety of publications that in certain waters the extermination of the whale was imminent, and that very drastic measures were being taken to try and avert that catastrophe.  I believe myself that some agreements were entered into between the Norwegian and British Governments with a view to preventing the extermination of whales in the North Sea and that area.  I would be glad to know if the Minister can say if there is any prospect of the whale industry being developed on our shores; if so, whether it may be expected to have any substantial value; and, if it is, how it is intended to exploit that potential value, and, in the event of the Government sponsoring any scheme for the exploitation of whale fisheries in the neighbourhood of our territory, whether he can tell us what reactions on the whale industry of Saorstát Eireann the depredations in the North Sea, to which I have referred, are likely to have?  Whaling used to be an immensely valuable business before the development of the travelling factory in the form of these immense boats which can capture whales and reduce them to their constituent parts at sea.  Since then, I understand, the profits to be made by anybody, except those in the business in a very large way, are comparatively small, and I understand that that development destroyed whatever whaling industry was going on in this country.  I should like to know whether the Minister intends to enter into competition with that type of whaling, and, if so, will the Government have to intervene to assist the industry by way of guaranteed loans or some other form of preliminary encouragement, or if he thinks it worth while doing that at all?</P>
    <P>I think that the Second Reading of this Bill is an occasion on which the Minister might go a little further than merely saying that this is a Bill to implement the findings of the League of Nations.  I think that he might avail of this occasion to give us a brief review of the whaling industry with <Col N="38" /> reference to its Irish associations, and tell us what prospects he sees for Ireland before that industry in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is meant by such expressions, in the definition section of this Bill, as &ldquo;the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and &ldquo;sea fisheries protection officer.&rdquo;  There are parts of my constituency in which there is a continuous contest as to the ownership of fisheries.  These people have to get licences from the conservators, who are functioning under the Minister, and when they go out to fish, they are fired upon by officers of the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company. I take it that, in Lough Foyle, there would not be very much use in fishing there for whales, whether young or old.  I rather object to this Bill entirely.  Apparently, it is a Bill to implement an international convention, and I take it that the maritime powers who are parties to this convention do not adhere to the rights inherent in the citizens of this State by remaining outside the territorial waters of this State, and I should like to have a guarantee from these other States that they would enforce this thing with regard to their own nationals fishing off our coasts.  Why should we oblige them?  Why should it be lawful for us to do this or that, or that it should be unlawful for us to do this or that, when these other people can come and break all the laws of this State and infringe on the fundamental rights of the citizens of this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have this Bill, the object of which, apparently, is to bring us into harmony with other States.  What interest have we in whale fishing? What interest are we likely to have in it?  None whatever.  So far as I see, there is no country interested in whale fishing except countries with large <Col N="39" /> industrial populations where whale oil is used for the purpose of converting it into human food.  If we were to do that in this country, it would mean bringing the whale oil into competition with one of our basic products in this country, which is butter, and I do not see any hope of us in this country needing whale oil for that purpose. On the contrary, we have these other countries who want this whale oil and who want to protect it, and yet they will not recognise or honour the elementary rights of the citizens of this State, and the Government will not enforce the rights of the citizens of this State against these other people.</P>
    <P>I should much prefer that this House should take some formal action in this matter.  It should not be allowed by the House to drop and become obsolete, and some definite and formal action should be taken against these people in connection with the International Convention of which this is a counterpart.  I think the Minister must have very little to do in obliging these people, who are usurping the rights of the citizens of this State at every opportunity they can get.  Lobster fishing, herring fishing, salmon fishing &mdash;everything they can do to destroy the fishery of this country, they do, so far as the citizens of this State are concerned, because, in the main, our fishermen are equipped with small vessels that can only go a few miles from shore.  As a result, the livelihood of our fishermen is being destroyed by the citizens of the States that are the other parties to this convention.  This House is being asked to accommodate these people and to protect them and, at the same time, to penalise our own people by preventing them from any attempt to break the articles of this convention.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very useless performance. The fishermen down at Lough Foyle, who use fishing for their livelihood, have to get a licence from the conservators, who are functioning under the Minister, in order to fish, and they dare not go 20 yards from the shore or they are fired on by the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company, their boats destroyed or confiscated, and their nets taken, and the men <Col N="40" /> themselves physically assaulted.  Great Britain, Denmark and other countries are parties to this convention, but what respect have they for us?  Great Britain, apparently, so far as the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company are concerned, are condoning everything that is being done in Lough Foyle against the citizens of this State, but the Minister is so benevolent as to waste the money of this State in introducing this Bill and passing it into law, and then, when it is passed, apparently, a new Department will have to be set up, because licences have to be issued, and this, that and the other thing have to be done under this Bill in order to oblige these people who trample on our rights every day in the week whenever an opportunity presents itself.  We have the citizens of this State being battered and hammered down in Lough Foyle under the protection of England, who is a party to this convention, and we have the French trawlers and the fishermen of other countries coming to our shores and taking away the meagre livelihood possessed by our citizens.</P>
    <P>One almost feels inclined to sneer at the elaborate provisions of this Bill. In the definition section we have such expressions as &ldquo;shore factories,&rdquo;&ldquo;exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; and so on.  We are told that the &ldquo;expression &lsquo;the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann&rsquo; means that portion of the seas within which citizens of Saorstát Eireann have, by international law, the exclusive right of fishing and where such portion is defined by the terms of any convention, treaty or arrangement for the time being in force,&rdquo; and so on. What are the exclusive rights vested in the citizens of Saorstát Eireann?  I should like to hear from the Minister now definitely what these exclusive rights are.  Are there any exclusive rights vested in any citizens of Saorstát Eireann?  Is there any protected area in which I can say that I will go out and fish there and the citizens of no other country can go on that territory?  Is there such a place?  If there is, why does not the Minister enforce the law down in Lough Foyle?  Then we have a provision to the effect that&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" />&ldquo;where a whale which has been lawfully shot at and struck shall carry with it a fixed line into the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann, nothing in the section concerned shall make it unlawful to continue the pursuit of such whale and to kill it within the exclusive fishery limits of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very subtle sub-section.  It is like the defence that is put up by the poachers along our shores when they are fishing for lobsters and say that they were not within the three-mile limit.  Anybody can fish, apparently, for whales within the three-mile limit and he shall have a good defence under this sub-section if he is able to say: &ldquo;We struck this whale outside the three-mile limit and we went to catch it in somebody's back garden in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo; That apparently is not unlawful.</P>
    <P>I wonder who invented that section? What genius thought of that?  It shall be unlawful for any person to go on board a ship of Saorstát Eireann, a fishing ship, the Muirchu probably, and from there shoot a whale outside or inside the waters of Saorstát Eireann.  There is apparently plenty of water around Saorstát Eireann, but before this Bill is finished I should like to hear the amount owned by Saorstát Eireann defined.  This whole fishing business, as far as enforcing and administering the rights of this country are concerned, is a joke.  This measure, with its enormous machinery, not to frustrate foreign countries but to frustrate the citizens of our own country, is introduced to prevent our fishermen doing this, that and the other thing.  The fishermen in Innishowen are not to fish in the Foyle for salmon according to the Foyle and Bann people, and apparently they are not to fish for whales in it according to the instructions that the officers of the Department will get when this Bill becomes law.  This whole territory will become an entirely neutral zone.  Across the lough, at Magilligan Strand, there will be a possé of officers belonging to the Foyle and Bann people to see that our fishermen do not go out to fish for salmon.  On our own side, our own <Col N="42" /> officers will be there to see that the fishermen do not go out to fish for a calf whale.  What a sensation will pass over the district when they hear of the contents of this Bill!  I think we could get plenty to do that would be of benefit to the country instead of wasting the time of the House and the money of the taxpayers in introducing legislation of this kind.</P>

Perhaps I might also answer Deputy McMenamin's point in regard to that matter by saying that I do not look upon this Bill as of great importance and that it was only when what I might call the more urgent business had been disposed of that this Bill was taken on.

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy can make a very strong point about that.  However, it can be dealt with at another time.  I was asked by Deputy Dillon what &ldquo;right whale&rdquo; means.  I find it very difficult to define what &ldquo;right whale&rdquo; means because it is defined in a peculiar way in the various countries.  In America it includes a North Atlantic whale, a Pacific whale, and so on.  It looks therefore as if it is a seaman's term.  Every seaman will refer to the whale he has been accustomed to harpoon and capture as a &ldquo;right whale.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Deputy McMenamin speaks of pursuing a whale inside our fishing limits.  I do not know very much about whales. Although I do not know very much about whales, I read a book once about one famous whale called Moby Dick, and I know it is possible for a whale to travel quite a distance after being harpooned or shot.  A lot of them would travel from outside the exclusive fishery limits to within the limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall deal with that. It would be too much to expect that those in pursuit of a whale should take their bearings just outside the fishery limits and stop at that moment to see where the whale has gone.</P>

      <P>They would not have time.  If Deputy McMenamin were in pursuit of a whale, he would have other things to think of besides taking his bearings on the different coast lines.  I do not know how the Deputy can make an analogy with the case of the lobsters.  Surely they do not pursue lobsters inside the fishing limits?  The lobster does not travel as quickly as the whale.</P>

In shooting a bird the Deputy can stand and look where the bird falls and he can consider whether he should take a chance in breaking the law.  If, however, the Deputy had a harpoon attached to a whale, he would not have very much time to consider what was going to happen next, at least as far as I understand it.  It is a very dangerous business.</P>

      <P>There is no necessity whatever for that.  If we take any of the European Governments whose nationals are alleged to have done a certain amount of poaching here, without making any bargain, if we can find out definitely that any particular ship has poached and report that particular crew to the Government concerned, that Government will give them the necessary order not to do it again.  Deputy Dillon asked if there was any prospect of development. I do not think so under the new conditions.  As I said already, there were ships away back in 1908 to 1910 doing whaling along the West coast.  They did give some employment, but the present ships are merely registered here.  They have no Irish nationals on them.  They do their fishing in the Antarctic, and they spend their profits somewhere else. They are of no advantage to this country.  I do not know whether there is any possibility of developing an industry of that kind here again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not make that clear.  Observe what is <Col N="46" /> going to happen now.  We have no fishery control at the moment.  Great Britain has a big system for controlling whale fisheries.  So has Norway, and so have all the Baltic countries.  If any parties now want to engage in the industry by capturing the whale, extracting the oil and jettisoning the bulk of the whale carcase, they can come in and register their boats here.  They will then be subject to our Department of Fisheries.  British and Norwegian ships, if they want to escape the pains and penalties imposed by their Governments for improper fishing, can come in and register here.  We, having passed this resolution and undertaken to employ League of Nations methods of treatment for whales, may be faced with the obligation of setting up elaborate whale-fishing inspection arrangements in order to enforce the law in respect of whale fishing, which is not conducted in the immediate vicinity of our island, but in the Antarctic.  The supervision of whale fishing is a very expensive business. It means that you have to put an inspector on every whaler.  The day is gone when a fleet of small whaling vessels went out.  Nowadays the mother vessel goes out.  It is really a factory vessel and it is accompanied by a number of subsidiary boats, on each of which it will be necessary to have an inspector.</P>

      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable public assistance authorities to assist societies engaged in giving food and lodgings to poor persons.  This Bill follows upon an interesting experiment by the Dublin Poor Law authority, initiated in the year 1926 and continued since by the various boards responsible for the relief of the poor in the Dublin area.  Under this scheme, certain workhouse buildings were put in repair and made available for use by a society whose members engaged in philanthropic work of various kinds.  The society undertook to use the buildings for the reception and shelter of necessitous persons who might otherwise become inmates of the workhouse, to maintain the premises and to provide certain services and equipment.  In making this arrangement, the Dublin Poor Law authority felt that they would improve the lot of the destitute persons concerned by placing them in the care of a society whose members devote themselves to the welfare of the people entrusted to their charge.  In this matter, the expectations of the Dublin Poor Law authority were amply fulfilled.  The Dublin Board of Assistance are of opinion that, were it not for the charitable and unselfish labours of these voluntary workers, the majority of the male population of the institution would become inmates of the workhouse, where they could not possibly receive the attention and encouragement that is now <Col N="48" /> given them.  Apart from that aspect of the question, it appears that the scheme has resulted in a substantial saving in the rates in the Dublin area.  The extent of that saving will probably be realised by bearing in mind the fact that upwards of 500 people in one night are accommodated in this institution.  The Dublin Board have already expended a considerable sum&mdash;somewhere in the neighbourhood of £3,000&mdash;in making the building suitable and providing furniture and other requisites and they are so impressed with the success and the useful nature of the work done that they are prepared to incur further expenditure on improvements and extensions of buildings.</P>
      <P>The Bill under consideration proposes to give power to local authorities to provide for poor persons in the manner indicated.  It will be observed that the assistance is to be given to societies affording relief in the form of food and lodging&mdash;in other words, to societies providing homes or institutions in which poor persons can get food and shelter.  The assistance to be given is to be subject to such limitations as the Minister for Local Government may impose and, in that way, the Minister will be enabled to encourage the development of this form of assistance along lines considered desirable in the public interest.  It will be noticed that Section 3 of the Bill is to have retrospective effect.  These provisions are intended to remove doubts as to the legality of items of expenditure already incurred by Dublin Board of Assistance.  Legal opinion was forthcoming that there is some doubt as to the legality of some payments under this head since 1926.  I think the Bill is an important stage in the growth of schemes for the assistance of the poor, and I recommend it to the House for favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>It is gratifying to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the present poor law authorities in the city were so struck with the success of the venture he mentioned that they are going to get further <Col N="49" /> assistance.  It is gratifying, particularly, for the reason that the experiment has been a success, and being a success it means rather a lot more than, perhaps, would be inferred from the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion, as it has taken men and also women who would otherwise have been inmates of some of the public assistance institutions out of them, and has also saved the rates.  I think we should understand when faced with this measure, and the implications of it, that it has meant a lot more.  A very exceptional type of experiment has been carried out, and the carrying out of it has been one of the heroic things associated with social work in the City of Dublin during the last ten or twelve years.  It has been one of the instances of heroism that did not appear on the public platform, that did not declare itself with drums, with marching or with anything like that, but that saved a large number of men, and a large number of women from being, not only social wrecks and a danger to society, complete social and moral wrecks, but a source of contamination and of dismay to other people. The people who have been conducting this experiment were dealing with the outcasts of society, with people who from time to time are usually in the casual wards of the Dublin Union and in common lodging houses.  They are the class of people least welcome, because of their peculiar circumstances, their complete want of hope in life and the absence of any monetary resources.  In the first place they never clean themselves and in the next place they could never rise above a particular low state of squalor and misery.  Taking that class of person out of the casual ward and the common lodging house, was not only a great benefit to these places, but a benefit to the unfortunate people who were less &ldquo;down-and-out&rdquo; than they were, who use the casual ward and the common lodging house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experiment has taken that particular class of men and women in the city who were &ldquo;down-and-out&rdquo; and they are now self-respecting citizens, paying their way and earning their own living, simply because of the fact that they were taken up by institutions <Col N="50" /> set up by voluntary aid, housed in a house placed at their disposal by the then commissioners of the City of Dublin, and provided with a decent home, decent food and decent surroundings conducted by persons voluntarily engaged in charitable work. They have been able to work their way back as a result of that assistance, and of the hope engendered in them by changed surroundings, and by the work that has meant so much in the life of Dublin.  It is possible in the institutions implied in this Bill for men and women to live without any of the hard restrictions that necessarily surround people in places like workhouses or in the difficult circumstances that surround people in common lodging houses.  That class, as far as institution life is concerned, had to be dealt with by more rigorous regulations and perhaps with more severe supervision than any other class.  In the institutions they are now in they are relieved completely from that particular supervision and are assisted to get back into life.  There is no control of any kind over their private lives. The men may earn a livelihood at the cattle market or they may engage in any occupation they wish, while the women may be flower sellers or street vendors, and are not precluded from making appeals to the charitable amongst the citizens in any way that is proper and within the law.  This Bill marks an experiment that was carried out in the first place by charitable workers in the City of Dublin, which assisted people who could not have succeeded without what the Parliamentary Secretary calls the poor law authority.  At the time the poor law authorities in the city were the commissioners appointed by the then Minister for Local Government, and not only did the commissioners assist, but it is due to the officials of the Department of Local Government to say, that the experiment could not have been carried out without their devoted assistance, tact, diplomacy and courage.  Some of the senior officials of the Department of Local Government, under the authority of the Ministry at that time left no stone unturned, in that respect, and any help that could be given was given to <Col N="51" /> the charitable workers in the city to face what was a gigantic task.  The class catered for was a class that was never studied; it was a class, perhaps that could not have been studied in the past.</P>
    <P>Under the new circumstances it was possible for social workers in the city to study conditions in other countries, to see what had been done there, to exchange ideas amongst themselves and to see what ought to be done here. If the <i>Morning Star</i> was set up to work to save men from squalor and misery both spiritual and material, and if the <i>Regina Coeli</i> is working also, not only was assistance given generally by the Department of Local Government at different times to that group of workers and individuals, but the officials of the Department were enjoying, as it were, new knowledge in keeping these social workers to make plans for dealing with that type of person that is so necessary to get that delicate machinery going.  They were the people who held the oil-can to that machinery and I regard this Bill as a monument, not only to the social workers in the city but a monument to some of the higher officials of the Department of Local Government. It is gratifying to know that the public recognise that the body that now deals with public assistance in the city is able to look back over the work done since 1926 and on the very difficult experiment carried out over that length of time, and is able to pronounce it a huge success.  Ordinary people who find themselves, from time to time inside the walls of these institutions, will never know what magnificent work has been done, but it is gratifying to know that the elected representatives dealing with public assistance recognise the value of that work and are going to assist it.  We may all pray that the work it will do in the future, with whatever increased assistance may be given, will be even greater than the useful work that was done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Chairman of the Dublin Board of Assistance for many years, I can on behalf of that authority and myself welcome the <Col N="52" /> introduction of this measure, and congratulate the Minister on his recognition of the valuable social services given unobtrusively and ungrudgingly by many of our Dublin citizens.  We have in the past been greatly helped in the administration of the laws for the relief of the poor by this society of voluntary workers in our area, whose efforts we have supported in the past, and we appreciate this Bill because it enables us to give increased assistance in the future.  The Minister is probably aware of the organisation to which we are referring, and I am sure he understands, as we do, that the services of these workers, untrammelled by the regulations which beset the members of a body such as the board of assistance, are services beyond fact, because amongst other things these people are able to give that kindness and sympathy which it is not possible for officials who are interested in the extending of public charity to give.  The House will, of course, understand that the officers who administer public charities have many difficulties to contend with&mdash; difficulties unknown to voluntary workers&mdash;and but little time to give to the individual needs of those applying for or receiving assistance.  I do not want to be critical of the work of the officers who are concerned with public authorities, when I endeavour to compliment those who are giving their voluntary services to those of their fellow-citizens who have been unfortunate in their fight in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of assistance is fully convinced of the fact that the people who are attended to in this institution would be a burden on the rates if they were not housed as they are in this hostel, and, as their numbers are many hundreds, it is estimated that at least two a week of these people leave the hostel sufficiently strong in body and improved in health to take up work and to make a new start in life.  There are many remarkable instances of men in various occupations, professional and otherwise, who have been practically thrown on what may be termed the scrap heap and who, by reason of the attention they have got at the hands of these workers, have been given an <Col N="53" /> opportunity of making another start and climbing to success.  I know that anyone who has taken any interest in this class of work will find it very interesting to refer to the histories of many of these men and women who have come under the care of these voluntary societies, and it is interesting to know that many of them who otherwise would be hopeless have been enabled to make a new start and are now holding very responsible positions.</P>
    <P>As I have said, much support has already been given to this social enterprise, and I am glad that the Minister has, by the introduction of this Bill, clarified the position by indemnifying the local authority which has in the past given assistance in many ways.  It is gratifying to know that in the future they will be provided with the ways and means of giving further help without any fear of complications arising.  It is interesting to realise that the principle underlying the Bill was started many years ago.  Some people may have thought it should have been attended to sooner on the lines proposed by the Bill, but I feel confident in saying that while it was not done too soon, it was wise to have waited.  The fact that the Bill is before us to-day is very satisfactory, and I have great pleasure in supporting the Second Reading, and in congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on having introduced it.</P>

      <P>There is not much to say in conclusion so far as the reception which the Bill has got is concerned. The Deputies who have spoken have given it a very cordial reception.  I should perhaps say that, in my opinion, no tribute is too high to pay to the voluntary workers who have brought such charity and enthusiasm to bear on their labours.  Some 12 months ago or so, I visited the institutions covered in this Bill and I confess that I was very deeply impressed by the evidence of the magnificent work being done there. It is scarcely possible for anybody fully to conceive the nature of excellence of the work being done without <Col N="54" /> having seen such an institution in actual operation, and, as I say, no tribute is too high to pay to the voluntary workers who are giving such wonderful attention to this particular section of Dublin's poor.  There has been no criticism of the Bill and I am in the happy position of having no criticism to answer.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee consisting of eleven Deputies, to be appointed by the Committee of Selection and with power to send for persons, papers and documents, be set up, publicly to investigate and report to the Dáil on all the facts and circumstances connected with and surrounding the decision of the Executive Council that the retention of Mr. E.P. McCarron in his post of Secretary to the Department of Local Government and Public Health was no longer possible, and to make such recommendations to the Dáil as they consider necessary in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion, Sir, I am very deeply conscious of my responsibilities, and fully appreciative of the importance of the issues involved, not merely to Mr. McCarron personally, but also to the public service and the community as a whole.  If Deputies would consider this matter calmly and impartially and apart from political passion and bias, I think that this motion would be unanimously adopted by the House, because it concerns something which is necessary to the establishment of certain vital principles in the public life of this country.  It is necessary, not merely as a matter of ordinary elementary justice to Mr. McCarron, that he should be given some public platform or some public opportunity of vindicating his public character and his integrity and efficiency as a public servant, but it is necessary also in the public interest that public officials&mdash;both governmental <Col N="55" /> officials and officials of local authorities&mdash;should be assured of the security of their tenure, and that they should feel that in exercising their functions they are entitled to exercise them entirely irrespective of the political policy of the particular Government for the time being.  The public is entitled to expect that every Government, no matter from what Party a Government for the time being may be drawn, will get impartial advice from public officials, but that the public officials of this country will not be turned into a further wheel in the political machine of any political Party in this State.  Mr. McCarron occupied a very responsible position in the public life of this country and in the public service.  He was well known throughout the length and breadth of this country.  But if this case had reference to the humblest civil servant, to the meanest man occupying the most subordinate position in the public service of this State, the same principles would be involved and the same issues would have to be considered.</P>
    <P>It is over two months now since the public Press conveyed to a startled public the information that Mr. McCarron had been removed from the office which he had held so long and so honourably.  The position of a permanent head&mdash;we now have to put the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; into inverted commas&mdash;of the Department of State known as the Department of Local Government and Public Health, if not the most important position in the State, was certainly the second most important position in the Civil Service of this State.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health himself stressed the importance of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in the life of every individual in the State in the speech he made to the Cork Chamber of Commerce last month.  I am quoting from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 21st January of this year:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Continuing, he referred to the important part which the Department of Local Government played in the ordinary everyday life of the <Col N="56" /> country.  Everybody, no matter what part of the country he lived in, rural or urban area or city, was subject in some way to the operations of the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For nearly fifteen years Mr. McCarron directed successfully and honourably and to the satisfaction of all sections of the community the affairs of that great Department which so intimately impinges on the life of every citizen of this State.  He was in touch with public authorities throughout the country.  He was in intimate association with men of all Parties in this House, and of all sections of political thought in the country, and there has never been a breath of suspicion against him.  There has never been, throughout that lengthy period, a suggestion from anybody, even from the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition, that he was anything but a man of integrity and efficiency, and of the utmost probity and honour.  There has never been a suggestion that he had not carried out his duties to the satisfaction of everybody in this country. He was in intimate touch with the philanthropic associations throughout the country, to their great benefit. Never, as I say, was there the slightest suspicion during all that time that there was anything wrong.  During the five years in which the present Government have carried on the affairs of this country there was nothing to show that they had anything but the fullest confidence in Mr. McCarron's administration of that Department.  To impartial outsiders it seemed that his Minister went out of his way, in the speeches he made publicly and at private functions, to laud the work of Mr. McCarron in his Department.  The phrases he used, the laudations he poured upon Mr. McCarron, were something that I think no other public servant in this State has ever got from any other Minister.  Members of this House have listened to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health publicly and privately bearing testimony, as a responsible Minister of this State, to the efficiency and integrity and impartiality of Mr. McCarron.  Consequently, the citizens of this State were profoundly shocked <Col N="57" /> when the bald announcement appeared in the newspapers of 1st December of last year that Mr. McCarron had been summarily dismissed from that position which he apparently had held so honourably for so long.  Nobody was more surprised than Mr. McCarron.</P>
    <P>What was the method by which this announcement was made&mdash;this announcement which stirred the public conscience of this country more deeply than it has ever been stirred in the history of this State since it was established in 1922?  A bald announcement was made in the Press of 1st December of last year.  The first intimation that the people of this country got that anything was wrong came over the wireless on the night before.  The news that was sent throughout this country and to all other peoples who listened-in to our station on that night was couched in such language as to bear an innuendo very detrimental to the interests of this loyal, efficient and faithful servant of this State.  Care was not even taken that our public radio station should not be used in a manner that would give rise&mdash;as it has given rise&mdash;to slanderous rumours and lying statements being dissipated, and uneasiness felt by practically every section of the community.  Then the Press came along with their announcement. The official announcement was made in a letter to Mr. McCarron:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have to inform you that on the 28th instant the Executive Council removed you from the office of Secretary to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, with effect as from 1st December, 1936.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That in itself was a crime against the public, not to speak about Mr. McCarron.  The way that announcement was made and the tone of the communication and the language used would in themselves be sufficient to justify the establishment of a tribunal such as we ask for in this motion. Then the Press came along and, taking only a section of the headlines that appeared in the Press on that day and the following days, let us see the captions that the public of this country and neighbouring countries were treated to as a result of the manner in <Col N="58" /> which this action was taken by the Government and the form which the announcement of that action took. Here are some of the captions taken at random from some of the newspapers. The <i>Irish Press,</i> the Government's own organ, had the heading &ldquo;Civil Service Sensation&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;Government Bombshell&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;Dismissal Sensation&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;You're Fired&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;Official Sacked&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;Sacked Civil Service Chief&rdquo;; another paper, &ldquo;Short Shrift.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What were the public, ignorant of what had gone on behind the scenes, to infer from all this?  What was the meaning that was taken by all sections of the community?  What was the interpretation that was put upon things by the Government's action?  It was that there was something deeply wrong with the administration of the Department of Local Government and Public Health by its so-called permanent head.  No reason was given why this drastic action was taken without any notice to the public or even Mr. McCarron, as it subsequently appeared.  Rumours began to be spread and to become rife.  People asked themselves: &ldquo;What is at the back of it?&rdquo;  The Government must know these rumours have been going around for the last two months and no action has been taken to justify the probity and integrity and efficiency of this faithful servant of the State, who served all sections of the community here for 15 years and gave his loyal and unstinted service to the present Government for five years, and against whom no complaint was made by the present Government or by his Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary during that period of five years.</P>
    <P>No step has been taken or is indicated as being about to be taken to give that small measure of justice to Mr. McCarron.  We ask the people's representatives here in the people's Parliament to see that that measure of justice is given to Mr. McCarron, that he is given some opportunity of publicly vindicating his character, efficiency and integrity.  It was with no object of getting any political party <Col N="59" /> advantage that this motion was put forward in my name or was put forward by the Party to which I have the honour to belong.  What other inference could be drawn from all that I have adverted to except that there was some grave public delinquency behind all this and that the Government had thrown the cloak of silence over it in a spirit of charity towards Mr. McCarron?  As people are saying throughout the country and as they have been saying during the last few months, &ldquo;There is never smoke without fire and there is something wrong.&rdquo; The political hacks of the Fianna Fáil Party throughout the country have been spreading insidious rumours, foul slanders, against Mr. McCarron in an effort to bolster up the Government formed from their own political party.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for me to advert as briefly as I can to the circumstances leading to the removal of Mr. McCarron from his office.  Mr. McCarron has made certain of these facts known to the public through the Press and it is right that Deputies&mdash; if there are independent Deputies, and I am sure there are in this House to-day, who wish to bring an independent judgment to bear upon this question&mdash;should get a very short connected narrative of the events leading up to Mr. McCarron's removal from office.  It is a matter of common notoriety that so far as any intimation has been given by the Government of the reasons why they removed Mr. McCarron from office, that those reasons were in some way or another connected with an appointment which had been made in the Portrane asylum and had some connection with some events in connection with Ballinasloe asylum.</P>
    <P>It is a matter that everybody is aware of that a vacancy occurred in the position of resident medical superintendent of the Ballinasloe Mental Home some short time ago through the death of Dr. Mills, the then resident medical superintendent. In accordance with the settled practice of the Department of Local Government, that post fell to be filled through the machinery of the Local <Col N="60" /> Appointments Commissioners, and intimation was conveyed to the committee administering the affairs of the Ballinasloe Mental Home that the Minister could not accede to the request which had been put forward that a certain medical officer who then held a position in the mental home should be promoted to the position of resident medical superintendent.  It is well known that the greatest possible influence was brought to bear upon the Minister and the Government by the Party from which the Government is formed to secure the appointment of a particular individual to that post.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to advert any further to that matter.  I do not wish to mention individuals' names or go into the controversy at all, but it is necessary that I should advert to it very shortly.  It is merely for the purpose of showing that the Minister apparently experienced considerable political difficulty from his own political adherents in reference to the appointment of a resident medical superintendent at Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>The position of resident medical superintendent at Ballinasloe and in all the other mental homes throughout the country is radically different from the position which existed until recently in the Grangegorman mental home, or rather the Grangegorman and Portrane mental homes.  The Grangegorman and Portrane mental hospitals are, I understand, the fourth largest institutions of the kind in this State.  The position of chief resident medical superintendent was occupied for many years by Dr. Donnellan.  He occupied a position fundamentally different from that occupied by every other resident medical superintendent in every other mental home in this country.  There was in the case of Grangegorman and Portrane a chief resident medical superintendent and a deputy resident medical superintendent. The chief medical superintendent had his principal functions in connection with the Grangegorman mental hospital&mdash;the mental home generally.  The affairs of the Portrane mental home were administered by a <Col N="61" /> deputy resident medical superintendent.</P>
    <P>That position at Portrane was the only position of its type that existed in this country.  It was recognised by the statutory rules governing these matters, and the chief resident medical superintendent had merely super-advisory duties in connection with the Portrane Mental Home.  In the year 1925 the position of deputy medical superintendent in Portrane was recognised by the Department of Local Government as fundamentally different from the position of resident medical superintendent in the other homes throughout the country.  The Minister will find on his files, if he looks at them, an official intimation to the Grangegorman Joint Committee recognising the fundamental distinction and allowing the joint committee to act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Now, this is a matter of very considerable importance in considering the subsequent things which led to the removal of Mr. McCarron.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health some time last year intimated to the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Homes that it was desirable that the officials of the Grangegorman Mental Homes and mental homes generally throughout the country should be retired on reaching the age of 65 years.  To that proposal the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Homes intimated their adherence.  In accordance with that decision Dr. Donnellan fell due for retirement last year.  It was then the plan of the Grangegorman Joint Committee that they should erect a third mental home somewhere in their district, probably somewhere in the County Dublin.  They thought, there fore, that the opportunity was a good one to reorganise the medical staff of their institutions&mdash;existing and to come.  I must emphasise the fact that this third mental home which was then in contemplation by the Grangegorman Joint Committee would take a very considerable amount of time before it was erected and brought into effective operation.</P>
    <P>When the new mental home, the third mental home under the jurisdiction <Col N="62" /> of the Grangegorman Committee, would be erected it would be necessary to appoint a new man to fulfil the duties of medical superintendent there.  With the concurrence of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Homes decided to re-arrange their medical staff and, instead of having a medical superintendent with two deputy medical superintendents, one for Portrane and one for the new mental home, they decided that they would have a chief medical superintendent for Grangegorman and two resident medical superintendents: one for Portrane and one for the new mental home, and so do away with the position of deputy resident medical superintendent. That proposal was accepted by the Grangegorman Joint Committee and by the Department of Local Government and Public Health. The question then arose: what was to be done with the position that had to be filled on the retirement of Dr. Donnellan, and what was to be done with Dr. Blake, who was then occupying the position of deputy medical resident superintendent at Portrane? Deputies will forgive me for again emphasising the fact that the position filled by Dr. Blake was a position unknown in any hospital in the Free State&mdash;the position of deputy resident medical superintendent.  Dr. Blake had carried on his duties as deputy resident superintendent in Portrane for a period of over five years.  He had been in the service of the Joint Committee of Grangegorman Mental Homes for twelve and a-half years. There was no suggestion then, and there is not any suggestion now, that Dr. Blake did not carry out his duties efficiently and that he ought not to be left to carry out the duties he had hitherto carried out in the Portrane Mental Home.  The only change that was contemplated was a change in the nomenclature.  Dr. Blake, instead of being called deputy resident medical superintendent, was henceforth to be known as resident medical superintendent. There was no vacancy to be filled; there was no appointment to be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> Dr. Blake could not lawfully be removed from his position in Portrane. There was no appointment that could be lawfully sent to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In that state of affairs the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Homes requested that Dr. Blake should be confirmed in his new title of resident medical superintendent instead of his former title of deputy resident medical superintendent. The file had been for some time in one of the sections of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and Mr. McCarron was requested by the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Homes to have the matter expedited.  Mr. McCarron called for that file and saw how the matter stood.  Deputies will realise that the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and Public Health would have an infinite variety of duties to carry on from day to day.  Indeed it has been to me personally, as one who has seen this particular Department in operation for the last fifteen years, a miracle how Mr. McCarron carried on his multifarious duties with such tact, unobtrusiveness and lack of fuss.  He had those multifarious duties to fulfil, and in the course of a few days he reached the file in connection with Grangegorman.</P>
    <P>On that file was a letter ready for signature and ready to be sent out.  I have not a copy of that letter, but may I state generally this: that Mr. McCarron came to the conclusion that if that letter had gone out from the Department of Local Government and Public Health his Minister would be caused serious political embarrassment? Mr. McCarron changed the letter in a number of ways, very unimportant ways, as will be seen by Deputies if the Minister produces that letter.  He changed it in ways which were intended to ease the Minister's political past in reference to the Ballinasloe appointment.  Mr. McCarron took the precaution, as he would in any file of a similar character, to put there and then a note on the margin of the file as to the reasons why he changed this <Col N="64" /> letter.  That letter should exist in the Minister's file with Mr. McCarron's note on the margin, explaining that there was a differentiation between the appointment of Dr. Blake as resident medical superintendent and the Ballinasloe case.</P>
    <P>If that letter had gone out in the form in which it was couched originally, political embarrassment would have accrued to the Minister and nothing have been achieved except to cause unnecessary irritation to the members of the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Home. This letter, I understand, purported to approve of the appointment of Dr. Blake as resident medical superintendent, and used the phrase &ldquo;owing to peculiar circumstances&rdquo;.  But the Department must have known and Mr. McCarron knew that there were no &ldquo;peculiar circumstances&rdquo;.  That letter stated &ldquo;owing to peculiar circumstances&rdquo; they were prepared to approve of Dr. Blake's appointment as resident medical superintendent provided that the Joint Committee gave an undertaking that the new appointment that would be made years hence in connection with the new mental home would be sent to the Local Appointments Commissioners. Now, in the first place, that would, of necessity, without any undertaking, have to be sent to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In the second place, the appointment was not going to arise for years to come and in the third place the existing Joint Committee of Management of the Grangegorman Mental Homes had no authority to bind their successors. Accordingly, Mr. McCarron altered that.  He said that there is nothing here happening with regard to Dr. Blake as the Department had already agreed and approved of Dr. Blake as resident medical superintendent.  The whole thing occupied about ten minutes of Mr. McCarron's official time that day, and those ten minutes have caused him to lose his position as head of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  They have caused great public uneasiness throughout the length and breadth of the Irish Free State, and have <Col N="65" /> shocked the public conscience of every decent man and woman in this State.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarron regarded that as an ordinary incident in his day's work and forgot all about it.  The letter that was sent out reached, in due course, the Joint Committee, and the Joint Committee were pleased at Dr. Blake's appointment being put out of their way.  Their proceedings were reported in the Press.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health saw the proceedings of the Joint Committee reported in the Press on Friday the 20th November.  On Friday, the 20th November, he told Mr. McCarron that he had seen something in that day's papers concerning the reported proceedings of the Grangegorman Joint Committee on the previous day which was the cause of embarrassment to him, having regard to the political difficulties he had experienced over filling the vacancy in the post of resident medical superintendent at Ballinasloe Mental Hospital and the candidature there of a certain doctor.  Mr. McCarron there and then explained to him that there was no parity at all between the position in Ballinasloe and the position in reference to Dr. Blake and he wrote and left for the Minister a memo., which the Minister must have, explaining the difference. He demonstrated to him that, so far from causing the Minister any political embarrassment, if the letter which was originally going out had gone out, the political adherents of the Government Party in Ballinasloe would have said this: &ldquo;Yes, you are able to appoint Doctor Blake without sending him to the Local Appointments Commissioners because there were special circumstances there.  Why are not there special circumstances in connection with Ballinasloe?&rdquo; and the flood-gates of Fianna Fáil political intriguery would have been let loose on the Government and on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in particular.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarron saved his Minister from that.  He did his duty to his Minister, in full appreciation of his loyalty to his Minister as a public servant and in full appreciation of Government <Col N="66" /> policy.  I use that phrase because it occurs later on and because he was accused of a lack of appreciation of Government policy.  I shall have something to say about it later on.  Are we to take it that that is a lack of appreciation of Government policy in regard to jobs and jobbery and political intriguery?  No other meaning can be attached to it, or is attached to it by the public.  But if he is accused, as he has been accused, by the letters that came from the Government of a lack of appreciation of Government policy, let any fair-minded Deputy, or any decent person outside this House, take the trouble of considering the facts of this matter.  If he does he must inevitably come to the conclusion that Mr. McCarron, when he was acting in connection with the Portrane appointment, was acting not merely in the public interest, but was acting in the interests of his own Minister and his political difficulties, and acting as a loyal, efficient and dutiful servant of the State would have acted in his place and as he was entitled to act as the permanent head of a big State department.</P>
    <P>When the letter from the Department of Local Government and Public Health went out, Mr. McCarron thought no more about it.  He assumed, as anybody would have assumed, that the Minister would have read his memorandum and would have appreciated what he had done.  He assumed, as he was entitled to assume, but he wrongly assumed, that the Minister would have some spark of justice and decency in him, and that before he took any action against him he would have given him an opportunity of knowing what the charges were that were festering in his mind, in his politically corrupt mind arising out of these transactions.  I will show the House in a moment that he did not take the elementary trouble to ascertain, or read the fully ascertained facts in connection with the case, before he recommended the Executive Council to dismiss Mr. McCarron for what he had done in connection with Doctor Blake and the Portrane Mental Home.  Mr. McCarron heard no more about this <Col N="67" /> matter from his Minister.  He assumed that everything was all right.  He went on with his work and forgot all about it.  He had in his mind the things that his Minister had said during the last four or five years about him.  He still had in his recollection the fact that a few days previous to this he had received personal hospitality from his own Minister in the Dáil restaurant, that he was driven home in the company of the Minister after a debate in the House in a Government car, in the Minister's car, and left at his own door.  That happened a few days before the incident to which I have just referred occurred.  There was nothing to lead him to know or suspect that he had not the confidence of the Minister.  There is that fact for Deputies to realise that even then the Minister had nothing in his mind in reference to his lack of confidence in Mr. McCarron.</P>
    <P>The next thing he heard was on Tuesday afternoon.  His Minister called him in and told him that he had serious news for him.  This was on Tuesday the 24th of November when he told him that he had been that day dismissed from his position as permanent head of the Department by the unanimous decision of the Executive Council.  I ask Deputies to remember that fact which has not been contradicted. It has appeared in the public Press under Mr. McCarron's own name.  The Minister informed him on Tuesday that he had been dismissed that day by the unanimous vote of the Executive Council.  Mr. McCarron over his own name in the public Press took responsibility for that statement. I will read it from the <i>Irish Press</i> so that the Government cannot doubt its accuracy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister had not read the papers concerning Doctor Blake's position until after my dismissal at the Executive Council meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 1st December, 1936&mdash; that is over two months ago.  I repeat here now what has not been contradicted by the Minister, that he, without telling Mr. McCarron that he had any <Col N="68" /> fault to find with him, and without giving him any opportunity of making his defence or of knowing the charges against him, went in to a meeting of the Executive Council on Tuesday, 21st of last November, and secured from the Executive Council, by what means we cannot know or judge, a unanimous order dismissing Mr. McCarron from his post as permanent head of the Department without knowing the facts, without being in a position to tell the Executive Council the facts, without having the file with him, without having read the file.  Could any greater indictment be made against any man, or any public man, than the mere statement of the bald facts I have just made?  Can anybody conceive of a greater piece of injustice being perpetrated against any man than has been perpetrated by the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health with the full connivance of the President and his colleagues?</P>
    <P>What has the result been?  Mr. McCarron got his full pension.  I shall advert to that in a moment.  If there was anything wrong he should not have got a pension.  So sure as if the President and his colleagues had put their hands into the pockets of Mr. McCarron and his wife and young family and stolen therefrom £300 a year for the next 15 years, so sure have they been guilty of the sin of injustice and theft.  May I read, for the delectation of the President and his colleagues, an extract from the current issue of the <i>Irish Ecclesiastical Record?</i>  It is late for them, so far as Mr. McCarron is concerned, perhaps, to take this into their serious consideration, but at least, if this motion does not do anything more, it will expose the hypocrisy and the pompous humbug that surrounds the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with this transaction and in connection with his public utterances about it.  In the current issue of the <i>Irish Ecclesiastical Record</i> a reverend gentleman, writing in connection with constitution-making, says this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No matter how excellent our country's constitution may be, we should be ceaseless in our efforts <Col N="69" /> towards making those that man it a little less selfish, a little less uncharitable, a little less ready to forget that the Moral Law binds as surely and as scrupulously in public life as it does in private life.  When all is said and done, it is not by having a republic or a two-chamber legislature, or by any such institutional device, that we will be assured of having a good government. No; the best safeguard of the liberties of citizens and the best guarantee that citizens will be well governed lie elsewhere.  They lie in a conscience tender and well-informed in the Christian principles of justice and charity on the part of the government personnel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can any fair-minded man or woman in this country think that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or the President or any of his colleagues, who must share responsibility for this action in regard to Mr. McCarron&mdash;can any fair-minded person think that the Government personnel had a conscience tender and well-informed in the Christian principles of justice and charity when they dismissed Mr. McCarron without telling him what they had against him, what charge they were making against him, and without giving an opportunity of being heard in his own defence, and leaving slanders and libels being disseminated throughout the length and breadth of the country for the last two months without taking any steps to give the reason why this action was taken?  In mere justice to Mr. McCarron, should he not have been afforded an opportunity?</P>
    <P>Let me go back to a mere recital of the facts.  I told Deputies that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, without having given the slightest notice to Mr. McCarron that he intended to bring this matter before the Executive Council or that he had any grievance whatever against Mr. McCarron, informed him on Tuesday that he had been dismissed. Mr. McCarron asked why he had been dismissed and he replied that he had not given him his full confidence. More pompous humbug&mdash;he had not given him his full confidence!  He said <Col N="70" /> that he had not given him his full confidence. Why, then, did the Minister give him his hospitality in the precincts of this House only a few days before, and why did he extend to him the hospitality of his car to bring him here a few days before?  Why did he praise Mr. McCarron only a short time previously before the representatives of industry and business in this country if he had not his confidence?  Mr. McCarron asked him there and then: &ldquo;Why have I not got your confidence?&rdquo; and the Minister was not able to tell him, on Tuesday 20th, why he had not got it.  Having perpetrated this outrage, this gross injustice, this gross breach of the moral law, as I say, he was not able to tell him why he had done it.  He had not read the file and did not know anything about the facts. Then Mr. McCarron, on the following Thursday, wrote a letter to the Government, or to the President&mdash;I forget which&mdash;asking that he be informed of the reasons that moved the Government to take this action.  To that he got no reply and has never since got a reply.  The Government met on Friday the 28th and made another order &mdash;this time a formal order&mdash;dismissing Mr. McCarron, or, to adopt the phraseology then used, removing him from his office, and granting him the fullest pension they were able to give him under the existing superannuation code.  It would be interesting to go through the superannuation code in order to find out the power that illegally justified the Executive Council in doing that.  It would be found that they got that power, not because they had no confidence in Mr. McCarron, but because they had the fullest confidence in him; and, because their consciences were uneasy, they gave him this conscience money.  This pension is nothing else but conscience money. The money Mr. McCarron got from the Government is nothing but conscience money&mdash;inadequate conscience money, I admit, but still nothing more or less than conscience money, because the section under which they have power to give this pension is one that deals with the reorganisation of a Department for the purpose, if you please, of economy.  Economy, indeed!  Getting rid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>After so many years of constant and devoted service in the public service, and having far greater experience than any other official in this country has in connection with the affairs of this Department, they are saddling the taxpayers with that pension in order to bolster up the panic-stricken action of a member of the Government.  That is what they did. If they had no confidence in Mr. McCarron, their duty was clear.  If Mr. McCarron had done anything which merited dismissal, their duty was equally clear.  They should have dismissed him without a pension.  He had his rights.  He could go to the Civil Service Compensation Tribunal and claim his rights under Article 10 of the Treaty and have it assessed by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Minister would have been entitled to be there, and would have been entitled to tell that impartial tribunal: &ldquo;You ought not to give any compensation to Mr. McCarron because he has failed in his duty as a public servant, and we are entitled to dismiss him without compensation.&rdquo;  They did not even do that.  They did not even take the way of granting him his pension under the Civil Service Compensation Act of 1925 or of an order of the Civil Service Compensation Tribunal.  They gave him the conscience money in order to try to quell the storm of public disapproval that they knew their action was bound to give rise to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Ministers rang up Mr. McCarron before the second meeting on the Friday, asking him would he take another job.  He was offered a job as Supernumerary Commissioner of Public Works.  They had no confidence in him.  He could not give his confidence to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or to the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward; but he was good enough to give his confidence to, or to be cast upon, <Col N="72" /> the Minister for Finance or his Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Flinn, in the Board of Public Works.  The only reason that has been given or extracted from the Government since this affair has taken place is this rubbish about confidence given to the Minister.  The Government are confounded out of their own mouths by their own actions. If they had a lack of confidence in him as a public official, they had no right to offer him a new position or to foist him on another Department or to foist him as a pensioner on the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>He was removed on Friday, the 24th, by the second order or decision of the Executive Council.  We know nothing about the first order, but as indicating that that order was made, we have the uncontradicted statement of Mr. McCarron that the Minister told him on the Tuesday that he was dismissed by the Executive Council. He was again dismissed on the Friday and this time for the last time.</P>
    <P>Now, Mr. McCarron found himself not merely out of the position which he had honourably held for years but he found himself faced with a whispering campaign throughout the country by the Fianna Fáil Party, to try to bolster up this action of the Government. He found that even decent people were suspicious and were profoundly uneasy about the whole transaction.  It has come to our knowledge that many decent people in this State are worried about this transaction and feel that there must be something more behind it.  I ask Deputies, if they have any sense of justice or fair play, is Mr. McCarron not entitled to a tribunal where he might face an inquiry in the eyes of the public?  He cannot get any satisfaction from the Government.  He wrote later that letter in which he explained his position.  He asked the President to grant him an interview but he was not granted that interview.  He wrote a letter and the only thing he could extract from the Ministry, in reply to his request to tell him why it was that he was dismissed, to enable him to vindicate his honour, integrity and efficiency, was the letter which appeared in the Press last week.  It <Col N="73" /> was a letter dated the 24th December, 1936, from the Secretary of the Executive Council to Mr. McCarron in reply to his letter of 16th December&mdash;eight days afterwards.  It took them eight days to think how on earth they would phrase something that would appear to hold water in the eyes of the public and then they evolved this extraordinary and amazing missive:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the President to acknowledge receipt of your letter.  He desires me to say that it was with great regret that the Executive Council came to its recent decision in your regard.  As you realise, however, the relations between the Secretary of a Department and his Minister are of peculiar importance.  In the interests of efficient administration, it is necessary that the Minister, in addition to trusting in the Secretary's integrity and efficiency, should have complete confidence in his discretion and general appreciation of Government policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have that extraordinary phrase &ldquo;general appreciation of Government policy&rdquo;&mdash;Government policy in reference to jobs that are dictated to them by Fianna Fáil clubs throughout the country.  There is no other meaning in that phrase, when you think of jobbery like that attempted at Ballinasloe, where the whole pack were round Ministers for the last seven or eight months.  Appreciation of Government policy in connection with jobs and jobbery and political intrigue &mdash;that is what civil servants need to have in future.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain incidents, of which you are aware, culminating in your action in relation to the Portrane appointment, made the Minister for Local Government and Public Health feel that he could no longer have such confidence in you, and the Executive Council consequently decided that your retention in your post as Secretary would not be possible. The President directs me to add that the Council would have been glad to avail of your services in another position in the public <Col N="74" /> service, had you been willing to accept it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President would have been glad to avail of the services of this man who was not fit to be a public servant!  What sort of responsibility is that in any President of an Executive Council?  There is only one explanation of that, that the President was uneasy in his conscience and felt that even the inadequate conscience money he had given would not be sufficient to stifle the whisperings of his own conscience.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarron wrote a long letter repudiating the suggestions contained in that letter.  He denied that he was aware of certain incidents as stated in the letter of the Secretary to the President of the 24th December.  He asked to be told what these incidents were and he emphatically stated that there were no such incidents.  To that again he got no adequate reply.  He has got, in the last few days, a letter dated the 27th January in reply to his letter of the 5th January.  Twenty-two days this time they took to evolve this missive. This letter from the Secretary, dated 27th January, 1937, has not been published in the Press and that is why I read it.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the President to state that he has fully considered your letter of the 5th instant.  In reply I am to state that the decision of the Executive Council in your regard was arrived at after full and mature consideration.  You have already been informed of the reason for the decision, namely, that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health felt that he could no longer have that complete confidence in your discretion and general appreciation of Government policy&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>we have that marvellous phrase repeated again&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;which in the interests of efficient administration it is necessary for a Minister to have in the Secretary of his Department.  As there is nothing to add to the statement conveyed to you on the 24th December, the President feels that no purpose would be served by further correspondence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Then there is a close down.  The Minister, we are told, had no confidence in Mr. McCarron and the President so far agreed with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in his view that he had no confidence in Mr. McCarron, that he concurred in his removal and concurred in the offer of an appointment to this man who was not worthy to have the confidence of the Vice-President.  Apparently he is worthy to have the confidence of some other Minister but not of the Vice-President. The Vice-President is something apart from any other Minister in the Cabinet.  The Minister for Finance fades into insignificance compared with the Vice-President.  Another job is offered to him with another Minister. He is offered a responsible position, the man in whom neither the Executive Council nor the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was able to say they had any confidence. That is the way the matter stands now on the facts.  I put it to any fair-minded Deputy in this House is that not a complete justification for the demand we put forward here, that all these matters should be investigated by an impartial tribunal in the interests of Mr. McCarron?  Justice, decency and fair play require it.  The public interest also requires it.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised here up to the present Mr. McCarron's personality in connection with this matter.  Before I pass to make a few short observations on the way this matter impinges on this community as a whole, and on the interests of public officials, I want to make one further reference to Mr. McCarron.  I have adverted several times to the whispering campaign that has been set on foot by the followers of Fianna Fáil and to the uneasiness that is felt even by decent people in connection with this matter.  I want to know what is the reason at the back of all this.  There is, apparently, on Mr. McCarron's statement, and even on the President's letter, no reason to justify his dismissal.  People feel that there is something at the back of it all.  It is due to Mr. McCarron that that feeling should be dissipated.  The <Col N="76" /> best way to get it dissipated is to appoint some impartial tribunal to go into all the facts and to put all the papers before them.  It is due to Mr. McCarron and his young family, due to their prospects in life for the future. It is due to him on ordinary Catholic moral principles that some action should be taken by the Government to see that the stigma of the innuendoes and the slanders that are going round the country should not be allowed to remain either on Mr. McCarron, his wife or his children.</P>
    <P>I am going now to give immortality in the pages of the journal of this House to a gentleman of whom I never heard before, and of whom I do not want ever to hear again, a gentleman of the name of Tracey, whose name appears in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of January 21st, 1937, as attending a meeting which the Vice-President addressed and made the speech to which I have already adverted.  Mr. Horgan, of the Chamber of Commerce, had asked the Minister in justice to Mr. McCarron to make some statement in reference to Mr. McCarron and the Minister had got out of the difficulty by resorting to what I have described in the course of my remarks as the pompous humbug of which he is such a past master.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not going to answer any questions regarding him.  What I have said about the Government acting with a full sense of its responsibility bears upon that action as well as upon every other action the Government has taken as a Government since it came into office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the flapdoodle and humbug the Minister is trying to get away with in connection with this transaction. Up gets Mr. Tracey, and he is reported as saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am speaking on the necessity for the appointment of a special tribunal because of the innuendoes that are going around.  I am referring to a statement made by a <Col N="77" /> member of the Cork Chamber of Commerce. While the Minister was saying this, Mr. R. Tracey, H.C., called out: &ldquo;We are not going to be bossed by any Castle clique.  Sack the whole damn lot of them and it would be a better job.&rdquo;  That is the sort of thing the members of the Fianna Fáil Party may hesitate to say, because of the law of slander, because juries, irrespective of political affiliations, will not stand over these gross slanders of public men.  They will hesitate to say that Mr. McCarron was guilty of selling public property, of doing something which involved moral guilt, but they will spread that sort of thing which to the ordinary, unthinking mind, bears a horrible innuendo.  Mr. McCarron is one of the &ldquo;Castle clique.&rdquo;  He was educated at the same school at which I had the honour to be educated&mdash;the Christian Brothers' school at North Richmond Street.  He was a member of the Gaelic League for many years, subscribed to it, and was a member of the sub-committee.  He forced his way upwards in the ranks of the British Civil Service here at a time when that was practically an impossible job.  It was certainly a Herculean job under the Local Government Board, as it existed prior to the change of Government.  He did that by merit and nothing else and all the time he remained a Catholic and an Irishman.  When it is said that he is a member of &ldquo;the old Castle clique,&rdquo; I hope the Minister for Local Government will now, even belatedly, have the decency to repudiate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have occupied the attention of the House too long, but I must refer to the incidence of this matter on public officials and on the public service generally.  This is a matter of supreme importance to Mr. McCarron.  He must be vindicated in some way.  I hope I have done my part in his public vindication in the country.  Time does not permit me to say all I should like to say in this connection.  We gather from a report in the Press that the Government have brought up their supporters by means of a special Whip to outvote this motion and defeat it. We have heard a number of killing slanders put around by members of the <Col N="78" /> Fianna Fáil Party in connection with Mr. McCarron.  The issue is important to him, but it is also important to the community.  In the first speech I made in this Assembly, I dealt with the dismissal of another public official, and I said at that time that it appeared to me that the Government wished to have about them in the key positions of the public service only what the Americans call &ldquo;nodders&rdquo; and &ldquo;yes men.&rdquo;  I was right then, and the action in this case emphasises that. Every civil servant, from the most junior to the most senior official, knows that his position depends upon&mdash;to use the phrase in the Secretary's letter&mdash;&ldquo;appreciation of Government policy.&rdquo; He is not to give an independent and impartial view on the problems that fall to be dealt with by him from day to day.  Whether he is a senior or a junior clerk or a so-called permanent head of a Department, he is to act in the interests of the Government's political policy, in the interest of their jobbery, intrigue and corruption.  Civil servants have no longer any sense of security of tenure.  Their jobs now depend upon their being adherents of whatever political Party happens to be in power for the time being.  If they do anything contrary to the political views of that Party, out they go.  That does not conduce to efficiency in the Civil Service and does not make for a loyal or dependable Civil Service.  The community, as a whole, are entitled to be assured that the civil servant will advise whatever Minister is in power for the time being to the best of his ability on the problems that fall to him to advise upon from day to day. They are entitled to be assured that, honestly and to the best of his skill and ability, the civil servant will give an opinion absolutely independent of political Party motives.  Otherwise the Civil Service is nothing but a corrupt political machine and the sooner it is got rid of the better.</P>
    <P>While this motion involves the interests of Mr. McCarron, it also involves the security and integrity of the Civil Service.  It involves the interest of the community, as a whole, in having an efficient, impartial and independent Civil Service to advise political Ministers, who come and go. <Col N="79" /> That being so, the case is complete for appointment of this tribunal.  If the Government refuse, only one interpretation can be placed upon their action. They have acted unjustly, harshly and without justification towards Mr. McCarron.  They have refused to give him any explanation of the reasons why he was dismissed.  They have not allowed him any opportunity to answer the charges or alleged charges&mdash; because no charges really exist&mdash; against him.  He demands a public inquiry, whatever its nature may be&mdash; I am not interested in its form; whether it be a judicial committee or a committee of the Dáil&mdash;for his vindication. In addition, the interest of public officials, both in the Civil Service and in local affairs, requires that that be done.  If the Government refuse to comply with this motion, judgment will go against them by default.  We, who support this motion and speak to it, are addressing the members in the House, but we are also addressing a wider jury outside this House.  We have stood as a Party and have made very great sacrifices as a political Party&mdash;the individuals who are leaders of this Party have made very great personal sacrifices&mdash;in the interest of justice, truth and honour.</P>
    <P>We stand for justice here.  The Minister for Local Government, who has been guilty of a gross breach of the moral law, smiled here to-day publicly at a reference by me to justice.  We demand justice, if not from this Government from the jury outside. The judgment of every decent-minded person in the community will go against the Government and in particular against the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>Do you?  It is quite characteristic, the usual dodge so that you cannot be answered.  I am not surprised.  I watched the President and the Vice-President while <Col N="80" /> listening to one of the most eloquent speeches I have ever listened to in this House, and I am not surprised that neither of them is anxious to answer that speech.  They are adopting the usual practice.  The President is now handing it down to the other members of his Government that they dare not put up anything and leave sufficient time to answer.  Again and again he has tried that particular practice here. He is pursuing now.  Does the President or the Vice-President hold that there is no case to answer, that they have not heard enough, that an indictment such as the terrible one to which we have listened is one that can be lightly thrown aside by the usual practice of the President to run away from the issue and to speak so late that there would be no opportunity of answering the misstatements and the misleading arguments of the Government? Here is a case in which elementary justice is in question and that practice is to be followed to prevent the Dáil and to prevent the country being provided with adequate time to hear an answer to any case made by the President or the Vice-President. We all admit that nobody wishes to discuss these personal things in this House if it could possibly be avoided.  There is always an element of embarrassment where they are concerned, and it is only a sense of duty that compels people in the position of those on the front Opposition Bench to put down a motion of this kind, a sense of duty to the country, a sense of duty to the Civil Service and a sense of duty demanding that a wrong that has been done should be righted, at least so far as it is now possible to right it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Costello overstated the case when he spoke of the shock with which the country and the Civil Service received the news of the dismissal of Mr. McCarron.  I ask members of the Executive Council to remember this: that we are all, I presume, destined to finish our lives in this country.  That being so, it is of vital interest to us to see that the Government of this country is clean; to see that one of the principal props on which the State rests is above <Col N="81" /> suspicion.  Does anybody pretend that the action of the Government in this matter within the last two months is such as to ensure that feeling of confidence on the part of the public and on the part of the Civil Service?  If they had made up their minds to undermine the confidence and to shake the morale of the Civil Service could they have gone a better way about it than the way they proceeded in this particular case?  We should not tolerate in the case of the Government dealing with civil servants what would not be tolerated for a moment in the case of a private individual dealing with his employees. Imagine such a thing taking place in any big business or in any big undertaking in this State at the present time &mdash;a man dismissed on the mere whim&mdash; because that is practically what it comes to&mdash;of a Minister of the Executive without reasons given, or reasons asked for; without any inquiry, with absolute refusal to go beyond the statement that he was dismissed&mdash;for that is practically what the President's letter comes to.</P>
    <P>That is not an example of just dealing that the Government should show the country.  The Government, and no one more than the President and the Vice-President, make great play with Christian principles.  Is this an example of the application of even the most fundamental Christian principles? Christian principles are well to talk of when they cost nothing, but whenever there is an opportunity the Government violates them with little or no provocation.  &ldquo;They have the power and they will exercise it!&rdquo; What is that but the very denial of such principles in the public and moral spheres?  I am well aware of it and the &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; that I heard from the benches opposite&mdash;even rather shame-faced&mdash;that reached this side when we had a quotation from Mr. Tracey of Cork.  It did not require the &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; given to that particular statement from the opposite benches to convince us that some, at least, of the followers of the Fianna Fáil Party will be delighted at the action taken by the Government.  I know perfectly well that there are a number of people whose views are <Col N="82" /> represented by that &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; but there are very many more decent men in Fianna Fáil whose minds are extremely uneasy and whose consciences are uneasy about this whole business.  Remember, we are all responsible, as this House elected the Government and stands by the Government in its majority, and the Government is responsible for this particular action.  Anyone who has the future welfare and the present reputation of this country at heart cannot but look with dislike and dismay at the action and conduct of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>I confess it is extremely difficult to estimate the damage that has already been done by the action taken by the Government at the latter end of last year.  Damage has been done, and it will be extremely difficult to remedy that damage now by any action that this House may take.  But, at least, it can do something, it can go some distance to minimise that damage; it can go some distance to convince the public that men who perform their duty are not there to be dismissed; it can go some distance to allay the fears of the Civil Service that because they follow their conscience and give sound advice to a Minister they will be dismissed.  If an inquiry of the kind we ask for is set up, something might be done, not merely to right the wrong, but something might also be done to restore some of the lost confidence before irreparable damage has been done to the public service and to the country.  I am rather surprised that the Minister is not aware of the fact that confidence has been shaken. It may be that that lack of confidence &mdash;I cannot describe it as anything else except real fear&mdash;that prevails at present in the higher ranks of the Civil Service may have not as yet gone downwards from the higher ranks. But you know perfectly well that it will go down, and go through all the ranks; that there is no reason why you should stop at the higher civil servants&mdash;at secretaries of Departments. If this kind of injustice is to be meted out to men who do their duty, there is no reason why the Vice-President of the Executive Council&mdash; who apparently stood silent when Mr. <Col N="83" /> Tracey was interrupting him in Cork &mdash;should not bring it down to the ordinary members of the Civil Service. Is there any reason why they should get better shrift than Mr. McCarron? It is not merely the confidence of the higher branches of the Civil Service that has been shaken.  It is not merely there that fear is to be felt; it will inevitably be felt right through.  It is to the interests of every one of those servants who served this Government&mdash;as they served the last Government&mdash;faithfully, that this case should be probed to the bottom, and that we should have some reason given for the extraordinary action of the President and the Vice-President in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>What is the feeling now?  Is the President unaware of it?  Is the Vice-President unaware of the fear that exists in the ranks of the civil servants? Is he unaware that now the watchword is &ldquo;Tread warily.  Be careful what advice you give the Minister.  Take account of his political susceptibilities. If you do not, in the language of some years ago, &lsquo;you are for it&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Is the Minister aware or is he unaware that that is the feeling widespread amongst certain ranks of the Civil Service at the present moment?  Can he understand how it could be otherwise?  Can he understand how his conduct is not bound inevitably to have that result? How can it fail to have it?  Take the case of a civil servant occupying the position that Mr. McCarron held&mdash;a civil servant who had bouquets continually thrown at him in public by the Minister.  I mention a few of the places in which it was done publicly, to show you what the alleged lack of appreciation of Government policy means.  Publicly the Minister&mdash;some-times there were Deputies present&mdash; again and again spoke in appreciation of Mr. McCarron's great work in the Department.  I presume that is the policy of the Department; I will come to the question in a moment whether it can be anything else.  In Arklow, Athy, Ballinasloe, Ballyshannon, Carlow, Dundalk, Cork, Dungarvan, Dun Laoghaire, Ennis, Limerick, Nenagh, Tullow and Waterford the Minister took the unusual step of going out of <Col N="84" /> his way to throw bouquets at the man who he now says has not his confidence, and has not the necessary appreciation of the general lines of Government policy!  After all those&mdash; I do not say fulsome; they were deserved&mdash;open tributes to the work of Mr. McCarron, to the integrity and value of Mr. McCarron to the Department, is the Minister now asking the House and the country to believe that this man did not understand what the general lines of Government policy were?  On the face of it the thing is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the interests of efficient administration, it is necessary that the Minister, in addition to trusting the secretary's integrity and efficiency, should have complete confidence in his discretion and general appreciation of Government policy.&rdquo;  At a dinner given by the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce the Minister said he was glad Mr. McCarron was there on that particular occasion so that he could pay tribute to the excellent work he had done for the Department. What, then, does the Minister require? As head of a Department, where was there lack of appreciation of the policy of the Minister?  If so, in what? There was one thing, and one thing only.  The whole context points to one thing only&mdash;appointments, jobs.  That is the one thing for which Mr. McCarron has never stood&mdash;anything in the nature of political pressure in regard to appointments.  For ten years he did not stand for any pressure brought by Deputies or anybody else. He did not stand for it, I have no doubt, in the case of the present Government either.  He gave his sound, honest advice.  Is it for that he was sacrificed?  Has the Minister indicated, since he took this extraordinary action, what other course could have been pursued or should have been pursued either in the Ballinasloe case or in the Portrane case?  Has he indicated that in public?  Does he think the public has no right to know those things?  Does he think they should wait until it is dragged out of him here&mdash;if it is dragged out here in the Dail&mdash;some attempt to make an answer to those questions?  Does he suggest <Col N="85" /> that Dr. Blake should have been dismissed when there was a rearrangement of positions there in connection with the Grangegorman and Portrane Asylums?  Does he suggest that he should have been dismissed?  I am waiting to hear the Minister say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  If not, what other line was there to pursue except his nominal promotion in the way in which he was nominally promoted?</P>
    <P>In the Ballinasloe case&mdash;I do not think Mr. McCarron had anything to do with it&mdash;was not the ordinary precedent followed?  What happened then?  The Minister himself told Mr. McCarron, at that famous interview, that he had got into hot water as a result of what was done in Portrane having in view what was done in Ballinasloe.  That is the whole offence. Because the only procedure and the proper procedure was followed; because the Minister got into panic, into hysteria, so far as his own followers in a certain portion of Ireland were concerned, the secretary of the Department has to go.  The Minister is in trouble with his political followers because he administered&mdash;as he is bound to administer&mdash;according to the precedent in connection with those appointments, and the secretary has to go!  That is a nice sense of responsibility on the part of the Minister. Every Government has to meet attacks of this kind in connection with those appointments, but this is the first time that I have seen the secretary of a Department dismissed because the Minister followed the ordinary precedent in regard to those appointments, and followed the only course that was open to him.  There may be people who are degraded enough to be placated by the action now taken by the Minister.  If that is so, I am sorry even for the lowest ranks&mdash;I am speaking morally&mdash;of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Minister thinks he has covered his dispute with his followers in Ballinasloe by dismissing the secretary of his Department, whom, time and again, he went out of his way to compliment on the excellent work that he has done for the Department, he has undoubtedly a low conception of some of his supporters.  Possibly he <Col N="86" /> is right; he may be speaking from experience.</P>
    <P>You pay civil servants highly&mdash;some of them highly.  What for?  To flatter you, is it?  Is that the idea, or is it to give to the Minister sound advice, which he may or may not follow?  That is his privilege; he can make up his mind.  But surely what you pay a man highly for is to give you what he thinks is the proper thing, not what he thinks you want?  Is not that the obvious reason why you pay a man a high salary&mdash;because you think his opinion worth something; not because, beforehand, if I may use the phrase, he will give you what he thinks is already in your mind?  The man would not be worth £3 a week if that is all you wanted him for, but apparently that is now the headline set out by the Minister for Local Government and by the President to the Civil Service of this country&mdash;&ldquo;God help you if you give your opinions, if you have not an appreciation of the political outlook of the Government.&rdquo;  That is what it comes to.  That is the only way in which any responsible civil servant can read the present action of the Government.</P>
    <P>This affects not merely people in the high position of Mr. McCarron; it affects others as well.  Mr. McCarron rose to that high position from the lower ranks of the Civil Service.  The action of the Government affects, as I have said, not merely highly-paid officials, but everyone in Government employment.  I wonder whether this is an effort on the part of the Government to prove the necessity of Deputy Norton's motion in connection with the Civil Service?  If they were anxious to create a scandal in order to make it absolutely necessary for the House to accept a motion of that kind, they could not go a better way about it.  Are they relying on the fact that civil servants hold office at their pleasure?  They are certainly interpreting the word &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; in a very unethical and non-legal sense.  Surely this was done because of a whim of the Minister for Local Government when he was in a pet?  I wonder did he threaten to resign if Mr. McCarron was not dismissed?  I find it hard to believe that any body of men who call <Col N="87" /> themselves responsible could have acted as the Executive Council acted&mdash;even then their action would be inexcusable unless something of the kind occurred.</P>
    <P>What is the explanation of their action?  I have had acquaintance with the work of civil servants for years.  I have always spoken of it highly.  There is a great deal of misinformed criticism of the Civil Service in this country.  I have watched officials working and I have come into contact with many of them, especially the higher officials, both in my capacity as a Deputy and as a Minister, and I may say that I have nothing but admiration for the work and the genuine devotion to duty of the great bulk of them.  Amongst the hardest worked and the most zealous of civil servants was the man whose case we are discussing here to-day.  When I was first elected to this House the only time I could see that man, who was then head of his Department, was when he ought to have been at home, between 7 and 8 o'clock at night.  That was the only time when I could see him to draw his attention to certain matters, because he was so busy during his ordinary working hours.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the President, or the Vice-President, would have the impudence to pretend that that man did not give the same loyal, self-sacrificing service to his Government as he gave to the previous Government.  Is there any suggestion that he did not? Why the dismissal without the slightest attempt at investigation?  That is the amazing thing about it.  When did the dismissal take place, on the 24th or the 28th?  On what occasion did the full and careful consideration, which is referred to in the last letter expressing the President's views, take place, the full investigation of the case on the part of the Executive Council? What kind of an investigation did they make?  Did they even once ask this high official, whose work nobody praised as much as the present Minister, for an explanation of anything? Did they give him an opportunity of putting his case before them?  Did they not dismiss first?  There was, I admit, a note submitted by Mr. McCarron on the Portrane case telling the <Col N="88" /> Minister quite truly there should be no reason why he should be uneasy about that, that the course adopted was the proper and only course.  Beyond that, was there a single opportunity given to this civil servant to put his case before either the Minister or the Executive Council?  Is that the conception of justice that prevails in the Executive Council?</P>
    <P>Certain events occurred.  On Friday the Minister expressed a certain amount of uneasiness over certain news that appeared in the Press with reference to Portrane, which he wrongly relates to certain events that occurred in Ballinasloe.  On Tuesday, when Mr. McCarron goes in to him, he says: &ldquo;I have not much for you to-day, Minister,&rdquo; and the Minister says: &ldquo;Well, I have very serious news for you.  The Executive Council have unanimously dismissed you.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&ldquo;You no longer have my confidence.&rdquo;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&ldquo;You no longer have my confidence.&rdquo;&ldquo;In what instance, and how, have I forfeited your confidence?&rdquo;&ldquo;You no longer have my confidence.&rdquo;  It was a mere reiteration, parrot-like, of that particular phrase.  Apparently that was all that could be got out of the Vice-President or that has since been got out of the Executive Council in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister was challenged again and again.  &ldquo;Had I your confidence last week when we were in such and such a consultation?&rdquo;&ldquo;Had I your confidence when you spoke of me at that dinner given by the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce?&rdquo;&ldquo;Had I your confidence then?&rdquo;  No reply, no instance given by the Minister in which there was any sacrifice of confidence on the part of Mr. McCarron except the Portrane instance, and there was no justification to show why that should have induced the Minister to lose confidence in Mr. McCarron. Quite the contrary.  But the Executive Council and the Minister take refuge in the fact that they have the power and they will use it.  That is not just.</P>
    <P>You have dismissed a man who has served this country and this Government exceptionally well, as the Minister himself has so often proclaimed. You have dismissed him without giving <Col N="89" /> him an opportunity of being heard, without asking him what case he had to make.  The Minister for some reason was in a panic or was affected with hysteria of some kind.  That is the only explanation the public can see.  Since then there have been rumours.  Why should not there be rumours?  How could it be otherwise? The Executive Council do not profess to attack the integrity of this particular official.  Do the Executive Council not know the ability of many of their followers to whisper all sorts of things for which they cannot be brought to book, to whisper these things through the country?  What is the ordinary man to think when you have an apparently responsible Government taking this action?  Surely the drastic action cannot have been taken on the case put up by the Minister for Local Government?  I have not met a single person in the country who believed that that is the reason for the dismissal. How could they or anybody else believe it?  The thing is too nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Do not the Executive Council see the grave injustice they are doing this particular official by the action they have taken and by now refusing an inquiry into the whole matter so that we will know definitely where we are both as regards the justice of this case and the foul slanders that are going about without a tittle of foundation? An important point is involved as regards the confidence the Civil Service as a whole will have in the Government.  It often takes the Executive Council a long time to make up their mind.  It is often extremely difficult to get definite and clear statements from members of the Executive Council, and particularly from the President and Vice-President, but there was no lack of haste in this particular case.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Mr. McCarron were on friendly terms on Thursday and Mr. McCarron was dismissed on the following Tuesday.  Is not that the sequence of events?  That was certainly quick going and all the time no hint was given to him that he was to be dismissed or that his case was discussed by the Executive Council or even a hint that his case was going <Col N="90" /> to be discussed by them.  I am speaking now of the 24th.  He was dismissed then and he knew he was dismissed, for he was informed, but apparently it was on the 28th that he was finally dismissed.  When was the careful consideration given to the case?  Where was the careful consideration to which the President's letter refers when he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;After full and mature consideration&rdquo;? Where is the evidence of either full or mature consideration of that case?  Was there any inquiry into the matter?  Who held the inquiry when a dismissal was decided on, on the 24th?  There was no inquiry on which the Executive Council could act and no evidence was brought forward by the Department.  Was Mr. McCarron himself called upon?  Not a bit.  Surely that is a violation of the most ordinary canons of justice and not merely a violation of justice but of decency.  Not merely a violation of Christian morality but a violation over which pagan morality would not stand. A man with any morality would be shocked by proceedings of that kind. What is it all about?  Simply an emotional brain storm on the part of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to which the Executive Council give way.  That is the best explanation we have got of the action of the Government in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>We have here a high official who never knew he was to be dismissed until he was told that he had been dismissed.  He never knew he had a case to meet until he was told he was dismissed.  The Minister will apparently say that the confidence of the Civil Service is unchecked.  I am expecting to hear irresponsible statements from the Minister and I expect him to take that particular line.  When during the long years so far as work is concerned, and so far as the work accomplished by Mr. McCarron is concerned during the association of the Minister with Mr. McCarron, was there any real disagreement between them on matters of policy?  Can the Minister show any disagreements? Can he explain that the obvious and only interpretation that can be put on the President's first letter is the one put upon it by Deputy Costello? <Col N="91" /> Remember we are told that integrity or efficiency are not enough.  Efficiency on the part of a secretary surely includes appreciation of the general policy of the Government or the general policy of the Minister. How could you have an efficient secretary of a department unless he gave full satisfaction in that respect?  Whatever else does this addendum mean except the obvious interpretation that Deputy Costello put on it?  Apparently Mr. McCarron was to act as a kind of screen for jobs by the political Party opposite.  I would be glad to hear the Minister give an explanation. &ldquo;Integrity will not do.&rdquo;&ldquo;Efficiency will not do.&rdquo;  How can a secretary be efficient if he is not in harmony with the policy of his Ministers? The President knows perfectly well what his letter written in connection with the two appointments means. There was the Ballinasloe appointment and the Portrane appointment. The President's letter must be read with each of these two cases in mind because in the Ballinasloe case there was a row because a certain appointment was not made.  The President's letter can have no other interpretation for members of the Civil Service except the one put upon it to-day. Then the letter goes on&mdash;and I suggest in a very cowardly fashion, because there is no explanation of it given afterwards though such an explanation was asked for&mdash;it was merely an effort to cover the tracks of the Minister in this matter&mdash;&ldquo;certain incidents of which you are aware culminating in your action in connection with the Portrane appointment.&rdquo; What were they?  Were they incidents in connection with that appointment or not, or were there other incidents? What is the meaning of the President's letter?  In that particular case he was asked by the man that he had dismissed without inquiry, to mention these incidents and not one of them has been mentioned up to this.  What is that but a cowardly subterfuge to try to cover over the conduct of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Executive Council in this matter?  What else does it mean?  Mr. McCarron in his <Col N="92" /> letter of January 5th said he knew no such incidents.  Deputies will notice that the letter on behalf of the President says &ldquo;certain incidents of which you are aware&rdquo;.  The man accused says he knows of no such incidents and he asked to be told what these incidents were.  Has he been told them?  He has not.  In his last letter the President reiterates&mdash;and I notice that the letter was not sent until this notice of motion was handed in&mdash;his previous reply.  There are a number of serious issues involved in this particular case.  A grave injustice has been done.  The Government is always under the impression that because it has the power to do things, it can do these things again and again and without any restraint by the moral law.  It claims that the civil servants hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  I am not going into that now.</P>
    <P>Certainly it was never intended that civil servants could be dismissed without a moment's notice and for no reason.  The other day in England three men working in Devonport were dismissed, but only after an inquiry into their conduct.  They were doing technical work and confidential work. Even there they were not dismissed without a careful inquiry.  I am not going into the question whether that inquiry was or was not adequate.  It did not give satisfaction to all parties, but an inquiry was held.  Even the British whom you run down did not proceed to ignore the canons of justice to the extent which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the Executive Council has done in this case.  Are these the foundations on which you are to build a new Ireland?  Is this your conception of justice?  On the grounds of ordinary decency and on the grounds of ordinary justice it is the business of the Dáil to support this particular motion. There is no other way of clearing up the matter.  In the interest of this country, in justice to the Civil Service and in justice to Mr. McCarron, there is no other way to clear up this matter except by a full inquiry.  Therefore it is that we are asking for this inquiry. It is very hard to tell how far this case <Col N="93" /> will shock the whole Civil Service.  I believe it will.  I believe it has done so already.  My information is to that effect, and I have no reason to doubt the correctness of that information.  I cannot see how it could be otherwise. But this Government cares nothing for justice, they care nothing for the welfare of the Civil Service and the welfare of the State, so long as they can give temporary satisfaction to certain political supporters of theirs. That is the only explanation of their action that I can see.  That is the only explanation that we have heard of the conduct of the Government up to the present.</P>

      <P>This motion is a motion to set up a committee to review a judgment taken by legal and competent judges on a matter connected with administration in the Civil Service. Now, the day that an Executive Council allows another body to be set up to review a judgment which it has arrived at, after full consideration, then on that day that Government has to disappear.  The only way that a Government can deal with a resolution of this sort is to regard it as a motion of censure, and it is as a motion of censure that we are regarding it, and it is as a motion of censure that we propose to resist it.</P>
      <P>Now, we have listened to two <i>ex parte</i> statements made from the opposite benches.  All sorts of allegations have been made against the Government: their corruption and their want of justice and all the rest of it.  There has not been, during the whole time, an attempt to consider what is the position of the secretary of a Department in relation to his Minister, and what these relations must of necessity be if there is to be efficient administration of the public services at all.  I wonder how many Deputies in the House will disagree with something which I had occasion to quote when the matter of the dismissal of General O'Duffy was here formally before the House.  On that occasion I reminded the House that, in connection with that particular matter, a former Minister for Justice had said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The law, however, does envisage the possibility of circumstances arising <Col N="94" /> which, without reflecting any discredit on the individual concerned, might render it undesirable in the interests of the State that he should be any longer permitted to retain his appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is the secretary of a Department of State specially to be appointed by the Executive Council?  If the position is of such importance that the appointment has to be made by the Executive Council, is there anybody who will hold that, if it is in the interests generally of the public administration that it should be made by the Executive Council, that it should not be revoked by the Executive Council?</P>
    <P>What are the relations between a Minister and the secretary of a Department? One of the speakers this evening spoke of the daily miracle of the work that is performed by the head of a Department, but remember that for that daily miracle the Minister is responsible, for every item of it, and how can the Minister of a Department possibly be responsible for it if confidence between him and the secretary does not prevail&mdash;the utmost confidence? If, in the course of their intimate contact, for it is intimate contact, any incident arises which makes it impossible for the Minister to retain that confidence, then it is the duty of the Minister to get instead of the official in whom he has lost confidence an official in whom he will have full confidence.  That is the whole theory of responsible Government, using, in so far as it is possible to do so, permanent civil servants in order to implement it.  Is the Dáil going to say that that is not right and proper? Is the Dáil going to say that, when a situation arises in which the Minister in his conscience and judgment loses that confidence, he is to go on administering his Department, depending on somebody in whom he ultimately has not trust?  It is quite obvious that the thing could not continue.  Whilst there is nobody who has a greater desire to see civil servants retained with the fullest possible security&mdash;I would go further and say civil servants who are in high positions and, above all, secretaries to Departments, retained <Col N="95" /> if it is at all possible to retain them&mdash; I for one am not for a second going to hold that if the secretary to a Department loses the confidence of the Minister with whom he has to work that secretary should be retained. Now, lest there should be any misunderstanding of my attitude, or feeling that I do not appreciate the value of permanency on the part of people in charge of Departments, I want to say this, that I fully appreciate the importance of the continuity of officials in public administration.  In the administration of the Departments that I am concerned with myself, from day to day I have experience of the value of having men who had precedents to which they could point, who had previous decisions to which they could point, who have all that accumulated knowledge over a long period of years of the various things that crop up in a Department&mdash;of having such people there as counsellors.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vice-President or any Minister is anxious every time to be generous.  Is the generosity of the Vice-President now to be used as an accusation against him?  Every Minister is anxious to give to the permanent officials who are with him as much credit for the work of the Department as can possibly be given to them.  I may very well have reason to believe yesterday that I could fully trust a person, but an incident may occur to-day which would change my mind in that regard to-morrow.  The whole basis of the system of Government that we have, and of administration that we have, is that there is a supreme law here which elects an Executive of administrators, and these administrators are personally and collectively responsible to the Dáil for the administration of their Departments; for every tittle of administration of their Departments they are held responsible, <Col N="96" /> and rightly so, but they have necessarily to delegate, or to permit to be performed in their name, functions, in the main, by the secretary.  He has to interpret the mind of the Minister to the officials.  He has to interpret the Government policy to officials. There is the suggestion here that this reference to lack of appreciation of Government policy in my letter had reference to jobs.  Is it not quite the contrary that is meant clearly and patently?  The point is here that the Government had decided that the Appointments Commission was to be used to the fullest possible extent. Here was a case, too, in which the Appointments Commission should have been used, in my opinion.  Where is the question of jobbery?  Is it not quite obvious that it was the duty of the Government to see that that policy would be carried out uniformly everywhere, and that any suspicions that might arise anywhere in regard to the uniform, the just, administration of that policy would be dissipated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy, with all the charges and allegations that have been made about appointments, to have a position which is absolutely clear, and one of the things that the Government has at heart is seeing to it that all public appointments which will be made by the Appointments Commission should be above reproach, and that the Appointments Commission should be uniformly used.  What, then, is the suggestion of using somebody as a screen for jobs?  Somebody, we are told&mdash;the secretary of a Department&mdash; is objected to for advice that he gave. Where has there been a suggestion of a question of advice?  Forsooth, if we do this, we are insisting that the heads of Departments should give to the Ministers advice which they think the Ministers will like.  As a matter of fact, every civil servant of any quality knows perfectly well &mdash; particularly those civil servants who have to advise Ministers on any matters&mdash;that his duty, the one thing he is supposed to do, is to give, to the best of his ability, honest advice to the Minister whether the Minister takes it or not.  The Minister may have a different opinion &mdash;not infrequently that is so.  Frequently&mdash;perhaps in the majority of <Col N="97" /> cases&mdash;the Minister's opinion does coincide with the advice that has been tendered to him by the head of his Department; but are we going to take up the position that the Minister must take the advice?  One would imagine, from some of the things that have been said, that if the Minister ventures to disagree, or to insist that it is his view or the view of the Government that must be taken, and not the view of the civil servants, some permanent wrong is being done to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>What is all this about?  I have been trying to find out what are the allegations against the Government in this motion or in the speeches that have been made.  The suggestion is that we dismissed this man because he did not give us the advice we wanted: because he did not cover up some political jobs we wanted to perpetrate. Where is there the slightest evidence of anything of the kind?  There is none &mdash;none anywhere.  If you want to investigate it, let it be shown here. Let anybody show where there is the slightest indication in any action we have taken that we dismissed the man because he gave us advice we did not want to take or because he was not willing to be a screen to cover up some political jobs the Government wanted to perpetrate.  Is not the evidence all to the contrary?</P>
    <P>The next line of the charge, apparently, is that we did this thing hastily &mdash;that the man got no opportunity. There are certain things you do not want to get outside evidence for.</P>

      <P>Very well, then, put out the Government&mdash;that is what your motion is&mdash;but the Government has very deliberately and with full appreciation of everything concerned decided that no longer is this particular gentleman, Mr. McCarron, the former secretary of that Department, to remain as secretary of that Department.  The Government has a right to do that if it feels that the proper and efficient administration of the Service is going to be served by doing so.  The Government would not be doing its duty if it did anything less.  For Mr. McCarron, personally, as an individual, the Government showed consideration in every way; but if, whether on account of special consideration or regard for an official, you have to maintain him in a position in which you have come to the conclusion that he is a misfit, as he will be if he is out of accord and if he has lost the confidence of his Minister, then you will be doing harm to the public services, if, out of undue regard for him, you are going to allow him to continue in the Service.  Mr. McCarron had an opportunity of sending to the Executive Council anything he wished to say in his own regard. He has published the letters he has <Col N="99" /> written and we have given our reply&mdash; the reply which the Government gives here to this Dáil, and it will give no other reply except that.</P>

      <P>I am not going further than what I said before, and that is that he had an opportunity of presenting to the Executive Council any statement which was made in his regard, and before the Executive Council took action they saw the memorandum which he had submitted to the Vice-President.  Again, I say the fundamental position is this&mdash;either you will admit that the Executive Council has the right and the duty to get the best possible and the most efficient secretaries for the Departments which are administered by the Ministers, or not.  I say they have; and, with due consideration for Mr. McCarron, they made it clear that it was for want of that confidence there that he was being dismissed, and he was dismissed with full consideration, in so far as it could legally be given, for his personal position.  Before he was dismissed or removed from office an opportunity was given to him to go into another post where the same individual confidence was not necessary, a post of equal value.  We have been told of the £300 a year or something like that that he has lost.  Mr. McCarron has lost it because he was not prepared to take a post of equal value in the Civil Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an immense difference.  The secretary of a Department has to be in every respect the Minister's <i>alter ego.</i>  The Minister has to take responsibility for his actions. I say there is an immense difference. There is the same difference that there was between putting General O'Duffy somewhere else&mdash;perhaps it would have been wrong, in some people's opinion, to put him anywhere else&mdash;but there was the same difference between putting him somewhere else and putting him in a responsible position as head of the police force.  There is an immense difference between offering him another position of equal value in which his abilities and efficiency otherwise might be availed of, and leaving him as secretary of a Department when, by reason of certain failures of judgment or discretion or of appreciation of what was the fundamental Government policy, the Minister lacked confidence in him.</P>
      <P>We have not then behaved either high-handedly or unjustly.  We went to the furthest letter of the law so as to give him the highest retiring pension in view of his ability and the services he had rendered.  We would have retained the ability which he had shown in another position in the Civil Service had he been willing to accept that but, when he was not willing to accept it, I say the Government is not going to be placed in the position in which a man can say: &ldquo;You will have to hold me on; you will have to retain me in this position whether in fact I am regarded by the Executive Council or the particular Minister as the best and most efficient person or not.&rdquo; That is what the real issue is, whether the Government or a Department is to be forced to continue on a man in whom the Minister has lost confidence. Everybody knows that there can be no efficient administration if that were the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the issue, precisely the issue and none other. The Government has offered to him a position elsewhere where that confidence was unnecessary and it has given him a pension, the biggest that could possibly be awarded him under the law.  How can it be said, then, that there is any other question at issue except that he should be retained in the position that he occupied, even when the Executive Council or the Minister had lost confidence in him? I have said the Executive Council are the judges.  They are appointed by law and, in the nature of things, they must be the judges.  They are accountable for their judgments to the Dáil as a whole, but while that Government is in office there is no reviewing of their decision.  The day that you review their decisions in these matters and the day particularly that you find judgment against them in these matters, there is no question of the Government retaining office any longer.  It could not do it.  Its whole power to administer would be destroyed.  You can vote the Government out and I do not object to that.  I think it is very good&mdash;it is one of the values of having Parliamentary institutions&mdash;that, in cases of this sort, if there should appear, on the part of the Executive, unfair or improper treatment of anybody, any failure of justice, the Government should be fully arraigned for it before the Dáil as is being done here to-day through the mouths of the Opposition.  That is all right.  I have nothing to say to that. What I do say is that it must be in that form and none other, but the proposal to set up a committee to inquire into the facts, to pronounce judgment, in other words, on the Executive Council, is quite impossible with the continuance of that Government in office.  You can vote the Government out but you cannot have a Committee of the Dáil reviewing or revising their decisions in matters in which they are made by the law and the Constitution the supreme judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, then, take full responsibility, as the Government, for what we have done.  What we have done we have done in the public interest.  There is no question of political victimisation, <Col N="102" /> no question of personal animosity. The assertions have been made that this man was removed from his office as secretary because he has not given to the Minister the advice which the Minister wanted or because he was not willing to act as a screen for some political jobbery which the Minister had in mind or which the Executive Council had in mind.  The Dáil cannot take it that these assertions are true when they are quite contrary to every indication.  I do not think there is anything further I have to say about it.  Former secretaries of Departments have gone into positions in the Civil Service similar to the position which was offered to Mr. McCarron and they did not regard it either as a lowering of their status or as an insult.  I think it is necessary in the public interest that what I quoted before from a former Minister for Justice should be clearly understood&mdash; that there is the possibility of circumstances arising which, without reflecting any discredit on the individual concerned, might render it undesirable in the interests of the State that he should be any longer permitted to retain the appointment.  Therefore it must be understood that being transferred from one office in the public service to another does not necessarily mean that there is any discredit attached to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>That brings me to, perhaps, the last thing I should deal with.  There have been suggestions that the Government, somehow, circulated certain reports.  There have been suggestions that the first announcement went, somehow, over the wireless and it has been hinted that the Government were responsible for that announcement. The Government was not responsible for that announcement any more than it was responsible for the publication of any of the letters. These letters were published by Mr. McCarron himself, who also published a statement.  So far as I have been able to find out, this news came to the broadcasting station via the newspapers to whom Mr. McCarron himself had given the information.  If, then, the broadcasting station, in giving out the news in that particular form, did <Col N="103" /> any injury to Mr. McCarron, do not say it was the Government that prompted it.  It is also said that Mr. McCarron deserves to be protected from some of the insinuations made against his character.  We made no insinuations against his character.  We made quite clear the basis on which the Executive Council decided to remove him&mdash;that they had lost confidence in him.  That is practically what it means.</P>

      <P>I shall not go any further than what I have stated.  As I said, you have your remedy if you think that this Government acted in the spirit in which previous speakers suggested it acted.  Your remedy is to put out the Government.  As long as this Government is responsible for public administration, if it finds that there is a secretary of a Department, or any other public official in whom it is essential they should have the utmost confidence&mdash; if they are satisfied that they have reason for no longer reposing the necessary confidence in him, this Government will remove any such person.  If you do not do that, you will not have efficient control of administration. If you do not have that position, you will have a Government which will only be a laughing stock because it will not be able to do its work.  Is that a threat to the Civil Service?  Is that weakening the sense of security that civil servants have? We have been four or five years in office.  We came into office under conditions which led a large number <Col N="104" /> of people to think that no civil servant or public official would be safe or secure.  I gave a promise before the election&mdash;about two or three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Because efficiency was bound to be impaired if this situation were allowed to continue, we remedied that situation in the only way in which it could be remedied.  The very fact of our making the offer we did should make it clear to everybody that there was nothing against Mr. McCarron's ability, that there was no indication of all those terrible things which, it is said, were implied in our removal of him from office.  We stated clearly and definitely why we removed him, and if it should ever happen again that a situation would arise in which we should have to decide whether it was necessary in the interest of efficient administration of the public services that the secretary of a Department should be changed to another position, then he will be changed, so long as we are in office.  If the Dáil thinks that in this or any other case we have acted harshly or improperly, there is only one way in which they can deal with the matter.  That is, dismiss the Government from office.</P>

      <P>The President says to-day, on second thoughts, that he welcomes discussion in the House on matters analogous to that which at present engages our attention.  In the next breath, he says he refuses to discuss the relevant facts and that, if a judgment is to be come to by this House on the issues raised in this connection, that judgment must be one of censure on the Government.  There must be no detached consideration of the facts of this case by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  These are the President's clear words&mdash;that he forbids detached judgment in this case and that any member of his Party who <Col N="105" /> desires to secure justice for this civil servant must, at the same time, desire to put the Government out of office. The President goes on to say: &ldquo;We transferred this man.&rdquo;  He quotes from a document in the course of which he points out that it has been stated by a previous Minister for Justice that circumstances can arise in which a civil servant is transferred from one position to another without any kind of reflection being made upon him. But you did not transfer Mr. McCarron; you dismissed him.  You dismissed him twice.  His own Minister told him, in the first place, that he was dismissed and declined to assign any reason except that he was not giving him his confidence.  He was then formally dismissed by the Executive Council.  It was as an afterthought that somebody confidentially told him, in an unofficial way, that a position as supernumerary Commissioner of Public Works was open to him if he cared to have it.  The public had been informed that he was dismissed from his office.  It is noteworthy that the President returns again and again to the statement that no reflection is implied on a civil servant whom it is proposed to transfer.  There was no proposal to transfer Mr. McCarron. There was instead, a final, irrevocable and unreasonable dismissal.</P>

    <P>The President said that the Opposition, in opening this case to-day, showed no desire to appreciate the relations that must exist between a secretary of a Department and a Minister.  So far as I am aware, we all appreciate it&mdash;my colleagues far more than I.  They are all men who have had ministerial experience.  Nobody challenges the statement that there must be absolute confidence between the Minister and his secretary.  Nobody denies that they could not carry on if they did not trust one another completely.  We all know that.  But, in this case, we have made manifest that the Minister did not say, &ldquo;Something happened yesterday which has thrown a flood of light on other matters.&rdquo;  Instead, he says, &ldquo;An incident occurred yesterday which is the end of a series of incidents which have robbed you of my confidence.&rdquo; The same Minister who said <Col N="106" /> that went out of his way all through the country to pay tribute to the peculiar efficiency and helpfulness of Mr. McCarron.  Not only did he do that, but he went out of his way in the most public fashion in Dáil Eireann to associate familiarly with Mr. McCarron and mark out by his appearance with him in personal intercourse that he was a person who enjoyed his confidence and, to a degree known only to themselves, his personal friendship.  He had no hesitation in being seen about in his company outside office hours.  Is it rational for any reasonable man to believe that, while the Vice-President was going out of his way to demonstrate to all beholders the measure of his confidence in Mr. McCarron, at the same time he distrusted him?  I entirely agree with the President, and so do all my colleagues, that no Minister should be asked to retain as permanent head of his Department a man in whom he has no confidence.  But are we to accept the proposition that a man who has given long years of honest service to the State is to have his whole position jeopardised at the passing whim of the particular Minister to whom he is responsible?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister ought to be able to lay the facts before not only the Executive Council but this House if needs be.  Surely he ought to be able to satisfy the House&mdash;whether the House agrees with him or not&mdash;that there were facts upon which a reasonable man could come to the conclusion that the secretary was not playing square.  He could then honestly say, &ldquo;It may be that other members of the House do not agree with me, but I had to do the work.  I had to work with this man and, the moment these facts became known to me and I ceased to have confidence in him, I was not going to be a hypocrite.  It may be that somebody else would have confidence in him but, on these facts, I had not, and I would not continue to work with him.&rdquo;  That has not happened.  The President has asked, &ldquo;Are we to use the generosity of the Vice-President against him now if he did speak generously of his secretary; is that to be used as a weapon against <Col N="107" /> him?&rdquo;  We want to use no weapon against the Minister.  In raising this matter, we are not asking for generosity; we are asking for justice. We do not want generosity for any member of the Civil Service.  We do not want the Executive Council to strain a point in a matter of this kind. Nobody admits more readily than I do that, from a man occupying Mr. McCarron's position, a very high standard of conduct is necessary. There is no room for generosity or looseness.  He must conform to a much higher standard of conduct than a minor civil servant.  His conduct must be beyond all suspicion and reproach.</P>
    <P>Our case is that his conduct is beyond all suspicion.  We say he is entitled to credit for that.  If the Minister had come forward and said perfectly honestly to Mr. McCarron, &ldquo;Look here, the fact is you and I do not get on, and we cannot do our job together.  I recognise that you are acting honestly according to your lights, but we clash and cannot see eye to eye in the work to be done, and we are not going to do the job.  Therefore, I am going to ask the Minister for Finance to find a place of equal status and equal remuneration for you. Will you go there?  I say perfectly plainly that if you are not prepared to assist me to get efficiency in the administration of the Department, by indicating your readiness to retire to another office, I will have to go to the Executive Council and say that I cannot get on with you, that I cannot get the work of this Department done with you.  These are the plain facts.&rdquo; I do not see how anyone on these benches could have complained if the Vice-President was in a position to get up and say that that interview took place.  No one could blame him seeing that, for one reason or another, they could not get on, that they were crosswise; that they were suspicious of one another.  Maybe neither was justified, but we know once that situation developed there was no use in trying to carry on with the relationship that subsisted.  Is that asking for generosity? I do not think it is.  It is only <Col N="108" /> asking for the barest justice for a man like Mr. McCarron who, we all know, has worked like a black in the public service, and long after official hours, when he thought it was necessary to do so.  Was that asking anything more than the barest justice, seeing that the President admits that there is no charge of turpitude against Mr. McCarron, no charge of impropriety and no charge of misconduct?  Was it anything more than the barest justice for the Minister to send for him and to say: &ldquo;We cannot get on and I want to get rid of you?  Probably the relationship that has grown up between us makes you want to get rid of me.  We must part, but the Executive Council, in view of the years of service you have given, will be glad to facilitate that parting without the slightest difficulty in view of your integrity and efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have had reason to complain on more than one occasion that the present Government seem to think that if you do not penalise a man in his pocket it is all right; that he has no other claim against you.  That is not true.  A man might gladly be penalised in his pocket if he could maintain his honour and his reputation.  A man's honour, reputation and prestige are of much greater value to himself and his family than his income.  A man's name is higher, particularly in a community such as that in which we live, a small community.  We know that Mr. McCarron stands very high in the matter of honour, reputation and integrity in the opinion of the people, and that his children are always proud to boast of him.  It is, therefore, important that there should be no reflection on him.</P>
    <P>That is more important than the loss of a couple of hundred pounds in salary.  The Government do not seem to be able to get over that.  If the Vice-President came forward honestly and boldly said: &ldquo;I recognise that Mr. McCarron is a zealous man, but we cannot get on.  It may be my fault, but, as I have been elected Vice-President of this State, I have to do this job and I am simply going to ask to have him transferred elsewhere.&rdquo;  Mr. McCarron would then have no complaint. <Col N="109" /> Every rational man would have said that the Vice-President might be a cranky man, that God made him so, but, at least, he was a man and had been decent enough when getting rid of him.  He knew Mr. McCarron to be zealous and enthusiastic, but they could not get on.  What difficulty was there about that?  No damage would have been done to Mr. McCarron and no conceivable damage to the Vice-President. At first people might be inclined to joke about it, but ultimately they would see that it was a decent and courageous thing to do, to state the facts, and then no one could complain and no reflection would be cast.  The Government had offered him another job.  There was a man with 15 years in the public service before him, drawing his salary and doing his work, and there would be no difficulty about it.  There would be the feeling not only with the Minister but throughout the country that they could publicly face the facts.  I am going to pay the President an unexpected tribute, because&mdash;although I have very little use for him as a politician&mdash;this is the kind of thing I expected he would do.  It is one of the strange and queer gifts he has of doing the kind of things that our people like, of being handsome in matters of this kind.  I believe he tries to be honest, and I believe he would do so in this case only that he does not want to let down the Vice-President.  He thinks the Vice-President has got himself into a mess and he is trying to cover him.</P>

      <P>I do not expect you would get up now.  The thing can be settled now and substantial justice done all round.  That is all I am primarily concerned with.  To tell you the truth, I do not care a fiddledee-dee if there is an inquiry or not, but for the fact that a man who I know has been a loyal servant should be amply vindicated and properly treated, I think the situation can be met now by the Government taking formal action saying they are glad to pay a tribute to this man's perfect integrity, perfect efficiency, the only trouble that arose being that he could not get on with <Col N="110" /> the Minister and that the Minister could not get on with him.  &ldquo;We do not put any blame on the Minister or put any blame on Mr. McCarron. There are the facts.  We were quite prepared that Mr. McCarron should be retained in a position of equal responsibility. We had not a position of equal status, but we are quite prepared to say now that we will give him a position with an equal salary.  It cannot be a position of equal status because there is none to offer, but if he does not like to take it we will give him for the remaining 15 years the full salary or allow him to go on superannuation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am concerned about this man of integrity and distinction being completely vindicated.  I want to see that his children can say, as they are entitled to say, that they have been proud of him in the past, and that they are proud of him now.  All sides in this country recognise him as a man who gave unusual and generous service to the State, not only a fair return for the salary he drew, but who worked in the highest traditions of the Civil Service of this State and did not spare time or trouble when he was discharging work in whatever position he filled in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be sorry to introduce a controversial note or heat into this question but heat, I suppose, we must show.  I cannot believe that there is a very large difference between anyone here desiring to see substantial justice done to this man.  The President has put the theory that you cannot reject anything the Executive Council does without smashing the Government. Let me call the President's attention to another parliamentary institution not a million miles from here where dockyard men were concerned.  When the suggestion was made from the Labour Benches in the British House of Commons that an inquiry should be held both the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty at first rejected it.  They said it would be unthinkable to discuss the dismissal as they would probably have to make statements that would not be consistent with the safety of the State. Then we were given the results of an inquiry that was held by responsible <Col N="111" /> civil servants with regard to the five chaps who were dismissed. Responsible officials asked them to weigh their decision favourably towards the men and they reported that every doubt was given in favour of the men.  It was only when distinguished civil servants reported that after giving them the benefit of every doubt they felt bound to advise the Admiralty to dismiss the men.  It was only then that the First Lord brought the matter before the Cabinet and said: &ldquo;Now, I am not bringing it myself.  I have had it examined first by the secret service of the dockyard. I then had it referred to three eminent civil servants and I have them instructed to re-examine it and to give the benefit of every doubt to these five men.  It is only after these preliminaries that I now come to the Cabinet and lay the reports of those two bodies before them and to say that I cannot be responsible for the safety of the dockyard if you do not dismiss them.&rdquo;  Then, and only then, was dismissal decided upon.  &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says the Prime Minister on this occasion: &ldquo;I am glad these cases are being raised here and being discussed and every point raised in regard to them. I will willingly discuss every point except in so far as I cannot reveal my sources of information; but I do allege that acts of sabotage took place about which you will all know in the past.  I cannot tell you how these men are connected with them but if the dockyards are to be safe, these men must go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to a secretary who was dismissed, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Air, in Great Britain, he was given the opportunity of appearing before a tribunal and did appear before a tribunal, and answered categorical charges where he said that he did not interpret his actions as being wrong at all and where the Minister for Air said he thought they were and the man after a full trial was then discharged.  I ask the President to compare that attitude with the attitude he has taken up here to-day, that is, that he will not discuss the facts at all, that once the Executive Council <Col N="112" /> examine the facts and pass judgment on them, it becomes a question of confidence; that you must not view the question from a detached point of view and that you must make up your mind that you vote to put out the Government or you vote to put out Mr. McCarron.  That is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>The President, in the course of his observations, said that the action taken in regard to the appointment of Dr. Blake gave rise to the gravest dissatisfaction on the part of the Minister, but does the President forget that this matter was brought under the attention of the Minister months ago and that the course proposed was approved by the Vice-President?</P>

      <P>May I intervene for a moment to say that I am trying here to see that a vicious precedent is not started.  It is quite obvious that if this thing is going to be examined in detail, every case will be examined in detail and you will make administration by the Government impossible. You have either in these matters to trust the court that has decided on the matter or get rid of the court and put some other court in.  You are not here in a position to examine this case in detail.  If you put up a commission to examine it in detail, you are setting up a body to revise the court which is the competent court in regard to the matter, and that court cannot <Col N="113" /> stand if you do.  There are a number of things I could have replied to, but I do not want to establish a precedent in regard to details.  There may be a number of cases in which the details would be altogether against the public interest, and even against the individual concerned, and I think that the Dáil has to take the position that either the Government has done its duty properly or it has not and they should get rid of it.  That is why, though I contravene and controvert a number of the statements made here in regard to the facts, I took up the position that we are not going into detail on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does make discussion a little difficult, because the President will not discuss it.  He says: &ldquo;I simply say we did this and there is an end of it.&rdquo;  My answer is that either you ought to give a man a tribunal to appear in front of so that he may rebut allegations made against him or come out overtly in public and say: &ldquo;We make no allegation of impropriety against him.  We know him to be an excellent, scrupulous and conscientious man.  It is solely a question of temperamental unsuitability.  The Minister cannot work with him and he cannot work with the Minister.  We have offered a job at the same salary. We have not got one at the same status. If he does not want that, recognising the value of his splendid services in the past, we offer his salary to the end of his period of 15 years, and a pension thereafter.  We only do that because a crisis has arisen which makes it impossible to retain him in his present position. We cannot retain the Minister and the Secretary.  We have to retain the Minister, and, therefore, the Secretary must go.&rdquo;  If that generous gesture had been made, all this trouble need not have arisen.  Surely when a man has given a life of unselfish service, when you think of his family&mdash; and it is not the money that worries me&mdash;surely he is entitled to that little added vindication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to believe, if they will, that so far as we are concerned we want no political kudos out of this, and if a way can be found in which a generous gesture can be made, fully <Col N="114" /> vindicating Mr. McCarron, I shall be delighted to hear it.  We want to be the cause of no gibes or jeers at anybody even if it emerges that there was a little haste or difficulty.  That could happen in the best regulated family, and a dignified and safe way out of such a difficulty is sometimes hard to find.  I say on our behalf that we want to put no obstacle in the way of a dignified and proper advance out of a position that has given rise to very deep and serious apprehension in the minds of many.  We would much sooner believe, and would be much happier to know, that no Government in this country desires to victimise anybody and we would be much happier if every section of the community, rich and poor, would know the same thing.  That settled, we can quarrel about politics in other regards or on other occasions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned now to secure that the peculiar circumstances in which these matters must be raised in this House by an Opposition attacking a Government and the Government defending itself against opposition, will not result in a public servant who spent his life in the service of this country being ground between the upper and lower millstones.  I would sooner the two millstones drew apart and that he were carried honourably out of this impasse; but, and I think that the Ministers will agree with this, if substantial justice is to be done after what has occurred, we must have a very ample vindication of Mr. McCarron.  There may be difficulties about giving that, but whatever difficulties there may be on the Minister's side, let me give them this assurance: they will not be added to by anything we say or do if we get any indication from the other side that it is desired not only to be strictly just, but in view of any misapprehension that may have arisen in the past, to be handsome in the compensation that is made to Mr. McCarron and to be honest, straight and plain in the estimation of his service and character in the Civil Service of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a very few words on this subject, all the fewer because Deputy Dillon <Col N="115" /> has just said for me a great deal of what I otherwise should wish to say.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are two separate issues raised by this debate. One is whether Mr. McCarron was fairly treated and the other is whether the Dáil is entitled to ask from the Government a statement of the facts to enable it to say whether Mr. McCarron has been fairly treated or not.  As regards the first issue&mdash; whether Mr. McCarron was fairly treated&mdash;there is one point about which I am not clear, and about which I hope the Government will not refuse to give an answer, and that is, was the offer of a position of equivalent value made to Mr. McCarron on the same occasion when he was first informed of his dismissal from his post, or was that offer made to him on some subsequent occasion?  A good deal seems to me to turn upon that point.  It is one thing to tell a man that you have come to the conclusion that in the interests of the public service it is better that he should be in another post of equal value.  It is another thing to call a man in and say to him melodramatically: &ldquo;I have got some serious news for you; the Executive Council has unanimously decided on your dismissal&rdquo;, and then after a subsequent interchange of letters and further interviews to offer him at a later date a post of equivalent value.  If that was the course of events, if there was an interval of that sort between those two happenings, I do think that on the evidence before us&mdash;which I admit is woefully incomplete&mdash;Mr. McCarron was unfairly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, so far as we can make out, what is the most that is alleged against him?  It is alleged against him that he showed a lack of discretion in not having the Portrane appointment made in such a way as to protect the Government against all suspicion of not using the Appointments Board in a case where they ought to have used it.  Now, quite evidently, Mr. McCarron is not accused of having done that in a corrupt spirit.  If there were any suggestion that Mr. McCarron had been <Col N="116" /> corrupt, he certainly would not, at a later or at any date, have been offered a position of equivalent value.  All that it amounts to then is that, according to the Minister for Local Government, Mr. McCarron was indiscreet, and showed a lack of political sensibility, shall we say, in not realising that the Government should have been better protected against criticism by the method in which that appointment was made.  The President says there were other incidents, but he has refused to give us any hint of what those other incidents were. We are entitled, I submit, to assume that those other incidents were at any rate not more serious than the one incident of which we have been told. I suggest that that one incident is an unbelievably trivial ground on which to call a man in and say to him &ldquo;I have got something very serious to announce to you.  The Executive Council has unanimously decided on your dismissal.&rdquo;  Just exercise a little imagination and a knowledge of psychology and think of the shock that an announcement of that sort must give to a public servant of long and distinguished service to the State.</P>
    <P>I am an Independent member, and, although there are certain subjects on which I differ profoundly from the Government, nevertheless in the ordinary jog-trot of Parliamentary business and of administration I have felt it my duty to give general support to the Government so long as I have been on one of the Independent Benches.  My instinct on an occasion such as this would be to support them if possible, but I must frankly confess that on the facts as they have been so far disclosed to us, it does seem to me that Mr. McCarron has been the victim of an injustice, although I agree that it should be within the competence of the Government to decide that even a head of a department might be better employed elsewhere in a post of equal importance and equal value.  But that is not the sort of decision that was reached, so far as the matter has been presented to us here for our consideration this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other matter, as to whether the Dáil and the country are <Col N="117" /> entitled at all to know about the reasons for an action of this sort in relation to a Civil Service post of great importance.  I suggest that the sense of humour of the President of the Executive Council must have entirely deserted him when he said at one moment that it was a happy feature of Parliamentary Government that we could discuss a matter of this sort here and take a decision on it, and then a moment afterwards declare that he would give us absolutely no material on which to base our decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you not making a great case without any material?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said, two or three times over, that I am expressing opinions on the basis of such scanty material as is available.  The President may be keeping up his sleeve material that would exonerate the Government.  I submit that if there is such material he has a duty to disclose it to us.  I suggest that a high quality of Civil Service is one of the greatest assets that a country can have.  It is in that respect, if any, that the British system of government commands the admiration of other countries.  The fact that a head of a department in Great Britain is treated as having almost the same security of tenure as a judge of the High Court is of incalculable value to the whole machinery of government.  I am glad that the President has recognised as explicitly as he has done to-day, in words at any rate, that it is desirable that civil servants in important positions should be men of the highest quality.  I would add to that, for my part, that they should be men who are not afraid of responsibility.  The curse of any badly run business or any badly run country always is that there are hosts of people anxious to run away from responsibility, to cover themselves against any possible criticism, and to shove any decisions of importance on to somebody else.  It is not at all desirable, of course, that a civil servant should be acting in conflict with the wishes of his Government, but it is important that civil servants should realise that the Government expects <Col N="118" /> them to be men and not mice, and that civil servants should above all things feel that they are not going to be offered up as sacrifices to appease the supporters of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>The present Government are at least singularly unlucky on this occasion if their conduct has been as virtuous as they claim it has been, because it is within common knowledge that there was a fierce agitation against the Department of Local Government, and inferentially against Mr. McCarron in particular, as its permanent head, over the Ballinasloe appointment. Superficially, what we see is this: we see Salome, in the person of Doctor Ada English, demanding from King Herod, in the person of the Minister for Local Government, the head of John the Baptist&mdash;in the person of the unfortunate Mr. McCarron &mdash;on a charger.  That is what it is apt to look like to the general public, and there is a danger of civil servants getting the impression that they will be sacrificed, if the Government finds itself in a tight place, in order to appease the supporters of the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not believe&mdash;and I will say it quite candidly&mdash;that either the President of the Executive Council or the Vice-President, the Minister for Local Government, would sacrifice a man for those motives.  I do not believe it, but I do say that it is the duty of Cæsar's wife to be above suspicion; that it is the duty of the Government to make it plain to the country that they have a high conception of the status of civil servants, and that it is the duty of the Government when it does take such violent action as to call in a very high civil servant and tell him that there is serious news for him and that he is dismissed and to hold him up to the country as a person who has been dismissed&mdash;I say that when a Government has done all that, it certainly ought here, as would the Government across the water in Great Britain, to make plain to the Dáil and to the country what are the reasons that justified its course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to observe that it seems to me that the <Col N="119" /> proceedings here this afternoon mark another step in the simplification of our institutions.  We have already disposed of all the institutions of the State, with the single exception of the Dáil, and now we hear from the President that it is impossible to allow the Dáil to review any decision of the Executive Council.  He says that his view is that the Executive Council is responsible and, if it makes a decision, all that the Dáil can do is to vote against the members of the Executive Council and put them out of office.  He says it is impossible to allow the Dáil to review the decision of the Executive Council.  I may have misunderstood the President.  I may be putting the matter further than he intended it should be put, but I do not think that I am really doing any injustice to his point, because the rest of his speech made it perfectly clear that he was not prepared to allow this House to discuss the decision of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>This House cannot discuss any decision unless it knows the facts.  The President told the House that before he spoke there were two <i>ex parte</i> statements.  An <i>ex parte</i> statement is a statement made by one party to a case, of the case as it appears to him. The matter would no longer have remained in the position of an <i>ex parte</i> matter if the President had chosen or if the Vice-President chose, to state the other side of the case, but that apparently is not to be done.  Therefore it comes to this, that this House is not only not to be allowed to review the decision of the Executive Council in this matter, but it is not to be allowed to discuss it because a discussion is impossible without knowledge of the facts.  The President has stated that we have only an <i>ex parte</i> statement of the case and he has explicitly declined to state the other side, if there be another side.  It therefore comes to this, that the position of Mr. McCarron, the late secretary of the Department, cannot be examined by this House, and it is impossible for any independent, fair-minded Deputy to determine the merits of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President said he is prepared to treat this motion as a motion of censure upon the Government.  Are we <Col N="120" /> to be asked to censure the Government for removing Mr. McCarron from office without knowing the facts?  The Government, through the mouth of the President, have stated explicitly that they will not defend their position before this House.  If that be true of this particular decision, why is it not to be applied to every other decision in matters of all kinds?  How is Parliamentary Government to be maintained? How is the Dáil to discuss any matter which may come up for decision if the President, or the person responsible for Government action, can come to the House and say: &ldquo;We have decided that we will not allow it to be discussed.  We will not state the facts. If you do not like our decision put us out and do so without knowing the facts.  We have an answer but we do not choose to give it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In effect, that is what the President has told the House to-night.  It marks a new stage, an interesting stage, in the simplification of our institutions. It requires very little further, we can proceed but little further, before Parliamentary Government ceases to exist and, with the Seanad and the other institutions of the State, the Dáil will go and the country will be depending on an Executive Council and a docile Party, prepared to support the decision of the Executive without knowing what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that plain justice to Mr. McCarron requires that the House should approve of the setting up of the committee that is asked for to consider the facts of this case, or that at least there should be some defence made to this House of the action which has been taken.  As I understood the President's speech, he took up his attitude entirely on the position of Mr. McCarron as the secretary of the Department.  Are we to understand that the secretary of the Department stands in a wholly different position from any other highly-placed civil servant?  Are we to understand that other civil servants holding high office are not exposed to the same danger of arbitrary removal and dismissal?</P>
    <P>The President mentioned another case of removal from office&mdash;he used <Col N="121" /> that euphemism instead of the more unpleasant word &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; when he referred to the case of General O'Duffy.  Apparently the same rule applies to the commissioner, the head of the Guards.  No doubt a case may arise in the future when it will be applied to some other civil servant. It may be applied, I would imagine, to any civil servant, high or low, and the position the House is faced with is that the President is prepared to come here and say &ldquo;We have removed that man.  We recognise his ability and his years of service, but he holds office at our pleasure.  He will not get any explanation; we will give none to him or to the House.&rdquo;  That is the attitude that has been taken up.</P>
    <P>The President said that Mr. McCarron got a certain opportunity&mdash;his words were &ldquo;an opportunity of sending a memorandum to the Executive Council.&rdquo;  As I understand the chronólogy of the matter, such opportunity as was given was later in date than his removal from the office.  He was removed from office first and it is stated he was then given an opportunity of sending a memorandum.  I would like to ask the President or the Minister for Local Government, or anybody else who may have any knowledge of the facts, what is it suggested Mr. McCarron should have sent a memorandum about?  He got an opportunity, it is said, of defending himself. Why, he has never been charged. What is his memorandum to deal with?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; Mr. McCarron might say and did say, &ldquo;that I have lost the confidence of my Minister.&rdquo;  How is he to defend himself against that unless he is given some indication of the acts of which he has been guilty and which have caused him to forfeit that confidence?  He asks for that information and is told at some stage of the proceedings that a series of incidents of which he is well aware, culminating in the Portrane incident, have caused him to lose the confidence of the Minister.  It is said he got an opportunity of defending himself by sending in a memorandum about incidents of which it is alleged he was aware.  He replied forthwith, in effect, &ldquo;I know of no such incidents.&rdquo;  Is <Col N="122" /> it just, is it fair, that the Executive Council should say to any man, much less a highly-placed civil servant who has something like 40 years' service, &ldquo;There are certain incidents of which you are aware&rdquo; and, when he denies knowledge of any incidents, they refuse to indicate them?  Is it fair in such circumstances to come here and say that Mr. McCarron was given an opportunity of sending in a memorandum?</P>
    <P>With what would such a memorandum have dealt?  How could Mr. McCarron have dealt with charges which have never been formulated? Surely under the plainest justice the humblest citizen or the humblest civil servant has a right to know the charge that is being made against him.  This matter raises, as has been said, issues of much greater importance than the personal issue between the Executive Council or Minister and Mr. McCarron, though, goodness knows, that is serious enough so far as the individual is concerned.  But there is a much graver issue involved, and that is the position of the civil servants of the State, the permanent officials, who must, with changing Governments. continue to maintain and carry out the machinery of Government.  What has been Mr. McCarron's fate last month may be the fate of any civil servant, highly-placed or low, in the near future.  Are they to have any protection? Is this House satisfied with the position that the Executive Council, through its Minister, can dismiss a civil servant and can come to this House and refuse to allow that dismissal to be a subject even of discus&mdash; sion?  Because until the facts are known discussion is in any real sense impossible.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that we have inherited or taken over the British system under which civil servants hold office at the pleasure of the Executive Council.  That may or may not be a good principle.  It may be suitable to the organisation of such an immense body of men and women as the British civil service.  It may be suitable to a complicated State and to institutions such as the British Constitution, where you have not only the idea of <Col N="123" /> the Crown as the father of the people and the protector of the rights of the people, but where you have other bodies, such as the Lords of the Treasury under whose jurisdiction civil servants come and upon whom civil servants are dependent for their pension rights and dependent in other matters.  There are in the British Constitution conditions under which the British civil servants serve. There are these different bodies and a number of checks and balances which insure some protection against arbitrary action by the Executive.  In this country we have arrived at a point of simplification, where none of these checks and balances exist.  We have no independent Lords of the Treasury to deal with civil service pension rights.  We have no idea of the Crown standing there protecting the individual against injustice.  We have nothing but the arbitrary action of the Executive Council, responsible if you like to the Dáil, but maintaining the position that it is not bound to defend its position against the Dáil.  It may be that Mr. McCarron, like many of the older civil servants, is in a more favourable position than the civil servants of to-day and to-morrow. Mr. McCarron as a transferred pre-Treaty civil servant has the protection of Article 10 of the Treaty.  So far that Article at least has been maintained in full effect and efficiency and those civil servants who had pre-Treaty service and who are regarded as transferred officers have protection to that extent.  Until the Dáil shall see fit to deprive them of it they have this particular protection.  Mr. McCarron's fortunate situation so far as pension rights are concerned may be attributed to his pre-Treaty rights under Article 10.</P>
    <P>We are facing a situation in the future when civil servants will have no protection.  The position as presented by the President of the Executive Council to the Dáil to-day is that the civil servant high or low, whether he is the secretary of a Department, a junior executive officer or clerical officer, must submit to dismissal without the right of coming before any independent tribunal or arbitration <Col N="124" /> board or without the right even to have his position examined in this House.  He must go out in the dark. He has the right to a pension, if that seems good to the Executive Council, but without the offer of any other position.  That is the claim made here on behalf of the Civil Service, and it is as well that it should be realised that that is the position.  The matters involved in the speech delivered by the President here to-day raise that issue in its most definite form.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down seemed to be under the impression that in dealing with this instance of the removal of an officer in the Civil Service from the post which he had held, and in resisting this motion which has been put down by Deputy Costello, we were adopting an attitude which was a new and novel one in this House.  We are not responsible for formulating the governing condition in regard to the tenure of all officers in the public service.  That was formulated by my predecessor and adopted by the Dáil on the 26th April, 1924, when the following statutory regulation was made:&mdash;&ldquo;Civil servants other than those holding temporary appointments shall hold office under the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.&rdquo; There is no reference in that regulation to any appeal tribunal, to any process of investigation into the validity or invalidity, justifiability or unjustifiability of the removal or dismissal from office of any civil servant.  And yet, Sir, that principle has not, as I have said, been formulated by us; it was formulated by my predecessor and endorsed by the Dáil on the 26th April, 1924, and it is precisely under that tenure that the officer concerned in this motion and every other person in the public service has held his position since. Nor, Sir, is this the first time that a proposal has been made that the circumstances under which an officer was removed from his post should be investigated by the Dáil.  There was a similar proposal made in May of 1926.  The officer concerned in that instance did not hold a very responsible post in the Civil Service.  When <Col N="125" /> he was removed from his office he was not given a very substantial pension. He was dismissed without a pension, and that issue was raised in the House and was dealt with by the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, who presumably was advised in this matter by the then Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>And this is what Mr. O'Higgins said&mdash; the reference is Dáil Debates, Volume 15, column 160&mdash;in reply to the demand for an inquiry into the circumstances of the dismissal of that officer:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is a new tenure that is suggested for civil servants, public trial or pension.  We are not prepared to accept that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A little earlier than that, on the 25th July, 1934, a question was raised in the course of the debates upon the Estimate as to what was the proper body to determine the competence of a chief officer of a Department, and this principle was laid down by the then Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Johnson.  The reference is in Dáil Debates, Volume 8, columns 2213-2216. Mr. Johnson said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The question of the competence of the chief officer is not the kind of question that ought to be the subject of an inquiry by a committee of the Dáil.  I think if we got into that line of policy and procedure we would be relieving the Ministry of their responsibilities.  No committee of the Dáil can with any sense of responsibility undertake to judge of the competence of an officer acting under a Ministry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the same debate a member of the Government Party, Mr. McGarry, said this, and I presume he was speaking in accordance with the then policy of his Party:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Do not take me as saying that I want an inquiry into the competence of the officials for that is a matter for the Ministry and not for the Dáil. The official is not responsible to the Dáil but the Ministry is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The then President of the Executive Council, Deputy Cosgrave, in the course of the same debate, said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That line of thought&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>referring to this proposal for an inquiry <Col N="126" /> into the competence of certain officers</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;would lead us to a big field.  If every dissatisfied officer who wishes to make a statement in good faith does so, and I am sure a number could be made, then the Department in question is to be the subject of inquiry by reason of grievances being ventilated or allegations made here. I do not think I could subscribe to a policy of that sort.  I do not know that it would tend to the discipline of the Service:&mdash;</P>
    <P>And earlier still, on the 23rd November, 1923&mdash;the reference is Volume 5, columns 1222-1223&mdash;my predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Blythe, said, dealing with the position of officers of the Civil Service:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are other officials, just as important as the Civil Service Commissioners, who are removable at the pleasure of the Executive Council&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners, for instance.  The Revenue Commissioners discharge extremely responsible duties, and duties in which the Executive Council might be tempted to interfere far more than in the case of the Civil Service Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners are removable at pleasure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And, again, later on in the course of the debate, he said this, speaking of the person whom it was proposed to nominate as one of the Civil Service Commissioners:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Remember, that as Secretary to the Ministry of Education he is under the will and pleasure of the Executive Council and his services can be dispensed with at any time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did say, in that connection, that if his services should be so dispensed with we will yield to a proposal in the Dáil to set up a special committee to investigate the circumstances of his removal.  So that I think the House will agree with me that Deputy Lavery was entirely mistaken when he said that the attitude which we had taken up in regard to this proposal this evening was a step in the simplification of the institutions of the State, and was a step towards the ultimate abolition of the Dáil.  In fact, we are merely maintaining here the policy in regard to civil servants and <Col N="127" /> their tenure which was formally adopted by the Dáil in 1924, which was maintained by our predecessors, which we have maintained ever since, and which the general public outside has always understood that tenure to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is this, as I see it, and as the law stands: the head of a Department is more likely to be transferred from that post to another than any other officer in the Civil Service, because what is the position?  That under the Constitution all the powers of government and all the executive authority which derives from the people fall, by virtue of that Constitution, to be exercised by the Executive Council which this Dáil has established, and that Executive Council is responsible to you. You have given it that authority and imposed upon it that responsibility because you have that confidence in it. What is one of the first prerogatives that you give to the members of the Executive Council?  Under sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act it is laid down that the Executive Council shall, on the recommendation of the Minister for the Department concerned, appoint the principal officer of each of the State Departments.  It quite clearly implies that if the individual who holds that Ministry should cease to hold it and another person takes his place, the newcomer may make his own independent nomination to that position, the position not indeed as that of head of the Department but as principal officer only in the Department. According to the Act it is not the person who is commonly referred to as the secretary to the Department who is head of the Department.  It is the Minister who is the <i>de facto</i> and the <i>de jure</i> head of the Department, and the other is only a person whom he <Col N="128" /> appoints to act for him and is, consequently, a person who may, without any reflection upon that person's integrity or ability, be removed from that office if the Minister does not wish any longer to delegate to him the powers, functions and authority which the Minister, and the Minister alone, is responsible to this Dáil for exercising. Without the Minister's sanction and consent no principal officer in a Department, or secretary to a Department, can act in any way whatsoever.</P>
      <P>That is the statutory position.  Mr. McCarron is not the first officer to be removed from the secretaryship of a Department.  There have been others. In every case, they have been removed, not because they have been guilty of any dereliction of duty, not because they have been guilty of any disgraceful conduct, but simply because the Minister felt that he could not have confidence in them in regard to every particular and because he felt that so long as they were his principal agents the affairs of that Department would not be administered as he himself would administer them if he had time to attend to them all. That is the position in which a head of a Department stands to a Minister. He is the principal agent of the Minister. He is nothing else than the agent of the Minister, and yet we are told that the purpose of this motion is only to do simple justice&mdash;when, in fact, it seeks to coerce the Minister into placing his confidence where his own judgment and conscience tell him that confidence would be misplaced!</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the whole of the motion.  That is the purpose of it. What other purpose has it?  It is to intimidate the Government, and to intimidate the Minister.  What justification have we heard for putting down a motion of this sort on the Order Paper?  What justification has Deputy Costello, who moved the motion, offered in support of it?  I think there were three grounds put forward, so far, in the course of the debate. One of them was the manner in which the announcement was made. The President has told the Dáil <Col N="129" /> that the Government was not responsible for the broadcast report of Mr. McCarron's removal.  I gathered that it came in the ordinary way from the newspapers, that it was part of the ordinary news service which is supplied to the Broadcast Authorities, and that it was sent out by them on that basis merely as an ordinary news item.  Yet that was the first ground upon which Deputy Costello based his case for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is the first reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The second was the captions which appeared in the newspapers. Now, what responsibility have we for the captions which appear in the Press?  If a newspaper says that this or that person is sacked, are we to come to the Dáil and answer because the editor or the sub-editor, or whoever writes the headlines, is so tactless or, perhaps, so inaccurate as to put it in that way?  And yet, that is the second ground upon which this case has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third ground which was made by Deputy Dillon was that in England, before people who had been employed in the dockyard had been dismissed, there was first of all an inquiry by secret service agents. Does Deputy Dillon or Deputy Costello desire that before a Minister withdraws his confidence from a public servant, or before he feels that that officer's ability might be better employed in some other post than that which he at the moment holds, we should, out of the Secret Service Fund, retain sleuths and spies and detectives to follow that civil servant and to probe into all the transactions of his public and private life in order to satisfy ourselves that the Minister's confidence should be no longer placed in him?  We were told that even after this investigation in Great Britain, there was a further investigation which was conducted, I believe, by three higher officers of the Civil Service. What sort of condition of affairs does Deputy Dillon or Deputy Costello, or any sensible Deputy in this Assembly think would be brought about if, before a civil servant was removed from office, a State trial <Col N="130" /> should be held at which the judges would be three civil servants and at which the complainant would be the Minister who was responsible to the Dáil, and at which the evidence would be that of secret service agents whose names could not be divulged?  That, Sir, is the sort of inquiry which Deputy Dillon was holding up to us as a model method of dealing with a position of this sort.</P>
    <P>Is it not clear, even if the worst and most specific charges were to be made and considered, that it would be quite impossible for a tribunal of that sort to sit in judgment between a Minister and the principal officer of his Department? Or would this principal officer be satisfied with a sub-committee of Ministers?  Would not the same position arise?  Do you think that Ministers, who share collective responsibility with their colleague in this matter and who share responsibilities with each other in everything the Government does, whether in relation to the Civil Service or to other matters of public interest or public concern, could institute the sort of inquiry which Deputy Dillon has held out to us as the model way of dealing with a case of this sort?  How could they possibly constitute that Court of Inquiry? I think, however, that the most novel suggestion of all came from Deputy Lavery.  Now, the issue is really this: That a Minister, having accepted, or a Minister having nominated, if you like, the head of his Department for an unspecified term, there being nothing in that act to give permanent tenure, for there is no contract of service between the head of a Department and his Minister except this: that so long as the Minister is fully satisfied with the head of his Department, that Minister will continue to repose in that civil servant the confidence which is necessary if their joint relationship is to continue to exist.  That is the issue which has arisen here&mdash;whether a Minister who has once placed that confidence can withdraw it if he sees fit&mdash; if he, in his own judgment and according to his own lights, sees fit to do so. That is the issue which Deputy Lavery suggests should be tried by a committee set up by this Dáil.  I should <Col N="131" /> like to see Deputy Lavery or Deputy Costello formulate an indictment or formulate terms of reference, the essence of which was to try whether a civil servant had, justly or unjustly, lost the confidence of his Minister.  I should like to see the evidence which could be brought to enable us to formulate an answer Yes or No, in the affirmative or in the negative, to a charge of that sort.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the evidence which would be brought before any tribunal to enable that tribunal to decide whether the Minister was justified or not in showing lack of confidence in a public servant because remember the heads of Departments stand in two capacities in relation to a Minister.  They are there as his advisers.  It has been said in the course of this discussion that our action in regard to the principal officer of the Department of Local Government has been such, that it will inevitably engender in the Civil Service an atmosphere and an attitude of tame acquiescence in everything which a Minister proposes to do, that we shall replace our independent advisers by a team of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men.  That is not so.  I do not think there is any danger whatever of that.  Ministers, when they come to the Dáil with any proposals they have to submit to the House, are going to be subjected to the most searching criticism that can be advanced against them in public. In many cases their principal critics will be men who have themselves held office so that that criticism will be informed with an inner knowledge of the Departments concerned and of the problems with which these Departments deal.  They are not going to come to a decision in regard to any matter of policy until they have thoroughly thrashed it out in their own Departments.  The first thing any Minister, who values his position in the public life of this country, will say to his permanent principal officers is: &ldquo;I want you to criticise any proposal which I suggest.  I want you to criticise it and to investigate it as searchingly, as closely and as ruthlessly as possible because the objections and <Col N="132" /> the criticisms which you may make will be nothing to the criticisms with which I may possibly be faced when discussing it with others.  Therefore I want to know all the answers to these criticisms in advance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Accordingly I do not believe&mdash;because it is not the attitude of civil servants which really determines the decision in these matters; it is the attitude of the Ministers&mdash;that with the criticism which exists in the public life of this country, you will ever get Ministers who will try to silence the criticisms of civil servants in their offices.  But it is only in the offices of Ministers that civil servants have the right to criticise.  Outside them, they must carry out the decisions of their Ministers in regard to policy, irrespective of whether they, as individual civil servants or whether the Civil Service as a whole, disagree with those decisions.  The civil servant stands in his capacity as a competent adviser.  He also stands in another capacity.  The civil servant stands there as an administrator, bound to administer the Department in accordance with the policy laid down by the Minister, not in accordance with the criticisms which may have been urged against the Minister's policy here in the Dáil, not in accordance with the criticisms of some other unnamed entity outside the Dáil, and not in the way in which members of the Opposition want his Department administered.  The Civil Service is there to administer honestly in accordance with the Minister's policy because it is the policy of the majority of the Dáil and is the policy of the majority of the people of the country at the present moment.</P>

There was a phrase which was used in the correspondence which has taken place with Mr. McCarron to which Deputy Costello adverted, to which he referred at great length and with a great deal more heat than even I am accustomed to show when I have a bad case.

I do not by that mean to imply that we are following in every instance what we sometimes think were questionable precedents, but at any rate the first thing we have got to learn in this Dáil &mdash;at least some members of the Opposition have got publicly to accept it&mdash;is that every civil servant is in the <Col N="134" /> service to help and not to handicap, not to hinder Ministers in discharge of their responsibilities to the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to the point at which I stopped.  I laid down the general principle that civil servants are appointed to help and not to handicap or hinder Ministers.  They are, certainly, not appointed to put Ministers in a position of public embarrassment.  No civil servant is entitled of his own motion to put a Minister in a position in which he would have even the appearance of acting inconsistently with the policy which he has laid down.  Now, I do not intend to go into the details of this matter any further than they have been disclosed by Deputy Costello. Deputy Costello said that, in dealing with this Portrane question, a letter was submitted to Mr. McCarron which he felt, if it went out, would cause the Minister serious political embarrassment.</P>
      <P>Let me make the matter quite clear. I believe that amongst other things which the head of a Department has to take into consideration when giving advice to his Minister is the political situation.  He is in quite a different position from that of other civil servants. He is in that position because he is supposed to have special qualities. One of these qualities is ability to gauge the effect of any action of the Minister upon public opinion.  It is because our predecessors felt that this quality was of particular importance, as we have likewise felt, and as universal experience elsewhere has shown it to be, that our statutes provide a Minister should have the right to choose his principal adviser and that the special position of the secretaryship and headship of a Department has been recognised in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get back again to the question of this letter.  What happened in this case, according to Deputy Costello's statement&mdash;and I am not going any further than his statement&mdash;I am, for the purpose of this debate, accepting that particular portion of Deputy Costello's statement as being correct. What does Deputy Costello say&mdash;that a letter came before the principal officer of the Minister for Local Government, the person who was concerned to look particularly and primarily to the interests of that Minister, <Col N="137" /> and that he saw that this letter was going to be a source of public embarrassment to him.  Surely, before he let that letter, or any other version of it, go out, it was his duty to go to his Minister and say: &ldquo;In view of the policy which you have laid down since you became head of this Department and in view of the policy which you have pursued in regard to the mental hospital appointments not merely in Galway but elsewhere, if this letter goes out, it will be read by the public as sanctioning an appointment to the new post of a resident medical superintendent in Dublin without reference to the Local Appointments Commission.  You have already compelled the Mental Hospital Committee in Galway and the Mental Hospital Committee in Longford-Westmeath to avail of the services of the Local Appointments Commission in relation to posts of the same nature.  Is it not clear that you will be attacked&mdash;possibly by ill-informed persons&mdash;if you allow what appears to be a promotion to the position of resident medical superintendent to be made in Dublin?&rdquo; That was the position.  That, to my mind, was essentially a case&mdash;I want to say this because I have a particular responsibility in this matter and I have already stated it in private &mdash;in which the head of the Department ought to have gone to his Minister and safeguarded him against even the appearance of inconsistency. He ought to have pointed out how this letter would possibly be interpreted and construed.  That was not what Mr. McCarron did, according to Deputy Costello.  According to Deputy Costello, Mr. McCarron contented himself with writing a note on the file pointing out to his own satisfaction but not, apparently, to the satisfaction of his Minister, the difference between the appointment which was going to be made in Portrane and the appointments which had already been made by the Local Appointments Commission in the case of Mullingar and Ballinasloe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The President told the Dáil that the appointment should have gone to the Appointments Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That leads to another point.  We are told that this was done because a certain person and others formed the view&mdash;I am not going to say that the view was hastily formed or was formed <i>mala fide</i>; I am sure the view was honestly formed&mdash;that this was not a new appointment by way of promotion.  Our advice is that that is not, in fact, the position.  We have had the best legal opinion available to us in regard to this matter.  We have been advised that, in fact, it was not merely a promotion but a wholly new appointment.  What position would the Minister for Local Government&mdash; who, according to Deputy Costello, in order honestly and consistently to follow up the policy that so far has been and will be henceforth in force in regard to local services, that is, that appointments would be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners&mdash;be in to withstand the demand and the request of his own friends, and not merely the request of his own friends but of those who are political opponents&mdash;because in regard to Galway and Ballinasloe there was an unanimous demand on the part of everyone on the committee, no matter what their complexion&mdash;for the promotion of a certain officer?  The Minister who had resisted that demand in every case was now faced with this position, that if challenged in the Dáil in regard to this appointment he would not be able to deny that he had been advised when he took legal advice on the matter; that he had been advised that this was both a new appointment and a promotion.  Yet the officer who ought to have foreseen that that was the probable outcome of the letter which was being sent out to Portrane, the officer who was supposed to act for the Minister, and for whose actions the Minister was to take responsibility, did not feel enough concerned about the matter to go to the Minister, though he was aware of the difficulties created by these appointments in Ballinasloe and Galway, and call his attention to the difficulties which were likely to arise.  Deputy Costello said that.  I am not taking any other words <Col N="139" /> except Deputy Costello's, that the officer who was aware of all the difficulties previously created for the Minister did not think it worth his while to seek the Minister's personal sanction for what he was going to do in his name in an important matter of this sort.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged also that the Minister for Local Government did not express to the head of his Department his concern at what had been done in his name.  The allegation has been made here that this thing was done hurriedly, that it was done without consideration, that it was done without any notification whatever to Mr. McCarron. I am not in a position personally to vouch for what took place between the Minister and the head of the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Mr. McCarron, at any rate, presented the Minister with a long memorandum, justifying his action in sending out that letter.  The memorandum was considered by the Minister for Local Government, and having considered it in the light of his discussion with Mr. McCarron, he felt it to be his duty to come to the Executive Council and to say, because of this incident&mdash;and other things that were not raised in this debate&mdash;though and in my view this is of sufficient importance&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot allow Mr. McCarron to administer the affairs of the Department of Local Government any longer in my name.&rdquo; After prolonged discussion and consideration&mdash;because there was no hasty decision in this matter&mdash;the Minister for Local Government felt that he could go back to Mr. McCarron and say, more by way of preparatory statement than anything else, that his removal from office had been decided upon.  But he was not, at that stage, removed from office.  Mr. McCarron asked if he could submit a memorandum to the Executive Council.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Unemployment Assistance Acts&mdash;Motion</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the wholly inadequate rates of benefit originally provided for unemployed persons under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and to the fact that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially, this House requests the Executive Council to introduce proposals for amending the Unemployment Assistance Acts, 1933 and 1935, with a view to providing from State Funds adequate maintenance for all <Col N="145" /> persons unable to obtain remunerative employment.&mdash;(Deputies Norton, Corish, Davin and Keyes.)</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is, to my mind, one that should be dealt with very seriously by every member of this House.  Anyone who has taken the pains or had the interest to try to find out what is going on in the country with regard to unemployment must be horrified at the present state of affairs.  From Government Ministers and Government Deputies we hear wonderful stories of all that has been done to help the unemployed in the time during which they have been in office, and often there have been hurled against this side of the House accusations of all sorts of things that we neglected or never tried to do.  But to my mind it is of very little importance to discuss what one side of the House did or what the other side of the House did not do. What we really want to face up to is the present position of the country, and, in trying to find out what is the position, one comes up against every possible obstacle.  I had the other day a pamphlet issued by the Ministery of Industry and Commerce on this whole question of unemployment.  While trying to take a perfectly fair view of this document it seemed to me that the whole essence of the document was to try to prove that there was less unemployment, but there was no facing up to the fact of the unemployment that existed.  Wherever one goes, one sees that there is unemployment, and a very grave amount of unemployment, in this country at the present time. One hears a tremendous lot at various times about Communism and all that sort of thing.  To my mind, there is only one way to get rid of Communism or prevent the start of Communism in this country, and that is by providing work for those who are willing and able to work.  I hold no brief for those who do not want to work; I am speaking for those who are able and willing to work.  Unfortunately, there are also people who are willing to work but are not able to work, and they should be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I was requested to go to Bray and attend a meeting of the <Col N="146" /> unemployed in the Town Hall.  I went to that meeting and on my way from my home to Bray, a distance of about 50 miles, I had a considerable time to think over what I was going to say at the meeting.  I could not help being struck by one very outstanding fact and that was that what it actually cost me to go from my home to Bray and back again would have been of more benefit if I could have given it to some unemployed person than my actually going to the meeting.  That was the feeling I had.  What could I do at a meeting of that kind?  Of course I could speak&mdash;that is what they asked me to go for&mdash;but what help could I give them by speaking?  That was not going to feed them or put clothes on their backs, and that is what worried me.  The march from Bray to Rathdrum was previous to this meeting.</P>
    <P>I have heard all sorts of stories about those people.  Some said they were Communists; others said they were riff-raff, and so on.  I studied the men who attended that meeting; I studied them very carefully and I was very impressed by the type of person I saw there.  I was very much more impressed later on when I heard some of those persons speaking.  I should like to mention one of the remarks I made at that meeting.  To be quite candid, I made the remark with a great deal of trepidation; I did not know how it was going to be received.  I said to myself &ldquo;If you are going to do any good, speak out what you think.&rdquo;  The remark I made at the meeting was &ldquo;I do not want to see you getting what they got in England by being out of work for a long time; I do not want to see you getting the dole mind.&rdquo;  One man in the audience said &ldquo;We are getting it already&rdquo; and later on when one of the unemployed got up to speak he said &ldquo;We have got the dole mind all right.&rdquo;  The whole tenor of the speeches made by those men at that meeting was &ldquo;We do not want charity; we do not want doles; we want work for those who are able to do it, but for those who cannot work, and if there is no work coming, we want decent maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> I am very sorry that Deputy Moore is not here to-night.  Whenever I quote anybody I always like to see him in front of me, if possible.  Anyhow, in the <i>Wicklow People</i> of Saturday, January 30th last, Deputy Moore is reported as having said &ldquo;The non-payment of annuities resulting in the loss to the county council of £40,000 affected their rates and every service that benefited the working man.&rdquo; When I was speaking I never mentioned anything about land annuities, but I quite agree with Deputy Moore that a loss of £40,000 to the Wicklow County Council must affect the unemployed and possibly create more unemployed in County Wicklow.  Whose fault is it if there is a loss of £40,000? The members on the Government side say that the people responsible are those who will not pay their land annuities, and some of them go so far as to say that there was a campaign against paying land annuities.  I can only speak from my own knowledge and I will say that as regards the County Wicklow I never saw any campaign against the paying of land annuities.  All that the farmers there want is to be put into a position to be able to pay them.  Undoubtedly it has had a very bad effect on the question of employment in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Later in Deputy Moore's speech this remark was made: &ldquo;No one will deny that the Government had done much to provide decent homes for the working people, and they were urging the public bodies to do more.&rdquo;  Later on one of the unemployed spoke, and he alluded to the reference to housing. He was reported as follows: &ldquo;Speaking of the new houses, he said that they were such a disgrace that if Wolfe Tone could see these named after him in the biggest housing scheme of any provincial town, he would turn in his grave.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Local Government is not here now.  If my memory is not at fault, he was down for the opening of these houses, some 288 in number.  I cannot remember whether he had a golden key or not.  I think he has had a good many <Col N="148" /> golden keys.  However, he opened the houses, and when I listened to the description given to me at that meeting of the condition of these houses, I could hardly believe that what was said was true; I felt that it was an exaggeration and could not believe that new houses passed by the Local Government Department could be in such a condition, or that the remark I have just quoted could have been made about a new housing scheme of this kind.  I made up my mind that at the first opportunity I would go and have a look at the houses.</P>
    <P>On Monday I received a letter from the unemployed in Bray stating they had made a request to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to receive a deputation to hear their complaints and that this had been refused.  They had no alternative but to march from Bray to the Dáil for the opening to-day, to protest against the whole conditions under which they had to exist.  When I received this letter I thought to myself that the best thing I could do was to go down, see them and explain to them for a start off that they would not be allowed near the Dáil.  I did not want to see those unfortunate men coming up here on, probably, a wet day, getting drenched to the skin and then, perhaps, somebody making a remark or other and a row being started.  Then how were they to get back?  These were the matters that influenced me.  So I went down and had a talk over with them to see what could be done.  When I got down there I found that their leaders, together with Father Gleeson, had already managed to persuade them not to come.  That march to Dublin, to the Dáil, was put off, but the leaders and Father Gleeson had the greatest difficulty in persuading the men to give up the idea.</P>
    <P>These men are desperate.  They feel that unless they can do something to draw attention to their conditions there is no hope for them.  I knew that there had been terrible privations in that march to Rathdrum, and I knew it was going to be no holiday, their march here, not to speak of their march back again.  I was very glad to <Col N="149" /> hear that they were not coming.  It showed the good sense of their leaders. As I say, Father Gleeson told me that the leaders had the greatest difficulty in persuading them not to march to Dublin.  I am very sorry that Deputy Everett is not here this evening, because shortly after I arrived in Bray he arrived on exactly the same mission. If he were here he would bear out what I am saying.  A great deal of credit is due to those men for not coming.</P>
    <P>After we discussed the matter for some time I said to the men: &ldquo;I am down here now and I would like to have a look at these Wolfe Tone houses.&rdquo;  I said I would come along with them and have a look at the houses, and they said &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  It was a very bad night.  It was a considerable distance to the houses, but off we started.  They had no coats or hats, but they cared nothing for that. They went out in that rain.  They did not mind it a bit so long as they could get me to see for myself the condition of the settlement.  I went along and went into any number of these houses. I went into some in the middle of the rows and into houses at the end of the rows, and the latter were really the worst.  When I came to look at the houses I found that what was being said about them was nothing to what I saw.  I saw the beds pulled out into the middle of the room and children sleeping in those beds in order to keep them clear of the wet that was falling on these beds in the position where they had first been.  The walls were saturated in wet, and if ever I saw a breeding ground of consumption I saw it in that great big settlement, that Wolfe Tone settlement in Bray.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, surely in considering this motion we are considering providing from State funds adequate maintenance for these people and their families.  The maintenance of these homes falls on the unemployed people, and out of the unemployment assistance they get they have to maintain these houses, and I submit, particularly in view of the fact that every single item for the maintenance of these houses and for the maintenance of these families has been taxed that Deputy The O'Mahony is in order.</P>

      <P>What is under consideration is the wholly inadequate rates of benefits to be provided. The motion asks that the Unemployment Assistance Acts should be amended with a view to providing from State funds adequate maintenance for all persons unable to obtain remunerative employment.  I allowed Deputy The O'Mahony a good deal of latitude, but now I think really that he should address himself to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheOMahony" hpid="The O'Mahony The O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>The O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have overstepped the limits with regard to this debate I can only just repeat that what I saw last night would make anybody overstep the limits of the discussion. Anyhow, I have not overstated the facts.  If anything, I have understated them.  Now with regard to the inadequate rates of benefit provided for the unemployed persons, I want just to mention that when I was down there last night I saw 30 or 40 writs that had been issued by the urban council against the occupiers of the Wolfe Tone houses.  These writs were for non-payment of rent.  How is it possible that these people who are unemployed and who are barely able to keep themselves and their children alive on what they get, can pay rents as well?  The whole thing seems to me to be a complete and impossible task.  It is a task for the Dáil to solve and not for those unfortunate poor people.  I think it is time that this House really faced up to this whole question of unemployment.  I think up to now everything has very often been done to try to hide that question of unemployment.  That is probably because it is a most difficult question to solve.  Of course, before the present Government came into power we heard all sorts of things and all sorts of statements as to how they were to solve the problem.  The very moment they came into office the question of unemployment was to be solved straight away.  They told us they had a plan.  Facts are facts, and the position <Col N="152" /> with regard to unemployment is getting worse.</P>
      <P>We talk about the prosperity of this country.  We hear it said what a wonderful country this is going to be.  As to that, a good deal will depend on how we deal with this question of the unemployed.  If we can tackle that successfully then we will definitely have made progress.  If our Party were in power to-morrow it would be our task to try to find a solution for this unemployment problem.  At the moment, that is the job of the Government in power.  I doubt if there is one member of the House who, if he were asked, could say straight off what sum of money was spent last year on unemployment.  I do not think that even the Minister himself could give us the figure.  All the urban and county councils in the country are spending money on the relief of unemployment. Then there is the National Health Insurance and other classes of insurance.  If all the money paid out for the relief of unemployment under those various heads were totted up, the total would make Deputies gasp. I know it is very easy for me to get up and speak.  It is easy to spout forth words, but I did not get up to do that. I did get up to say that we have this terrible disease of unemployment facing the country, and that the country cannot go ahead until it is solved.  I am not scoffing at the Government for not solving it, but I am scoffing at them for having said that the problem was an easy one to solve and that they would find a solution for it.  I would be happy indeed if I could help them towards solving it.  If I had a solution for it I would be only too glad to give it to the Government.  The problem is a gigantic one and is not going to be solved in five minutes or in one year.  What I do believe is required is the goodwill of every member of the House to join together and see if they can find some solution for this terrible disease which, unless it is cured, will destroy the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one or two remarks on this motion which draws attention to the wholly inadequate rates of benefit originally provided for unemployed <Col N="153" /> persons and points out that the situation has been worsened by reason of the fact that during the last two years the retail prices of commodities normally used in working-class homes have been raised substantially.  The motion suggests that there should be an amendment of the Unemployment Assistance Acts with a view to making the situation more satisfactory for those people who have to maintain themselves and their families and who are dependent upon such State assistance as they can get under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  One of the things that I suggest ought to be done is that those who are at present getting unemployment assistance should not be liable, as they are to-day, to pay income tax, as it were, on the amount of unemployment assistance that they get.  Those people are having income tax taken off them every time that they make a purchase across the counter of the ordinary necessaries of life.  The tax-gatherer dips his hand in and takes money from them that in reality is income tax.  The Minister is well aware that, when his Party came into office first, he and his fellow-Ministers went throughout the country claiming that the additional taxation to be imposed was required to maintain the increased services that were being brought about and to maintain the uneconomic war, would all fall on the shoulders of the rich.  The last two Budgets have taken every halfpenny of that taxation and put it on the shoulders of the poor.  There always has been the theory that taxation should not fall on a person whose income was below a particular level, the level necessary to maintain bare subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income-tax laws have recognised that principle.  They declare that a person with an income of £125 or £150 shall not be chargeable with income tax.  That is the law at present.  The Ministers of the present Government claim that they had given substantial concessions to the earners of small wages under the changes which they have made in the income-tax laws. But during the last three years they have completely set aside the principle that the first £125 or £150 of a man's <Col N="154" /> income shall not be taxed.  There is hardly a halfpenny spent on the ordinary necessaries of life for which that £125 or £150 is supposed to be reserved, that is not now subjected to a tax.  It is done in such a way as to put income tax at the rate of about 4/9 in the £ on every halfpenny of expenditure in the case of a working person.</P>
    <P>When an unemployed man gets a nominal 20/- from the Labour Exchange under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and proceeds to spend that on bread and butter, or if he can ever touch such a thing as bacon, or on the ordinary things that go to patch up the kind of house that Deputy The O'Mahony has been speaking of, every time that he puts 1/- across the counter to meet his needs either as regards food, clothing or maintenance, the tax-gatherer dips his hand in and says that he has to take income tax off that 1/-.  The direct subsidies that are being paid are, in fact, taxes. Originally, the subsidy for wheat was paid from the Central Fund, and the charge fell on income-tax payers.  Now the charge falls on every loaf of bread, on every half-stone of flour sold over the counter, as well as on the bacon, butter and other necessaries that the workman buys.  One of the reasons, therefore, why there should be an amendment of the scales originally laid down in the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933 is that by a deliberate plan of the Government these scales and payments have, since then, been subjected to income tax which amounts to 4/6 or 4/9 in the £.  It is only a small item, if you like, in the difficulty that exists and that this motion draws attention to.  The real difficulty that exists is that unemployment in this country is increasing in spite of the fact that people are flying from this country to Great Britain in bigger numbers than ever went in former years to the United States.  Emigration is bigger at the present time than it ever was since the setting up of this State.</P>

      <P>If he would get closer down to the type of person Deputy The O'Mahony speaks about and with the type of people who are trying to get in touch with the Minister for Defence in order to explain their difficulties, he would understand a lot more of the situation that exists and he and his colleagues would be better able to interpret their own figures.  The real thing, however, is the problem there and what is causing the problem, and that is the complete destruction of the agricultural resources of this country. Accordingly, there are very strong reasons why the Minister should go more deeply into the matter than, apparently, he has gone, and why he should examine what exactly the payments that are made under the Unemployment Assistance Act are worth to-day as compared with the time they were originally fixed, and perhaps he might tell us how long he thinks that even the present payments can be made by the unfortunate people who are concerned while the present policy is being pursued by his Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to congratulate Deputy The O'Mahony for the very reasoned and unimpassioned presentation he made of the case, and I think that anybody who lives in the country will recognise that there was not anything in the case as presented by him to which exception <Col N="157" /> could be taken.  To refer to one item alone, I think everybody will agree that it is quite clear, as he said, that the people of this country do not want doles but work.  To that, I think, everybody here will subscribe.</P>
      <P>In connection with the particular motion we are dealing with, however, the payments concerned are only applicable to persons who are willing and able to work.  That is the intention of the Act, and it is not intended to cover people who are incapable of working because of physical or other disabilities.  How that has worked out in practice is another matter, because it is notorious that plenty of people, in the misguided idea, when this Act first came along, that they would be better off under the State charity than under the local bodies, did come along and mark themselves down as eligible for State aid and were given qualification certificates, only to be struck off later by the Court of Referees, at the instigation of investigation officers, as not being genuinely seeking work, whereas the actual fact was that they could not get work.  I hold that that was a double fraud on the local authorities and on the individuals concerned themselves, because they were thrown back on to us then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the Courts of Referees do not decide these cases fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not my point.  What I am suggesting is that qualification certificates were given to people who obviously were not able to work, and these people had not any reasonable chance of getting work, and I say that it was a double fraud on the local authorities and the individuals themselves, because we were contributing 1/6 in the £ on the assumption that these were able-bodied people.  They got the card and then, when it was found that they could not work, they came before the courts and were struck off, and then they came back to us again.  We were paying the 1/6 and keeping them from starving as well.  Dealing with the question of the motion and the inadequacy of the present rates, I do not think that the Government, at the time of the passing of the Act, themselves held that the <Col N="158" /> rates were adequate at the time.  In fact, it is my recollection that they stated at the time that they considered the rates inadequate and that they were only to be for the relief of temporary periods of unemployment between one period of employment and another.  Various rates were fixed at the time to suit the various conditions of eligibility, such as rates for married men and single men, as well as country and city rates.  Among the classes of persons to whom the rates of unemployment assistance were applicable were 6/- for a single man with no dependents in the country districts, £1 for a man with dependent wife and five or more other dependents in city districts, and 12/6 for a man with a similar number of dependents in the country districts, and so on.  Those were the figures at the time the Act was introduced, and there has already been considerable stress laid on the increase in the prices of practically all commodities since that time.  In view of that increase, one would think that anybody would concede that if the rates were not even adequate at that time, they surely would want to be revised now.  I am sure that nobody would contend that 12/6 would be enough at the present time to maintain a man and his wife and five children in the country districts, even if it were ever considered adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything to be said for the Department of Industry in this regard it is their vigilance in investigating the means at the disposal of the unfortunate applicants for unemployment assistance.  Sometimes I begin to think that the idea in the minds of the Department officials is that these unfortunate people can live on a different basis from individuals who cannot be so classed.  On a previous occasion I gave the case of a young man who was disqualified from receiving assistance because it was held that his means precluded him from receiving it.  I quoted the case of this man's case having failed to get any satisfaction in Dublin Castle, and I then brought it to the Minister's notice, but that man is in the same position to-day.  His father and himself and three sisters are living in <Col N="159" /> Limerick in a slum as bad as any of those that got publicity in the <i>Irish Press</i> some time ago, or worse if anything. This man was unable to get work, and he wanted the unemployment assistance, because, as he said, he felt mean because he was eating his sister's food.  Yet he was disqualified because 4/- or 5/- a week were coming in.  He considered that he was very harshly treated and he appealed, and they told him that he had 10/- a week coming in, and hence he got nothing.  He is struck off under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  He has written personally to the Minister. That is just one of the cases showing the way they arrive at the means of these people, and I want to say that where there is 12/6 or £1 it can be definitely taken that there are no other hidden means, because that is thoroughly looked after by the investigation officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>Figures have been quoted by Deputy Norton as to what British medical authorities think is the minimum necessary for the provision of food for an adult or an adult with a family.  Figures have also been quoted of what amounts are provided by public institutions such as prisons, mental hospitals, and so on.  Figures have been given as to the amount necessary to provide goods and provisions for a soldier, and it must be remembered that these goods and provisions are bought in better conditions than any unemployed person could buy them.  If the Minister would only himself calmly consider, without any pressure from these benches, how the figures he is paying to an unemployed man and his family square with the cost of maintenance of an individual in these institutions, it would be readily apparent that, apart from rent costs and other expenses, they are not getting sufficient to purchase food alone.  There are other necessaries of life besides food, and it would be clearly shown to the Minister's satisfaction, if he would look into the figures, that these people are getting, allowing for these other expenses, a <Col N="160" /> sum that is totally inadequate to provide themselves with food.</P>
    <P>I have a case in mind of a man who had a distinguished record in the I.R.A.  He is paying a rent of 5/6 per week.  He is rather lucky in that respect, because he has been transferred to one of our uneconomic houses, the rents of which have been subsidised.  Yet he has to pay 5/6 per week for his house.  He has a wife and five children, and the maximum amount he receives is £1 per week. Out of that he must pay 5/6 to the rent collector, leaving him with 14/6 to maintain seven persons for seven days. There are even worse cases than that, because there are people with larger families.  Viewing the matter perfectly dispassionately, I would urge the Minister to consider calmly whether or not he thinks a sufficient allowance is being given to the unemployed to maintain them in ordinary health while they cannot get employment.</P>
    <P>If it were merely a question of giving them some allowance while they were passing from one job to another, say for a period of a couple of weeks, one would naturally conclude that if there was any thriftiness on their part they would be able to husband a few shillings which, with unemployment assistance, would tide them over the rainy day, but that is not the position. You are dealing here with long-drawn out, protracted periods of unemployment when these men can get no work whatsoever.  Even when they do get work on relief schemes in the country districts, the new rates are so miserably low that they are not likely to make any saving out of their wages.  They are getting 16/- per week, that is four days at 4/-.  Then when a man has broken time during spells of wet weather, such as we have experienced recently, he will not save very much while working on relief schemes.</P>
    <P>The pernicious headline as regards wages set by the authorities on these schemes is being followed by private employers and there is no hope that a man will be able during the time he is working to save sufficient to enable him to carry on, with the allowance at present given him under the <Col N="161" /> Unemployment Assistance Act, during periods of unemployment.  I think if the Minister would calmly consider this matter it would not be necessary for hunger-marchers to come to the gates of Leinster House or to go to the various boards to present their cases.  The representations of Deputies coming from various parts of the country would be quite sufficient.  I am quite sure Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches have no different experience in this respect from Deputies on the Opposition or Labour Benches because the same story will be unfolded in any part of the country.  I suggest to the Minister that it is a matter of absolute and dire necessity, until that happier time arives when we can provide employment for all our people, that we should give them an allowance adequate to their needs.  If we are providing them with unemployment assistance we ought to mean what we say.  We may talk about the menace of communism and of other &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; but there is only one way to curb the development of Communistic tendencies and that is to provide our people with either work or maintenance. Luckily there is very little Communism in this country, and I think it is a tribute to the spirit of these poor people that they are bearing their privations with so much patience.  No section of the community should be allowed to grouse against the making of adequate provision to enable that unfortunate section of the people who are unemployed to keep body and soul together until we can provide sufficient work for them.  The Minister maintained in reply to Deputy Mulcahy that unemployment had been reduced.  If that is so, it is all the more reason for increasing the amount of unemployment assistance, because you have a smaller number to provide for.  Again, if you have more people in employment, the Unemployment Assistance Fund will benefit from increased contributions. The fact that you have a lesser number of unemployed to deal with, and a larger fund at your disposal, is an argument for increasing the amount of assistance which you allow to those who are unfortunate <Col N="162" /> enough to remain unemployed at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was glad to hear the kindly and sympathetic statement that has been made by Deputy The O'Mahony.  I am very glad that he has recognised what many of us have known for a very long time, that the overwhelming majority of our unemployed people want employment rather than help in any other form. We have been accustomed, more especially in recent years, to hear the usual cheap sneers about wasters and idlers and people who want to live eternally on the dole, accompanied by the not very Christian observations about free beef and free milk.  In face of that, it is refreshing to hear a statement such as we have listened to this evening.  I am sure that contributions of that kind in this House would do a good deal to set a good example in the matter of utterances and observations when dealing with the misery of the people who are unemployed in this country.  When the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced, it was introduced in response to a general acceptance in this House of the principle of work or maintenance, and I hope I shall be able to show in a short time, though I shall have to cover ground that has already been covered in this debate, that neither one principle nor the other has been honoured in any subsequent action that has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the rates of benefit provided under the Act are entirely inadequate.  When one thinks of an allowance of 12/6 in the rural areas for seven persons&mdash;a man, his wife and five children&mdash;there is no need to stress that point.  The truth and accuracy of the statement are obvious.  The fact that no provision is made for a larger number of dependents than five, if a family is larger than the number provided for at the generous figure of 1/- per child under the Act, is worthy of some comment. I think it is unworthy of any Christian State that there should not be provision made for each dependent member of the family, no matter how large the family may be.  I think it is unfortunate in this particular connection that hardships should be imposed <Col N="163" /> on the unemployed people.  On the other hand, where there are dependent children of people who pay income tax, so far as I know there are certain allowances made in respect to the dependent children.</P>
    <P>I believe the allowances in such cases cover all members of the family.  In the case of unemployed people, I submit that, if the family number more than five, provision should be made for them while, at the same time, I submit that the present provision for the others is miserably inadequate. Examination of the position reveals that the original provision has been reduced considerably in some cases and, in most cases, to some extent. Formerly, the first two shillings of the alleged means&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;were not calculated for the purpose of assessment in the means entered in the qualification certificate.  Later, in response to the desire of the Minister for Finance to make substantial savings on the Unemployment Assistance Vote, the means assessment was based on everything supposed to be possessed by the unemployed person over and above the first shilling, so that, in many cases, the maximum paid to a man, his wife and five children in a rural area is now fixed at 11/6 per week.  Taking my own area&mdash;West Cork&mdash;I find that the cost of maintaining a patient in the county hospital is 6/4.  If Deputies deduct 6/4 from 11/6, they will see how much has been allowed under this scheme for the remaining members of the family of an unemployed person. Perhaps it could be said that 6/4 represents the cost of treatment at a standard higher than would be necessary for people in normal health. Again, I can quote the figure for the maintenance of a patient in the county home in the same area.  The figure is 4/6¾.  That is the cost of maintaining an inmate in the county home.  That figure is based on the purchase in very large quantities of the commodities that go to sustain life. Large supplies are purchased in bulk through the operations of the Combined Purchasing Scheme of the Local Government Department.  This scheme enables the local authority to purchase <Col N="164" /> at a much smaller price than an ordinary person, buying small quantities in the local shops, would pay. With such facilities for purchase, 4/6¾ is the figure arrived at as the cost of one individual.  One can see how utterly impossible it is to support a family on the figure allowed to the unemployed in the rural areas, even taking the maximum under the Act. I understand that this matter was brought to the personal knowledge of the President in Cork City, by members of the local working-class organisations, one and a half or two years ago.  While the President agreed that the amounts provided were inadequate, he indicated that there was trouble in providing more by reason of the difficulty in obtaining money for that purpose. I am reliably informed that, on the very same day, the President, at a later stage, speaking in the city, said there was plenty of money and unlimited resources to afford everybody a plentiful living in the country.  If that is so, it seems to me that the President had at hand an opportunity for immediate revision of the unhappy position of people who have to depend on the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>
    <P>There was a further inroad on the position of a large section of unemployed persons by the adoption of the Employment Period Order.  The Employment Period Order covers three classes of people&mdash;single men, widowers without dependents, and small holders the valuation of whose land does not exceed £4.  It seems to me that there was never any justification for the enactment of this Order except as a device for saving the payment of unemployment assistance. The employment which is supposed to be available during this period is entirely imaginary and fictitious so far as my knowledge&mdash;and it is fairly extensive&mdash;of rural areas in County Cork goes.  This Order cannot be defended, and it has had a very serious effect on the position of numbers of unemployed people who had to go to the local authority to be relieved immediately the operation of the Order was notified.</P>
    <P>Further, there have been grave complaints about the means assessment in <Col N="165" /> connection with claims for unemployment assistance.  I believe that a great many of these complaints are well founded.  I have had a fairly wide experience in dealing with complaints of the kind.  One finds it impossible to reconcile the assessment with the facts in a number of cases of which I have personal knowledge.  I think it is true in the country generally that the assessment in many cases bears no relation to the realities of the position. I have mentioned a certain worsening of what was really a poor and rather miserable scheme of unemployment assistance.  The claim is made in the motion that that position has been substantially worsened by the change in the prices of commodities necessary for the maintenance of families.  There is no doubt that that contention is true.  On August 25th, 1935, household flour was selling at 28/- or 29/- per sack.  The price is very much more to-day.  Under a recent regulation made by the Minister, the price of bread was fixed for rural areas at 10½d., when sold across the counter, and 11d. otherwise.  These are, I think, the prices applicable in that portion of the rural area of which I have knowledge.  In that commodity alone, there has been a substantial increase.  I think that it is also true that the price of tea, sugar, milk, butter, coal and other things has increased.  In that way alone, the position of the unemployed person has considerably worsened.  I read in some publication&mdash;whether the trade journal or a newspaper, I do not know &mdash;that 31,000 persons were put into employment on public works.  Is not that somewhat misleading?  To a person who did not know the facts, it would seem as if those 31,000 persons were in fairly continuous employment.</P>
    <P>I would not complain if the period of employment was any way reasonable, but the position is that the maximum period of employment for the bulk of these people is four days, for others only three days, for a very considerable number two days, and for some, one day.  If that position was made clear, I suggest it would militate against the happy picture that was drawn of 31,000 people being put into <Col N="166" /> employment.  I consider the position caused by the rotation of labour as it affects people in receipt of unemployment assistance, is rapidly becoming a serious menace, and nothing short of a public scandal.  When these people go to work for three days they are unable to get unemployment assistance for some time afterwards, as their claim, as they term it, is broken.  When working for local authorities sometimes they cannot get wages for a month, and during that time they are unable for a considerable period to get unemployment assistance, so that their last stage is worse than the first.  I admit that the Minister is not responsible for that, but I think he should interest himself in the matter.  I suggest that the period of rotation on public work schemes should be at least a fortnight, or, if it had to be narrowed down, when a man is sent from the Labour Exchange, the least period he should be employed on public works should be one week.  Picture the position of people in receipt of unemployment assistance who were directed to report for work on such schemes during the last couple of months, and particularly during the last five or six weeks. There was hardly a week this year during which men could be continuously employed.  There were several days where they had to give up work after one hour, and their whole earnings in a month would not represent anything like a full week's wages.  Because of the weather conditions they had not an opportunity of getting the full measure of employment provided.  That position is extremely bad.  The Minister will recognise that on close examination.</P>
    <P>As to the rates paid to unemployed people, he will see that there is a pressing need for revising the whole arrangement and also in connection with the rotation of labour on public work schemes.  There was an example last week at a meeting of Cork County Council when he had an appeal on behalf of 40 men from Bandon area who were working at a stone-breaking job a month ago but got no wages up to last Thursday.  I brought that question to the notice of the House shortly before the Adjournment some months ago, so that the Department would <Col N="167" /> arrange in schemes of this kind for the weekly payment of wages.  County surveyors and officials of local authorities indicate difficulties about doing so, but if they were informed by the Ministry that no such difficulty should be allowed to stand in the way, I think an effort would be made to meet them, and, in that respect, I can promise the full co-operation of local authorities. People in receipt of unemployment assistance suffer other hardships, and not the least is the hardship created by complaints, very often unfounded, that are made against them.</P>
    <P>I had experience recently of the case of a man who was unemployed whose payment was suspended following a report that he had been engaged picking carrageen moss.  I understand that if he was picking carrageen moss every hour of the day for a fortnight he would not earn 10/-.  As a matter of fact, it was ascertained that the process of picking carrageen moss for a long period must have brought that man about 2/6, but because of the complaint his claim to unemployment assistance was suspended and a most prolonged inquisition took place.  It seems to me that when a local officer of the Department gets such a complaint, and when he has some knowledge of the district, he might easily know that it was impossible for any serious infringement of the Act to take place in such a case, even if the charge was well founded, because the opportunity was not there for any substantial earnings.</P>
    <P>Amongst other cases I remember one where the complaint was that a man had gone to work for a neighbouring farmer who was pressed for help to make hay during inclement weather. The farmer enlisted the voluntary services of the man for two hours one afternoon.  The matter was solemnly and seriously reported to the Department and after eight or nine months it was decided that the man should be prosecuted.  There was a prosecution but the case was very properly scouted out of court.  Nearly three months after that decision the man received unemployment assistance, but he had to hand over a very large proportion <Col N="168" /> of the amount to the home assistance officer who had given him relief during that period.  I appreciate the fact that it is impossible to deal with every individual case but I think cases such as I have mentioned should not occur. It seems to me that not alone is there a very strong case for raising substantially the rates of unemployment benefit, but there is also a case for seeing that in the administration of the Act a more humane and considerate system of inquiry is adopted.  The position is terribly serious as regards the rotation of labour.  I can assure the Minister that there is a very strong feeling amongst people who have had experience of the system and its revolting injustice.  Men are asked to go four and five miles to work on minor relief schemes.  In some cases I am reminded that the distance is longer.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Court of Referees in the West Cork area was that it was unreasonable to ask men to travel more than three miles to such work, and that decision was confirmed by the Department.  Many are not aware that such a decision was held to be correct by the Department.  In the meantime these unfortunate men continue to struggle to accept such offers of employment.  Something might be said for it if there was some reasonable period of employment in view, but, for the few days provided under the present arrangement, it seems to me to be an entirely unfair arrangement.  I feel that the justice of the claims made in the motion are perfectly obvious, and as the facts are all in its favour, no further arguments are needed to press it.  I think the Minister made a statement in a moment of extraordinary patriotic fervour, either in this House or outside it, in which he referred to some members of this Party who were pressing for public work to relieve unemployment, as political mendicants. I want to tell the Minister that someone is making mendicants of the unemployed people, and that the unemployed people are beginning bitterly to resent it, and while I do not think there is any purpose in talking about Communism and other things of the kind that are talked about so <Col N="169" /> glibly by many people at present, I think it is a very serious position. These unfortunate people who are unemployed ought to be guaranteed some reasonable prospect of work when public works are opened, and in the absence of such works, they ought to be guaranteed some reasonable measure of maintenance by this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day I put to the Minister for Defence a question which implied in the first place that it was impossible for men who belong to the Army reserve to get employment on any of the relief schemes being put into operation at present, and, secondly, that among the married men, because of the fact that they could not get work on these relief schemes, and, therefore, could not get work practically at all, there was a tendency to wish to get out of the Army reserve.  If they got out of it, they would be able to get work on relief schemes because their family conditions would qualify them for it.  I asked him if he would take steps to remove these grievances at once, and, with a view to his understanding the urgency of the matter, if he would receive a deputation from the Army reservists in the City of Dublin.  The Minister with regard to the deputation said he would not receive the deputation from the Army reservists, but that he was willing at all times to give sympathetic consideration to any representations that would be put forward by an individual reservist regarding his conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I think it would be good for the Minister to receive a number of Army reservists and to hear from them directly their conditions, I nevertheless appreciate his attitude in the matter, but when he says he is prepared to receive representations from individual reservists regarding their conditions of service, I would ask him if he would arrange that these representations could be made in person, <Col N="170" /> or to some officer appointed by him, perhaps connected with the Adjutant-General's Department, because personal contact is necessary to assure the men, particularly in the conditions in which they are at present, that there is a desire to assist them. Personal contact, I think, is also necessary in order to get carried across to the Minister the conditions of these men.  To ask the men to put down in writing individually a statement of their conditions is an unsatisfactory way of doing things.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is no machinery connected with the Army, or even associated outside with the Army, that acts in any way as soldiers' friend to ex-soldiers or people on the reserve, and it would be the beginning of a helpful connection if the Minister, in agreeing to take these representations, would take them through an officer attached to the Army.  I say that it is impossible for an Army reservist at present to get employment on relief works, and the Minister's reply is that it is not impossible for an Army reservist who is in receipt of unemployment assistance to secure employment on relief works. He adds, however, &ldquo;I am aware that in relation to this kind of employment, Army reservists are affected in the same way and to the same extent as other persons who have means by the operation of the rule under which preference in such employment is given to persons in receipt of higher rates of assistance over persons in receipt of lower rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When exchanging supplementary questions and answers to-day, statements were made that would suggest that the Army reservist stood as much chance of getting employment on relief works as the person who was in receipt of unemployment assistance to the extent, say, of £1.  I want the Minister to understand from me that the facts as I come up against them and as represented to me by reservists are that there is no chance of a reservist, who is allowed unemployment assistance of only 16/- a week, whatever be the size of his family, getting employment through the labour exchanges here in the city while there are people <Col N="171" /> drawing 17/-, 18/-, 19/- and £1.  If, as is implied here and as I think I understood from an interjection of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Army reservist drawing 16/- has as much right to get employment as the man drawing £1, it would be as well that that matter were clear, but I put to the Minister for his consideration and for his criticism and reply that so long as there is a man drawing £1 a week in the City of Dublin, or one drawing 19/-, 18/- or 17/-, no man who belongs to the Army reserve has any chance of being selected for whatever few days are available on relief work.</P>
    <P>The theory upon which that is based is that he has means.  What are the means of an Army reservist?  A class &ldquo;A&rdquo; man who is able to turn up and give his period of training in the summer, usually about June, gets, I think, £8, so that next June the class &ldquo;A&rdquo; man who serves his period of service will get £8 and, at the beginning of next December, he will get £4 12s.  Because of that, he is not able to-day to get employment on relief works.</P>
    <P>The matter is urgent.  A considerable amount of publicity has been given to the amount of money available for relief works throughout the country&mdash; something like £2,500,000.  A large scheme in connection with a new airport is being embarked on at Collinstown, and the position of the Army reservist in the City of Dublin is that under present circumstances he has no hope of getting a day's work up there. I do not want to exaggerate the position, but if the Army in any circumstances had to be extended and any substantial body of the citizens of this country taken into it, the Minister, in my opinion, would find that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve would be the backbone of that Army.  The smallness of the numbers of men in the Army at present prevents them, as I am sure the Minister is only too keenly conscious, from being trained in the way he or any other Minister responsible for the Army would wish.  In the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve he has experienced soldiers and, not only has he experienced soldiers, but a group of men dovetailing the <Col N="172" /> Army and an interest in the Army into the citizens as a whole.  If the present position with regard to the &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve is allowed to continue, the reservists generally cannot be a group of men disseminating through the people as a whole an interest in and a desire to co-operate with the Army and the military authorities.  Both on the ground that these men are in dire distress, some of them in view of the circumstances in which they are, and on the ground of their importance to the Army as an institution, and to the citizens as a whole, the matter is urgent and I would ask the Minister to leave nothing undone to face up to the problem straight away.  The Minister states in his answer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am having the whole question of the relation of those grants to the receipt of unemployment assistance examined with a view to seeing whether relief can be afforded, and in what form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He refers to the position by which an Army reservist not only loses a chance of work at the present time but loses 4/- every week from the beginning of the year off the payment that would ordinarily be made to him.  That loss is because of the fact that he may hope to look forward to £8 for service given in June, and £4 12s. next year. That is, under present circumstances, a great grievance and a source of great misery and distress to the men, but I found that the biggest grievance and the biggest distress that is brought to them is that the disability which is there put against them cuts them off from any chance of work.  If the reservists who are getting 16/- are entitled to work, I should like that to be made clear, but I should also like the Minister to understand that that is a very small point.  What about the reservists who are only getting 15/-, 14/- or 13/-?  That, as I say, is one of their difficulties, but work is what they want, and I state very definitely to the Minister that the experience of those men in the City of Dublin is that the fact that they are reservists stands between them and relief work.  Many of them are not able to get any other kind of work at the present time.</P>

      <P>As far as endeavouring to get rid of the grievances which reservists have in this matter is concerned, the Deputy is pushing an open door in urging me to do something to get their grievances rectified.  The difficulty of the whole matter in regard to reservists is that their bounty is treated as means.  If a man is getting a few shillings a week as reserve pay it brings his unemployment assistance down below what it would be if he were not in receipt of reserve pay.  The difficulty of the preference in employment is caused by the fact that the few shillings of a bounty which a reservist gets bring the unemployment assistance down below what he would get if he were not on the reserve, as preference on public works is given to men according to the amount of their unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but all unemployment assistance people are treated either as men who have means or as men who have no means and they are given unemployment assistance accordingly.  It would be a difficult matter of administration to give a reservist preference beyond other unemployed people simply because he is a reservist.  I am trying to go very much further than this narrow question of relief works; I am trying to get the whole grievances that reservists have over the country abolished. I admit that a man who is prepared to serve his country in arms, and who happens to be unemployed, is entitled to more from the State than an unemployed man who is not training every year and holding himself in readiness to serve his country in arms. I told the Deputy to-day&mdash;and all I can do to-night is to repeat it&mdash;that I am having the whole question examined with a view to seeing whether relief can be afforded, and in what form.  I took this matter up with the Minister for Industry and <Col N="174" /> Commerce a long time ago.  As a matter of fact, it was brought up first when an amendment to the Unemployment Assistance Acts was brought forward.  I am hoping that within a few weeks that matter will be cured. If we can succeed in getting the reserve pay not counted as means, the reservist who has no other means than his reserve pay will draw the maximum amount of unemployment assistance.  Therefore, according to his circumstances, he will be on the same footing as other unemployed people in regard to relief work.</P>

      <P>I would urge the Minister, if the principle is agreed at all, to realise the urgency of the matter, because there is real urgency. I should like further to ask the Minister whether he will give consideration to the possibility of allowing the reservists access to some officer of the Adjutant General's Department.  There are many matters that might be smoothed over if there were such access.</P>
