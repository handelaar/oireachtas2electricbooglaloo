      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the loss sustained by fishermen along the Erris coast in North Mayo owing to the tariff on salmon entering the British market, and, whether, having regard to the circumstances of the people concerned, he is prepared to consider the granting of a subsidy equal to the amount of the tariff.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any adverse conditions affecting in a particular way the area mentioned by the Deputy.  In any event the question of a bounty would have to be determined by reference to considerations affecting the industry in general.  I am not satisfied that the payment of export bounty in the case of salmon would be advantageous to the fishermen concerned and I am not, therefore, prepared to consider the granting of a bounty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to this Bill which is before the House, I wish to say that there appears to be a good deal of dissatisfaction down the country in connection with this question of the small curers.  Anything that will interfere with the small curers throughout the country will, to my mind, affect the pig-breeding industry to a great extent.  Most of those small curers in the industry began from the very foundation and built up a fairly good business, which is a great asset to themselves and more especially to the producers in the neighbourhood where they are operating.  Any interference with them would be a move in the wrong direction.  Anything that would tend towards giving over to the bigger factories anything in the way of a monopoly would have an adverse effect on the industry.  For some time <Col N="546" /> past there has been a good deal of dissatisfaction with the operations of the Pigs Marketing Board.  The prices fixed for the pigs in the factory and payable to the producer are not as high as they should be and the prices charged for the bacon to the consumer are very much higher than they should be.  I have some experience of the prices paid in the factory and the prices charged to the consumer.  The difference between the two prices is too considerable.  Any move the Minister makes should, I think, be in the direction of keeping down the price charged to the consumer and, at the same time, giving to the producer a price which pays somewhat more than the cost of production.  Pig breeding is always of a character which moves up and down. When there is a low price for three or four months, you have a falling off in young stock.  After that, you have a scarcity.  I do think that a better price could be paid to the producer and, at the same time, that the price to the consumer might not be as high as it is. Something could be done in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything that would tend to interfere with the small curers would be a bad thing.  These curers are giving a certain amount of employment and, at the same time, are taking pigs from farmers for which they are giving as good prices as some of the big factories and, at times, better prices.  In my opinion, as a director of one of the factories, a better price could be paid to the producer while the price to the consumer might not be as high as it is. The 12/- or 14/- deducted from the price of pigs to compensate for the bacon sent to the English market is taking a considerable amount out of the producer's pocket.  While you have a continuance of that sort of thing, you will have dissatisfaction amongst the curers and producers.  A resolution was passed in the factory with which I am associated 12 months ago asking that a better price be given to the producers. A lesser sum than that made by some of the factories would be sufficient to pay a fair amount of interest on the capital invested in these undertakings. A resolution was also passed in the factory I speak of that the price fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board <Col N="547" /> should be the minimum price and that the factories should be allowed to give a higher price than that if they so desired.  I do not know if there was any reply to these resolutions.  I did not hear any more about the matter. There has been a good deal of dissatisfaction about the whole business.  The factories must have done very well during the past 12 months.  Taking into account the cost of feeding stuffs and the cost of production, the price paid to the producer does not leave him any profit.  If anything is to be done, it should be done in the direction of getting better prices for the producer and, at the same time, allowing for the sale to the consumer at a fair price.  The Minister should not interfere with the small curers.  They are giving a great deal of employment and they are serving the community by taking pigs from the producers and supplying their customers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a curer in the constituency which I represent who employs about 25 hands and cures about 250 pigs per week.  This man is under the impression that he will be deprived of his business.  I should like to have some assurance from the Minister that this man's business will not be interfered with and that the workers will not be deprived of their livelihood and the factory prevented from rendering a useful service to the local community.  As Deputy Holohan pointed out, it is a great advantage to a village to have a factory because, when the people come in with their pigs, they spend a certain amount of money there.  This is the only industry in Hacketstown, and as it affords employment to 25 men, I ask the Minister to give an assurance that this man will be allowed to carry on his business and that the employment of his staff will not be interrupted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this measure, as I found the original Act, extremely complicated.  People down the country have the same experience. That is, perhaps, unavoidable, but it does not tend to allay a feeling of unrest and uneasiness in connection with this matter.  I am sorry that the <Col N="548" /> Minister does not appear to have information on some vital matters in connection with this Bill.  If he has that information, he did not take the House fully into his confidence on a number of points.  We have a clause in the Bill to obviate a certain abuse.  When the Minister was explaining that particular clause, he did not commit himself to the statement that the abuse actually existed.  He said the accusation had been made, and contented himself with that.  If legislation is proposed to deal with an alleged abuse there must be some solid foundation for the belief that the abuse exists.  I cannot believe that a Minister would seriously put before the House, particularly in an amending Bill, a clause to deal with an abuse if he had not made inquiries and found that that abuse actually existed, apart from mere speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House would have been in a much better position to discuss this whole matter if an answer had been given to the pertinent question put by Deputy Dillon on the last day on the question of prices and profits.  We had the statement made by the Minister, at the very close of Friday's debate, that he had no information as to what profits were being made by the big factories.  That information is absolutely vital when we are regulating a trade of this kind, but the Minister was unable to help the House in the slightest degree.  He said he had not the information.  I accept that, but I think it is very strange he has not information of that kind, seeing that the board and the various firms have been operating under the Principal Act for the last two years.  That information is vital to a proper and satisfactory discussion of this measure.  It is regrettable that the Minister is not in a position to give that information to the House, because very serious charges were made on the last day by people who know a great deal more about the business than I do regarding the extent of the profits.  If those charges be true, something more is required than is to be found in this Bill.  Nobody can go to the country without being struck with the dissatisfaction that exists amongst the producers, the ordinary farmers and the people in the small towns regarding the operation of the <Col N="549" /> Principal Act.  When an amendment is proposed, or when a new Act comes in, I think that dissatisfaction must be taken into account to see whether this Bill will do anything to remedy it.  I cannot see that it will.</P>
    <P>It may have been a mere coincidence of time, but Deputy Haslett pointed out on the last day that in his county, before the operation of the Act, there was a glut of pigs, but that now there is a scarcity in Monaghan.  Is that not what will inevitably result, if there is any tittle of foundation, and I am afraid there is a great deal of foundation for it, in the complaint that you hear practically all over the country, amongst the farmers and in the towns, namely, that pig producing has ceased to be profitable?  It may occasionally be profitable and just slightly over production costs may be got for the farmer, but that occurs not sufficiently often and the amount of the surplus is not sufficiently great to induce them to continue in pig production. They point out to me that the cost of feeding stuffs is such at the moment that they cannot possibly produce.  The Bill does not make any attempt to cope with a situation of that kind and yet, if we are considering the future of pig production here, surely it is a factor which is absolutely vital and which should have been dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the plaint&mdash;and this is very widespread, I can assure the Minister, and I am not now imputing anything more than ordinary commercial ability to any of the curers&mdash; that the farmer never knows what he is going to get for his pig until the pig has been slaughtered.  He is completely, he says, at the mercy of the curer and he does not know how the pig will be graded&mdash;whether it will be first grade, or so on, downwards&mdash; until the pig is dead.  He points out that that is rather too late for him to find out, whereas under the older system which these Acts replace, he at least knew what he was getting for the pig.  That creates in his mind something like that suspicion which did prevail, and for which the Minister has provided, in connection with the dummy buyers who are being sent around, that he is not even getting a <Col N="550" /> fair deal, apart altogether from the cost of production.</P>
    <P>There is the other factor which is of considerable importance and which has been brought before the attention of the Minister on several occasions&mdash; the destruction of the pig markets in the smaller towns.  I have heard complaints again and again all over my county in that respect and I see nothing in this Bill to remedy that; rather do I see that under this Bill there will be an intensification of the evil results that follow from that.  The Minister, I think, on one occasion, pointed out that, after all, if the farmer brought his pig a long distance into the market and got a better price, he would have more to spend in the local town.  That, of course, does not hold because he will not go into the local towns on the fair days because the fair days will not exist.  Pig fairs in many of these places have practically ceased to exist because pig buyers have to a large extent gone out of business as a result of the attempt to regulate the trade, and it is impossible to believe that either the consumers or the producers have benefited much by these attempts at regulation, one of which we are now dealing with.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there is nothing in the Bill to cause any anxiety to a Deputy like Deputy Everett, or anybody who is interested in the maintenance of the minor curers.  There is nothing in the Bill that absolutely wipes them out of existence.  That is perfectly true; but the Bill certainly, to put it at its lowest, envisages their disappearance from business.  It provides means that will quickly get them out of business.  It does not actually legislate them out of business, but it does provide means that will soon put an end to their business.  Undoubtedly they will be quickly gobbled up by the larger men, and how far that process will be continued between the larger people themselves, only the future can tell.  Undoubtedly, whatever the Minister may pretend to the contrary, there is a danger of monopolies being set up and gradually more and more concentration of this business.  As I say, the public, facing a situation of that kind, has not the necessary information to know <Col N="551" /> whether that is likely to be good or bad for the trade of the country, to know whether there is any foundation for the very serious charges by people who know about the matter, that enormous profits are being made, and that, whereas the public pays very high for bacon, the farmer gets a very low price for his pig.  Both the producer and the consumer suffer, and yet those who come in between are in a position to make very comfortable profits.  The Minister has neglected to get information on that point, and, therefore, is not in a position to put that information before the House.</P>
    <P>He pointed out the last day in his opening statement that undoubtedly one of the consequences of the wiping out of the minor curer would be that the pigs would be brought in, and, therefore, could be cured at less cost in the bigger centres.  That is obviously quite in keeping with the general line of the Bill.  The Bill does not need to legislate these minor curers out of existence, if it provides the means by which they will get out of existence.  Compensation certainly must be payable to them, but here it would look as if compensation will be paid to them at the expense of the public and not at the expense of the person who is buying the business. These monopolies will be fostered, so far as the wiping out of these tends towards centralisation, at the expense of the public.  How can it be prevented, taking human nature as it is? That undoubtedly will intensify the damage at present being done to the small towns, and remember that, even from the point of view of farming, these smaller towns are of considerable importance and they should not be so easily and so readily damaged as the Minister apparently wishes to damage them.  The people in those smaller towns are very often the people who help the farmers to keep on in troubled times, and, to a certain extent, the shopkeeper is a kind of banker to the farmer who does not charge the usual banking rate of interest.  They are apparently to be hit without any advertence to the fact that ultimately it will come back on the farmer himself.  Certainly the <Col N="552" /> immediate advantages to the farmer are not apparent.</P>
    <P>I have met many complaints in the country about the policy of the Government, but I have met universal complaint throughout the country so far as this is concerned.  It may be that the farmers do not know their business. They ask what can they do and say that this is a most complicated business.  They bring in their pig, and the first they are told about the grade of the pig is when it is killed.  Before that they are given no information and are in no position to know whether they will take it home or not.  They do not know the price.  That is how they put it to me, and I presume they are speaking from experience.  If that is playing into the hands of monopolies, as it seems to be, especially international monopolies, there is everything to be said against the Bill, and I think the House ought to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that this is a very complicated Bill and rather difficult to understand. We will probably only gather its full implications when it is going through the Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Sullivan, however, in respect of probably the most essential point of the Bill, did not help us to understand what his objection is.  He said, with regard to the position of the minor curers, that, while the Bill does not legislate them out of existence, it paved the way for their extinction, their absorption, or whatever it might be called, but he did not give us any description of how that is to come about.  He did not point to the clauses in the Bill that will have that effect, and I for one have not been enabled to see how that is to happen by any remarks that came from Deputy O'Sullivan.  It may be that I have not got the imagination necessary.  That is why I wish Deputy O'Sullivan had more or less sketched the evolution which he thinks will take place when the Bill passes, so that we can see the danger that he apprehends more vividly than we do at present.  If we could see that danger we would be entirely in sympathy, because I do not know of any Deputy who wants to see the minor curers abolished; who does not want <Col N="553" /> to see them established on a very permanent and secure basis.</P>
      <P>I have this conflicting fact to bear in mind&mdash;that the one or two minor curers with whom I happen to be in contact have no such apprehension with regard to this matter.  They are not at all alarmed, and in one case the curer is actually very perturbed by the absurd criticism that appeared in the papers recently following a meeting of the minor curers' organisation.  So far as I know, these minor curers have no difficulties at present in getting the full supply of pigs they require.  It is true that they have certain grievances; that they have not got the advantages the bigger curers have; that they must go out to the fairs to purchase their pigs, and have not the advantage of getting the exact grades the bigger curers have, whose supplies are chiefly brought directly to the factory.  Such grievances as they have are largely administrative.  It could hardly be expected that the Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board would have reached perfection in their administration in so short a time as two years.</P>
      <P>There is one very satisfactory feature in the Bill, in my opinion, and that is, that compensation is to be provided for the unregistered minor curers.  These unfortunate people were certainly threatened with a hard fate&mdash;that a business which had been, to a large extent, at all events, a livelihood to them, was definitely being legislated out of existence and there was no compensation proposed heretofore.  Now, at all events, they have the satisfaction of knowing that they have to be compensated for the loss of their business, and I am very glad that that provision has been inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the correct place to discuss the question as to whether the provision with regard to sending pigs to the factory, in case the producer is not satisfied that he is getting the correct price in the fair, is in Committee. At all events, it is an attempt to solve the difficulty.  Of course, it undoubtedly has been the case up to the present that producers have been victimised by an arrangement for fictitious prices on the part of certain factories.  One <Col N="554" /> statement frequently made when the Bill was being discussed on Friday last struck me as being in happy contrast with the gravity of the speeches, particularly the speech of Deputy Dillon, forecasting serious consequences from the passage of the Bill.  I mean the statement that, if the country was to be saved from a monopoly and the bad effects of a ring and so on, it must look to a revival and a re-establishment of the pig dealers.  Even the pig dealers themselves would be amused at that proposal, because their reputation, to say the least, is not that of being opposed to a ring.  They have been very frequently involved in rings and I claim that even they themselves would not pretend to such a reputation as that.  If the bulk of the producers are only offered that protection, I do not know that they will feel particularly happy; certainly that protection would not be a very sound reliance for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, had the great advantage when speaking on this Bill that he, apparently, had a great deal of inside information. In his excitement over the Bill I think that he did not make his vision of what is to happen when the Bill is passed entirely clear.  He was full of lurid prophecies as to the future of the bacon industry, as to the certainty of an unscrupulous monopoly, and so on; but I certainly did not find his statements or prophecies at all as convincing as would be necessary to induce me to vote against this Bill.  I do not see anything in this Bill that would increase the hold of Messrs. Henry Denny and Son or any other curer. I rather think, as a matter of fact, that, in so far as it gives increased protection for the minor curers, it will not be welcome to them.</P>
    <P>When the proposal to give power to purchase the registered minor curers is criticised, I ask Deputies to realise what the position would be if that provision were not there. We might have a minor curer unable to find the capital necessary to equip himself and provide all the qualifications necessary under the Bill for <Col N="555" /> complete registration, so that he would have to go out of existence and throw up a valuable business without any compensation.  Nobody would welcome such a proposal as that.  For those who claim to be friends of the minor curers, to criticise a proposal of that kind seems to me very difficult to understand. With regard to the point on which Deputy Dillon laid such tremendous emphasis&mdash;that the compensation is to be provided out of levies on the pig producers&mdash;I do not read that into the Bill.  I do not gather that that is what must happen.  So far as I can understand the Bill, the funds are to be provided by the Bacon Marketing Board by a direct levy on the bacon factories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly they would get it out of their profits.  To call that a levy from pig producers seems to me far-fetched.  The Bill is one which should be entitled to more serious and impartial consideration than has been given to it.  When Deputy O'Sullivan talks, for instance, about the dissatisfaction in the country over prices, which he says is general and widespread, I think he is going too far in his generalisation.  I confess that I have not heard that dissatisfaction expressed. On the contrary, I have heard the remark made many times that the prices for pigs last autumn were probably the best paid for ten years.  That is not necessarily conclusive that the profits made by the pig producers have been on a very high level.  But, at all events, it is not consistent with the allegation that prices have been unsatisfactory since the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board were established. The remarks I have heard made indicated satisfaction with the work of these boards&mdash;that they had already, in the short period of their existence, so arranged prices that, at the time of the year when prices are very rarely satisfactory, you had a very substantial increase in prices.  Indeed prices had exceeded prices paid for several years previously.  It seems to me that <Col N="556" /> Deputy Dillon has given a lead to his Party because of his personal contact with certain bacon producers and the experience thus gained.  The Deputy has allowed his emotion carry him away, and his Party have taken their cue from him in this particular instance.  What are the provisions of this Bill that are objected to?  I put that question to them.  This is a matter affecting important interests in the country, and I submit there should have been a clearer understanding as to the objections to the proposals. Before the Opposition commit themselves to the very serious step of voting against a Bill like this, a Bill that is necessary in very many ways&mdash; necessary because of several of its provisions&mdash;they should first be sure really that there is a case against it, and in the next place that the things that are necessary to be done can be done in some better manner.  They certainly have not made to my satisfaction a case against the Bill.  As an instance of the misunderstanding that may arise, Deputy Everett has just referred to the case of a curer who, he says, is anxious as to the provisions of the Bill.  Now I have a letter here from that curer to say that he is in no way anxious and that he has no sympathy with the criticisms made against the Bill.  From that it is clear that we should be on our guard against these statements.  There are people who find a difficulty in understanding this Bill, but these people, at the same time, are ready to jump to conclusions with regard to it.  Personally I think a very strong case has been made out for the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>To my mind this amending Bill does not improve the present position of the pig industry. When the original Bill was going through this House, I might remind the Minister that very serious opposition was raised to it.  The main purpose or reason of that opposition was that the Bill, in fact, provided more for the curers than for the producers. I think our experiences of the operation of the Act have borne out that contention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I said in this House that in substance and in fact the Bill was a curers' Bill. I repeat that now.  I said that while every effort was made to control prices in other matters, there was no provision made to ensure an economic price for the producer.  One of the amendments which was gone into most fully in the original debate was the amendment to make some provision for an economic price for the producer. That amendment was defeated. I remember&mdash;and I have looked up the Official Reports this morning&mdash;that when that amendment was being debated here the Minister himself intervened and he said that I said that he was protecting the curers. Perhaps I did say it.  I repeat now that he was in fact protecting the curers.  At the time I told the Minister that there was nothing in the Bill to say that the curer was getting an uneconomic price, and the retort was that there was nothing in the Bill to say that he was getting an economic price.  Deputy Dillon then asked: &ldquo;Did not the curers fix the price of bacon?&rdquo;  That is the rub.  They did fix it and they do fix it, and they ensure that they at least of all the people handling the pig from the day it is born to the day it is taken off the pan would be sure of a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anything I say I do not want to be in any way personal to any individual in the curing industry or to any curing company.  These people understand their own business and they <Col N="558" /> know how to take care of it.  I do not blame them for taking the best care they can of it.  The original Bill was purely and simply a curers' Bill, and this Bill is no improvement on that.  Practically all the machinery operating the original Act was in the hands of the curers.  They control the production, sales and everything else. They are an all-powerful body.  There was a provision in the original Act to eliminate gradually the minor curers. The minor curers were to be put out of business gradually.</P>
    <P>The only help this amendment of the Act gives in that matter is that we are going to hasten the day of the elimination; elimination is to come sooner than it was intended under the Principal Act.  The Act and this amending Bill are all in favour of the monopolies and when the eliminations are made the position of the monopolist will be all-powerful.  One definite result of the Bill&mdash;and in fact it is the only result of the Bill&mdash;is that the curers will gain and the producers lose.  The curers have made more profits since the operations commenced under the original Act than they did at any previous period, with the possible exception of the period of the War.  There is no question about that for it is practically admitted all round that the curers have made very definite profits and on a scale that they never made before.  The Minister tells us that the Prices Commission are going to inquire into the matter of profits. I expect they will.  But the Prices Commission when they inquire into the operations of the curers will operate in the same way as they did when they inquired into the prices of other commodities. First of all they will find out the price of the article, then the amount paid in wages and labour, and the profit for the curer.  The profits the curers make will have to be very big before there will be any question about it by the Prices Commission. That has been the general way in which these matters have been conducted. What we in this House and on these benches are arguing for is that there should be some attempt made to investigate agricultural profits.  In the original Bill we made an attempt to have some provision inserted so that <Col N="559" /> the producer would be ensured an economic price for his pig.  We were unsuccessful.  I would like to see in this particular connection the Price Commission investigating the profits that may be made; is there any commission going to be set up to investigate the position of the producer?</P>
    <P>It ought to be possible to have some commission set up to investigate all the circumstances of the pig producer and find out whether he is losing or gaining. If he is losing, some effort should be made to change the existing circumstances and put him in a position of making some profit.  This Bill does not do it.  When the original Act was passed the curers formed themselves into a sort of trust.  Whatever individual opposition they hitherto gave one another, it disappeared.  I know several firms who were at that time actively opposed in business and, the moment the Bill was passed, they shook hands and acted in common and so arranged matters that they were able to reap a golden harvest.  This Bill accentuated the position.  Whatever little opposition there was in the pig-curing industry, it is going to be eliminated by this Bill.  I do not say that that is definitely enshrined in the Bill, but you are certainly hastening the day when you will eliminate competition. You are advancing the day of the destruction of the minor curers. If there were a section in the Bill making certain the continuance of the operation of minor curers, I would willingly support it.  I would certainly not support anything that tends to eliminate the minor curers. Opposition is the life of trade; the more opposition we have for any trade, the better, and the more small curers we have competing against big curers the better for the country and for the producer.</P>
    <P>Who is going to pay compensation? The Minister is going to compensate those who are affected and I am in favour of compensating people driven out of business by Government action. If the Government acts as the driving out body, then the Government should compensate those who are driven out. I submit that the producer, the <Col N="560" /> farmer, should not be asked to compensate them.  If the minor curers are going to be compensated, their profits will be taken into account when arranging the compensation and it is here provided that directly or indirectly the farmer has to provide the compensation.  He will have to pay compensation on the assumption that the minor curers were still buying pigs.  The farmer will be paying the people who ordinarily would be taking his pigs and at the same time he will be enabling the larger curer, who has wiped out the smaller curer, to make a big profit.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why the minor curer should not be allowed to continue his business if he is prepared to take his chance.  I know there are some who desire to carry on the business that they have been carrying on for years.  As Deputy Moore said, the Committee Stage will possibly be the proper place to go into the Bill in detail.  I am as much opposed to this Bill as I was to the original Act.  I do not think it will help in the solution of the difficulties of the pig producers. I am rather in agreement with Deputy Dillon that this Bill will eventually lead to the nationalisation of the industry.  I see a danger of that.  I am as opposed to the nationalisation of industry as any Deputy could possibly be.  I hope we will never come to it in this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I think it is an unsound principle.  Business should be left to the business people and the less Government interference there is the better.  If the only solution is this, that you are going to have a private monopoly with powers such as the original Act and this Bill give them, then of the two evils I would prefer nationalisation to a monopoly that would be given such powers as have been given to the curers by legislation.  I believe the best interests of the country would be served by dropping both Bills and letting the pig industry find its own level.  We have discussed the manufacturing end.  The people who manufacture the farmers' products into the <Col N="561" /> finished article are being provided for. There was never a sound attempt made to provide a satisfactory price for the man who matters, the producer. Until there is something done in that direction, it is useless to be considering Bills which will not be any definite help to the farmer.  I expect we all will have something to say on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Moore, one would imagine that all the rumours which Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about in connection with this Bill were unfounded.  I read the report of a meeting of the Kilkenny Corporation last week, and a resolution was passed unanimously there protesting against the provisions of this Bill. They declared its effect would be to wipe out the minor curers.  I am sorry Deputy Pattison is not in the House. He associated himself very strongly with the resolution.  I do not presume to be a marvel at understanding legislation, but I could not help being astonished when I heard Deputy Moore and others on the Fianna Fáil Benches talking about how ridiculous it was to suggest that this Bill was going to have certain effects.  I believe that statements made by public bodies like the Kilkenny Corporation cannot be unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago we had Deputy Holohan speaking here.  He is a director of a big bacon factory, and he said that the amount of money taken by the bacon curers was more than reasonable. I think the Minister will not deny that. I remember very well when the Minister was piloting the Cattle Bill through the Dáil, he said the only thing the farmers could look for as regards a reasonable price was a certain amount of competition.  He meant competition between one buyer and another, and I agree with him that that is the only thing to ensure a good price when you present your cattle in a fair.  If there are several buyers the farmer has a good idea that he can get the market value for his animals because of the competition.  Statements have been made here about the people.  I do not believe that they are any worse than anybody else.  In connection with pigs, and indeed in <Col N="562" /> connection with other matters, I would like to see open competition, but this Bill or the original Act does not provide that.  We all know that, so far as the local pig fairs are concerned, at the present time they are practically nonexistent. We also know that farmers who rear pigs do not know what they are going to get for them when they have them ready for the market.  As I have said, I am not an expert on these matters.  I imagine that the Minister's idea in bringing forward this Bill is to try to secure that the price of bacon will bear some relation to the price which the farmer gets for his pig. I propose to read for the House a short quotation from an English farmers' paper.  It is headed &ldquo;A Shilling's Worth of Bacon.&rdquo;  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A shilling passed over the grocer's bacon counter to-day will, on the average, buy 13½ ounces of rasher bacon.  This is shown by figures produced by the research department of the Bacon Development Board from the Ministry of Labour cost-of-living returns.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is from last week's issue of the paper.  I wonder what housewife in this country could buy 13½ ounces of rashers for a shilling?  The price here to-day is 1/8, 1/9 or 1/6.  It should be the Minister's job to see that the price which the consumer here has to pay for bacon is more in keeping with what the producer gets for his pig.</P>
    <P>That is the whole grumble at the present time about the bacon and pig industry in this country.  The price that people are being compelled to pay for bacon bears no relation to what the producer gets for his pigs.  A very explicit statement will be required from the Minister on this Bill if he is to allay the fears that have been expressed by people in the country in connection with it.  The discrepancy at the present time between what the farmer or the producer gets for his pigs and what the consumer has to pay for bacon is altogether too big. The quotation which I have given from that English farmers' paper should set people thinking.  The <Col N="563" /> statements in it cannot be contradicted. The English people are able to buy rashers at practically a 1/- per lb., and it is to the English market that we are sending our bacon.  Our people here have to pay almost twice as much for a lb. of rashers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan was very slow to criticise the curers, and he made no constructive proposition so far as producers are concerned.  Therefore, his statements were not very helpful. Several Deputies on the opposite benches followed the same line.  They said that the present Act, as well as this amending Bill, were measures intended to benefit the curers.  In my opinion, the answer of the people in the country to that type of criticism is this&mdash;that prices have improved over a period.  Better and more uniform prices are now being paid for bacon than during any corresponding period when the Opposition were in office.  That is the answer that can be made to them in connection with this amending measure.  I suggest that some minor adjustments should be made in this amending Bill concerning the bacon factories in Kerry.  Our committee of agriculture asked the Minister some 12 months ago if it would be possible to have some independent inspections carried out on behalf of producers.  What they asked was that some inspector, nominated by the Department or by farmers and sanctioned by the Minister, would be engaged to supervise the checking of the weighing in the factory.  I make the same suggestion in connection with this Bill.  Another point put forward was that bacon which was bought by the curers as grade B from producers was sold by them to retailers as grade A bacon.  These are matters that, in my opinion, should easily lend themselves to adjustment.  It is important that the rate of profit as between the producers and the factory should be a fair one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of centralisation.  Deputy O'Sullivan's statement was to the effect that slowly <Col N="564" /> but surely the whole industry was being centralised.  In my opinion there is something in that.  The tendency at the moment is to have the trade concentrated in one important town in each county.  That is the case in the County Kerry.  Unless that tendency is checked, it is bound to have a detrimental effect on smaller towns, towns which in the past were important marketing centres in the pig industry.  What I would suggest to the Minister in connection with that is that under this amending Bill the payment of a minimum price should be provided for, allowing the curers to pay a greater price as the occasion demanded.  That would help to create competition all round and would help to make the system as perfect as possible.  I know that the Minister is doing his utmost to relieve a long-felt want.  Pig rings and other combines were effectively dealt with under the existing measure, but now, in order to make the position more up to date and more perfect, this amending Bill is brought in.  It will have the effect of bringing all areas into line with the general system.</P>

      <P>We had an unexpectedly long debate on this amending Bill.  When introducing it, I explained that there were seven or eight points in connection with which we wished to amend the existing legislation.  In my innocence I thought that the Opposition would take the same view of this legislation as they took of the 1935 measure, namely, that we should all combine to do the best we possibly could for the bacon industry.  At the time that the 1935 Bill was going through the Dáil a special committee was set up to examine it.  That committee, it is true, sat in private, but anybody who cares to look up the records will see that throughout the whole of the Committee Stage there was not a single Party vote taken.  It is true, of course, that there were several divisions on <Col N="565" /> points that were raised in committee, but in no instance during the whole progress of that Bill was there a Party vote taken.  One would imagine now, listening to the Party opposite, with, I admit, an eye on the electorate, that they did not approve of that measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I have, but I want to try to do something for the industry as well.  The Deputies opposite have made a number of political speeches on this measure addressed to dealers and others&mdash; people whom they let down, according to themselves, in 1935.  The point is that if those people were let down in that Bill, then the Opposition let them down as well as everybody else.  Now they are trying to go back on what they did in 1935, and are pretending to dealers and others in this country that they were their friends all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate, as I have said, has lasted a long time on this Bill.  The criticism of it from the Opposition Benches was of the most futile kind. Not a single clause from it was quoted in all the speeches made from the opposite side.  The Deputies opposite have tried to pretend that there are things in this Bill against producers, dealers and minor curers that are not there at all.  I take it for granted, of course, that quite a number of the Deputies opposite take their views of a Bill such as this from reports of meetings and interviews in the Press, and so on, and that they do not read the Bill itself. That seems to be their usual practice. It would seem as if they take their viewpoint from some meeting of the minor curers, from meetings of corporations, or from a newspaper interview.  I am quite sure, at least, that, if they had actually read the Bill, they would have been ashamed of most of the criticisms that were put forward. Most of these criticisms were absolutely futile, because there was not a single word in any of the criticisms that were put forward by the Opposition, that was applicable to this Bill.  Any criticisms that might have been applicable to this particular Bill could have been applied to the Act of 1935&mdash;an Act, which, I repeat, was agreed to by the <Col N="566" /> whole Dáil&mdash;by every Party in this House&mdash;and now, in order to retrieve their position, and in the hope that they may be able to help a class of people from whom they expect to get votes in the coming election, they pretend to be against that Bill.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions were made by various Deputies on the opposite side. Suggestions were made by Deputy Dillon, which were, I would say, as puerile as could come from any responsible Deputy&mdash;if one could use the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in connection with Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon started, in his usual way, by making a personal attack.  His suggestion was that I was being hoodwinked by the bacon curers. What did it matter whether or not I was being hoodwinked by the curers? If that were so, why did not Deputy Dillon get up and speak, in the way that other Deputies on the opposite side spoke, and point out what remedies there were?  At any rate, he kept telling us that he had a plan, and after keeping the House listening to the greatest futilities and <i>ráméis</i> for an hour or so, he came to his plan, and all his plan amounted to was the establishment of the live-pig industry in Donegal.  He evidently forgot, or was not aware of the fact, that, two or three years ago, we had tried to establish that industry.  I, myself, got the people concerned together, and they are quite willing to engage in it, and they went up to Donegal and got special terms to enable them to export the pigs that they got there; but, for one reason or another, the scheme broke down.  Therefore, Deputy Dillon's plan broke down&mdash;the plan that he is now speaking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon then talked about two classes of dealers in pigs.  He spoke of one as being a decent class of dealers, and others as being not so decent.  He said that there was one class of these people, who were decent, and who had been decent all their lives&mdash;good men in their own business, and men who should get support.  Well, we all have our own views about such things as that. There are decent men in that business, just as there are decent men in every other business; but in that business, as in every other business, there are <Col N="567" /> men who are not so decent.  I am afraid that the reason for all this speech-making in connection with this matter was let out by Deputy Coburn, who, evidently, could not keep his opinion to himself, when he said that the reason I am against the dealers is because they were followers of the Redmondite Party.  Well, all I can say is that that type of reasoning could be equally applied the other way; but surely it is not relevant to this discussion, considering that there is nothing in this Bill dealing with that particular matter except one clause, which, when we come to deal with it in the Committee Stage, will show how the members of the Party opposite stand. They will have to make up their mind as to how they will vote on that matter.  Either they will vote against the proposal to take the pigs direct from the producer, or not.  I rather suspect that, when it comes to a question, as between the dealers and the producers, the Party opposite will vote in favour of the producers, since they are by far the larger body.  I rather fancy that when it comes to the actual question of dealing with that matter, the members of the Party opposite will drop the dealers in favour of the producers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about his plan. Why did we bring in the original Bill in 1935?  I remember coming in here and pointing out to the House the fact that there were different prices being given at different fairs in the country, and I asked why there should be such a difference in price as between one fair and another in the country; and the whole House unanimously agreed with me in the proposal to remedy that matter.  Therefore, for Deputy Dillon, or any other Deputy, to suggest that we should go back to the old system of the live-pig market is, I suggest, only an attempt to hoodwink the people.  Of course, I know that a lot of the dealers are honest men.  In my younger days, I know that I had to stand and meet a lot of these dealers, and, undoubtedly, some of them were very honest men; but, on the other hand, some of them were not so honest, and I cannot agree <Col N="568" /> with Deputy Desmond when he says that the pig-dealer gave his last 1/- to the farmer for his pigs.  I am quite sure that he did not.  I remember the system of a man meeting one on the road and saying he would give so-and-so for your stock, and then another man meeting you further along the road and offering you a lesser price; and then in the end you sold your pigs to the dealers for what you could get from them.  You went home then and you found, when you read the papers, that you could have sold your pigs for a higher price in the next town.  Where was the question of the dealer giving the last 1/- he could afford there?  Why did we bring in the Bill of 1935?  Was it not to stop that sort of thing going on all over the country?  The very argument that was used to prove the necessity of the Act of 1935&mdash;an Act that was welcomed by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies on the opposite benches&mdash;is now being used against this particular Act.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the chief &ldquo;bogey&rdquo; here is this matter of the compensation clause.  I think it is rather unfair to take the attitude that has been taken by Deputies opposite. No matter what Deputy Dillon or other Deputies opposite say about this Bill being drafted by the large bacon curers, I say that, in connection with this Bill, I came to the conclusion that people who were being deprived of their business should be compensated, and I asked the officers of my Department to have that included in the Bill.  I say now&mdash;no matter what Deputy Dillon or any other Deputy says&mdash;that neither the Pigs Marketing Board nor the Bacon Marketing Board had anything to do with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know if Deputy Dillon accepts it.  At any rate, I think that everybody will agree that if, for any reason, we have to put people out of business, we should compensate them, wherever it is possible to do so; in some cases it is not possible.  Now, there are <Col N="569" /> three classes of people concerned here. First of all, there are the small curers who did not qualify for an ordinary licence or for a minor curer's licence. They went out of business on the 31st March last under the original Act, and there was nothing in the original Act to settle compensation, or no idea of compensation, for these people.  These people must get compensation if this clause goes through. There is a provision there, as I explained in introducing this motion, which lays down the basis on which compensation will be calculated.  It is laid down that the average profit of all factories during the term&mdash;1935 I think it is&mdash;will be taken and their profit will be assumed to be the same as the average profit of all factories. Compensation will be fixed taking that as the basis.  As I explained before, if any three men on a tribunal are asked to compensate any business man, and if these three men are told that his profits were 7 per cent., 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. over a period, that tribunal can fix what the compensation should be, because they can take ten, 12 or 15 years' purchase and assess compensation in that way. The clause will be operated in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second clause dealing with minor curers.  Deputies on the opposite side have made a number of speeches following on the ramp that has been raised by certain organisations and certain newspapers that we are going to drive these people out of business.  What is in this clause to suggest that we are going to drive them out of business?  I know, the officers of my Department know, and Deputies ought to know, that before a minor curer becomes a licensee, he must have his premises brought up to a certain standard under which he can slaughter pigs under hygienic conditions, and it is quite possible that there may be certain minor curers who cannot afford to do that.  If this particular compensation clause were not there, these minor curers would have to go out of business and could not be compensated in any way.  If any minor curer goes out of business voluntarily, because he cannot afford to <Col N="570" /> carry out these alterations in his factory, is it not only fair that he should be compensated because he has been driven out by legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall come to the method of compensation.  These licensees are grouped.  The factory that dealt with more than 2,200 cwts. during the year 1935 was entitled to get a licence in 1935.  Some of these factories had to make alterations under the 1935 Act before 1st April, 1937.  At least one of them was not prepared to make those alterations, whether through want of cash or not I do not know.  Is that particular factory to go out of business without compensation? If the members of the Opposition had their way&mdash;I admit, largely, through ignorance&mdash;there would be no compensation clause for these people and that particular factory would, by legislation, have to go out of business and get no compensation.  In that particular case, that man will be entitled to get compensation should he go out of business.  The clause goes further. It says that if any licensee goes out of business voluntarily, the Bacon Marketing Board may buy him out and distribute his quota amongst the others in the proportion in which they are getting quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon worked himself up into a state of high excitement and said that Henry Denny would buy out all these people under this clause, that he would merely go down and say to the small curer: &ldquo;Would you like to go out of business and take compensation?&rdquo;, that he would squeeze out that small curer and make him glad to take compensation until eventually Henry Denny would have the whole country in his own hands.  He worked himself up to a state of great excitement, as <Col N="571" /> I say, until Deputy Smith reminded him that the Minister had power to issue new licences.  He was badly punctured in that argument, and he then tried to make a retreat, and it was a very undignified retreat.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon hopes to be in my position after the next election.  I believe he is the expert on agriculture on the other side, but apparently he does not trust himself, should he succeed me, or he does not trust me or anybody who may be in my position after the election, to issue new licences, if he sees that sort of thing happening.  If the Minister sees the big groups buying out factories with the object of having a monopoly, is it not quite a simple thing for the Minister to issue licences to any group of people to set up a new factory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you where it comes from.  Deputies spent a great deal of Friday and a considerable time to-day alleging that it was the consumers and the producers who would pay, and their solution was that we should make the curers pay.  As I have said, they did not read the Bill. None of them appears to have read the Bill.  If they had read the Bill they would have seen that it was payable out of the Bacon Marketing Fund.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows enough law to be able to find out in <Col N="573" /> the Act where it comes from.  He will find that in Section III of the original Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, then. It comes from the curers and the Bacon Marketing Board have no power to levy from the producer or anybody else except from the curers. Here we find it is provided in the Bill that it must come out of the Marketing Fund, and we find in the original Act that the Bacon Marketing Fund can only be recouped direct from the curers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are going back to very simple economics.  Where do the curers get it?  The curer is a man who engages in the business of buying pigs from the producer, and selling them as bacon, and he makes a profit usually, although two of them went bankrupt last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  The curer would probably get it, as Deputy Moore suggests, out of his profits, because if he does not get it out of his profits he goes out of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we pay the compensation?  That would be a most interesting situation.  If I brought in a Bill here and said: &ldquo;We will pay the compensation out of moneys voted by the Dáil,&rdquo; look at the uproar there would be.  We would hear: &ldquo;Imagine the Dáil compensating those people when the bacon curers are making good profits.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested before to certain Deputies on the opposite side that I should give them a hint that I was going to do a certain thing, so that they would come out in full cry against <Col N="574" /> it, while all the time I was going to do the other thing.  Of course that would not prevent them from criticising the other thing, because they are always ready to turn right around, and their retreat is not very graceful in many cases.  This is going to be paid by the curers out of their own profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they have. Another thing which Deputy Dillon said was that Henry Denny and Son would go so far as to close down the factories in Ireland.  He said they had no interest in keeping up the quota to Great Britain, because if we lost the quota it would go to Denmark and Henry Denny would have it again.  If I were to analyse that statement it would be found that there is quite a number of untruths in it.  The sum total of it is that it is altogether untrue. Under the particular agreement which Denmark has with Great Britain, and the particular agreement we have with Great Britain, nothing like that could occur.  We could lose our quota, it is true, but Denmark would not get it, so Deputy Dillon is wrong in that also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Deputy could not make it go there either.  Deputy Haslett said that compensating the minor curers must put them out of business.  That is the sort of allegation which is made by the Opposition &mdash;that because we compensate the minor curers we are bringing nearer the day when those minor curers will <Col N="575" /> go out of business.  That sort of reasoning is worthy only of an Opposition like what we have opposite us. Because you compensate a man, you are bringing his destruction nearer?  Everybody will remember that Deputy Dillon was as enthusiastic over the original Act as I was, or anybody else on this side.  It is true he may have overstepped the line with his enthusiasm on that Act.  I do not think that any body on this side can be quoted as forecasting a great future or that things would be perfect under that Act.  As a matter of fact, if anybody cares to look up the debates on that particular Bill, I think it will be found that I did say towards the close that there would possibly be at least one amending Bill&mdash;if not two or three&mdash; as time went on, because it is very hard to foresee how certain things will go.  That amending Bill has come. But there was no attempt by anybody in the Opposition to make any sort of constructive proposal with regard to the Bill that is before us.  There are about seven or eight matters dealt with in that amending Bill.  I explained what they were when I was introducing the Bill.  Not a single thing in the Bill was referred to, but we had this general futile criticism of the dealers, and the factories making big profits, and all that sort of thing.  Any Deputy who has a certain fluency can get up and make a speech without knowing what he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Bill is about, and I have the advantage of the Deputy that way.  Those political speeches made by the Opposition are not a bit helpful to the industry, to the producers or to anybody else. If they had the producers really in mind they would drop those political speeches and try to make suggestions as to how things could be improved. They have not done that.  If any Deputy can stand up and point out where he made any suggestion for improvement in any speech he made here, I am wrong in what I have said.</P>

Probably, as I have said, that is due to ignorance of what is in the Bill.  Probably it is due to stupidity; I do not like to say dishonesty. I think it is due more to stupidity than to dishonesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a mixture of both.  Then we have talk from the Opposition about free competition. Nothing could be more nonsensical than this talk about free competition. Every Deputy opposite, when he voted for the original Act, did away with free competition immediately. There is no use in Deputy Curran shaking his head, because that is only claiming that he did not know what he was voting for.  In the original Act free competition is done away with.  Each factory gets a certain quota, and that number of pigs inevitably goes into that factory.  All pay the same price.  What competition is there left?  There is no competition. For Deputies to get up here, on this particular Bill, and talk on general economic principles about free competition being the life of trade, is the greatest nonsense and Deputies should realise that.  Everything they said was against the original Act, and there was no murmur of disapproval of any clause that was in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies opposite wanted to bring in a motion to have the original Act rescinded, then every speech they made would be quite in order and as much to the point as you could expect from the Deputies opposite.  Deputy McMenamin gave us some statistics. He said he went down to a valley in <Col N="577" /> Donegal and counted 12 pigs where there were 150 at this time last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say at this time last year.  I said in the month of April.  I gave a specific date; I gave a concrete example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the general principle that you cannot judge statistics by one figure is well borne out by Deputy McMenamin's statement.  That would be a reduction of 92 per cent. in the number of pigs in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin gives a particular instance of one particular valley.  It may be true.  As a matter of fact, probably if the Deputy went to a particular farm, where the farm had changed hands, he might find that there were 50 pigs last year and none now, or that there are 50 now while there was none last year.  But that would not prove anything.  To attempt to prove that the number of pigs in the country is going down because Deputy McMenamin counted 12 pigs in a particular valley is not bringing us anywhere.</P>

      <P>I did that already.  I am answering the arguments of Deputies opposite about things that are not in the Bill.  It was alleged by Deputies opposite that there was a great trade for fat pigs&mdash;&ldquo;cutters&rdquo;, as they are called&mdash;with Birmingham and that, under this Bill, we were doing away with that trade.  There is nothing in that point.  The Bill does not interfere <Col N="579" /> with any dealer who goes out to buy these fat pigs and export them to Birmingham or wherever he desires to export them.  The British Government do not interfere, either, because there is no quota on these pigs in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tariff on them but, as against that, the exporters get a bounty.  The dealer is quite free to go into the fair and buy, as against the factories, that particular class of pig. If he pays 1/- more than the factories, he may be sure he will get these pigs and he can maintain his connection with Birmingham as well as ever he did.  I am told that the prices the factories are getting for their bacon are out of line with the prices they are paying for their pigs.  Were I not of the same opinion, I should not have urged that the Prices Commission should be asked to inquire into this whole matter.  The Prices Commission are to inquire into it, and they are the proper body to do so.  That is not my function at all.  Deputy O'Sullivan complained that I did not bring figures before the Dáil showing the profits the bacon factories were making.  That would have nothing to do with this Bill. There is not a clause in the Bill which could be discussed, amended or interfered with as a result of having these figures produced.</P>

      <P>Of course, when they have inquired into the matter.  That is their job, and I only hope they will get on to it as soon as possible.  How is the price fixed?  Deputies do not seem to realise what we agreed to do in the Act of 1935.  There was never a Party vote on that.  Individual Deputies opposite may have objected to some clauses as individual Deputies on this side objected to certain clauses.  But there never was a Party vote taken on these clauses.  It was agreed, as a general principle that the bacon factories would get what they could for their <Col N="580" /> bacon and we based our whole scheme on that.  That is how the whole Act was built up.  The Pigs Marketing Board were to fix the price of pigs, having in mind what the bacon factories were able to get for the bacon.  The whole Act was based on what the bacon factories would get, having regard to supply and demand.</P>

      <P>Another point made was that the factories should be permitted to pay a price higher than the fixed price.  Deputies opposite appear to be very concerned about monopolies, but they make suggestions which are altogether out of line with that concern. Nothing could bring about a monopoly more quickly than their suggestion, if it were given effect. That was realised when we were putting through the original Bill&mdash;that we could not permit any factory to pay more than the fixed price any more than we could allow any factory to pay a lower price.  If they were allowed to pay more than the fixed price, we can imagine Deputy Dillon or Deputy Bennett telling us that combines could go out and pay 5/- or 6/- more than the fixed price for their pigs and put all the smaller men out of action, so that eventually they would have all the profits for themselves.</P>

      <P>To come to the next point raised, the producer.  Deputy O'Sullivan says that there is great dissatisfaction <Col N="584" /> amongst producers with regard to prices and he says, in particular, that the producer does not know what he gets for his pig until it is weighed and graded, and that he is not there to see it.  In the first place, he can sell his pig on the live pig market, and, in the second place, if what Deputies allege is true, that these live pig markets are gone, he can go to the factory and get the factory to weigh the pig in his presence and be paid on the live weight.  He has that option.  Then he sees what he is getting, and, if he likes, he can weigh the pig on the town scales before going to the factory, if he has any suspicions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any disgruntled person in the country he will go to the Deputy, naturally, but none has complained to me for some months. I admit they did complain in the beginning.  They had a genuine grievance, and one of the clauses of this Bill is to remedy it so that every producer will have the right to send his pig to the factory if he wants to.  The big grievance they had was that they could not sell direct.  The producer can get his live weight at the factory and further, if he sends his pig into the factory, and if the pig is killed and graded, he gets his cheque back and he cannot be deceived.  So far as we can provide for it, and I believe we have provided adequately for it, he cannot be deceived with regard to the grading of his pig because, in the first place, the Pigs Marketing Board have had inspectors watching the grading from the commencement of the Act and, from 1st April this year, the Department of Agriculture has a representative <Col N="585" /> in every factory to see that the grading is properly done, so that he is perfectly safeguarded so far as that is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have heard something of the same complaints as I have heard, seeing that he has put inspectors in since 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Part II of the Act was to come into operation as soon as we were ready.  We had difficulty in getting the required number of veterinary surgeons, but now we have the required number, and also the required number of lay inspectors, and that Part of the Act came into operation on 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to weight only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <P>Do not sell them live weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Bennett is right in that, but, in any case, I think the producer will do better to sell dead weight.  The tendency of all this legislation is to get our producers to sell dead weight. That is purposely done, because, as was explained here when the original Act was brought in in 1935, until we get our producers to make an effort to produce grade A 1 pigs, we will not get what we are entitled to for our bacon on foreign markets.  We must get them to produce the best type of pig, and we can only do that by encouraging them to sell dead weight, so that they will get back a return showing how many pigs were sold of grade A 1 and other grades.  Every producer I have spoken to in the last couple of years has been getting more and more into grade A 1 pigs every time he brings pigs in, and that is the whole object of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> The Opposition are going to vote against this Bill, I believe.  I do not know why.  They have not stated a single thing in the Bill against which they are voting.  They are voting against the original Act, if you like, the Act they approved of in 1935 and which they are very sorry for now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be able to go through the country, and when the producer says that he is doing better on his pigs than he was three years ago, they can say: &ldquo;We all voted for that Act,&rdquo; and when they meet a dealer they can say: &ldquo;We voted against that Act on account of the dealer.&rdquo;  They will then have it both ways, as they always have it, and, like the man with the ass, they do not get anywhere.  Deputy Bennett says there is considerable opposition to the 1935 Act.  That is an amazing statement to make.  There was no Bill ever went through this House for the last five years in respect of which there was such general agreement with regard to all its provisions, and yet Deputy Bennett says there is considerable opposition to it.</P>

The farmer knows now what price he is entitled to get and he insists upon it, whether at the factory, in the market, or wherever he brings his pigs.

We were told that the curers formed a trust after the Act went through.  That is just like the statement about free competition. What trust was there in it? It was provided in the legislation what every curer would get and what he would pay for his pigs.  They went out and sold their bacon, and what trust could there be?  There could not be competition under the Act, and because there was not, we are told that they formed a trust.</P>

      <P>They had to pay the same price and take the number of pigs allotted to them and so on, but to call it a trust is certainly not right, and certainly not using the word as it should be used.  Deputy Curran said, I think, that he would deal with these matters further in Committee.  I suggest that the Deputy will not, if the Ceann Comhairle is doing his business, because there is nothing in this Bill about the matters he is talking about. It is not my job to see that the price of bacon is related to the price the farmer is getting for his pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was at least partially explained before.  The factories may be getting too much for their bacon&mdash;that is possible.  But when a Deputy talks about a factory paying, say, 70/- per cwt. for bacon and selling it at 1/8 per lb., it is not treating the question quite seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be all right if a pig was entirely composed of back rashers, but it is not.  I do not want to be taken as standing up for the factories, but at least let us get the facts of the case.  The pig has a shoulder and other parts that are not as dear as back rashers.  Take 70/- as the average dead weight price for a pig. Then take 20 per cent. off that, which is, I think, what they take off for reduction of weight when it is turned into bacon.  Then take the factory costs, whatever they may be, and, in <Col N="589" /> addition to that, you must take whatever they may be paying by way of levy to the Bacon Marketing Board, which, during a lot of the period referred to, was 12/- per cwt.  When you take all these things into account you find that they bring the price up very much higher, much nearer to what they are getting for their bacon.  There will still be a gap, I admit, but that is being investigated by the Prices Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers will take all that into account next month.  Two or three Deputies complained that there was too much centralisation of factories and that there were many districts where producers usefully could have a small or medium-sized factory&mdash;that it would be better if we had more factories.  The only authoritative statement we have on that question, I believe, is the report of the Pig Industries Tribunal, set up by the leader of the Opposition when he was on this side of the House.  I presume on that account Deputies on the opposite benches will pay more attention to the report.  That tribunal reported that, in their opinion, there were far too many bacon factories in the country.  They assume that there would be a better price for pigs if we had fewer factories&mdash;that there would be less waste and, therefore, more for the producer.  Whether this report should be accepted as common ground or not.  I do not know, but the fact is that in this particular Bill there is not a single section or sub-section dealing <Col N="590" /> with the registration or licensing of factories.</P>
      <P>Minor factories are in exactly the same position as under the original Bill, in spite of all the criticism from the other side.  The small licensed curers are in exactly the same position, and those who did not qualify to become either licensed or minor curers are in exactly the same position, with the exception that if they go out, they get compensation.  If it is alleged that the big curers can put them out more easily now than before, I cannot see how any Deputy can hold that.  Surely if the big factories are able to put the small men out they could have put them out without compensation just as easily as with compensation.  If we pass a Bill which provides compensation for these smaller men, who have to go out as a result of legislation, we are doing a just thing and there was no need whatever for all this criticism of this Bill.  I want to repeat again, after all the speeches we heard from the Opposition, and some of them were very long speeches, that there was not a single clause quoted from the Bill to justify anything said by the Opposition. When we come to the Committee Stage we will see whether they have any criticism to offer or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Bill, 1937, be read a Second Time.  This Bill is really a corollary to the Act passed here on the 11th December last, the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act. That amendment of the Constitution removed all reference to the King and to the Governor-General and transferred all those powers and functions to the Executive Council.  While certain executive powers governing the Constitution were dealt with in that Act, there were certain other powers and functions that are governed by ordinary law, charters and other instruments that were not covered or dealt with. It is to meet that that this Bill is now being introduced, so as to make perfectly clear what was the intention at the time that Act was passed, on the 11th December, 1936.  It also makes provision with reference to the late Governor-General, which I do not want to deal with now.  I can deal with that when replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, before he sits down, give the Dáil some idea as to the reasons for the rather extraordinary generous provision that is being made for the late Governor-General? Surely it is unfair to expect the Dáil to discuss the question without getting any indication of the Government <Col N="593" /> reasons for this proposal.  There must be a reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the position was that the previous occupants of that position were in receipt of £10,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Buckley was in receipt of £2,000, and allowance.  The basis on which this provision is being made for the late occupant of the Governor-Generalship is that he must be set up in some way; he must get a house.  He has to give up&mdash;he has already given up&mdash;the house that he occupied as Governor-General.  He has to secure for himself a house, and I do not think anybody will say £500 a year is an over-generous allowance for a man in his position.  After all, during the four or five years he was there he was responsible for a definite saving; perhaps there may be some adjustment in regard to income tax, and I might not be quite correct in saying that while he held office there was a saving to the State of £32,000, but there was a saving of almost that amount.  In view of the very small allowance he was in receipt of while he was there, I think it is only right that some provision should be made for him so that he should be able to secure a house, and £500 a year is not an over-generous allowance.</P>
      <P>I might point out that some reference was made here to certain other moneys that have to be provided.  Part of that is in relation to rent.  The position ended on 11th December, so far as the Governor-General was concerned.</P>

      <P>Without notice. Some adjustment had to be made with regard to rent, and that came to £153. When you make provision for a maid, a gardener and so on, the total would amount to £213.  I can give the details afterwards as to how that £213 is made up.  That is the other provision that is referred to and that has to be made.  Then there is a sum of £42 13s. which is for a telephone and a <Col N="594" /> chaptain and which has been made direct from the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>Before I come to the <i>piece de resistance</i> of this Bill I should like to remark in passing that the Minister assumes that air of innocence which always characterises him when he is getting Bills through the House; there is no man more fitted to get a Bill of this type through this House than the Minister, and I presume that that is the reason the Minister for Justice was asked to introduce this measure.  There are a number of points upon which I would like a little clarification.  I am sorry the Minister did not go a little more elaborately into the details of this measure.  Section 2 to the ordinary layman is rather a complicated affair and it is a pity that the Minister did not explain precisely what it means and what is the reason for introducing it.  I gather that, roughly speaking, what happened is this: that in that insatiable desire the President has of trying to make political capital&mdash; although in this case it turned out to be something of a boomerang&mdash;out of troubles on the other side, in great haste we passed legislation last December and that has left us now in rather a mess and Section 2 is meant to clear up that particular mess.  How far it does so, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I right in assuming that what it amounts to is this: that certain prerogatives that were previously enjoyed by the King and Governor-General are now more or less divided up between the Executive Council and various Ministers?  I see that the Minister quite agrees with me in that.  There is one point I should like him to clear up and that is the point raised by the Minister for Finance last week.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice will clarify my mind on the matter.  It makes me extremely uneasy as to the position of the President, the Minister for Finance and even the Minister for Justice.  I gathered from the explicit statement of the Minister for Finance <Col N="595" /> last week that up to December last he and others, the President too, were Ministers of the King.  Was that the position up to last December? Silence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not going to answer every question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can deny the charming smile of the Minister, but it is not an answer to the question.  It is a statement by a Minister of the Government, made after the introduction of this Bill and after he had seen this Bill.  I presume this Bill was before the Executive Council and also before the Party.  I cannot imagine the Government bringing in a Bill of this kind without the approval of the full Executive Council and without the approval of the Party. Therefore I assume the Bill has the full blessing both of the Ministry and the Party.  The Minister for Finance must know what he was talking about, although I admit it is a large assumption, but still we must assume that. Last week the position was that up to December, 1936, the President, the Vice-President, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers were Ministers of the Crown.  I want to know what are they now?</P>
      <P>We did a number of negative things last December.  We cut out the King, but did we make any positive provision for the holding of office by a Minister of something or other, say, by the President, who was, up to then, the chief Minister of the Crown in this country?  I must say that he and the Minister for Finance concealed the fact very well until last week, when there was a parade of it here by the Minister for Finance.  He showed the great prerogatives he had enjoyed as Minister of the Crown.  He could run people down in the public streets and an action could not be taken against him.  I want to know is that regularised in this Bill?  I am not quite sure that it is.  I want to know what is the position of the President, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers.  I gather they have ceased to be Ministers of the Crown.  I wonder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that is not clear to me is that certain rights are still reserved <Col N="596" /> to the King in this Bill.  In other words, internationally we belong to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Roughly speaking, that is what Section 2 of this Bill, making a reference to the second Act of last December, amounts to.  Therefore from the point of view of our status we belong to the British Commonwealth of Nations. That sums up the reference made to the External Relations Act of last year.  But apparently internally we are a kind of republic.  I suppose other people regard us as being members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but, to quote a famous phrase of the President in the year 1921, we regard ourselves as being a republic.  Is that the position under Section 2?  Perhaps the Minister will take the opportunity of clarifying that when he comes to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Coming to what I might call the main purposes of this Bill, we find it is to provide what does seem an extraordinarily generous allowance for the Governor-General.  Now, the Minister was rather unfortunate in drawing a comparison.  He drew a comparison between the £10,000 a year voted for the previous Governors-General and the £2,000 taken by the last occupant of the office.  Candidly, I do not know whether he is still Governor-General or not.  That even is not clear.  We tried to secure last December that he shall have no statutory function, but whether he is still Governor-General or not I do not know.  Perhaps he is, but anyhow one thing is clear&mdash;that the two previous occupants had a lot to do. They spent that £10,000 in the ordinary work of entertaining foreign visitors and others.  Let us make no bones about it.  In common with other Deputies, I have a certain desire that the present Governor-General should do well.  I wish him well.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say against the present occupant of the Governor-Generalship. I want to make that quite clear.  We should realise what were the conditions on which he took office.  The Minister may remember &mdash;I do not know whether he personally participated in some of the amusing but by no means edifying incidents <Col N="597" /> that took place when there was a regular <i>sauve qui peut</i> of the various Ministers out of various houses.  When the Governor-General of that day made his appearance on the scene, sometimes one would think that it was the rout of an army that occurred. It was sometimes so great that they even forgot the people that they brought with them to the party in their desire to escape.  We have seen incidents in which the head of the Executive Council made every effort to take precedence, physically and geographically, of the then Governor-General by walking before him.  I am not speaking of the present occupant of the office.  We saw these things happen.  Apparently it did not suit&mdash;I do not like to use the word vanity.  Shall I say the sense of what was due to his own position in the case of the President.  The Minister knows that that led to a vacation of the office by the previous occupant of the Governor-Generalship.  The circumstances were most regrettable in which that occurred.  We all know what led up to it.</P>
    <P>We all know that for a couple of months the office was vacant, until finally for some reason that was never revealed either to this House or to the country the position was filled.  Apparently the condition on which the position was filled was this, that the future occupant was deliberately to do nothing&mdash;I want to stress that point and I am not blaming him&mdash;but that is the case so far as the public can judge, and I think there is no doubt about the facts.  I do not think the Minister or any other Minister can deny it: that the one condition on which he took office was that he was to do nothing. He was to be not a rubber stamp to sign Bills, but he was to keep out of the public gaze and do nothing.  His whole work was to exist, and nothing else.  That was a different position altogether, I suggest to the Minister, from the comparison he made between the £10,000 a year paid to the previous occupants and the position of the present occupant.  I call him the present occupant because, candidly, I do not know whether he is so or not. Anyhow, my meaning is clear.</P>
    <P>The two other occupants of this high <Col N="598" /> position filled various tasks in this State.  Again and again they were utilised by the State to entertain foreign distinguished visitors, and I am convinced that out of that salary they made nothing whatsoever; that they spent it and more than spent it in the work of the State.  The position was entirely different in connection with what is described euphemistically as &ldquo;the last Governor-General.&rdquo;  What the exact significance of &ldquo;the last&rdquo; is I do not know, whether they regard him as already ceasing to be Governor-General or whether there is to be no other&mdash;again I am not quite clear on that matter.  But, in his case, the one thing that he was asked to do was to keep out of the public gaze: &ldquo;Do not appear in the same place, especially with the President and, if possible, with any of the Ministers, and if they do happen to make an appearance slip away as quickly as possible.  Let there be no difficulty about that extraordinarily difficult question of precedence.&rdquo; For that purpose, for doing nothing, not for carrying on the work of the State&mdash;remember again I have no criticism to offer against the individual &mdash;but for doing absolutely nothing, and because he did absolutely nothing he was given a salary of £2,000 a year, double the salary of a Minister.  He was given not merely a salary of £2,000 a year, but other expenses for the upkeep of his establishment amounting, on the average, to another £2,000 a year.  The allowance for his house and for the maintenance of an official residence was £1,200 a year.  There was also an allowance for travelling did public interest.  What travelling did he do in the public interest, except to scurry out of the way of Ministers? What else was he asked to do in the public interest?</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister appreciates my point.  The position was &ldquo;for the Lord's sake keep out of the way: don't let us see you and for that you will get £75 a year for travelling expenses&mdash;so you ought to be able to keep out of the way.&rdquo;  I do not object, but the sum is generous even for that.  He got a chaplain.  That is all right.  He got a private secretary as well to attend to the enormous business of doing nothing.  Again, there is no one in a <Col N="599" /> better position to appreciate the value of a private secretary than the person who has had one and who is now without one.  He had a private secretary to look after the enormous business of doing nothing.  That, shall I say, seems rather an extravagance. Therefore, when the Minister for Justice made the comparison between the salary of the other Governors-General and the present occupant, I think he was rather unfortunate.  Remember that the man got not merely £2,000 a year for doing nothing, but because he did nothing and on condition that he did nothing.</P>
    <P>Now, I have never raised my voice against the salary paid to the present Governor-General owing to the office he held, but I did think that the office should either have been abolished or that it should have been properly kept up.  What was done was that we had one of these silly compromises that was satisfactory neither to economy nor to dignity.  That is what is really wrong with the position.  I have nothing against the present occupant of the position, but it is surely rather peculiar that a man who has got for four years a salary of £2,000 a year for doing nothing, an allowance of £2,000 a year to live in a house so as to help him to do nothing, should now get a gratuity of £2,000 for doing nothing and £500 a year to enable him to do nothing for the rest of his life.  That, as I say, is a peculiar position, and, mind you, this Bill comes before the House with the unanimous blessing of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That comes as a revelation to members on this side of the House.  The Minister, of course, is quite innocent.  I know that neither he nor any of the other Ministers ever spoke in the old days about the Governor-General's salary and what a crime it was to pay it.  It was useless to point out to them then that the other two Governors-General spent all that money in the work of the State, but here we have a situation in which the Fianna Fáil Party is enthusiastically throwing in its weight behind a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>I know that the President in his Constitution is anxious that women should not do anything, but that <Col N="600" /> men should, and that the less they do the higher the salary they get, comes from a man who himself only gets £1,700 and his Ministers £1,000 a year each.  The occupant of this position, who did nothing, got £2,000 a year, the top salary in the administration of the State, and he got it because he did nothing.  In addition, he got an official residence and something for the upkeep of that official residence as well.  In the circumstances, to bring forward an omnibus Bill of this kind, containing a regularisation of the general executive position, and, possibly, a regularisation of the position of the Minister for Finance&mdash;the ex-Minister of the Crown up to last December&mdash;as well as a regularisation of the position of the Chief Justice, with this effort of extreme generosity on the part of the Government, is rather surprising.  It is also surprising that the ordinary back-bencher of the Fianna Fáil Party had nothing to say on the matter, and that it had got full approval of that particular Party. There are, perhaps, one or two other matters to which I may refer.  There is a section in this Bill dealing with the question of charters.  That section says, in effect, that the Executive Council may, whenever they think proper, make any adaptation or modification of any statute or charter which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, is consequential on the passing of the Principal Act.  In other words, within their own discretion, they can decide whether or not the charter needs modification as a result of this Bill, and then they can change it.  Evidently, the courts have nothing to do with it.  Why is that?  What is to prevent the Executive Council saying: &ldquo;We think this is consequential,&rdquo; and then going ahead and making the change?  I presume, according to this, that the word of the Executive Council is the last word in connection with a matter like that. Theirs is the last word as to whether a thing is consequential or not.  They can therefore make any change they like on the pretence that it is consequential.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I should like to say a few words in connection with this <Col N="601" /> matter of external relations.  Who is it that declares war under this Bill? I admit, of course, that, with that optimistic outlook that sometimes characterises them, the Executive Council do not always foresee the possibility of war; but let us suppose that such a thing should occur, and that, in the midst of international trouble, this country is invaded.  Who declares war in that case?  I am speaking now from the legal point of view, and, possibly, the Minister can clear up that matter?</P>
    <P>After all, however, the main thing in connection with this Bill is this extraordinary award that is proposed to be given to the person who has been occupying the position of Governor-General.  It would be bad enough to give an award to a man who, having been appointed to a position, had neglected his duties; but here is a case where a man was given a position on the distinct understanding that he should do nothing while he was in that position.  Why should that man be given any award?  It is not a question of his being appointed and failing to do his duty; it is a question of his being specially appointed to do nothing.  That is, to my mind, what requires justification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the proposals of the Government in relation to Mr. Buckley require an immense amount of justification, and I think that, in that regard, the Minister hardly treated the House with justice, or even with fairness, in abstaining from any explanation that would enable us to comment on his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in some quarters it has been suggested that Mr. Buckley already has performed an act of great generosity in accepting so small a salary as he has been accepting and in handing back a portion of what his predecessor was getting in the same office.  It seems to me, however, that that argument has no validity if, as I assume, the salary he was to receive was determined at the time of his appointment&mdash;if when he was appointed, he was to receive £2,000 a year of a salary and £2,000 a year of an allowance, and no more; and I <Col N="602" /> have not the slightest doubt that an understanding was reached on that point before he was appointed.  We were told, at the time, that he was making a very magnanimous sacrifice, in the interests of his country and because of his personal esteem for President de Valera, in accepting that post&mdash;that it went very much against the grain for him to accept such a post&mdash;but now it appears that, in addition to remunerating him amply for that sacrifice, we are to reward him heavily for withdrawing him from a post the occupation of which went so much against his feelings.  Surely, there is a serious illogicality in that.  I put a question to the Minister, which appeared to me to be highly relevant: whether or not it was agreed that, if Mr. Buckley accepted that appointment, he was to be provided for for life.  In order to justify these proposals that are now before us, it seems to me that that should be so and that, in addition, we should be assured that Mr. Buckley made a substantial financial sacrifice in accepting this position.  So far as we are aware, he made no such sacrifice at all.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I have opposed the Estimate for Mr. Buckley's office year after year.  The reason I opposed it was that I considered the Estimate to be altogether excessive in comparison with the duties to be performed.  I think there is no reason why, out of the £4,000 a year Mr. Buckley has been receiving as Governor-General&mdash;£2,000 as salary and the balance as an allowance&mdash;he should not have been able to save up about £2,500 a year, so that, in the course of the last four years, he should have been able to accumulate a capital sum of about £10,000.  Certainly, so far as the State is concerned, he could have done that, and the State would have had nothing to complain about, since the State put him in a position that involved no expenditure. As Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, the only thing the State asked of him was to do nothing and to keep as much in obscurity as he could.  On one occasion I compared Mr. Buckley to a remittance man in Canada.  The position of a remittance man in Canada is that <Col N="603" /> he gets so much a year to remain in Canada and on no account to show his face at home.  In the same way the unfortunate Mr. Buckley was marooned in Monkstown and expected to remain there and to let us forget his existence. We were only reminded of his existence when, each year, his Estimate appeared.</P>
    <P>In order to justify this, it appears to me that the Government have got to establish three things: First, that Mr. Buckley sustained a financial loss as a result of his appointment; secondly, that there was an agreement that some such proposal as this should be made when he retired, to provide for him; and, thirdly, that nobody else was available for the position on better terms because I cannot believe that somebody else could not have been got on much better terms so far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, the position of Governor-General never has been regarded, either here or in any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, as a lucrative appointment.  It has always been regarded as an honourable appointment, but certainly not as a profitable one.  So far as I know, in the last 100 years, at any rate, there has been no case of a Governor-General in any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations getting rich or expecting that, when he retired from that honourable but unprofitable function, any provision would be made for him. Certainly there has never been a case, before this, of a Governor-General having been in fact provided for for life.</P>
    <P>There may be some adequate explanation and excuse for all this.  I hope there is, because I like to think the best of the Government and not the worst, on a matter such as this.  On the surface I feel obliged to say frankly that it has the appearance of an unsavoury piece of jobbery.  I hope it is not that.  I am not stating it is that. I am only stating that, in default of explanations that have not been given to us, that is what it looks like.  I hope the Minister will take us into his confidence and say everything that is to be said about Mr. Buckley's financial circumstances at the time he accepted <Col N="604" /> this office and about the terms of the agreement he made with the Government to accept this office, so that we can judge of the propriety of the proposals placed before us for consideration. Failing that, I shall feel obliged to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is something very puzzling about this Bill.  I have remarked that, as in the case of all measures which deal with constitutional questions, even remotely, there is a characteristic lack of candour about this measure and a determined attempt to obscure as much as possible. What exactly is the intention in the Bill, and what exactly is the position of this State?  We have in the second portion of this Bill a section which is consequential on the Act of last December, defining the external relationship of this country.  We remember that that Act of last December was introduced and drafted with such an intense desire to obscure its meaning and deceive the people that, whereas it was obviously introduced with the intention of getting rid of a King, when the Opposition examined that Bill as introduced, it was discovered and agreed that if that Bill had gone through in the form in which it was introduced, instead of getting rid of a King we would have found ourselves fixed up with a King and a half Consequently the Bill was withdrawn, altered and re-introduced in a different form.  That Bill at least laid down definitely, as it is now the law, that for certain purposes the King was retained as the link linking this country with other Commonwealth countries and as the recognised head for the purpose of external relations.  Section 2 of this Bill is more or less consequential on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not pretend to be sufficiently deeply versed in constitutional law to be able to pronounce judgment on the type of Bills that are being introduced here latterly.  I accept the opinion of others, but I think it is rather regrettable that Parliament is called together and asked to discuss and pass legislation which is deliberately designed to be misleading and obscure.  That portion is rather difficult to follow, but the portion dealing with the Governor-General is unfortunately only too clear. <Col N="605" /> The only thing I have got to say is that I am sorry that the Minister adopted the particular line he did in introducing this Bill.  It is characteristic of the Minister that when he has an awkward Bill to handle he has always been very candid and generally brief.  The brevity was very marked to-day.  The candour was marked only by its absence.  I am afraid that the lawyer in the Minister more or less obscured the Minister.  It is the duty of a lawyer in professional life to win a case as best he can, but it is the responsibility of a Minister introducing a measure to give an open account of that measure, to explain what every section means and why the various sections were inserted.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, too, that the Minister in his very brief remarks made a rather unfair and deliberate effort to mislead the Dáil when in two or three words he gave us to understand that the State saving during Mr. Donal Buckley's four years' tenure of office of Governor-General was approximately £32,000. On the face of it that might appear to be correct, but that statement was all the more unforgivable because it had the appearance of being correct.  It is true to say that his predecessors received £10,000 by way of salary and allowance.  I believe it is equally true to say that the late, or present, occupant of that office received £2,000 by way of salary.  I think that was free of income-tax.  He received a further £1,200 for the upkeep of an official residence in which no official business was to be done.  He received something in the neighbourhood of £500 a year for a private secretary and chaplain.  He received £50 for the use of a telephone, to do what I do not know, unless it might have been to back greyhounds, but it was certainly not to do the business of the State, although the State had to pay £50 for his telephone messages.  He received £75 for travelling expenses, but not on the State business, and £300 a year for the upkeep of a motor-car to carry him, certainly not on State business.  That particular list of salary and expenses paid to him comes to £4,150 a year. His predecessor had £10,000 a year.  I am not very conversant with the income-tax paid by people who receive <Col N="606" /> huge salaries, but just offhand I would say that the amount of income-tax on £10,000 a year would be £4,000, so that previous Governors-General received £6,000 a year.</P>

      <P>I am talking about salary.  He received £6,000 a year. This particular individual received £4,150 a year, and the Minister tells us that in four years approximately £32,000 was saved.  The previous Governors-General carried out certain functions, certain duties, certain responsibilities. State entertainments were given out of and under the expenditure of their Department.  If we are to reach a fair figure for the economies effected by the change of salary, we have got to see how much was paid by way of the cost of State functions and entertainments, either by any individual Department, or any Minister as head of a Department, or the President as acting head of the State, because all these State functions, banquets, dances, teas, lunches, and so on, which, in the last four years, have been given by the President or one or other of the Ministers, were merely so much replacement for the functions that heretofore were carried out by the Governor-General. Such expenditure has got to be subtracted from the expenditure of those Departments and added on to the £4,150 a year which Mr. Donal Buckley received, before we can arrive at anything like an approximate figure to indicate whether there was a saving at all, or what that saving was.  The official residence in the Phoenix Park has been maintained.  Its grounds and gardens, its buildings, its ruins, have been maintained, although it has been lying idle.  State money is still being spent on that particular residence, even though it is empty.  I would suggest to the Minister and to the Dáil that it is entirely beside the point whether or not there has been a saving effected in the last four years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to an expensive establishment of one kind or another. I said before that it was entirely beside the point&mdash;I might almost say irrelevant&mdash;as to whether or not there had been a saving in the last four years.  The only point of importance, and the only thing that matters before anybody in this Dáil is justified in voting away public moneys in the way we are asked to do it here, is the point made by Deputy MacDermot&mdash; whether, in fact, the Governor-General's contract included a provision for a gratuity at the end of his term of office, and for a pension of £500 a year for the rest of his life. He did agree to accept that job, that office, on condition that he did not work but received a considerably smaller salary than his predecessor. That was the case made to the Dáil, and there was a responsibility on the Minister for Finance and others, who came to us asking us to vote that money every year, to inform the House if there were any other obligations. We never got any hint, any whisper, any indication, that in addition to that £4,000 a year for doing nothing we were also bound to give him a gratuity at the end of his term of office, to pay all his bills, and to give a pension of £500 a year for life.  I want to know clearly and definitely if there was any contract or understanding to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was not, I want to know this: Is it purely out of generosity, when dealing with other people's money, that the Government brings <Col N="608" /> in these proposals now?  I cannot credit it.  I do not believe, much as I differ from the present Government, that they are so thoroughly reckless with regard to their responsibility as custodians of the people's money that they are going to chuck it away in thousands and in half thousands per annum, in order to pad the pockets of any individual.  I cannot believe that, and I do not believe it.  I believe that some form of pressure has been put on the Government to drive them into introducing this legislation.  If that is so, the Dáil is entitled to know what is the pressure, and who is twisting the screw.  If the Government, opposed to us as they are, happen to find themselves in the position of being the unfortunate victims of excessive pressure behind the scenes, if they will only be frank and open, they will find many others to help them in getting rid of that pressure, but I do not think, as things are, that they will find many to help them in chucking away public money in the way it is suggested to chuck it away here.  The whole story has got to be told.  Sooner or later it must be told.</P>
    <P>What has provoked, or incited, or induced the Government, in the heights or depths of an economic war, when they have cut pay and allowances and salaries, to become quite suddenly so generous to one individual? Is his position so desperate, so pathetic, after drawing £16,000 in four years for doing nothing, that he has got to be a person specially singled out from the whole country to receive a lump sum of £2,000, to get all little liabilities of £15 or £20 or £40 paid out of the public purse and to be subsidised for the rest of his life at the rate of £500 per year?  Surely that cannot be a voluntary act of Government.  Or is it that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first drive mad?  Is it that the strain of five years in office has driven every member of the Executive Council &ldquo;looney&rdquo;?  Do they think that anybody&mdash;even the most loyal member of their own Party organisation&mdash;is going to stand for that kind of thing?  There is surely some reason for it and, if there is, the reason should be stated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Mr. Donal Buckley appears to me to be a business man.  It is a pity that he was subsidised in idleness.  It is a great pity that that man was not filling a representative position abroad.  We might be able to pay this money if we had had people who were capable of making a good business bargain.  He appears to be the man we have missed for the last five years because, on its face, this document has all the evidence of having been dictated by a shrewd and hard businessman.  If we vote this money, no matter what Party we belong to, we have got to justify it.  We shall all meet constituents who are hard up against it, unable to pay their debts, on the verge of bankruptcy. We shall meet those who are bankrupt, with families depending upon them.  The material difference to these people between damnation and salvation would be a fraction of £2,000.  Such people are clamouring to the Government for help.  Legally, the Government is unable to help them.  How is anyone to go down and face such people or how is any member of the Dáil to say we can do nothing for them while, at the same time, we are able to give £2,000 in cash and £500 a year for life to an individual who drew £16,000 in four years for doing nothing and on condition that he would do nothing?  I advise the Minister and the Government to take the Dáil into their confidence. A few words in an undertone is not sufficient introduction or explanation of a Bill of this type.  If we start doing this for Mr. Donal Buckley, we shall establish a dangerous precedent &mdash;a very dangerous precedent.</P>

      <P>Once that precedent is established, there will, I fear, be a great many demands on the public purse, and I do not see how these demands can be denied.  There may be, as I say, a case for this proposal. There may be some defence or some justification.  But if there is any justification or any explanation, nobody in the Dáil has heard it yet.  I strongly advise members of all Parties to pay attention to this fact: they are not just <Col N="610" /> voting or chucking away their own money.  If the position of the Governor-General is so pathetic that something has got to be done to pave with gold the path he will travel for the rest of his life, then let those who believe in that kind of thing get together and subscribe their own money.  This is a proposal which puts the responsibility on every Deputy here of making that over-generous and extravagant provision for an individual and to do that with his eyes open and understanding, when he does it, that it is not his own money he is voting but the moneys of the public, entrusted to his care in the belief that he would not be reckless, extravagant or over-generous with that which does not belong to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this Bill will be largely interrogatory.  I notice that the Bill is not described as an Amendment of the Constitution Bill, and, consequently, that its legal effect cannot be in any way to change the Constitution.  It is set out in clause 2 that &ldquo;every power, function, duty and jurisdiction which, immediately before the passing of the Principal Act was, by any means whatsoever, capable of being exercised or required to be performed by the King or by the representative of the Crown ... shall be, and be deemed to have been, as from the passing of the Principal Act, transferred to and (as the case may be) capable of being exercised by or required to be performed by the Executive Council&rdquo;.  Surely that provision cannot have legal effect if it necessitates a change of the Constitution. As I said, I am speaking interrogatively. When the Principal Act and the External Relations Act were brought in, there seemed to be a desperate attempt to remove the King and the Governor-General from the Constitution, but it was not done completely. The Governor-General was left a certain function and, while the Government make this grand statement, this Bill can have no effect in the way of making any change in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not put down as an Amendment to the Constitution Bill. It refers to &ldquo;every&rdquo; power which was <Col N="611" /> exercised by the King or the representative of the Crown, but then we have the clause &ldquo;save where and in so far as the exercise or performance of such power, function, duty or jurisdiction is, by virtue of an amendment of the Constitution effected by the Principal Act or by virtue of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, conferred or imposed on some other person.&rdquo;  I speak from memory and I am open to correction, but it seems to me that Constitution Amendment Act No. 27, which is referred to, still left a certain function to the Governor-General.  That being so, it is clear that that function cannot be transferred to the Executive Council except by an amendment of the Constitution.  This Bill does not purport to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the External Relations Act&mdash;again I speak from memory and may be wrong; I am open to correction&mdash;it seems to me that no provision was made to empower the Executive Council to decide as to declaring war.  Consequently, there, again, this Bill fails to change the Constitution.  The Minister should explain that part of the Bill much more clearly.  In fact, this Bill would require the attendance not merely of the Minister for Justice, but of the Minister for Finance and of the President.  It is no use addressing the Minister for Justice in regard to External Affairs.  I notice that the officials of the Department of Finance are not here to assist in regard to the second part of the Bill.  I regret they are not here.  I foretold that some Bill of this nature would be required.  We discussed the matter some years ago at the Public Accounts Committee.  I pointed out then to the officials of the Department of Finance that the legal salary of Ministers was £1,700 and that the legal salary of the Governor-General was £10,000.  Secondly, the holders of those offices had a legal right to claim that full amount.</P>
    <P>There was one way in which the pretence of the Government could have been made a reality.  The Government could, in the case of Ministers, have given the full salary to them, minus income-tax, and then have taken back <Col N="612" /> from them such difference as there was between the legal salary and the amount which the Government advertised Ministers were taking.  The same applies to the Governor-General.  I noticed that, with regard to Ministers' salary, the Estimates put it down at £1,000 and then put down: &ldquo;Income-tax, say, £150.&rdquo;  With regard to the Governor-General, the only information given to the Dáil and to the country was a lie.  It was stated in a note to the finance accounts that the Governor-General's salary was £2,000, free of income-tax.  There is no such thing known to law as a salary free of income-tax, and the only purpose of putting down that figure was to mislead the Dáil and the public.  Incidentally, through this attempt to mislead the public, we are now being committed to a most uncalled-for expense and yet, I admit, a payment we are legally bound to make.  The only way to ensure, while the law remained, that the salary of the Governor-General was £10,000 was that he should receive the £10,000, and then hand back to the Government the difference between his legal salary and what the Government thought he should receive and what he himself had agreed to accept.</P>
    <P>It was perfectly clear to me when I dealt with this matter at the Public Accounts Committee that if the Governor-General received his £10,000, to which he was legally entitled, and handed back the difference, £8,000, in that case, by law, he should have given up more than £2,000 in income tax.</P>
    <P>The only other way to do it was that he should receive the £10,000 and that he should then hand back the difference between what would remain with him when he had paid income tax on that and a net sum of £2,000.  If that had been done, the public in this country would have had to be told what his true salary was, that is to say, the salary announced in the finance accounts would have had to be such sum as would, when income tax on £10,000 was deducted from it, amount to £2,000, and that, of course, would have revealed that the Governor-General's salary alone, apart from allowances, was between £5,000 and £6,000.  Instead of that, the Minister himself, when he introduced the Bill, <Col N="613" /> repeated the false statement that so much money was saved.  The Governor-General's legal salary was £10,000, and the salary he actually received, depending on allowances which he might be due to get and other sources of income on which he was due to pay income-tax. I work out at something in the neighbourhood of £6,000; but, in order to let the dishonest propaganda of the present Government loose on the country and in order to enable them to say &ldquo;The other man was getting £10,000 and this man is getting only £2,000.  Look what we are saving,&rdquo; they had to falsify the accounts and state a salary of £2,000, when legally it was £10,000, and when, in fact, working it out roughly, it was about £6,000.</P>
    <P>If the Government had been honest with the country and, as I say, had given the amount as £10,000 and had taken back from him such sum as represented the difference between £2,000 net income and £10,000, minus income tax on £10,000, there would be no reason for the second part of this Bill.  But, as it happens, the Government going around saying what economies were being performed by them have actually put their successors into the position of having to pay a debt which they themselves contracted. I am subject to correction in this, but I think the Governor-General&mdash;and I presume that is why it is done&mdash;is making a claim for arrears of pay, because, by law, he was entitled to £10,000 on which he was bound to pay income tax and, instead of that, in order to humbug the people, he was given £2,000 and told &ldquo;You need not pay income tax.&rdquo;  Having received only that amount, he can now claim the difference of £8,000, out of which has to be deducted the full income tax on £10,000 for that period of office.  It appears to me&mdash;the President or the Minister can correct me&mdash;that this part of the Bill is the result of a claim, negotiation of that claim and terms agreed to, as a compromise to this debt which is legally owing to this man.</P>
    <P>The Government undertook to pay £2,000 and to pay some expenses and, mind you, he received a very full allowance for expenses&mdash;£2,000&mdash;<Col N="614" /> which was not to be accounted for. There was no account to be given of that sum before the Public Accounts Committee.  His functions, when he was installed in his house, we know. I know a case of a diplomatic representative who went out to see him, and who gave him an invitation, and his reply was that he was not even allowed to go to a tea party unless ordered to do so by the Executive Council, and the Executive Council never ordered him to do it.  Here is the position as I interpret it and foretold it at the Public Accounts Committee. When a man's legal salary is a certain amount, he has a claim to it, and the only way in which you can get rid of that claim is to pay him that money.  If he agrees to accept less, the only way in which to meet the situation is to pay him the full amount and take back the sum he agrees to surrender.  If the Government had done that, they would have had to state his salary as the £2,000 net he receives plus the income tax on £10,000 such as was paid by his predecessors.  That was not done in order that a false situation would be created and in order that Ministers could go around and say: &ldquo;Look at the saving we are making.  The other man got £10,000 and this man is getting only £2,000.&rdquo;  It is not true at all.  The other man got less than £6,000 in actual net as compared with £2,000, and this man, I calculate, got about £6,000 as compared with £10,000 received by his predecessor.  But, for that difference, we now have to pay £2,000 down and £500 a year for the rest of his life.</P>
    <P>The salary of the Governor-General was due to be paid out of the Central Fund for the various years of this Government's office.  What have they done?  In order to economise during their time, they have just passed the buck, as they say in America.  They have gone around pointing out how economical they are by not paying their debts and have passed on their debts to their successors.  The position before this House, so far as I understand it, seems to be that the Governor-General, or the late Governor-General&mdash;I do not know <Col N="615" /> which&mdash;has a claim to some sum of money.  It will be something like the difference between £6,000 and £10,000 for the four years or so he was in office.  He can make that legal claim but no money can be paid unless it is voted by this House.  I believe the legal position is that though you may have a claim against a government, if it is such a claim that requires money to be voted, you cannot enforce that claim unless Parliament votes the money.</P>
    <P>We are in the position that we could resist this claim being made upon us, in disregard, presumably, of an agreement made some years ago, by admitting that this man can go to the courts and claim the money, but at the same time we are sitting here and refusing to vote it.  I just want to point out that that is how I understood the situation.  I am sorry the Finance officials are not here, because it is only a couple of years ago that I pointed out to them that this claim would be made.  They were very careful, but they did try to suggest to me that one need not worry about that. I regret to say that I happened to be a true prophet, and it is most unfortunate that I did happen to be a true prophet, because I am temperamentally a pessimist.  As the Minister has given no explanation, I give the House what seems to me to be the palpable explanation of it.</P>
    <P>The Government let a legal debt accrue to that man.  Whether they had an agreement with him which is now disregarded I do not know. Through that they have had to come to some sort of a compromise with him&mdash;to compromise on the amount. The compromise is for £2,000, plus the payment of certain debts, plus £500 per annum, which means that Ministers who were going round with the story that he had only £2,000 and that his predecessor had £10,000 were blatantly dishonest.  Through not acting until now, the future Government of this country is committed to paying moneys that the Government should have been paying during this time.  They may have thought that they had a firm agreement.  But what is the good, when you are dealing with <Col N="616" /> certain people, of having a firm agreement unless it is also a legal agreement? It seems to me that the Government brought in this Bill to put themselves right with the law.</P>

      <P>He challenges us to correct him.  He makes all sorts of insinuations based on nothing but&mdash;I do not like to say his own view of what might be done by him, but when people attribute to others things of that sort I am inclined to attribute it to their own minds very much.  However, to make some of these points clear, I take first this question of the provision that is being made in this Bill for the former Governor-General.  He is the former Governor-General, and has been the former Governor-General in fact, in law, since the 11th December last.  I hope that point is appreciated.  That is definite; that is the advice that the Government has got.  This is supposed to be a bargain.  There was no bargain. A certain position arose when the previous Governor-General refused to accept the views of the Government on certain matters and relinquished his office.  There were Bills urgently necessary in the Dáil.  I think it was about November.  At the time I happened to be in Geneva.  The line of action I had intended taking could not have been taken because time did not permit of its being taken.  We had to make our measures legal.  It was necessary to have a Governor-General to sign these Bills, and we had to get a Governor-General.  I and my colleagues thought of all the men in the country who would be prepared to carry out the full intention we had&mdash; the policy that was behind our whole programme.  It was very important that we should get a man who could be absolutely depended upon to do that. It would have been necessary for whoever took it to make very great sacrifices&mdash;sacrifices that nobody would make except he did it for a good cause. In the very same spirit with which that <Col N="617" /> man came out in 1916, when, I think, he was already 50 years of age, he said he was prepared to do it.  He tried not to do it, but he said: &ldquo;If you say to me this is a duty which you think I ought to render to the country, I am prepared to do it.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Yes; in the same way as I would ask, if I were in command of a corps, a man to undertake a difficult and, if you like, a dangerous task.  I ask you to volunteer to do it.&rdquo;  In that spirit he took the position and in that spirit he acted and made it possible for people who are not fit to black his boots to talk about him as Deputy Fitzgerald talked just now.</P>
      <P>There was no bargain.  He was entitled as Governor-General to get £10,000 per year, and, if it were his predecessor had it, £7,500 of that would be free of income-tax.  Only £2,500, so far as I remember, of that was subject to income-tax.  In addition to that, there were allowances.  I will read out the sums paid for that establishment over ten years.  In addition to that there were more sums provided for entertainment than have been provided by us, who have otherwise provided for the entertainment.  So that the sums which we asked the House to vote here every year contained the whole story. Deputy Fitzgerald talked about our deceiving the people by saying that the Governor-General was getting a net sum of £2,000.  If you want to calculate what would be the sum&mdash;if the Revenue Department, knowing the total income from various sources had to find the sum&mdash;it is possible, if you wanted to make a mathematical calculation, to say what was his salary before income-tax would have been taken off in giving him a net £2,000. The fact is clearly stated that he had a net salary of £2,000, arrive at it as you will.  We could not legally keep that money from him.  What he did was, to say to me: &ldquo;If I get £2,000 net, I will take no more.&rdquo;  It was accordingly arranged with the Finance Department that a sum equivalent to that should be paid to the Governor-General per year.</P>

      <P>Yes, after his appointment.  It had nothing whatever to do with it.  He was legally entitled to get £10,000 every year as his salary once he accepted the position of Governor-General, but he knew our general policy in that regard.  When the question arose of settling what provision was to be made for his establishment, the sums were so adjusted that he got £2,000 as his salary.  His establishment was calculated independently, and a separate provision is made every year for it.  On what basis does the Deputy talk when he suggests that we were deceiving the country? Everybody in the country knew.  We had made it clear in the Estimate time after time, and this question of the amount that he was receiving was brought up, and the amount that was being independently provided for his household.  It was being provided and he practically did not control a penny of it.  It was being otherwise expended. His secretary and so on&mdash;all these things were provided for independently&mdash;there was an independent amount paid.  So far as his establishment is concerned, he had not the handling, so to speak, of a penny of the money.  There was a definite Estimate for certain amounts for certain purposes.  It was all provided there.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that £7,500 was put aside as the sum which was not to bear income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to that is that in addition to whatever entertainment sum the former Governor-General was given, there was an extra sum given.  In the years in which I compared them there were additional sums greater than the sums which were provided when the immediately previous Governor-General was in office.  The Deputy does not want to hear these sums but I will give them to the House.  Taking the year 1923-24, the total sum provided for the whole office was £24,309; for 1924-25, £34,470; for 1925-26, £27,600; for 1926-27, £26,000; for 1927-28, £26,000; for 1928-29, £28,000; for 1929-30, £26,000; for 1930-31, £25,000; for 1932-33, £25,000; and for 1933-34, £21,000.  That gives an average for those ten years of £26,000 odd.  That was what the <Col N="620" /> upkeep of the establishment cost during those years.  There are questions in regard to what one might call the allied service&mdash;the Board of Works, buildings, furniture, fire, light, etc. Now with regard to these last four we have for 1933-34 a sum of £4,674 of a total; for 1934-35, £4,160; for 1935-36, £4,166; and for 1936-37, £3,225.  Therefore, whereas there was an average of over £26,000 for the ten years I have given, the average in the last four years was less than one-sixth of that sum, about £4,000.  So if we talk about the expenses of the establishment there is no question whatever and there is no doubt whatever as to the big change with regard to the amount that was spent.  As far as the people of this State are concerned, the view of the vast majority is that the Governor-General, who acted in accordance with the advice and policy of the Government within the last four years, was doing the will of the Irish people very much more than the Governor-General who was acting in accordance with the advice of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the amounts, the Governor-General, as I told you, got a salary, and whereas there was £10,000 available out of the Central Fund, the net salary he got was £2,000, arrive at it as you will.  If you subtract that £2,000 from the four sums I have given you (£4,674, £4,160, £4,166, and £3,225), you will get the amount that was spent on his establishment each year.  These sums were directly spent for items of service over which he had no control.  So that there was no possibility of his turning to his own purpose any money provided for those services.  These were the minima that were essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some words in this Bill which I dislike to see there.  If I had known Deputy Fitzgerald had originated them by some references elsewhere, I would have voted against their being in the Bill at all, because they imply something about which there should be no question, that special care should be taken, lest, the Governor-General, having been entitled to these moneys which he voluntarily surrendered, at some other time an action might lie against this <Col N="621" /> State in respect of them.  Suppose he was to die and his legal representatives made a claim.  It was to prevent that that these words were put in on the suggestion of the Finance Department, in order to prevent the possibility of something that might possibly happen in extraordinary circumstances. That is why these words are there.  They are there by way of a safeguard, to prevent in any circumstances any claim being made by anybody on foot of the fact that there was a sum of £10,000 a year which the former Governor-General could have drawn and did not draw, but voluntarily surrendered without any bond or anything of that sort.  That is why this thing has been done.  Otherwise this is a surrender for the time being. There was no formal document with regard to this surrender.  It was simply surrendered.  These words are there because the Department of Finance, with the care with which they look after the public purse, wished to have them there.  Their suggestion has given rise to this idea, that the Governor-General was giving something and was not giving something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The former Governor-General did not put in any claim.  I have responsibility and so has the Government responsibility in this matter.  We asked a man to leave his home and put himself in a position which would practically debar him from going back to his ordinary business. We have a duty in the matter. We know that he could not make provision for his future.  He had to give up his home.  What we say should be provided for him is what we are asking the Dáil to provide under this Bill, a sum of £2,000, which is the equivalent of portion of the salary which he has been accustomed to take every year and give him, so to speak, this one moiety equivalent to the salary that he had been taking for three or four years past.</P>

It was not anybody's suggestion but my own.  As Minister for External Affairs and as President, I made a suggestion to the Government.  I looked around amongst all the men I knew to get a man who would play this part, a man I knew who would not act otherwise than the way he did act during those four years.  Those who know the man will agree with me that the choice was a good choice, and I leave it to any person on the opposite benches to deny that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would be a long time&mdash;but perhaps I had better leave the thing alone.  The point was that we took the responsibility, in the public interest, of asking this man to leave his business and devote himself to a position which would inevitably mean that once he left that position <Col N="623" /> there was no other position he could very well get back to.  Having done that, I feel it is our duty, representing the people in whose service he was, to see that this man is not left in the position to which we have brought him now.  We took him out of his position and he cannot very well go back to any other position for obvious reasons, and I say it is the duty of the State in a case like that to make provision for him.</P>
      <P>I say that the sum that has been saved through his occupancy of that position over that period of years compensates us ten-fold for the sum that you are asked to provide in this instance.  He is an old man now, relatively speaking, and the provision we are asking you to make by way of an annuity of £500 a year would be purchased for a little over £4,000.  In one year alone the State has saved more than the entire provision that we are asking you to make for him.  The estimate of £4,000 represents the present value of the annuity based on the ordinary expectation of life at his age.  If he wants to get a home, he can purchase a house with the £2,000, or he can use that £2,000 for any other purpose.  We are not specifying it for any particular purpose.  We are saying that this man has served his country well.  He came away at our request to get into this position, and we are doing this as a duty, not because he has asked us to do it, but as a clear public duty.</P>
      <P>When we asked this man to take this position we had an obligation not to leave him in the position he would find himself in if no provision were being made.  The total value of this proposal would be about £6,000.  In the last year alone more than that sum has been saved out of the salary available from the Central Fund in respect of the Governor-General.  In the circumstances I think it is not an extravagant provision at all.  I am standing over it and the Government are standing over it, and I am quite prepared to defend it anywhere.  There was no bargain and no demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision against all possible claims, I forget the exact words, but I know I dislike them <Col N="624" /> intensely.  The Department of Finance felt that wording was necessary to cover the possibility of claims of any kind, and they inserted them.  The actual wording is: &ldquo;the following sums in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims by him under the Governor-General's Salary and Establishment Act.&rdquo;  I dislike this phrase intensely. I did suggest at the time I saw this thing that these words should not be there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had plenty of time in which to talk, and if he would stop interrupting me now it might be just as well.  With regard to the other matters in the Bill, so far as the constitutional position is concerned, this measure creates no new position whatever.  In the main, it is consequential upon what was done on the 11th December last.  It is necessary only to this extent, that there were certain statutory functions of the Governor-General the performance of which otherwise had to be arranged for.  This arranges for the performance of these functions by the Executive Council, and that is all.  So far as the position created on the 11th December is concerned, this does not alter it.  All it does is that where certain statutory and other functions performed by the Governor-General were not provided for, they have to be provided for in a consequential measure such as this.

      <P>Perhaps I should preface my remarks by indicating that anything I shall say when speaking on this matter will have no personal reference to Mr. Donal Buckley, although I might be tempted to say very strong things.  I can only describe this as the most scandalous proposition that has ever been brought before this House.  The President has made no proper effort to justify it.  He spent a considerable portion of his <Col N="626" /> time telling the House what we already knew, the amounts the previous Governor-General had got in various years by way of salaries and allowances, and he made a comparison with the amounts the last Governor-General received.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with the Bill we are discussing.  In fact, those items were completely isolated from the Bill.  If one were to follow the President's example, one might argue that the previous Governors-General, even if they did get the many thousands that the President said were voted by this House, performed certain duties and circulated great sums of money amongst the shopkeepers of Dublin and other places in the country.  They spent all they got and in doing so helped many citizens. I might argue otherwise in relation to the late holder of this office, but I do not want to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification whatsoever for this Bill.  So far as Mr. Donal Buckley is concerned, my recollection of him when last I saw him in this House was an affable, genial Irish gentleman against whom I could not say one word.  He was at that time a member of this Dáil, enjoying no salary but an allowance of £360 a year to meet his expenses as a Deputy.  I hope that Deputies on the opposite, as well as on this, side of the House realise that if a member of this House performs his duty in the way that he ought to, there is no profit out of that allowance.  It passes out of a Deputy's hands like water through a sieve.  If a man performs his duty here in a manner that will be satisfactory to his conscience and to the people who elect him, instead of making a profit, he will be at a loss.  It is to Mr. Donal Buckley's credit that he did serve his country as a member of the Dáil, and for that he received an allowance of £360 a year.  By reason of that he neglected his business, but no more than any other member, and he did not ask any compensation from the Dáil for that.  On that I might say that there were other members of the House who gave up their business in order to be able to attend to their Parliamentary duties.  Some held high office in <Col N="627" /> the Government for a number of years. When they ceased to hold those offices they did not ask or receive compensation.</P>
    <P>What is one to think of the mentality of a Government which derided the office of Governor-General, as the present Government Party did in this House and in the country, and which now comes forward and asks that compensation be given to the last holder of it?  The President put it in words that I perhaps would not be prepared to use: that he appointed Mr. Donald Buckley, and that Mr. Donald Buckley agreed to be put in the position, commonly called in America, of a yes-man: that, as the President himself said, &ldquo;he was a person who could be absolutely depended on to do as I asked him to do.&rdquo;  Because it pleased the President to appoint a yes-man in this State for a period of five years, to be at the President's beck and call, and to do what he told him to do and nothing else, this country is now being asked to give Mr. Donald Buckley a lump sum of £2,000 and a pension of £500 a year.</P>
    <P>We debated this afternoon a Bill affecting the agricultural community, the Pigs and Bacon Bill, in connection with which the question of compensation for minor curers arose.  Some of us objected to the producers being called upon to pay that compensation. When the Minister for Agriculture asked where else they should find the money, I felt inclined to make the retort: &ldquo;From the same source that you are finding a lump sum of £2,000 and a pension of £500 a year for Mr. Donald Buckley.&rdquo;  The sums of money involved in this Bill would be sufficient to buy out two or three of the minor curers who are being legislated out of existence by the Government.  One wonders if this gratuity and pension are being given to Mr. Donald Buckley to compensate him for the indignity that he was subjected to&mdash;in being compelled to accept such a sinecure, an office which it is difficult to conceive any man of independence accepting. Is this compensation for the compulsory confinement that he endured for five years?  I remember asking, when <Col N="628" /> the Estimate for the salary of the Governor-General came before the House in recent years, whether we could have an assurance that the Governor-General existed at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Compensation in lieu of the Governor-General's salary is in the Bill and, therefore, I presume one is allowed, when speaking of the compensation, to refer to the thing itself. We are asked here to vote compensation to Mr. Donald Buckley, the last Governor-General, for the loss of office.  I do not know if any other case is being made for the Bill.  I do not know if there has been any loss of office, because the President said that he had reduced the position to that of an acting yes-man.  This was a gentleman who lived in retirement at Monkstown or somewhere else, to whom we voted a salary and allowances each year for five years. We did that without having any actual evidence before us that he was alive.  By repute we knew that he was alive, but that was all.  As far as we knew, he did nothing; there was no evidence put before the Dáil that he ever did anything.  Now the country is being asked to compensate a man who filled a sinecure like that, a man who did nothing.  If the President made the case that Mr. Donald Buckley had suffered in health as a result of his enforced confinement in Monkstown during the last five years I, and I am sure many other members of the House, would be quite willing that he should be given a compassionate allowance.  If he had suffered in health I would regret it just as much as any member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made for this Bill is that Mr. Donald Buckley should receive this lump sum and a pension of £500 a year because he had to neglect his business during the years that he held this office; in other words, during the years he occupied this sinecure.  On that reasoning every member of the Dáil should be compensated because, as I said before, the business of Deputies who conscientiously attend to their parliamentary duties suffers. Their business is neglected, and why <Col N="629" /> not give them compensation?  The President has made no case for this Bill, and he knows it.  There is no precedent for this measure.  We had two previous Governors-General. They did something while in office. There are different views held, of course, as to whether what they did was beneficial or otherwise for the country.  But they certainly did something. They spent money freely and helped to put money in circulation. They did not receive compensation or a pension, and if they were to be compensated as the President is compensating Mr. Donald Buckley, their allowances and pensions would be much larger than his, because they gave up whatever business or profession they were carrying on at the time and devoted more time to the duties of the office than Mr. Donald Buckley did.  At a time when there are many people, if not destitute, at least in want, in this country, it is scandalous that a measure like this should be introduced, and that we should be asked to vote a gratuity and a pension to a gentleman who, as the President himself admitted, had really no work to perform.  I do not think that any terms that one might employ would be too strong to condemn this measure. I, and I hope many other members of the House, will vote against it.  None of us have any but the happiest recollections of Mr. Donald Buckley when he was a member of this House, but no matter who the holder of this office was, or the Party he belonged to, it would not alter my condemnation of a measure such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The President's justification for this measure, as I understood him, was that the late Governor-General took up this position at the request of the Government, and that it would not be easy for him now to take up again the threads of the business he was engaged in previously.  As I listened, I wondered&mdash;if one wanted to use that phrase&mdash;how many people in this country would be entitled to compensation or pension?  Let us take the President of the Executive Council himself, or the members of the Executive Council.  Supposing they lost office to-morrow, I take it that it is <Col N="630" /> probable that they could not take up the threads of life which they had had before they went into their present positions.  The same thing, of course, applies to their predecessors in office. But is that a justification for the awarding of compensations or pensions of this nature?  If such awards are to be made, where is it going to stop? Where are you going to draw the line with regard to people who have given their services?  Are all such people to get pensions and compensations for the rest of their lives?</P>
      <P>I say that this question of pensions has gone too far in this country.  I say that, here and now.  I have said it before, and I repeat it.  People in the country are now saying that it will soon be a question when every second person in the State will have a pension. If the Governor-General took up that position, I take it that he took it up in the full knowledge of what it meant, and that he enjoyed the remuneration accompanying his employment.  I take exception to this policy of giving pensions to people, such as the Governor-General&mdash;and I couple with him the members of the present Executive Council as well as the members of the former Executive Council&mdash;just because they have given good service. It appears to me that there is no justification for the proposal contained in this Bill.  The last Governor-General was compensated for any services he gave, and there is no use in talking about what salary his predecessors had. I remember very well how the Fianna Fáil Party talked about the salary of his predecessors, and I was waiting to hear what Deputy Corry would have to say about this to-day.  I remember the Fianna Fáil Party proclaiming that they would have no pensions and no salary over £1,000 a year.  I am sorry that Deputy Corry is not here.  I should have liked to hear him, and I was waiting to find out what he would have to say about this.</P>

      <P>I am not going to have a silent vote on this Bill.  I look upon this Bill as being the result of the greatest piece of corruption that has ever happened in this country.  As <Col N="631" /> Deputy Curran said, the Fianna Fáil Party, before they came into office, made capital out of the matter of the salaries of previous Governors-General. Now, however, we see the effect of the situation created by them.  We see, here, that the Governor-General is to get a pension of £500.  I should like to know from the President what that would amount to, at the present rate of interest, if it were capitalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but then, in this case there is the question of a lump sum, and that, at 10 per cent., would be about £8,000, before you were finished with it.  However, what I was going to say is that, at this rate, it will mean that there will be no end to the corruption that is going to prevail in this country.  I can say, as I think I have said before, that, in the 40 or so years that I have been connected with public life in this country there was never so much corruption as there is to-day; and I say that, if proof were needed of that, the proof is to be found in this Bill.  As I said before, I am not going to give a silent vote on this Bill.  The position the people have been put into as a result of the economic war and the policy of the Government is that, the more they do, the less they get; but, according to this, the less the Governor-General did, the more he is to gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What exactly the duties of the Governor-General were nobody except the President knows.  Nobody knows what were his duties or what he did, and yet he is going to be presented with a pension which, I believe, is entirely unjust, so far as the people of this country are concerned.  Nobody can deny that there are many people in this country to-day who are very badly off.  They have been put into the position that they are not able to <Col N="632" /> support themselves or their families. If you go to any church gate in the country&mdash;of course, Fianna Fáil are hardly in a position to face a crowd at a church gate in the country&mdash;you will find that the people, due to the policy of the present Government, are not able to support themselves or their families, and yet you have this proposal to make this gentleman a present of £500 per annum.  I shall vote against it, and I hope that the Deputies on all sides of the House will support me in voting against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot asked two pertinent questions. First, he asked was there an agreement with the Governor-General at the time he agreed to take over office, and, second, what sacrifice had the Governor-General made in taking up that office?  I understood the Deputy to say that, if he did not get a satisfactory answer in regard to that, he could only come to the conclusion that it was a piece of political jobbery. Have those questions been answered, and, if so, have the answers been <i>bona fide?</i>  The President told the House that he had an agreement with the Governor-General.  It seems to have been an agreement of this character: that the Governor-General said to him&mdash;I take it that it was as a result of a question&mdash;that if he got £2,000 a year, that was all he wanted. Deputy MacDermot wanted to know what were the sacrifices that the Governor-General made.  The President told Deputy MacDermot and the House that the Governor-General had made great sacrifices: that he had given up his business, and that it was not possible for him, as a result of holding this office of Governor-General for the last four years, to go back to his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, let us test that.  Somebody has told us that the Governor-General is about 70 years of age.  I take it that he was in business all his life before he took up this position of Governor-General. In other words, there were 66 years of his life apart from the four years, that he spent in this office of Governor-General.  Now we are told that the President looked all around the country to find a man to fill this <Col N="633" /> position, and yet the man he found was a man of 66 years of age, running a business somewhere down the country.  Does anybody suggest that that man was making any sacrifice? According to the President, the Governor-General handed his business over to his son when he took up this office; and that, again according to the President, he was making a sacrifice in doing so.  Where was the sacrifice there?  If he were 66 years of age, was it not time to hand over his business to his son, or to somebody else?</P>
    <P>I should like to know is that the justification for a Bill of this kind.  I agree with what Deputy MacDermot has said, that this is a piece of jobbery.  It is a piece of jobbery.  What is the justification for that piece of jobbery? The justification is, as we all know and as the country knows, that the sacrifice this man made was that he permitted himself to be taken and used by the President in a way that no other man with any bit of backbone would permit himself to be used.  He had to be stuck in a hole somewhere.  I understand there is a plague of rabbits in this country at present and that the Imperial Chemical Company have produced some substance which, if blown into the rabbit holes, will kill all the rabbits.  We are not going to do anything of that kind with the gentleman in this hole.  We are going to shoot at him with golden bullets, this man of 70 years of age who made this extraordinary sacrifice for the people!  Why, the people of the country did not know that he existed for the last four years! They did not know whether he was alive or dead.  The only thing we knew was that we were asked to vote his salary every year.  This is the boldest and most audacious piece of jobbery we ever heard of anywhere. Contrast all this blowing about patriotism with the treatment meted out to Lord Snowden, who died on Saturday.  He was a man who struggled for democracy all his life, and who, for the most of his years, was in broken health, suffering intense and violent pain.  He retired from the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, one of the greatest offices in the world.  He went out of office <Col N="634" /> without a penny pension and died a poor man.</P>

Is this not opening wide the floodgates of corruption in this country? Can there be any doubt about it?  Is the House aware of the gravity of the step Deputies are asked to take in passing a Bill of this kind?  We are the trustees of the public purse; we are the guardians of the people's money. We are supposed to be critical of how every penny taken from the taxpayers is spent.  Here this Bill is lashed up to us and we are asked to pass it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that there are two reasons for the absence of Deputies over there.  The first is that Deputies over there got into office by making capital out of the salary paid to one man in this country. They used that matter up and down the country.  Secondly, after they get into office, a Bill such as this brings out publicly the insincerity of their attitude on the question of salaries and pensions.  I should like to see paraded on those benches opposite the number of Deputies who have provided themselves with pensions since they came into office.  Yet they got elected because of their apparent disapproval of voting these big salaries and pensions. <Col N="635" /> Did they tell the poor boys and girls, whom they gathered about them prior to the last two elections, that they were going to get pensions for themselves?  This is nothing short of legalised corruption, legalised jobbery. If I were to support this Bill, and any man were to charge me with legalised corruption, I would have no answer to it.  We are using the power which the nation vested in us, as trustees for the public, to carry out legalised corruption and legalised jobbery.</P>
      <P>Let us not mince words about it at all.  I am the last man in the world who would object to paying any man a reasonable salary, provided he was worthy of the job and did something for his salary.  I have never questioned the payment of a salary to any man who was worthy of it.  I have always believed, and still believe that a good man is worth any money in reason in any job&mdash;I do not mind what it is.  He may be a street-sweeper, a Governor-General, or a managing director of the biggest firm in the world.  The person who does not appreciate merit and pay for it accordingly will lose in the long run, because somebody else will appreciate it and pay for it.  But here we are asked, without justification, to vote a large sum and a large pension to a man who did nothing.  We are told that he sacrificed himself, that the sacrifice had to be made.  The President looked around the country for a man who would sacrifice himself, the sacrifice apparently being that he should degrade himself and hide himself away.  He is some sort of obscure specimen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The President looked around the country for a yes-man, and this was the gentleman he selected.  If the President wanted a yes-man, let him compensate him.  Let the President be honest; let him compensate him out of his own money. Nobody will object to his doing that, but do not ask the people of this country to pay it.  We are told that he sacrificed himself and that he played a noble part, the noble part which he played being that he allowed himself to <Col N="636" /> be stuck away in some place for the last four years.  Nobody knows where he has been for the last four years. We are told that he served the country well.  He served the country well by keeping himself out of sight.  He would not be permitted to go even to a football match.  Somebody has said that he was not permitted to go to a party where he might drink even a cup of tea.  That is playing a noble part! Is that in keeping with the dignity of a man who was supposed to be head of the State?  He may be the representative of an English King.  I do not know whom he represents, nor do I care, but he was paid for doing something, and he should have done something and not merely permitted himself to be stuffed away in this fashion.  We have never known during all these years where he was.  He suddenly appears now to be handed over by this Government a sum of £2,000 down and £500 a year for the rest of his life.  That is his reward.  Is it any wonder that there are 22,000 men and women out on strike in the city looking for sufficient to keep them alive, to put them in a position to buy the necessaries of life?</P>
      <P>That is going on outside in the city. Those people who are on strike now, and living on strike pay&mdash;a man with a wife and family probably getting £1 a week strike money&mdash;are living out there while we are in here doing this. We are asked to believe that a man who got £2,000 a year for four years&mdash; a man who was 66 years of age when he took up the job, and should have retired from business then, if not before&mdash;made a sacrifice by taking that job.  Now we are asked to give him £2,000 down and £500 a year for life, while thousands of people outside, in the city alone, not to speak of rural Ireland, have not sufficient money to buy the necessaries of life.  This House can do that if it likes.</P>

Prior to 1932 we were all <Col N="637" /> familiar with large posters which were exhibited throughout the country on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, criticising persons who got pensions for their national services in this country.

      <P>In case even that would not be sufficient, the Government feels stung with anxiety as to the future of this person, and proceeds to hand him out a sum of £500 per annum.  I had to rub my eyes when I saw this provision in this Bill sponsored by a Party which in the past, at all events, has been loud in its denunciations of pensions very much less in amount than the pension provided here, even though the former pensions were provided for persons who had done work a million times more valuable to the nation than the work which was performed by the ex-Governor-General during the past four years.  I am not going to be tempted, no matter what my indignation may be in regard to this Bill, into making any derogatory references to <Col N="638" /> Mr. Donal Buckley.  I believe him to be an eminently respectable gentleman, held in high esteem by a very large section of the community, of which I am glad to say I am one, but one must consider this Bill apart altogether from one's admirations or feelings towards the recipient of these sums.  One must look upon this as a matter of principle, and, looking at it as a matter of principle, I cannot for the life of me understand what justified the Executive Council in formulating such outrageous proposals as are contained in this Bill.  We have been told, in justification of it, by Ministers and by the Government Press organ, that the ex-Governor-General saved the country a substantial sum of money by working for the insignificant salary of £2,000 per year; in other words, that he was a cheap Governor-General, and that the State put some money in its pocket by putting that person in to fill that particular position.  But that is all beside the point.</P>
      <P>The fact which remains is that we have paid £1,000 a year more to the Governor-General during each of the past four years than we have paid to the Minister who has introduced this Bill.  When we are talking about the comparative costs of State functionaries, let this Government remember and let the country remember that during each of the past four years the Governor-General was twice as costly to this country as any Minister in this country.  That is the perspective in which we must look at the Governor-General. That is the real yard-stick to put on the Governor-General, and not the fantastic and outrageous salary of £10,000 a year which was paid to his predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That could not be justified by any reasonable body of people, nor could £2,000 a year be justified for whatever functions, if any, the recently demised Governor-General performed in his particular position.  Yet, we are being asked to make this lavish payment to a man who during the past four years as Governor-General has done practically nothing for the very handsome salary of £2,000 a year which was paid to him.  What have been the functions of the Governor-General during the <Col N="639" /> past four years?  Everybody knows he has lived the life of a recluse. Everybody knows, of course, that the man has been compelled to live a hermitical life, locked up in the building provided for him by the Government at the State's expense.  I wonder whether the Government regard that as a kind of sacrifice, as something which they ought to pay for in this particularly lavish way?  So far as one can see, his only outward functions were to sign an occasional Bill during the past four years.  Judging by the scale of salary he was paid during that period he probably got £100 for every signature he put to a Bill.  Yet, for work of that kind, the Government comes along now to make a grant of £2,000, and a blank cheque for whatever the Governor-General likes to fill in, and a pension of £500 a year.  One would imagine that a person with such menial tasks to perform during the past four years, and with such generous wages for performing those menial tasks&mdash;£10,000 in four years, because that is the way it will work out when this Bill is passed&mdash;had already been generously treated by the State.  I, personally, do not regard Mr. Donal Buckley as having made any great sacrifice, either personal or national, when he was called to render those menial services to the State at a salary of £2,000 per year.  Hundreds of thousands of people in this country could be got to discharge tasks of that kind for a very much lesser salary than was paid to the Governor-General during that period.</P>
    <P>I was interested in examining the reasons given for the payment of this pension to the ex-Governor-General. The claim for the payment of it could hardly be based on the assumption that he was overworked, or that he performed any exceptionally arduous tasks during the past four years, nor I suggest can it be urged in justification of this Bill that he made any sacrifice of a personal or national character, having regard to the salary which he was paid.  On what grounds, then, is it sought to justify this Bill? Is it sought to justify it on the grounds that Mr. Buckley was compelled to make certain business sacrifices?  The <Col N="640" /> facts are entirely opposed even to that conception of justification for a Bill of this kind.  In 1932 Mr. Buckley was an unsuccessful candidate for the Dáil. He was then called to serve as Governor-General, to the tune of £2,000 per annum.  After giving four years' service he is now to be given a State pension of £500 per annum.</P>
    <P>Is there any civil servant or member of any State force in the country who would get a pension of £500 a year after four years service performed in such congenial surroundings as those in which the ex-Governor-General performed his duties?  Recently, on the Post Office Estimate, I urged the Minister for Posts to give a gratuity to a part-time postman&mdash;Dan McGrath&mdash; who had served the Post Office for 51 years.  Dan McGrath, a part-time postman of Tipperary, could not get a farthing gratuity from this Government although he had served the State for 51 years, but Dan Buckley, who served the State for four years, gets a pension of £500 per annum, with £2,000 thrown in.  How, in the name of Heaven, does the Executive Council justify that lopsided treatment of an individual under this Bill and the miserable, niggardly treatment of the other official who served the State for 51 years and who had not the 200th part of the ex-Governor-General's salary?  A sum of £500 a year is, apparently, necessary to solace the ex-Governor-General.</P>
    <P>The generosity of the Executive Council in this matter is in very marked contrast with the niggardly treatment meted out to old I.R.A. men who have been trying to get pensions under the Army Pensions Act.  I had a letter the other day from a woman in Carlow whose late husband was certified by a doctor with well-known Fianna Fáil sympathies to have lost his life as a result of his incarceration in British jails.  The woman said that she had read with considerable interest a speech by the Minister for Defence in which he said that it was the policy of Fianna Fáil to put not merely butter on the people's bread but to put on a little jam as well.  This woman, with six children, without a halfpenny of income except the miserable pittance she may get in the form of home assistance and with notice of eviction lying <Col N="641" /> on the kitchen table, said her trouble was not to get bread with butter and jam but to get any bread at all.  Her husband had a claim in for a pension for four years.  No decision has yet been come to on that claim, but, if this woman is awarded her husband's pension, it will not amount to £500 a year.  Yet, in a couple of months after the abolition of his office, we find a Bill introduced to pay a sum of £500 a year to an unnecessary functionary such as the Governor-General.  Old I.R.A. men cannot get decisions on their pension claims.  When they do get decisions, they find that the amounts are niggardly and miserable and do not take adequate cognisance of the services they rendered.  Not a single one of them, I suppose, got a pension equal to that which it is proposed to give in this case.  Hundreds of them got niggardly, miserable pensions for their services to the nation. All the generosity and all the munificence is reserved for the ex-Governor-General.</P>
    <P>I understand that the ex-Governor-General is a native of Maynooth.  In Maynooth a man with a wife and five hungry children will get only 12/6 a week unemployment assistance.  A sum of 12/6 a week in Maynooth, to which the Governor-General will probably go back to reside, is expected to keep a man with a wife and five children.  But, when it comes to an ex-Governor-General, he cannot exist on less than £500 a year.  If 12/6 is good enough for a man with a wife and five children living in the same place as the ex-Governor-General, will the Executive Council tell us on what ground they justify the payment of this sum for services which were not worth anything like a pension of £500 per annum?  We are told that people in receipt of unemployment assistance cannot get a halfpenny more than they are getting&mdash; and this from an Executive Council which proposes to pay £500 a year, plus a tidy stipend of £2,000 in lieu of notice.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking that the generosity enshrined in this Bill is in very marked contrast with the treatment meted out to, at least, one employee of the ex-Governor-General. <Col N="642" /> I have no permission from the person concerned to say what I am now about to say.  But what I have to say will stand the searchlight of truth, and I put it before the Dáil so that it may see the two sides of this problem.  If Deputy Briscoe were in the House, he would probably confirm what I am going to say, because he knows the facts.  A man came to me recently and said he was an employee of the Governor-General to whom it is now proposed to make these payments.  He had been employed there for four years and lost his employment in consequence of the abolition of the office.  He is a widower with three young children depending upon him.  His employment with the Governor-General was not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  That employment was precipitately cut off and, since then, he has not been able to get any outside employment.  He was dismissed and not a farthing compensation was given him nor did the State try to absorb him into any other employment.  Contrast the treatment of that man with three young children depending upon him, with the treatment of the ex-Governor-General, who is being treated in a manner which almost rivals the play, &ldquo;Brewster's Millions,&rdquo; which some of us saw some years ago.  I should like the Executive Council to get somebody to justify this proposal apart from their majority in this House which can be regimented to vote for this Bill, even though many of them do not like the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government is now proposing to set up a committee to inquire into the salaries and other emoluments of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and officers of this House and the House to be created.  Why not ask that committee to examine this matter, even though it be normally outside its terms of reference?  Why not get an impartial examination by a committee of that kind, so that the nation as a whole may learn of the grounds on which it is sought to justify such a lavish payment as is proposed in this Bill?  This Bill has no authority at all behind it except the authority of the Executive Council who are looking on this matter not in an impartial way but purely in a <Col N="643" /> Party way.  There is no justification whatever for the lavish payment provided for in this measure.  If the Government wanted to make any amends which they felt they ought to make to the ex-Governor-General, they could very easily have set up a committee to see what compensation, if any, should be paid to him.  They could easily have asked this other committee which is being set up to examine and report on the matter, but the Executive Council know perfectly well that no impartial body in the country could be got to recommend the payment of a pension of £500 a year, plus a lump sum of £2,000, plus a blank cheque, to a man who has performed the trivial, menial tasks of the ex-Governor-General during the last four years.  This is an outrageous Bill.  It cannot possibly be justified on any grounds of loss, on any grounds of sacrifice whatever.  It is purely a Bill to give a pension to a Party supporter and there is no justification from any national standpoint for treating the ex-Governor-General in this generous way.  I am opposed to this Bill.  I think no case whatever has been made for it.  I do not think there is any authority from the people to treat this ex-Governor-General in this way, and I challenge the Government to take off the Whips and try to get this Bill passed on a free vote.  They know perfectly well that they dare not do it.</P>

      <P>My comments will not be very many on this matter, but, first, I want it to be clearly understood that anything I say is not to be taken as reflecting in any way upon Donal Buckley.  He was, and is, a very decent man, and all I want to say is that my objection to this Bill is an objection to a pension for a Governor-General. Deputy Tom Kelly thinks that this pension is being granted to him because he was out in 1916.  There is already on the Statute Book a Pensions Act for dealing with such cases and, as Deputy Norton has rightly pointed out, the best of them will not get a pension of that amount.  Even lumping them all together, 1916, 1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923, they will not come <Col N="644" /> up to £500.  This whole question is befogged by the Government's representations. They are in a difficulty because we know all the things they said about the previous holder of the position and about the salary of £10,000 and so on, prior to taking office.  Deputy Fitzgerald endeavoured to point out, by way of explanation what the actual salary of the previous holder was; £10,000 was put down, but, as established before the Public Accounts Committee, £6,000 of that were for expenses in the national interest.  These expenses are now being incurred under the Department of External Affairs for banquets in Dublin Castle, and so on, but the Revenue Commissioners found&mdash;the reference is page 112 of the Public Accounts Report of 1934, in reply to question 816&mdash;that the figure of expenses out of the £10,000 was £6,000, spent by the Governor-General on State functions, acting, I presume, under the instructions of the Government of the day, and that £4,000 was his net salary.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will be as meticulous in speaking as the President was when he spoke a moment ago.  The President said that when he called on Dan Buckley to occupy the office of Governor-General, it was nearly as grave an undertaking as going out in 1916.  Is that the way to treat this House or the country, that the head of the State should make a statement like that or that the Minister for Finance should butt in with the remark he made just now?  The Revenue Commissioners found that the expenses <Col N="645" /> the Governor-General had were £6,000 and the sum that should be classed as salary was £4,000, which was then subject to income-tax, and they assessed the previous holders of the office on £4,000.  When you take income-tax off £4,000 of salary, you will find you will not be very far above the £2,000 the present holder has.</P>
      <P>This is all humbug.  I do not think there is any other word I can use. The Government finds itself in a difficulty now, and they were in that difficulty from the moment they assumed office.  They had gone around the country telling the people that the Governor-General was receiving £10,000, that the President and Ministers of State were too highly paid and that they were going to cut them down.  They did it, and when they took office they found it was not all as they expected it to be.  I think this is simply a case of chickens coming home to roost, and it is good enough. They are taking some steps, I believe, to correct that, but so far as Mr. Buckley is concerned, I only hope the man will live for the next 999 years, that he will live to the age of Methuselah's cat, so that we will have a living memorial to the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil administration and that he will not be blown up by Deputy Tom Kelly, or anybody like him, and thrown off his horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton has rightly pointed out that men with records, men who gave service and suffered injury, hardship and wounds are being treated in a most niggardly fashion by this and&mdash; I am going to say it&mdash;the previous Government, but that in cases like these Fianna Fáil can take the big jump and give a man £500 a year pension for a Governor-Generalship.  If the President got up to justify it and said: &ldquo;The Governor-General was out in 1916 and took part in all the activities of 1921, 1922, 1923&rdquo;&mdash;as I am aware he did&mdash;&ldquo;and instead of putting him through the military service pensions code we propose to give him a pension of £500 a year,&rdquo; I would say more power to him; it is recognition at last for people who gave service. That would be tip-top, but it is not for <Col N="646" /> that this pension is being given.  It is for the abolition of the office of Governor-General about which so much has been said.  I want to stress this point as to the relative salaries.  The difference between the salaries of Donal Buckley, James McNeill and Tim Healy&mdash;Lord have mercy on him &mdash;is not £1,000, and then you have the President of the State, and the national organ of the State, the <i>Irish Press</i>, declaring that £32,000 was saved in four years.  It is easy to see that there is an uneasy conscience behind this and that there is a general election in the offing.  There is another reason that the Government could put forward in defence of this measure, but they have not done it.  Every Government that falsely or illegally imprisons a person for any length of time and then gives him a free pardon has to compensate him.  I think that the proper justification for this compensation and this pension would be as compensation for imprisoning Dan Buckley for four years in Monkstown.</P>

If they were giving it to him for that, and if the Minister for Education stated here in the House, &ldquo;I am putting this forward because, as Quarter-Master of the 1st Midland Division in 1922 and 1923, he rendered good service to the country and served with me,&rdquo; I would then say that there was some justification for it.  But it is not for that.  It is for acting as the King's representative in Monkstown or, alternatively, it is compensation for this false imprisonment, and therefore I am going to vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Opposition Party, as expressed in the newspaper organs which represent their point of view and here in the Dáil, has certainly changed somewhat since 1934 when the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, a prominent member of the Opposition Party, suggested that the £2,000 being granted to the Governor-General should not be assessed as salary at all.  In column 112 of the Minutes of Evidence of the Public Accounts Committee of 20th June, 1934, the following is reported:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Chairman: I quite agree that the present Governor-General might have everything free of income-tax but that would be on the ground that he had no income, only an allowance for expenses.  Therefore, I think that the £2,000 should not be assessed as salary at all.  It should appear in the Estimates or in the Appropriation Accounts as a payment made to him in relation to his expenses and should really be under sub-head B as an allowance to the Governor-General for expenses.  If it is not an allowance for expenses, then he is bound to pay income-tax and the salary he draws is the complete amount, <Col N="648" /> including any that may be deducted for income-tax.</P>

Our position is that we have taken responsibility for bringing this matter before the Dáil, and we are prepared to say to the Dáil that we have examined this question and that we are quite satisfied that the proposal which we have now placed before the Dáil only makes what we consider sufficient and proper provision for a gentleman who has held the office of Seanascal in this State.</P>

      <P>Imputations have been hurled at the Government that there is some question of corruption and jobbery in this matter, and I think I can best answer the rather sneering remarks of Deputy Norton by pointing out again, if it be necessary, that before Deputy Norton was very prominently known in Irish national affairs, Domhnal O Buachalla had a long and honourable record of service, which was not alone shown in his work for the Gaelic League and for Irish industry, but which was proved beyond a shadow <Col N="649" /> of doubt when, although a comparatively old man, he went out in the Easter Week Rising.  Deputy MacEoin has suggested, by the way, that the President, in his speech, stated that Mr. Buckley's taking up the position of Governor-General was somewhat on a par with his going out in Easter Week.  Of course, the President said no such thing.  In reply to an interruption to the effect that Mr. Buckley knew he would not be in a position to return to his business, the President said, &ldquo;Yes, and in 1916 he knew he might not go back.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it is pretended that there is anything in the record of this gentleman to show that he was at any time disposed to take the easy line in national affairs, or to place the question of emoluments or remuneration in the first place, I think the sneers of Deputy Norton might perhaps be justified.  But, I certainly think it is rather strange that a Deputy who represents an area from which, Dan Buckley happens to come should institute comparisons between matters like unemployment assistance, the old I.R.A., and so on, and the proposal now before the House &mdash;analogies which are entirely irrelevant, and which, in any case, are not intended to be, let me say, honest, but to give an entirely false impression to the country.  It is my duty, at any rate, to express to the House the view of the Government&mdash;that we are quite satisfied that this provision which is now being made by us, and which we have placed before the Dáil, must be made, and we hope that the House will agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On other occasions we have heard complaints being made that men who have given honoured public service and have held high positions in the State should not remain unprovided for.  One knows the difficulties they may sometimes have in taking up their ordinary avocations.  When a period is extended to five years, or as often happens, to ten years, then it becomes extremely difficult for people who have given service in their own way to the country to come back and take up the threads where they left them off and pursue their work in the ordinary way.  These <Col N="650" /> considerations apply in a special manner to Mr. O Buachalla.  He was called upon to take up a specially important position, to which in one way or another a great deal of odium had been attached, and which undoubtedly rendered it extremely difficult for any Irishman, particularly for one of Mr. O Buachalla's well-known opinions, to take it up with that spirit with which he would in other circumstances, no doubt, have taken it up.  In the particular circumstances of the time it was an extremely difficult position for Mr. O Buachalla to accept.  It is because we realise that he made a big sacrifice that we are making this provision now. It was not in accordance with his own wish he accepted and occupied the post, but because of a desire to give of his best in whatever position the Government required, that Mr. O Buachalla took up the post.  The question of emoluments never arose at the time. So far as he was concerned it was not mentioned.  At no time did we consult Mr. O Buachalla about the question of emoluments.</P>
    <P>When I heard the lamentations of Deputy Norton about this provision of £500 a year and a lump sum of £2,000 which is provided for Mr. O Buachalla, and when I read in certain newspapers rather vicious attacks in connection with the Government and the action it has taken up, I wondered those newspapers did not in any way dissociate themselves from the personal attack on the gentleman in question.  When I hear of these things, I feel that it is our duty to lay before the House the considerations which prompted us to bring in this Estimate and to make this provision.  The first consideration was the feeling that we took a gentleman from his ordinary business and put him in a position which at that time was the highest position in the State.</P>

      <P>When the last two occupants of the office drew emoluments <Col N="651" /> that were very much greater in a single year than Mr. O Buachalla has drawn altogether, there were no complaints. Indeed, what the last occupants drew in a single year was almost as great as what Mr. O Buachalla has drawn in four.  The position then was that apparently any figure that was mentioned and agreed upon by the Government of the day was considered fitting and suitable for the person who held the position of Governor-General. As far as I remember, the expenditure during the period of the two previous Governors-General ran up to about £26,000 a year of which about £10,000 represented personal salary.  Even in this year's Estimates the personal salary for Mr. O Buachalla stands at a figure of £10,000 although during the four years in which he occupied the office he has not taken in personal salary the amount he is entitled to draw in a single year.  So that while the other Governors-General have drawn sums amounting to £48,000 or £50,000 during their periods of office, Mr. O Buachalla has, on account of the substantial refund made to the Exchequer, taken a salary of only £2,000 a year.  He got only £8,000 in all against £48,000 or £50,000 drawn by his predecessors.</P>

      <P>I was saying that Mr. O Buachalla was called upon at very short notice to terminate his office. <Col N="652" /> Ordinarily his period of office would naturally have to end about the end of this year, so that apart from whatever financial loss might be incurred by reason of the fact that no notice was given by which proper arrangements might be made for the termination of his services, the fact was that at a very short notice, arrangements had to be made by him.  The office of Governor-General was suddenly abolished and the Government are not going to take up the position that the gentleman who against his will and entirely out of a feeling to do whatever his duty to his country called upon him to do, and to do it at a rather critical stage, is to be left unprovided for when he relinquishes that office in circumstances into which I need not enter.  When the general prestige of the office of Governor-General was by no means inviting, even to the most mercenary person, when there was a good deal of odium attached to it, Mr. O Buachalla came forward, not through any desire of his own, as was consistent with his whole career, or for any prestige or personal advancement but solely on national grounds and because he believed it was his duty to do it in the national interest.  Then we are going to see, as the Government that was responsible for putting him in that position, and as the Government that is equally responsible for terminating his services rather suddenly, that provision will be made for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred also to the question of some employee of the ex-Governor-General. They were, as far as I remember, some employees of the previous Governor-General.  They were not employees of the State.  If they had been State employees, no doubt the question of their absorption into other employment might be considered, but as they were not, the question of providing alternative employment cannot be regarded as a State obligation.  Having regard to the fact that Mr. O Buachalla held the highest position in the State, that he drew only a fraction of his salary and that the total expenditure of his establishment during the term that he held it was less than £5,000 a year, whereas previously and up to the term of office <Col N="653" /> of the late occupant, it had run up to £26,000 a year, there is clear proof that we are cutting down the emoluments now to the barest minimum consistent with attaching some degree of dignity and comfort to the position which Mr. O Buachalla held.  It was fixed at a very minimum and there is no use in Deputy Norton or anybody else pretending that a person who occupied that position could live on the allowance of a Deputy or that, in the nature of things at that time, he could exist on any lesser sum or have smaller sums allowed for both his salary and expenses than were allowed when he took up office.</P>
    <P>If I were to institute a comparison between the salaries and allowances of trade union leaders and the amount which persons in receipt of home assistance, or unemployment assistance, or persons who are in a very destitute state, receive from the State, I have no doubt that I could make a very interesting if rather invidious comparison.  I have no desire, either in the case of Mr. O Buachalla, or anybody else, to go into these personal matters, but I certainly think that Deputy Norton has been distinetly unfair to Mr. O Buachalla when he made the suggestion that in some way that gentleman is responsible for raising this question or that he is in any way interested in getting any profit or emolument from the State. Deputy Norton has entirely neglected the simple question that we, as the Government of the day, are the persons in a position best fitted to judge this matter.  Having all the facts before us, and having considered all the relevant circumstances, we consider that the provision that is proposed is proper and suitable, and we do not propose to go further into the personal issue or to go into the personal affairs of the gentleman in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin suggested that the Government should have done this in some other way.  The Government have come before the Dáil in the manner in which this matter should be dealt with.  We have no notion whatever of shriking public opinion on this <Col N="654" /> question, or of shirking opinion here in the Dáil.  We believe, when the question is fully understood, and when regard is had to the nature of this position, the emoluments of Mr. O Buachalla's predecessors and the circumstances under which he took up the office and eventually relinquished it, it will be considered by every person capable of examining this question in a judicial manner that we are only doing what is right and proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, this situation, since the publication of this Bill, has been grotesque, and the more we discuss it the more grotesque it becomes.  I do not really know whether some new tradition has not grown up in this country now.  There was a time in our fathers' and grandfathers' day, and in the day of those who went before them, when, if you did make a sacrifice for the country, and if you did get a certain amount of popular esteem for your patriotism in making that sacrifice, you considered yourself more than adequately rewarded for what you had done.  You felt you had done your public duty and you made no more bones about it. But now, if you keep a dog that barked at a Black and Tan, you hurry in and call loudly for a pension. If you take a job for which you get £2,000 a year and expenses and a free house, when it is taken from you, you come in and clamour for a pension. And you not only want a pension, but you want a lump sum and your debts paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has it ceased to be a meritorious thing to serve your country at all?  I must say there are more disagreeable ways of serving your country than taking £2,000 a year and a free house and expenses, though some people may find that a great trial, a heavy cross to bear.  Is the fact that in undergoing that trial they have served their country not sufficient reward without this elaborate financial provision being made?  I would have no complaint at all if this decent man had taken the job and said: &ldquo;The salary is £10,000 a year, and so long as that is going I will take it,&rdquo; put it in his pocket and made no bones about it, taking what the men before <Col N="655" /> him got and asking no different treatment. But what has happened?  In order to discredit and insult the predecessors of Mr. Buckley in this office, when Mr. Buckley was made Governor-General he was induced by the President of the Executive Council to make a handsome gesture, to vindicate President de Valera, in saying that the salary of the Governor-General was excessive.  Mr. Dan Buckley said: &ldquo;I will be glad to do the job for £2,000, and indeed that is ample,&rdquo; and there was a great virtue in that.</P>
    <P>Comparisons were drawn between the rich man's Government, extravagant President Cosgrave lashing the public money on his personal friends, and ascetic, pure-souled President de Valera getting his patriotic supporter to come forward and accept a simple solatium.  The whole country was lost in admiration at this wonderful gesture.  There were pathetic speeches made from the Fianna Fáil Benches about the nobility and handsomeness of Mr. Dan Buckley, how he stepped into the gap and, being really one of the plain people, asked only a fair salary and would take no more the scorned Saxon shilling.  But when you paint the Saxon shilling green, white and gold, Mr. Dan Buckley is prepared to take his share of it as well as everybody else, and not only that, but a larger share than anybody else asked for.  He wants what no Governor-General ever expected to enjoy, a life pension.</P>
    <P>So far as Mr. Buckley himself is concerned, I wish him long life to enjoy it. I hope he will beggar the Treasury before he lies down to die.  I hope he will beggar the Treasury and that he will have health and happiness for many a long day.  It is nothing short of grotesque when one throws one's mind back to the song and dance that was made about the disinterested rejection by this noblehearted patriot of the remuneration granted to other Governors-General.  Now a Bill is being brought in to pay his debts, to give him a lump sum, and to furnish him with a life pension.  My God, when you compare that with the position of men who were run off their holdings <Col N="656" /> into poverty on the roadside and who never dreamed of asking the country for anything, but went to the roadside or emigrated because they believed it was their patriotic duty to do so; when you think of the men who ran out of this country with prices on their heads, who left their wives and families to fare what way they could; when you think of men who spent, in their sickness as well as in their health, long terms of imprisonment, hard labour and penal servitude, and never dreamed of asking anything of the country, what can you think?</P>
    <P>Here you have a gentleman whose sole contribution in respect of this pension&mdash;do not let me be understood as in any way aspersing or belittling anything this man did in 1916; it was a very gallant thing for a man of his age to do, but that is not being considered in regard to this pension&mdash;whose sole activity is that he took a job at £2,000 a year, more than the man probably ever earned before in his life, that he got a comfortable house in Dun Laoghaire and found himself better off than he was before, and, as the Minister for Education says in moving accents, occupying the highest position in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether President de Valera will compliment the Minister for Education when he examines the Official Reports, because I think the President was labouring under the belief up to now that he occupies the highest position in the State.  However, from this on he will have to realise that up to very recently he was playing second fiddle to Dan Buckley. I do not know how he will like that, but that is the fact as stated on the authority of a member of the Executive Council.  For that immense sacrifice of occupying the first position in the State at £2,000 a year with allowances and a fine house, he is to have all his debts paid, debts contracted and arising out of the occupancy of that position, and is to get a lump sum of £2,000 and a pension of £500 a year.  When you compare him with the unfortunate patriots who thought they were patriots in the last century, and when you compare their contribution to the fight to make this country free, and the reward they <Col N="657" /> got with the historic labour that has been done to justify the award of this pension, and the measure of the award, it is certainly enough to make a cat laugh.</P>
    <P>Nobody here wants to sneer at Mr. Buckley himself, and I believe if the decent man was let alone that he would have done this thing in the right way.  He would have taken his £10,000 a year, and said nothing about it.  But what makes me sick is the hypocrisy, the fraudulent hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party who induced this poor old man to get up and make a show of himself before the whole country, and who did it to get a little bit of cheap political capital four years ago.  They &ldquo;cashed-in&rdquo; for all they were worth at that time.  They were the Government of the plain people; they did not believe in high salaries; they did not want any extravagances, and they now force this respectable man to come hat in hand clamouring to get what he magnanimously rejected four years ago.  This is a very nasty business.</P>
    <P>Let us clear up one point because an attempt is being made to confuse the issue.  Mr. James MacNeill was the Governor-General of this country, and the late Mr. T.M. Healy was his predecessor in that office.  They made no bones about taking their salary. They sought to have no part of their expenses removed from the Appropriation Account or from the Central Fund service when it was laid before the Dáil.  An attempt is now being made by the Minister for Education, and by the Minister for Finance, to suggest that the finding that £6,000 of that £10,000 was spent in expenses arising out of the office of the Governor-General, was a finding made by the Executive Council.  That simply is not true.  It was a finding submitted by, I think, the Minister to the Revenue Commissioners who declined to accept his certificate, and insisted on their right to check over the Governor-General's accounts.  They did so check them, and having done so declared that they found that £6,000 of his salary was properly charged to expenses and they then levied income-tax <Col N="658" /> on the remaining £4,000, which brought Mr. MacNeill's salary and Mr. Healy's salary down probably to the neighbourhood of £3,000 a year or less.</P>
    <P>Now, they made no complaint about that, and they desired the people to believe that they were getting £10,000 from the Treasury and all their expenses.  They insisted on that appearing in the accounts to be debated in Dáil Eireann, and the matter was debated very eloquently by President de Valera.  In column 493, volume 25 of the Parliamentary Debates for 1928, Mr. de Valera made his position very clear.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are against the spending of that £20,000 because we believe that there ought not to be a penny more than is absolutely necessary spent on any Administration that is not reproductive... We believe that from £10,000 to £15,000 can quite easily be saved on that establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he proceeded to compare the Governor-General here with the President of the United States, and he said it was wrong.  He made a speech of about half an hour, but it is not worth reading it because he repudiates it all in what he is doing at the present time. The point that I want to make is this: that those men insisted that whatever moneys they got would be made the subject of debate in this House, and that there would be no covering or concealment. They held themselves open to whatever weapons might be hurled at them by the Fianna Fáil Party, and plenty were so hurled.</P>
    <P>This man is held up as a reformer, as the person who, in his rejection of the full salary, vindicates all that President de Valera had said when he was in opposition and vindicates the attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition.  And now we have this Bill.  It will leave a nasty taste in everybody's mouth, and to tell the truth the most regrettable part of it is that this decent man should be made the subject of as much ridicule and jest as he must be throughout the country when the people come to read this.  If he had been let do it decently, nobody could have pointed the finger of scorn at him.  I believe that, so far as Mr. <Col N="659" /> Buckley is concerned, if he had been let alone he would have taken whatever salary attached to the post, and then nobody could have any reason to complain; but through the hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party he is being manoeuvred into a position in which it is extremely difficult for him to justify himself.  He will be left open to a great deal of adverse comment all through the country which really should not fall on his head, but which ought to be directed at the people who made a tool of him, and who manoeuvred him into the humiliating and shameless position in which he is found to-day.  There are some matters arising on this Bill which can more properly be raised on the Committee Stage.  I, therefore, propose to postpone any further observations that I have to make until the Committee Stage is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing grotesque about this debate is the futility of the Opposition.  If I am in order in doing so, I think I may describe it as hot air, meant not for this House but for the country for the coming elections.  The President has given the House some figures as to the saving in the amounts paid to the late Governor-General during his four years of office.  He said they averaged about £4,000 per annum.  During the years that the office was occupied by the late Mr. T.M. Healy and Mr. James MacNeill it cost the State about £26,000 a year.  The comparative figures, therefore, are £26,000 a year for ten years or so, and £4,000 a year during the last four years.  That means a difference of £22,000 a year.  If you multiply this last figure by four, you get £88,000.  The interest on that sum, at 5 per cent., would be over £4,000. The sum so saved to the State was sufficient to meet all that was given to the late Governor-General in the way of salary and expenses, and makes a good answer for the proposed payment of a gratuity of £2,000 and a pension of £500 a year to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very easy thing to be a good business man when you <Col N="660" /> have figures like that, and, no matter what attempt has been made by the Opposition to cloak the actual state of affairs, the figures are there for everybody in the country to see for them selves, and no attempt that has been made, or that can be made, to mislead the people, will succeed in doing so, so long as the figures are there.  The figures prove that if Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal, as the Party was then called, were still in office, the office of the Governor-General would have cost this country, in the last four years, £104,000, as against the £16,000 that the country had to pay for that office while Mr. Buckley held it. These are the facts, and, no matter what speeches may be made, the people of this country will not be misled so long as they can see these figures for themselves.</P>
      <P>I think it comes rather badly from the Fine Gael Party&mdash;or Cumann na nGaedheal, as it was formerly known&mdash; to pretend to get such a rude shock with regard to the granting of gratuities or pensions in this country.  The granting of gratuities or pensions is not a new thing.  It is certainly not a new thing so far as the Fine Gael Party were concerned.  Big gratuities and big pensions were given in the past.  They have not been attacked by us, and I shall not attack them now, but, according to the speeches we have heard to-day, one would imagine that it was the first time in the history of the Free State Government that such a thing as this had happened.  One would imagine, to listen to the speeches that were made, that such a thing as this could not have happened in the time of the Fine Gael Government.  We all know what happened; but perhaps we will be told that, if gratuities or pensions were given then, they were given for good service.  I am not saying that they were not given for good service, but I do say that when this sum is being voted for Mr. Buckley, he certainly gave good service, so far as any of us can understand the meaning of good service, and so far as anybody can appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told all about the nice salary he had, and about the amount of expenses he had to incur. <Col N="661" /> We are told that his expenses were very small, having regard to the nature of the position he held.  It must be remembered, however, that he came forward at a time in this country when we believed that a certain advance had to be made, and that he did his job faithfully and well. We had to find somebody in whom we could place implicit faith, and, no matter how people may sneer now, anybody who knows Mr. Buckley's record in the past, knows that that position must have been very distasteful to him.  Nevertheless, he did that job, and fulfilled his trust faithfully.  We know, of course, that there are people, such as Deputy McMenamin, who do not understand such things.  We know that there are people who think that anybody would jump at the chance of £2,000 a year, but many of us know that there are sufficient people still in this country who are not prepared to sacrifice their principles for the sake of £2,000 a year, and I think we can say that we are all glad to know that there are still people in this country, such as Mr. Buckley, who are not willing to put the question of money before the question of nationalism.</P>
    <P>However, I do not want to go into the hypocritical statements that were made here to-day.  As I have said, the plain, ordinary people of the country can see for themselves the difference between the money it would have cost this country, if somebody else were Governor-General, under the régime of the former Government, and what it has cost while Mr. Buckley held that office.  When we took <Col N="662" /> the lowest possible estimate of what the expenses of his office must have been, we found that he has not been able to save anything or to provide for the declining years of his life, and I hold that it is the duty of this country&mdash;and I think that every decent and honest Irishman will accept it whole-heartedly&mdash;to see that he, having accepted that post in accordance with the wishes of the President of the Executive Council, should have at least enough to live on in the declining years of his life.  That is what we have come to this House to ask for, and we have come to ask for nothing more.  I do not think there is anybody who does not appreciate what Mr. Buckley has done, and I must say that I do not think much of the hypocritical statements to which we have listened in this House to-day.  As a matter of fact, I think that, in putting forward these hypocritical statements, the people who put them forward will not find the favourable reaction they hoped to get from the people of the country.  Before I conclude, Sir, I should like to refer to one point in connection with the Governor-General's expenses, which was made by, I think, Deputy MacEoin.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £8,730 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1938, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Roinn Uachtarán na hArd-Chomhairle (Uimh. 16 de 1924).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,730 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1938, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the President of the Executive Council (No. 16 of 1924).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, looking at the Book of Estimates, will note that the Estimate this year shows an increase of £1,463. That increase is due to two or three factors.  There are, first of all, normal incremental changes, increased provision for bonuses calculated on a higher cost-of-living figure, the replacement of a post of typist by that of shorthand-typist and the creation of a post of writing assistant.  In addition, there is the extra provision which has been made, as indicated already to the Dáil by me when the Estimates were being published, for salaries, wages and allowances in connection with the office of President and the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the President. There is also, I think, an increase of £60, due to incidentals, these incidentals including an item which has arisen in connection with the duty of giving public notice of the intention to make Orders in regard to certain specified commodities.  As the Orders are made by the Executive Council that charge falls upon the Executive Council.  As far as the Estimate itself is concerned, I do not think it <Col N="665" /> is necessary to give any further explanation.</P>

      <P>I should like to discuss, not any particular item in the Estimate, but rather the manner in which the President has fulfilled his duty as President of the Executive Council.  I can understand his not being in a position to know exactly what the issues to be raised on this particular Vote will be.  I am not raising at all the question of his making a statement on this Vote, but when he comes to discuss the Vote for External Affairs I hope he will be able to give us some survey on which to found useful discussion. His general conduct of the affairs of the nation can come under review here.  Therefore, it is reasonable enough that he should, in this case, follow his usual practice.  I think, Sir, that the country would feel much easier in its mind, and those who have the welfare of the country at heart certainly would feel easier in their minds, if the President had given some evidence during the last couple of months of devoting his attention to the real issues that are facing the State, rather than devoting it, as apparently he has done, to what to many of us here &mdash;and I am confident to many people in the country&mdash;would seem rather to be side shows.  I think the man occupying the position of President of the Executive Council in this State at the present moment might have been better employed in facing some of the real problems that concern this country than in frittering away his energies, his time, and his attention on matters which the country considers, and certainly we consider, to be of comparatively slight importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking now of the way in which apparently a great deal of his time during the last couple of months was devoted to the working out of the Constitution.  I think it would have been much better had he faced certain other problems that the country considers to be much more real, much more vital, than providing people with a ready-made Constitution, which they can take or leave when the time for the so-called plebiscite comes.  There are issues to which the President <Col N="666" /> should have devoted his attention. There are issues to which the country expects him to devote his attention, and yet, so far as any achievement is concerned, all we can say is there is no evidence that he has given the slightest attention to them.  Those matters have not been advanced one single step in the 12 months since we were discussing this Estimate last. As the President knows, at election times it is usual for the rumour to be sent around that, owing to some sudden circumstances which have arisen, a settlement of various disputes is imminent.  I presume that, in the next couple of weeks, we will have a recrudescence of these rumours.</P>

I have no doubt that the word will go around from the Executive Council &ldquo;Now, boys, start.&rdquo;  I told the President before that I had from a very high authority a rumour coming from a person very high in the Cabinet that a settlement was imminent. That is 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious, unfortunately, that the President has given no evidence that he has been active in this matter.  He has been frittering away his time on a Constitution which, unfortunately, few people seem to understand, and which they certainly care nothing about.  It has been impossible, as the House will remember, to elicit from the President by means of Parliamentary questions any information as to whether or not he was going to attend the Imperial Conference.  It was only in the last few weeks that a quite definite answer was got from him on that particular matter.  As far as we can judge&mdash;we can only form our judgments on such scanty information as the President affords to this House&mdash; the Government did not seem to have made up its mind as to whether they had a policy on that particular matter or not.  Personally, I fail to see on what grounds the Executive Council <Col N="667" /> and the President ultimately decided that we would not be represented at that conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I to be told that there was any matter of principle at stake?  Does anybody pretend that that Government and that Party are more republican now than they were in 1932?  Surely, so far as that is concerned, there has been retrogression instead of advance. Yet, apparently it was not against any principles that this country should be represented at such a conference in 1932 by the Vice-President and other Ministers.  What was the principle at stake which prevented their attending this conference?  Was it mere pettishness of some kind?  Why was there no attendance?  Surely the President has been long enough in office to know the advantages which, in the past, have come to this country from the attendance at those conferences of members of the Government&mdash;men representing this State in various capacities. Nobody can deny the importance of every one of those conferences&mdash;the conference of 1923, and especially that of 1926; of 1929 and 1930, and the conference of 1932, which might have been of great importance to this country had proper use been made of it.  There is one thing which must surely be clear to anybody who looks over the events of, say, the last 14 years, and that is the extreme value of taking part in those conferences, the value especially to those who are still members of the Commonwealth.  Is there any principle at stake to prevent our taking part? As far as I can see, there is certainly none which has been enunciated as yet by the President.  Why then was there no representation?  If there are matters of vital interest to this country which we could discuss with the other nations who take part in those conferences, why were we not represented? Surely they are important nations, every one of them.  It ought to be to our interest to take part in what I might call an international gathering of that kind.  Is it that the President and his Government are afraid to take part in those conferences?  Is it that they have not sufficient confidence in themselves? Was their experience of the conference in 1932 such as to give them <Col N="668" /> a lack of confidence, and to make them feel that, on the whole, it might be well if they kept out of conferences of that kind?</P>
    <P>You have there meeting together not merely the representatives of Great Britain, but also of Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, people from whom in the past we have got considerable help when we were putting up the point of view of this country. Is there not any matter of external politics, even where those nations alone are concerned, on which we could get help from a gathering of that kind?  Why is it that when the opportunity offered we spurned it? Surely there are big economic issues&mdash; apart altogether from the economic war, apart from its settlement, apart from its continuance&mdash;at stake in the world at present, and one of those that could be raised and debated is the preference that will be given or continue to be given to what is known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  If that was not on the agenda, is there any reason why this country could not have got it on the agenda?  Or is it that, in these mundane, economic matters, we have no interest?  Do we still think that we can live as if we were isolated from the rest of the world economically?  Are we willing to go into negotiation with other States while we deliberately turn down an opportunity for raising these issues when offered to us?</P>
    <P>I have tried before, and tried in vain, to get information from the President on another question.  I do not know what the Government's view is on the question of defence.  I want a statement on that question.  I am not asking them to decide for one policy or another but let them, at least, tell the country what their policy is.  What is to be the policy in the event of a European War&mdash;a contingency that, when considering matters of defence, must be contemplated? How does the Government expect that we shall keep out of such a war?  Will a mere declaration by us that we are neutral be sufficient for that purpose?  Is the President so much in the clouds or so immersed in the Constitution, which is much the same thing, that he thinks that our <Col N="669" /> decision one way or another will decide a matter of that kind?  When the big Powers are at war, they are not going to consider whether we want to remain neutral or not.  They will consider only the question of what use this country could be to them.  Our neutrality would not be worth a moment's purchase if it suited the war-book of any of the Powers to utilise this country.  What is our policy?  Rely on ourselves alone, regard ourselves as divided from every other country?  I do not see how you can keep out of a European War by wishing to stay out of it.  We may be relying on the League of Nations but, when such a war comes, the function of the League will have ceased.  It would be the function of the League to prevent things reaching that stage but, once there is a general European conflagration, I am afraid the League will not be of much help.</P>
    <P>Have we any defence policy in conjunction with any other nation?  That is a question I put to the President before and I am not aware that I got an answer.  I wonder if the President has any answer to the question or if he is hoping that, no matter what our attitude is, Britain will protect us for her own sake.  Are we going to allow her to do it?  Shall we take steps to allow her to do it?  Have we even considered that problem?  It is not my business to urge policy. I want to know what the policy of the President is, if he has any, and I assert, that on the question of national defence, he ought to have a policy.  Is it to be a policy of splendid isolation or a policy of understanding with other Powers?  If our policy is to be one of splendid isolation, what guarantee have we that our neutrality will be respected by other Powers?</P>
    <P>So far as membership of the Commonwealth is concerned, I do not know what the President means our attitude to be.  I understand that we are still members of that Commonwealth.  Our law states that we are still members. That makes it all the more difficult to understand the failure of the President to take part in this particular conference. I see by this evening's papers <Col N="670" /> that one of the questions to be raised there is the vexed question of citizenship. As the President knows, that is a matter that, for a long time, engaged the attention of the different Governments. Do we take up the attitude that that is a matter in which we have no interest because we have passed legislation dealing with it in this House, and that what happens to Irishmen in England is no concern of ours?  I do not know what difficult problems may be raised in connection with citizenship, but I understand that, at the request of some of the Dominions, the matter has now been placed on the agenda.  Though we are still members of the Commonwealth, do we take up the lordly attitude on that question that we are not interested in it?  Unfortunately, a number of the matters in which the President is not interested vitally affect the interests of the people of this country.  That is why I suggested that the country would have been much more impressed with the leadership of this State by the President if he had devoted his energies and attention to these matters instead of to the&mdash;so far as real advance is concerned&mdash;footling business in which we were engaged last week. I am sorry the President found it necessary to devote such valuable time to matters of that kind and to leave more serious matters in abeyance.  The President himself, on one occasion if not on more than one, voiced his appreciation of the great advances made since 1922.  On one occasion&mdash;I think I am not misquoting him&mdash;he said he could not have believed such advances were possible under the Treaty.  Taking that as representing his view, has he asked himself in what arena these advances were made?  They were made precisely at these conferences which the President has now boycotted. They were made particularly at the 1926 conference and what followed that conference&mdash;the O.D.L. Conference and the conference that led to the Statute of Westminister.  That cannot be denied.  There are a lot of other problems of vital interest which could be discussed at these conferences. We had a very clear example of that in the 1932 conference.  We should have learned from that that there was, at <Col N="671" /> least, a grave lack of wisdom in not making the most of a conference of that kind.  That opportunity was most scandalously misused and the country has been suffering, as a result, ever since.  Now, we have another opportunity which is being thrown aside. Why?  We are still waiting for an answer.  No reason is given save that it &ldquo;must be clear to everybody.&rdquo;  The President thinks that anything that is completely in dispute &ldquo;must be clear to everybody.&rdquo;  One thing that is not clear is the President's failure to use this opportunity.  He does not explain what loss of dignity would be involved in taking part in the conference or how our status would be affected.  He pointed out, in introducing certain Bills recently, that we are still members of the Commonwealth of Nations. We still are and, now that he is no longer occupying the position which he occupied up to last Christmas when, according to the Minister for Finance, he was a Minister of the Crown, surely, there is less risk of loss of dignity by attending these conferences?  What was the objection?  Again and again, efforts have been made to get some explanation but none has been offered. All we see in this and other matters is a shameful neglect of the real interests of the country and the devotion of all the President's own efforts to the Constitution. So far as his own efforts are concerned, it is, perhaps, as well he had something to occupy him.  He might have done more damage if he had been attending to the serious affairs of the country.  Although I take a lenient view wherever the President is concerned, the House has every reason to be dissatisfied with the way in which, for the last 12 months, the Government of this country has been carried on by the Cabinet of which he is President and to be dissatisfied with the conduct of the President himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was coming up from the country to-day, there were 60 young fellows going from the County Mayo to England, fleeing the country as emigrants.  Up to this, the exodus used to be confined to the Friday train, but now it has overflowed on to the Tuesday train.  We are now witnesses, for the first time since I <Col N="672" /> was a very small child, of the old traditional picture of the relatives down at the railway station caoining the departing emigrant.  In the face of that fact, the President of the Executive Council and his Ministers have answered &ldquo;Well, we admit that this tide of emigration is flowing, but if it is, it is flowing no faster than it flowed in the days of our predecessors, and therefore, it ill becomes our predecessors to upbraid us.&rdquo;  I do urge on the President to come down from the Olympian heights on which he has dwelt for the last few years to a recollection of the circumstances with which he is familiar, having been reared in a country house in this country.  During the years 1921 to 1929, the United States of America was an expanding country where there obtained a standard of living far higher than any that obtained in Europe, and the result of it was that from Ireland, Germany, Greece, Italy and every European country there was a strong tide of emigration flowing to America because they wanted there to enjoy the higher standard of living that was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a case of people fleeing from Ireland because they could not get a livelihood in Ireland.  It was a case of people deliberately saying to themselves: &ldquo;The livelihood we can get in Ireland, plus the amenity of living at home, cannot be compared with the standard of living we can get by going to live with our relatives in America.&rdquo;  I saw them going and I knew them personally. I knew their fathers and mothers and knew all their belongings, and they did not go as emigrants, in the old sense of the word.  There was no lamentation about their going; on the contrary, their parents were eager to see them go for two reasons, firstly, they thought it provided the means for these boys and girls to get on in the world and, secondly, to be quite frank, they looked forward to the cheques that would come home from America, and they came in a golden flood.  Far from having the American wake that we used to have in the old days, they were eager to see them go and, mind you, the wake at the departure of emigrants for America was in many ways as grievous and as sorrowful <Col N="673" /> a function as the wake for a deceased relative.  There was just as much grief and sorrow, when I was a child, about the departure of one of the young people to America as there was if they were mourning his death; but in the years to which I now refer, from 1921 to 1929, there was no mourning. There was universal rejoicing. Their parents knew they were going out to relatives; they knew they were going to a good job; and they knew they would be coming back within a decade, rich visitors, and come back bearing riches with them, they always did, and then went back to America again and in 90 per cent. of cases, married and settled down.  By the time they had acquired family responsibilities of their own in America, younger brothers, nephews and nieces went out after them and so you had a steady stream of money coming home to Ireland and a steady efflux of emigrants from this country not in any spirit of desolation or despair, but in a spirit of eager anticipation, facing a new world and confident that they were going to do better for themselves and for those they left behind than if they remained in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The emigration that is going on now is of an entirely different character. The emigration that is going on now is the emigration of boys and girls who are going to England looking for work, not because they anticipate they are going to have a very much better time in England than they had when at home, but because they cannot get work, and cannot get any profitable occupation at home at all, and because the farm will not yield sufficient to justify the employment of growing children in the way it used to do.  There is no use telling me that the girl of 15 years, who emigrates to Brondesbury to become a servant in a lower middle-class family in London, looks forward to a higher standard of living than she would enjoy on her mother's place in Ballaghaderreen because she does not. She is enjoying a very much lower standard of living.  Bear this in mind, because it is time somebody spoke out plainly on this question: parents would not let girls go into those positions if they could keep them at home.  There is grave danger, both to the morals and <Col N="674" /> to the faith of many of the girls going to England at the present time.  I do not want to exaggerate the problem, nor do I want to suggest that the Government would not attempt to deal with these difficulties if they could devise a plan, but I am stating with absolute certainty that these evils do exist, and I confess that they are evils of a type for which I find it very difficult to propose a remedy, other than that of raising the standard of living here and raising the standard of the people's prosperity at home and so keeping the people at home.</P>
    <P>A case came to my notice recently of a girl who went from our district to work in London as a domestic servant, and when she was there for a while, she wrote home to her mother&mdash;in this case she got quite a good job as a domestic servant&mdash;and she said she was very happy.  I will tell the whole story because I do not want to reflect on any race or class or creed, and it does not reflect on them, because I suppose this lady was acting according to her belief of what was right.  She said that she was staying with a Jewish lady in Brondesbury who had joined the Anglican Church; that she was very comfortable; and that she was well looked after, but that she had to go to church every Sunday morning with her mistress.  I am sure that that was a good pious lady in England who wanted to look after this girl as best she could, and who felt it was right that she should bring her to the true faith, and this innocent country girl was trotting off every Sunday morning to an Anglican service.  I am not suggesting that the Government is standing by indifferent to that.  I am sure that that fact, brought to the attention of the President, shocks and dismays him just as much as it does me, and I am sure that if the name and location of that child were brought to his attention, he would exert himself to get whatever steps should be taken in the parish where she is resident to have her properly looked after and to have it explained to her mistress that it was not right and proper to bring a Catholic girl to the service of a church to which she did not belong.</P>
    <P>Those, however, are the kind of evils <Col N="675" /> that exist because these girls are going to look for work in England and because they have to go.  When the girls went to America, what happened was that they went to an aunt, an uncle, a cousin or a relative of some kind.  There was no emergency to get a job.  Everybody was well-off and they stayed a week, a fortnight or a month with the relatives until a suitable position was found, and they always had somebody to turn to if anything went amiss.  The emigration going to England at present is of an entirely different kind, and when Deputies on the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party who are living in the country get up and say, in President de Valera's presence: &ldquo;It is the same emigration that always went on,&rdquo; they are not doing their duty.  The President and members of the Executive Council, because of the work they have to do, are to a greater or lesser extent, detached from the everyday life of the people.  They can only get their information from the reports brought to them by civil servants and members of their Party and correspondents in the country.  If any Deputy compares the emigration that went on between 1921 and 1929 with the emigration going on at the present time, he is not speaking the truth&mdash;it may be that he does not live close enough to the people to understand the difference; or it may be that he is closing his eyes to something he does not want to see; but whatever the reason is, he is not speaking the truth.  The two types of emigration are fundamentally different.</P>
    <P>It may be politically indiscreet to say so, but I say quite frankly, with an intimate knowledge of its character, that I do not believe the American emigration did this country a haporth of harm.  On the contrary, it strengthened this country, sent wealth home to the country, provided an opportunity to young people to advance further in temporal affairs than they could ever hope to get in this country; and in building up the immense prestige they enjoy in America they immensely strengthened this country in its international relations. The boys and girls who went to America in these days served this country <Col N="676" /> just as truly and effectively and splendidly as their brothers and sisters who stayed at home.</P>
    <P>I think the vast majority went, not because there was any pressure on them to go, but because they wanted to go. They went in the same spirit as Englishmen went in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries to build up an Empire, except that ours was not an Empire of conquest, but of going where we were welcome and making our contribution to building up a great new nation.  We did make that contribution and, as a result of that, we own great wealth there.  We have no one to thank for it.  Anything we own there, or any prestige we enjoy, has been well and truly earned by the people who went out.  For anything we have had from America we have given in our children, and in the people who helped to build up America, ample return and are giving at the present time.</P>
    <P>I say to the President that the present emigration is an evidence of the disintegration of the economic life of our country.  In Great Britain, in France, in European countries, you would have a revolution, because people would not go.  You take England; you have the depressed areas there, and one of the great problems there is that the people will not leave them when offered jobs outside.  They will not go; they assert the right to get employment or maintenance where they have always lived.  If they had a problem anything like the problem we have here, there would be a revolution in England.  But our people have a different tradition.  For that kind of cause they do not revolt; they simply fold their tents and slip away.  They are going in tens of thousands.  What maddens me is to see them going from want.</P>
    <P>I often despair of making Deputies see the country as I see it.  I sometimes cannot understand why they do not.  The vast majority live, as I do, amongst the people.  Take this case; Deputy Mrs. Concannon may have seen this kind of case.  I have a particular woman in mind.  I remember that woman when she used to come to Ballaghaderreen; she would have a good <Col N="677" /> hat and a nice blouse, with a piece of lace on the neck, and a respectable coat.  She was a very independent woman.  She dealt in whatever shop she liked; and, if she was not courteously received, she had plenty to go to elsewhere.  For the last four years that woman has often stuck in my mind as a type of what I have seen going on around me.  First, I knew by her demeanour that she was unable to meet her bill.  I knew her to be a respectable woman, and I knew her husband to be hard-working.  I knew that she had met with severe reverses&mdash;that she had to sell cattle below their value and could not replace them.  I have seen her try to keep out of the way for fear she would be spoken to in public about her bill&mdash;she had never been spoken to about her bill.  I saw her begin to get shabby.  I have seen the hat that I knew gradually beginning to get crushed.  You could see eventually that, instead of the good black skirt, she was coming to town in a skirt she used to wear about the house. Gradually her coat, instead of being the market or Sunday coat, was obviously a coat she would throw about her shoulders going about the stables or something of that kind.  Lastly, I saw that woman come in and, instead of a nice blouse, she had that kind of blouse made out of cotton cloth, gathered with a safety pin at the neck with no lace collar on it&mdash;she was a poor woman.</P>
    <P>A few nights ago I met her in great distress late at night.  I had been called up to the Gárda barracks to answer a telephone call and I met her in great distress hurrying up the street.  I stopped her and asked her what had her in town at that hour of the night.  She said her boy had run away to England; that he got a scholarship in an agricultural college and she scraped up the money to let him go there; that he asked leave to come home for a holiday and that she borrowed the money to make it possible for him to come home; that he had taken the money and gone to England, and she was trying to get him back.  He was only between 16 and 17.  I am as sure as I am standing in this Dáil that that boy went to <Col N="678" /> England to earn money because he was ashamed to be at college when he knew his home was as poor as it was.  It was only four or five years ago when his father and mother were comfortable and independent.  He saw the house getting poorer and saw his mother's clothes getting poorer. That child hooked it to England rather than do the grand fellow in school while his parents were getting poor. I happen to know that woman personally since I was a child.  She is a violent supporter of the President's. The only time I ever had a cross word with her was when she thrust her head into a motor car in which I was and bellowed &ldquo;Up de Valera&rdquo; in my face. She was a very good friend of mine and her husband was an extremely respectable man.</P>
    <P>That kind of thing is going on in hundreds of cases of my own acquaintance. Possibly it was because she was my friend and, at the same time such a strident supporter of the President's, that I noticed her more than anybody else.  Although I have not traced through the whole period of decline in other of my friends, I do now see people coming into Ballaghadereen who I remember a few years ago were smart, well got-up, independent generally, and who now have in their faces all the hall-marks of people experiencing the utmost possible stringency and finding it terribly hard to make ends meet.  I do not think the President's supporters are telling him that&mdash;I think they do him a terrible injustice when they do not; I think they tell him what they think he wants to hear. They must know just every bit as much as I know, they are living amongst the people, as I live amongst the people.  What I find so hard to bear is that I see banquets held in Dublin and wealthy manufacturers getting up and congratulating each other and saying how proud and happy they are to have the Minister for Industry and Commerce here and, &ldquo;He has here seen by this splendid banquet and the spirit abroad how the country is progressing.&rdquo;  I see millers and bacon curers and every vested interest in this country waxing fat and growing in wealth and prosperity and arrogance.  And I see <Col N="679" /> these unfortunate people whom we all know, and whom it is terribly hard to get to speak for themselves, sinking steadily.</P>
    <P>It has been one of the most notorious things in Irish politics that you cannot get the farmers to organise themselves. They are the last element in this country who will constitute themselves an organised body to look after their own interests.  It is regrettable that those who should be defending the farmers against the vested interests are letting them down.  There is not a single Deputy in this House who is not in a position to say that these are his own people.  Yet, they are being surrendered to the vested interests in this country and to the insane political programme of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am saying this because I see that those people all over the country are steadily declining to poverty and misery arising out of the loss of a market for their goods.  The big man can trim his sails to any wind but the farmers of the country, the ordinary small farmers, as most of them are, cannot do so.  They depend on getting a profit on what they produce when they produce it. Dislocate and wreck their market and you crush them.  The fathers and mothers are getting poorer and the children are fleeing the country. Surely it is time that those Deputies who know that position should make the members of the Government aware of it.  Whether Fianna Fáil are coming back as a Government or whether they are going to come back as an Opposition they should be made aware of these facts, because these ought to colour their every activity in public life; they have not done so up to now.</P>
    <P>I want to pass from that to a question to which I attach immense importance. All of us in this House, to a greater or lesser degree, identified ourselves, or our parents or grandparents indentified themselves, in the struggle to make this country sovereign and independent.  I want to put this to the President.  I admit that the League of Nations, when it was in its full and pristine glory, was an immense bulwark for the freedom of small nations throughout the world. <Col N="680" /> We had all hoped that in our day we would see it a fold in which the small independent sovereign nations would be perfectly safe against aggression from anyone.  That security of freedom has been dissipated for the time being in any case.  The League of Nations is now in a dangerous morass into which I believe it is still our duty to go.  I believe it is the duty of every nation of goodwill to be represented at the League of Nations with a view to changing it from a morass into solid ground in which all the nations of the world can stand together.  But the fact is that at present, far from being a safeguard to the nations it is a form of menace.  That being so, and the condition of Europe being what it is, can the President honestly say that the sovereignty and independence of this country would be safe for one hour outside the Commonwealth of Nations? We reconstructed the British Empire. We went into the British Empire.  I do not believe that a single person in this country enjoyed going into the British Empire.  But we went in there and for ten years we took the British Empire to pieces, and built up, out of these pieces, the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>I was recently in London attending the Empire Parliamentary Union.  I there found that, if you leave the French-Canadians out altogether, more than half the delegates from the Nations of the Commonwealth were Irishmen.  I listened time and again to British statesmen, Australian statesmen, South African statesmen, New Zealand statesmen and Canadian statesmen congratulating themselves that through this period of stress, this one political association had survived the storm and had come out stronger than when it first began.  They all said it is all due to the extraordinary genius which devised this intangible bond, which in practice means nothing, but which in theory holds this League together.  The President smiles at the description of the Crown having, in fact, any function other than as a Commonwealth link in the domestic affairs of any State in the Commonwealth of Nations.  I think the President would do this country a great service if he could realise <Col N="681" /> what a powerful bulwark we have in the Commonwealth of Nations.  That fact struck me as I heard men from all parts of the world congratulating themselves on that state of affairs. Many of them must remember that the genius that devised that scheme and the genius that destroyed the Empire and created the Commonwealth of Nations was largely the genius of this country.  It was Ireland very largely that led the Empire into the Commonwealth and provided the Commonwealth nations with the framework which survived the stresses and difficulties through which we have passed.  Ireland is the genius which devised the formula which established, as it never before had been established, the independence and sovereignty of every one of the State members and which holds the Commonwealth nations together, while the League of Nations itself is apparently breaking up.</P>
    <P>Some of the more obscure and silly members of the Fianna Fáil Party may think that there was something wrong in going into the Empire Parliamentary Association.  I think that is absolute insanity.  It is absolute insanity for our people not to realise that the preservation of our sovereignty and independence is absolutely impossible except on the basis of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I think it is deplorable madness that our Government cannot realise their duty in this matter. Instead of cowering in their tents and running away from international responsibilities, their duty, not only to this country but to the world, is to go into the Commonwealth of Nations and to carry on the work of developing the Commonwealth to which we belong until eventually it may help to constitute an effective substitute for the League of Nations which is, I am afraid, collapsing at the present time. If this Commonwealth took the lead, and it may take the lead without us, in opening up freer trade between the nations of the world, in helping to form a block sufficiently powerful to restore economic stability, what greater contribution could Ireland make to world stability and peace <Col N="682" /> than by helping in that work?  It may be the difference between a devastated world and the destruction of our country, and something approximating permanent peace if the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America can be induced to co-operate in any way in this great work.  We could thus make an immense contribution and the greater the contribution we could make the greater the bulwark we would raise around our own sovereignty and independence, not only as against foreign nations but against Great Britain herself.  Some of us forget that ten or 20 years in the life of a nation is a short period.  It has happened that England is in a pacific frame of mind at present.  She has been so since the War; she will continue to be for some time to come. It is our prime duty to preserve the independence that has been handed to us.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that what we are doing is throwing away what those who went before us tried to win.  Our job should be to consolidate and complete it by getting national unity, and that is possible of being done in our generation.  But, far from consolidating our position of independent sovereignty, we are pulling the props away as quickly as we can, and we are trusting to God that by leaving one pin point for the whole structure to survive on, it will continue to balance there and will not fall off.  But it only balances there so long as Great Britain remains a pacific country.  I want to safeguard our independence and sovereignty. Every independent small nation should be concerned to safeguard its independence and sovereignty, not only against its remote neighbours and its present probable enemies, but against its close neighbours and its remote possible enemies.</P>
    <P>Let me direct the attention of members of the House to an interesting fact. Recently a question was rather offensively addressed by a member of the British House of Commons to Mr. Malcolm Macdonald, the Secretary for Dominion Affairs in the Government of Great Britain.  He asked if Irish nationals could not be prevented from <Col N="683" /> going into Great Britain.  Mr. Macdonald said they could not, and that it was not the intention of the Government to try.  Then somebody else got up and asked if something could not be done to restrict their ingress, and Mr. Macdonald made this immensely significant reply.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No, it would not be practicable, but even if it were, we could not do it, because if we did it would give rise to questions of principle upon which the Dominions feel very strongly and Canada and Australia would object.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to understand the significance of that.  For seven centuries we made friends with Great Britain's enemies, and we tried to use them for the purpose of getting Great Britain in control or of overthrowing her, and for seven centuries we failed.  Whenever Great Britain's enemies wanted to desert us, they deserted us and left our people to be hanged and slaughtered in whatever way an antagonistic Great Britain desired to slaughter them.  We then discovered, very largely owing to the genius of the men who manned the first Government of this State, that a much more effective way of adjusting the balance caused by the act of creation, which put Ireland beside England, was to make friends with England's friends, and with that idea in our minds the Commonwealth of Nations was evolved, establishing an automatic alliance for all time, so that whenever Great Britain sought to infringe the rights of this State, every Dominion of the Commonwealth of Nations, every State member of the Commonwealth of Nations, was on the <i>qui vive</i>, defending our right, lest the precedent established by admitting Great Britain's right against us should subsequently be quoted against them.</P>
    <P>For the first time in history we succeeded in establishing a position that whenever our interests conflicted with Great Britain, Great Britain, instead of facing us with the immense might of an empire behind them, confronted not us alone, but all the sovereign and independent State members of the Commonwealth, all concerned to vindicate our sovereignty and our independence, because upon the principle <Col N="684" /> enshrined therein depended their own sovereign existence as independent States.  I am solemnly told that to cherish or support an idea of that kind is to betray the sovereignty and independence of this State.  I will say this &mdash;and I do not now address those of the people who have not the brains to understand these things, but anybody who understands international affairs &mdash;that in the present state of affairs the only hope of maintaining effective sovereignty and independence in this country, or indeed in any State of the world&mdash;the only hope of recovering the unity of this country is by maintaining and using our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>Let me direct the attention of Deputies to one other matter.  At the present moment President de Valera says: &ldquo;Here is a Constitution.&rdquo;  He claims it has been drafted and presented it as if Great Britain were a million miles away.  Do Deputies understand the significance of that claim?  It may be true.  Let us assume it is accurate and true.  It means this: that we can legislate in any capacity in regard to any matter concerning the interests of our people 30 miles away from the most powerful military power in Europe without having any regard whatever to her feelings in the matter. Austria is a sovereign and an independent state with ten centuries of independence behind it.  If they wanted to pass, say, a Poor Law Bill, they have to get permission from Rome, and there are negotiations going on with Italy, and unless they had that complete dependence on Italy they would be running hat in hand to Berlin. Take Denmark, a nation very similarly circumstanced to ours.  They frequently find themselves in the embarrassing position of being obliged to say, &ldquo;We sympathise with that objective, but our proximity to the German Reich makes it quite impossible for us to take up a definite stand.&rdquo;  We alone of the small nations of Europe are in a position at Geneva, in London, in New York, or anywhere else, to speak our minds, whether it is pleasing or displeasing to anybody, to Germany, France, Spain, to any country in the world, or to Great Britain.  And the <Col N="685" /> machinery which is provided by the men who devised and planned the Commonwealth of Nations gives us absolute security against them all.</P>
    <P>I have heard things said in this House and if they were said in any Parliament in Europe the Foreign Office would be bombarded.  There is not a State in Europe dare quarrel with us.  Is not that an astonishing thing?  Here we are, the poorest country in Europe, probably with one of the smallest populations, with no navy, with a nominal army, and there is not a State in Europe dare pick a quarrel with us.  Why?  There is not a State in Europe dare insult our flag going into any port in Europe. Why?  There is not a State in Europe in which a citizen of this State is not in a position to have his rights vindicated. Why?  And I am told by imbeciles in this country that if you go out honestly and openly before the people and say to them that you believe in the Commonwealth and that it is your public duty to exhort your own people to support it, it takes something away from the honour, the independence and the integrity of this country.  That such imbeciles can be abroad, and that they are not locked up in lunatic asylums for their own protection, is a thing one cannot understand.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House too long, but I must confess that, knowing, as I know, the President of the Executive Council to be an earnest student of Machiavelli, to have carried it with him to New York, to have browsed in it in the aristocratic purlieus of Fitzwilliam Square, whenever I find myself at a loss to understand the devious ways of his mind I hurry to the Library and there I get <i>The Prince</i> and I try to find in <i>The Prince</i> what it is that the President is up to.</P>
    <P>I think in this instance the President has consulted his own master and I am going to suggest to him that, as he misinterpreted certain of his own Articles in the Constitution, so too he is losing his power as adroitly as he used to do to interpret certain passages in his own master, Machiavelli. I have no doubt that he has recently been reading how to retain a principality <Col N="686" /> which he once obtained.  His principality is coming to an end in a few weeks, and I suppose he looks for guidance to the old sources.  I think the President has misread the passage. It comes at the end of the chapter on &ldquo;A Principality Obtained&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a State, the prince ought to examine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That can be translated President or Uachtarán or even Taoiseach if you translate it not into base Béarla but straight from Italian into Gaelic.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>That is the mistake you are making. The President thought he had done them at one stroke, and the silly Yes-men that he has surrounding him keep telling him that the injuries are all forgotten: that they are all over, and that the people are suffering no more. They are.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the part that he has put into practice and has made a thorough mistake.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs.  For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And this is the piece that he has forgotten:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh <Col N="687" /> measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any obligation to you for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Neither the Pensions Bill nor the Governor-General's pension will turn away the wrath he has brought on his own head, not through folly but by evil advice.  The Yes-men told him that the injuries arising out of his actions were all over, but they are not.</P>

      <P>I would like to add a few words before the President concludes. It struck me on several occasions during the eloquent speech of Deputy Dillon, in which he forcibly restated the arguments in favour of membership of the Commonwealth which those who think like him and myself have been urging for years past, that in all probability, so far as the President of the Executive Council is concerned, he was preaching to the converted. I think that the President of the Executive Council has no more idea of leaving the Commonwealth of Nations than Deputy Dillon or I; not one bit more.  The trouble is that there is a certain technique in politics that he finds a difficulty, and that his Party find a difficulty, in throwing overboard. There is a certain political cant&mdash;I use the word in its literal sense and not in any offensive sense&mdash;that people have got into the habit of expecting from politicians in this country, and that politicians, accordingly, find it hard to throw overboard.  I do not think that we ought to be too impatient either with the President of the Executive Council himself or with the members of his Party.  The opposite Party, too, had their difficulties in throwing overboard the kind of language to which the people had become accustomed: which the people had been taught to regard as alone patriotic.  I have heard in not very distant times, when I was a member of the Official Opposition myself, a Front Bench Opposition member describe himself, at a public meeting at which I was participating, as an unrepentant republican.  We all know that when <Col N="688" /> the Free State was first established a great many of the Party in power took that line: that the Treaty was a means to an end, and that the end was still to be a republic&mdash;a republic for 32 counties, I suppose, but a republic.</P>
      <P>Well, now, I do not think that there is any great difference, perhaps any difference at all, in the attitude of mind of the more intelligent members of the Fianna Fáil Party at the present moment, and the attitude of mind of the more intelligent members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, shall we say seven or eight years ago.  The unfortunate thing is that it should be so hard to throw away this unsound timber that is still in the political structure of this country.  It does a great deal of harm: that, while firmly remaining in the Commonwealth, we should think it necessary to go on in our speeches and in our newspaper articles being as offensive about the Commonwealth as we can be.  It is very unfortunate that when, as Deputy Dillon says, our own independence and our own prosperity, everything that is worth while for a nation, really is bound up with the continued safety and prosperity of a Commonwealth, we should be so often quoted by the bitter enemies of the Commonwealth because our public men and our newspapers are found saying the sort of things that have become common form for patriotic Irish politicians to say.  I say that is a condition of things that we should endeavour to grow out of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in spite of all the things that have happened during the last five years or so, that on the whole we have advanced in the right direction.  I think that the general feeling in this country in respect of Great Britain and of the Commonwealth is sounder now than it was five years ago, and that the five years of Fianna Fáil Government have not brought us nearer to separation from the British Commonwealth: that, on the contrary, they have really lodged us there more firmly than we were lodged in it when Fianna Fáil came into office.  I feel, as I said the other day, that if we ever do leave the British Commonwealth it will only be because the British themselves eventually lose patience with us and <Col N="689" /> throw us out, whether we want to go or not.  I hope that day will not come so long as there seems to be a reasonable prospect that we will be able to cure our own disease.  But if, unfortunately, it became clear that we could not cure our own disease, then I for one would welcome, in the words of Mr. Balfour, &ldquo;a bold piece of surgery&rdquo; that would consist in setting up a completely separate republic of our own, because I would feel that it was the only possible way to an inevitable end. I am perfectly certain, though I may not live to see it&mdash;I still hope that I shall live to see it&mdash;that some day we shall establish the unity of Ireland, and that the Six Counties will form part of the polity of Ireland.  I am equally certain that some day we shall wholeheartedly accept membership of the Commonwealth of Nations.  The economic, geographical and political forces are too strong for us to come to any other conclusion but that.  It is only a question of how long it will take for the people, as a whole, to understand the situation and to see reason, to find the contentment and happiness that comes from a true outlook upon the facts of life.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has chided the President with his absence from the Imperial Conference, and I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan in thinking that that absence was very unfortunate. Deputy O'Sullivan has asked the President to supply him with a candid explanation of his absence from the conference, but feeling some shade of doubt as to whether the President will comply with that request, I shall attempt to do it for him&mdash;at any rate to some extent.  I think the President is absent from the Imperial Conference for two reasons.  One is the Coronation and the close coincidence in time between the holding of the Imperial Conference and the holding of the Coronation, and the consequent very invidious and embarrassing position of any delegates to the conference who refuse to be associated in any way with the Coronation or with the loyal greetings to the King that the Imperial Conference thought it proper, of course, to send.  I think the second reason has been the approach of the general election, <Col N="690" /> and the fact that, when a general election is impending, the President's instinct is to stay as much to the left as he can.  I believe that the President and a great many of the people in this country grossly overrate what might be called the revolutionary forces in this country.  I do not believe that the forces of the extreme left in this country are at all to be as much feared as the President seems to believe.</P>
    <P>My own feeling is that, if once the &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; were settled and if a reasonable compromise could be made with Great Britain about the financial dispute between the two countries, the differences between the two Parties would be found to be extremely small. As I have said already, I believe that Fianna Fáil just as much as Fine Gael are determined to stay in the Commonwealth. I agree that Fine Gael are prepared to go further in the way of open admission of that than Fianna Fáil are prepared to go at present; but the time must come when facts will force even Fianna Fáil to face and admit the position as it really is, and I cannot but think that a great deal of the political warfare in this country would fade away if once the financial dispute with Great Britain were settled.  No doubt, Parties would form again, but they would form upon lines different from those upon which they are now formed.  I believe that, at heart, we really all agree about the main things.  I hope, and I cannot but believe, that we all do intensely care about reunion with the North, and that we care about the sovereignty and independence of this country and about the assertion of its right to mould its destinies in any way that the people of this country desire.  Those of us who are convinced of the desirability of being associated with the British Commonwealth of Nations and of having the King as an integral part of our Constitution, also believe that it is our right to change these institutions, if the people so desire, and that if honour or interest forbids us staying within the Commonwealth, then it is our right to go out of the Commonwealth. Consequently, I think that a great deal of the Party warfare that is going on at the present is artificial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> It is unfortunate that the President is absent from the Imperial Conference, because, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said, some very important things are going on there.  There is the discussion of citizenship, to which Deputy O'Sullivan alluded, and there is a discussion of matters of defence and of economic questions&mdash;every one of them of vital importance to this country. There is another matter of discussion there, which Deputy O'Sullivan did not mention but which is of immense importance to us, and to the world in general, and that is a decision as to what the future attitude of the nations of the Commonwealth is to be to the League of Nations.  We all know that these Imperial Conferences do not arrive at hard and fast decisions that completely bind the constituent members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and that each country retains its liberty to direct its foreign policy according to the desires of its people; but general principles and general ideas and general plans are arrived at, and therefore, it seems to me to be very unfortunate indeed that President de Valera&mdash;not alone this country, but the President, personally &mdash;should be absent from discussions on such a matter as the future relations of the League of Nations with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I say that it is unfortunate that the President, personally, should be absent because he has a special prestige in Geneva.  The President has been at Geneva, and he has had splendid experience and has achieved prestige there, and apart altogether from my very great regret that Ireland should be absent from the Imperial Conference, I do also regret that the President, for personal reasons, is not present at the discussions going on there concerning the future of the League and the future relations of the British Commonwealth of Nations with the League.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which I think it is only fair to say&mdash;and I do not say it out of ill-nature towards my former colleagues, but because it is an element in the situation and a disagreeable sign of the tendency which, I think, politicians in general <Col N="692" /> in this country have, to make capital out of any friendly or co-operative relations between the Government of the day in this country and the Government of Great Britain.  I have criticised in this House already the attitude of the Opposition towards the President in the matter of his doings in Geneva and in the matter of his Non-Intervention Bill with regard to Spain.  I must say, however, that I hardly thought it would have been necessary to recur to that subject, but only a week ago, I saw that, at a convention in one of the Dublin constituencies, Deputy Cosgrave went out of his way to attack the Government for &ldquo;slavish subservience&rdquo; to the British Government in the matter of Abyssinia and Spain.  Now, I am not going to go back to the matter of Abyssinia, but the trouble in Spain is still with us and is still a matter of active concern.  I do suggest that, if the Opposition would allow themselves to be candid with themselves for five minutes, they would realise that, if they were in office, they could not have acted in any other way than the way in which the President has acted in that connection.  I challenge any responsible member of the Opposition to say, that, if they were in office, they would have broken from the rest of the Commonwealth and given formal recognition to General Franco's Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You asked the President to withdraw our Ambassador from Madrid last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the case.  As a matter of fact, however, I did not ask to have him withdrawn from Madrid, where he is not, but from St. Jean de Luz, where he is, simply on the ground that he was not performing any useful function there, and I thought that it would kill a lot of the mischievous agitation that is going on in this country if he were withdrawn for the time being. Inasmuch as the Spanish Government had no representative here, it seemed to me that there was no necessity for a representative of ours in St. Jean de Luz or Hendaye.  I resent intensely the habit that exists in this country of suggesting that whenever the policy of our Government coincides with the <Col N="693" /> policy of the British Government that is a proof of slavery and subservience. I do not see how we can have any hope of establishing a proper attitude of mind amongst our people if even the Opposition, consisting of men who are warmly attached to the Commonwealth connection, fail to resist the temptation of using that kind of club with which to beat the Government.  As I say, if they were in office, they would have acted as our Government have acted.  In face of that, you have not only the speech of Deputy Cosgrave but you had a speech about three weeks ago by a member of the National Executive of Fine Gael, a newly-selected candidate by Fine Gael for the County Kildare, in which he described President de Valera as the confessed ally of Senor Caballero.  The grotesque thing is that over in England, where I have been two or three times lately&mdash;for example, in the hotly partisan atmosphere of the Oxford Union, where I recently took part in a debate on Partition&mdash;I found that everyone hostile to the British Government was wildly attacking the British Government for being pro-Franco.  Here, those who are hostile to our Government attack them for being at once subservient to Great Britain and being pro-Caballero. I think that the attitude of our Government and of the British Government has been correct.  They have both followed a genuine policy of non-intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, sir, that before the Imperial Conference comes to an end the President will have established, at any rate, some contact with the statesmen from other countries of the Commonwealth, and that he will have done something to recognise the fact to which Deputy Dillon made allusion, that over 50 per cent. of the English-speaking delegates to that conference are of Irish extraction.  I hope that he will take steps to see that our views and interests in connection with such matters as citizenship, defence, economic questions and the League of Nations are not left entirely unrepresented, and also that he will try, before these statesmen scatter to the four corners of the world, to engage their sympathetic interest in our ambition for, to take a Government phrase, the <Col N="694" /> reintegration of our national territory, always remembering that that is something which cannot be done by simply everbearing the aspirations, principles and desires of the majority in the North, that it is something that can only be accomplished, and that we can only expect the assistance of the other parts of the Empire in accomplishing, if we are prepared to make concessions and compromise.  I hope that in the matter, too, of the financial dispute with Great Britain, the President will not for ever continue in the point of view that for the Irish side to make a compromise is necessarily the same thing as unconditional surrender.  I must say for one who is so astute a politician as the President of the Executive Council, it amazes me that he should go to a general election without having made a serious attempt at compromise.</P>
