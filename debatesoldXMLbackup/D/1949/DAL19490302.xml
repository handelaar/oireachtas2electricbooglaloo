    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Offaly Old Age Pension.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if Mrs. Ann Brophy, Ballincor, Shinrone, Offaly, a blind person, who was in receipt of an old age pension at the rate of 7/6 a week until recently, had her pension reduced, as from the 7th January last, to 5/-; whether the reduction in question was consequent on an appeal from Mrs. Brophy herself that her pension was insufficient; whether the pensioner's husband is now over 69 years of age; whether the justification for reducing her pension is a means test whereunder the pensioner is assumed to possess half of her husband's earnings in his 69th year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first and second parts of the question, the position is that on the basis of an investigation of means, made last year, following an application for an increase in her pension, it was decided that, in view of the means of her husband, the pensioner in question was not entitled to any pension under the legislation then in force, but that, by virtue of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, she became entitled to a pension of 5/- a week as from the 7th January of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the rest of the question, I am not aware of the age of the pensioner's husband, but the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1932, which require that a pensioner who is one of a married couple living together in the same house shall be assessed with one half of the total means of the couple, <Col N="656" /> apply irrespective of the age of the marriage partner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not undertake to abolish the means test and to give old age pensions of 26/-a week at the age of 65?  Why, therefore, is he in a Government which enforces a means test?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say in reply to that inappropriate supplementary question, which does not arise out of the question put by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that any statements which were made relating to the abolition of a means test clearly had relation to the abolition of a means test under a comprehensive scheme of social insurance. The means test will be abolished under such a scheme and old age pensioners will get under that scheme a higher rate of old age pensions than they are getting to-day and further a much higher rate than the highest rate of pension they got during any of the years when the last Government were in office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a means test for every one of Fianna Fáil's 16 years in office and you know it.  It is easier now than ever it was at any time for the past 16 years and that is what is annoying you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that irritating and unnecessary delay is being experienced by insured persons who apply for national health benefit; and if he will take steps to remedy this unsatisfactory position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any undue delay in the payment of benefit by the National Health Insurance Society, but, if the Deputy will let me have particulars of any individual cases in which delay appears to have occurred, I shall have inquiries made in the matter.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that responsibility for the payment of national health <Col N="657" /> insurance benefit lies with the National Health Insurance Society which is an autonomous body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that complaints of delay are so numerous that it would be impossible for any Deputy to compile them and, secondly, does he not realise that even at present there is a duplication of forms which tends to delay the payment of benefit to the extent that some of the applicants are unable to fill in any of these forms properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of no such situation as is suggested by the Deputy. I suggest to him, and to other Deputies in the House that if they will furnish me with evidence that there is delay, I shall be only too glad to have the matter investigated.  I am assured however by the society, on whom the responsibility for the payment of benefit primarily devolves, that there is no delay and that cheques for benefit are despatched in the overwhelming majority of cases within three days of medical evidence of the incapacity being received at the society's head office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that there is at present a certain form, Form 5, which calls on the applicant to fill in certain particulars purporting to show that any illness or injury from which he suffers was not caused as result of an accident arising out of his employment or was not an injury for which he would be entitled to common law compensation?  Is he further aware that in addition to Form 5, the applicant is called upon to fill another form, Form 27, which deals with the question of workmen's compensation and common law damages? Does the Minister not realise that there is duplication in this matter which could easily be obviated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever queries are made are the same as have been made for the last 20 or 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixteen years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Traynor has suggested, whatever forms are in use have been in use for the past 16 years. It seems to me that the queries to which the Deputy referred are so <Col N="658" /> simple that any ordinary person would dispose of them in a matter of minutes. If a person has suffered an accident arising out of or in the course of his employment, he claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  If he is claiming in respect of ordinary sickness, he claims under the National Health Insurance Act.  It is a simple and expeditious matter to decide under what heading a person is claiming benefit.  I do not think there can be any greater simplification of the forms than that which exists at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in the particular case which prompted me to put down the question the applicant was served with Form 5 and, having filled it adequately, he inquired as to the cause of the delay in getting his benefit?  He was immediately served with another Form 5 to fill up and he was subsequently served with Form 27.  He is still waiting, after practically two months of filling forms, to receive the benefit to which he is justly entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is anxious to have the claim paid expeditiously and so am I.  If, therefore, he will send me particulars of the case I will have inquiries made to find out in what manner that case was dealt with and whether there was any avoidable delay, and, if so, to take whatever steps are open to me to try to prevent a recurrence of the circumstances which gave rise to any delay which might have taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that facilities at the Town Hall, Castleblayney, are totally inadequate and render it unsuitable for use as a technical school and that in addition the fact that these classes are held there means that amenities for Circuit Court sittings are also inadequate; and, if so, whether he will regard the building of a new technical school as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am <Col N="659" /> aware that the accommodation in the building at present being used as a technical school at Castleblayney is unsuitable and that a new technical school is necessary there.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant of £10 per acre is paid to landowners who are prepared to plant not less than one acre at a spacing of not more than five feet and to fence or otherwise protect the plantation against damage by stock or rabbits.  The grant is payable in two equal instalments, the first immediately upon satisfactory completion of the planting, and the second five years afterwards if the plantation has been properly maintained in the interval.</P>
      <P>I am of opinion that the present grant offers a fair inducement to landowners to plant their waste lands. Such timber as they cultivate for themselves with the assistance of the Department's grant is their own property and may become highly valuable if properly tended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he now has evidence that since the price for <Col N="671" /> creamery milk was fixed in 1947 there have been substantial increases in the wages paid to agricultural workers and to creamery workers and that the manufacturing costs of creamery milk have also increased in the same period; and, if so, whether he will state what steps, if any, he intends to take, by way of increasing the price of creamery milk, in order to help dairy farmers to offset the burdens recently placed on milk production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that there is grave disappointment with his lack of encouragement of the dairying industry; and, if so, whether he will state how he intends to extend and develop the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that since the present prices were fixed in 1947, there have been increases in various directions in the cost of milk production.  Nevertheless, I have reason to believe that the majority of milk suppliers to creameries are not dissatisfied with these prices, and are not unmindful of the fact that calves which were selling for from 10/-to 20/- in 1947 are now worth from 50/-to £10 apiece, which, on the average milk yield of 400 gallons, amounts to an increase of from 1¼d. to 5d. per gallon on the price of milk, and I do not at present propose to advise the Government to increase the prices of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the main obstacle to the increasing prosperity in the dairying industry is the relatively low milk yield of dairy cows; if the average milk yield could be substantially increased, the return to the producer from existing prices would be more than ample. With this object in view, I have initiated schemes for the improvement of pastures, and I also propose to provide a number of artificial insemination stations at which high-class proven dairy bulls will be available for the service of cows at a fee not greater than that at present charged by premium bull owners.  At the same <Col N="672" /> time, it is intended to introduce a revised system of milk recording which will relieve farmers of all work in connection with weighing and recording, and also permit of the payment of a reasonable rate of remuneration to the supervisors.  To enable these measures to be successful, however, I must be assured of the whole-hearted co-operation of the creamery industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, despite the improvement in food conditions throughout the world in the last 12 months, he still has the people of this country on six ounces of butter per week, even though the dairying industry is one of the principal industries in the country?  Can the Minister not give some indication as to what he is going to do to increase production in the dairying industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall very gladly do so. The Deputy will be glad to hear that the production of butter is steadily rising.  The production of butter in the month of January was substantially higher than butter production in any January since 1937.  The Deputy will also be glad to hear that larger quantities of milk are reaching the creameries as well as the Dublin milk consuming area than have reached it since 1939. The Deputy will be consoled to hear the following figures from one dairy group at present operating in a typical dairying district in this country.  In 1939 the earning per cow was £11 16s. 9d.  In 1948 the earning per cow was £28 10s. 0d.  If that does not reassure the Deputy that the dairying industry is on the upgrade, I shall be glad to furnish him with further figures and particulars.</P>

      <P>The number of applications under the farm buildings scheme which have been received from rated occupiers of agricultural land in County Dublin is 326.  Shortage of essential materials for the country's building programme as a whole has prevented me from bringing the scheme into general operation up to now, but I am glad to say that I shall be able to give effect to it next month.  That part of the scheme which relates to grants for poultry houses has, however, been in operation for some months.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the Lough Ree islanders live solely on fishing and that they have now been legislated practically out of existence; and, if so, whether with a view to alleviating their position he will (i) take steps to have the by-laws altered under which they have been refused net licences for the past two seasons and are unreasonably restricted in the size of eel hooks and weight of eels which they may take, and (ii) include in terms of reference of the coming public inquiry all the grievances of these fishermen regarding (a) net fishing to include trout, (b) the size of eel which they may take, (c) the size of eel hook which may be used by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Lough Ree islanders are generally dependent upon the proceeds of fishing as part of their livelihood and I realise <Col N="676" /> that their activities have been restricted by the abolition, under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, of all freshwater netting as from 1st January, 1948. That section, however, authorises me to make, under suitable conditions, a by-law permitting within any specified area of freshwater the use of nets for the capture of fish other than salmon, trout and eels; and the men concerned were repeatedly told if they chose to apply for such a by-law the necessary steps would be taken in that regard. Towards the close of 1948 an application reached my Department, and arrangements have been completed for holding the necessary public inquiries during the first week in April.  Should the evidence tendered justify me in making the appropriate by-law, I shall, of course, do so.  I have no power to authorise the use of nets for the capture of trout.</P>
      <P>The minimum size of eel which may be taken, and of eel hook which may be used, are governed by an existing by-law, and before any modification could be considered a <i>prima facie</i> case showing that the proposed change would be for the benefit of the eel fisheries in the river system as a whole must be submitted.  As no such case has been furnished the forthcoming inquiries must be limited to the possible restoration of the position which obtained immediately preceding 1st January, 1948.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints that the Government's policy of ensuring that tomatoes will not be denied to poor people has reduced the <Col N="677" /> profits to which tomato growers have become accustomed in recent years. I am quite satisfied, however, that efficient growers will make reasonable profits this year as they did last year, and I would direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that the home producers are protected from open competition by a customs duty of 2d. a 1b. payable on tomatoes coming from the Continent during the period when the bulk of the home crop is on the market, in addition to the cost of conveying them from the Continent to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the past 12 months a small number of applications from local authorities for loans from the Local Loans Fund were refused and the applicants were advised by the Department of Local Government to approach their treasurers for the necessary accommodation if the expenditure involved could not be provided for out of revenue.  Generally, the applications were for small short-term loans or for loans for works not of a <Col N="679" /> purely capital nature such as, for example, road improvements and housing repairs, the cost of which it was felt should normally be met out of revenue.</P>
      <P>These decisions were taken on the grounds (1) that the Local Loans Fund exists primarily for making to local authorities long-term loans for essential schemes of a purely capital nature involving relatively large expenditure which the local authorities cannot meet from their ordinary resources, and (2) that, because of the increasing demands on the Fund, it is necessary to conserve as far as possible its limited resources for the financing of the more essential capital public works, particularly housing schemes.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, over a long period, there has been an abuse of the petrol rationing system through the sale of petrol coupons by persons in the categories mentioned by the Deputy who, for one reason or another, purchase less petrol than their rations would enable them to purchase.  It was in the knowledge that this abuse existed, and largely with the object of counteracting it, that I increased supplementary allowances recently for essential users of vehicles.  To the extent to which the legitimate requirements of essential users can be met, there should be a reduction in the black-market in petrol. The supply position enables this process of adjustment of rations by reference to the needs of the users to be continued, and it is my hope that the result will be to end the abuses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that on Monday next, 7th March, a new national loan will be issued for public subscription.</P>
      <P>It is almost exactly a year since I announced the flotation of a loan of £12,000,000.  On this occasion both the amount and the terms are being repeated.  Cash subscriptions at par are being invited for £12,000,000 for 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds repayable at the option of the State in 1965 and compulsorily repayable in 1970.  From 1st September next, when the new bonds will be quoted ex-dividend, there will be no distinction between them and the bonds issued a year ago.  Both issues will be consolidated to form a single stock which will then be of an amount more conducive to a normal flow of market transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year's issue was over-subscribed by the public and the popularity of the stock is shown by the premium at which it has been quoted on the stock exchange ever since dealings commenced. The opportunity of acquiring identical bonds at par should be attractive and I am hoping for a ready response from the public, the more so as it is still desirable, as an offset to inflation, that State expenditure proper to be met from borrowings should be financed out of private savings.  Accordingly, although in a position to invest up to £4,000,000 in the loan on behalf of funds under my control, I am prepared, as before, to accept a drastic reduction in the amount of my allotment. On this occasion also, subscriptions <Col N="697" /> to the loan are not being sought outside the State.</P>
    <P>The loan is being floated to provide for the financing of schemes of economic and social benefit to the community, in particular for electricity development and housing.  The financial position at the moment is, in some respects, similar to that which obtained before the previous issue was made. The amount of ways and means advances and Exchequer Bills outstanding has again become considerable &mdash;it amounted to £9.8 million on 1st March as against £13.1 million on the same date last year&mdash;and in order to be in a position to finance the coming year's capital outlay it is necessary to raise new long-term borrowings.</P>
    <P>So far, in 1948/49, Exchequer issues for capital expenditure amount to £8 million, of which advances to the Electricity Supply Board account for £3.75 million, advances to the Local Loans Fund for £1.7 million, advances to Bord na Móna for £.74 million, Road Fund advances for £.69 million and telephone capital expenditure for £.75 million.  Capital expenditure on these and other works of national importance will continue in 1949/50.</P>
    <P>Like all previous loans, the new bonds will have the protection of a substantial sinking fund.  This will amount to over £120,000 in the first year and subsequent annual provisions will be on an increasing scale according as bonds are extinguished by purchase and cancellation.  The sinking fund, which will be provided out of ordinary revenue, will be a safeguard for investors against depreciation in the capital value of their holdings.  Subscribers will also feel secure in the knowledge that the credit of the State is high and the national debt comparatively low.</P>
    <P>The bonds should appeal both to small and large investors.  They will be a trustee investment and will be marketable at any time on the stock exchange.  Any sum from £10 upwards, in multiples of £10, may be subscribed to the loan and I shall endeavour to secure that, as far as possible, applicants for amounts not exceeding £5,000 will receive allotments in full.</P>
    <P>The 4 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds <Col N="698" /> issued in December, 1939, and redeemable at the option of the State on 1st January, 1950, carry the right of conversion at par into any subsequent public loan raised during the emergency or within six months of its termination.  In accordance with that undertaking, holdings of 4 per cent. Exchequer Bonds, 1950/60, may be exchanged, in whole or in part, at par, for the 3 per cent. bonds now offered.</P>
    <P>The prospectus of the new issue will appear in the daily papers on Friday, 4th March, and copies of the prospectus and forms of application will be available at banks, post offices and stockbroking offices as from that day.  The list of cash applications will close not later than Friday, 11th March, which is also the final date for applications for conversion of 4 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds.</P>
    <P>The terms of the new issue are attractive and the purposes for which the money is required should commend themselves to all.  I, therefore, feel that I can rely on the active support of members of all Parties in the House in ensuring the success of the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has assured the Dáil that the loan is being floated to provide for the financing of schemes of economic and social benefit to the community, we wish him success. We consider that the terms of the loan will make it as attractive to investors as he assumes.  Subsequent to a similar issue of Exchequer bonds last year, statements as to the purposes for which that loan was required were made by Ministers and other Government speakers which conflicted both with the announcement made at the time by the Minister for Finance and with the facts.  The information which has now been given by the Minister as to the expenditure of the proceeds of last year's loan has, I hope, finally disposed of these misrepresentations.  I note that a substantial proportion of this year's loan, like last year's loan is required to repay short term borrowings during the previous 12 months. That is normal financing of Government activity and is not in itself a ground for criticism of the Government's administration.  As the Minister <Col N="699" /> said last year, the credit of the State was high and the credit of the State is still high and it is still true that the national debt is comparatively low. That is a very satisfactory position after long years of emergency conditions. That being so, we on this side will always approve of the utilisation of the State credit for schemes of national development and, as this loan is proclaimed to be for the purpose of financing such schemes, we give it our support.</P>

The Local Loans Fund Act, 1935, under which the fund was established, limited issues to an aggregate of £5,000,000, the idea being that when that limit was nearly reached Parliamentary authority would be sought for its extension by new legislation.  The limit was raised to £11,000,000 by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1937, and to £17,000,000 by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>In the period from the 1st May, 1935, when the fund was established, to the 31st January, 1949, loan issues from the fund amounted to £16,861,612, of which £12,026,114 was for housing loans, £3,064,531 for public health loans, £780,503 for a temporary advance under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1945, in connection with stock redemption operations, £595,936 for vocational education loans and £394,528 for loans for other services.  Of the housing figure of £12,026,114 over a half or £6,279,959 was for rural housing under the Labourers' Cottages Acts, £4,742,896 was for urban housing under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts; loans for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts accounted for £915,541 and the balance of £87,718 was in respect of Gaeltacht housing loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> Sanctions of loans over the same period, including a carry-over from before 1st May, 1935, amounted to £22,888,033.  As sanction is usually for all of the loan and as loans are ordinarily paid out in instalments, the aggregate of sanctions up to a given date is substantially more than the total issued up to that date.  The statutory limit of £17,000,000 applies only to issues.</P>
    <P>This limit is now almost reached and has to be extended.  The Bill provides for an extension to £25,000,000.  The additional £8,000,000 should do for some years, when fresh legislation will be required.  It is desirable that the Bill should become law as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to increase the amount of money available from the Local Loans Fund for issue to local authorities.  The local authorities, undoubtedly, will want to draw very largely on the Local Loans Fund in future and all we can hope is that they will be enabled to draw largely from it this year when there is such great unemployment in order to get ahead with works of capital development.  Unfortunately, the rate of development of works of a capital nature was strictly limited for a number of years during the war.  Now that material is available and that we seem to have more men than we can employ at the present rate of development, it is urgently necessary that money should be provided to local authorities on reasonable terms in order to get ahead with development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered a statement made last week by the Minister for Local Government in relation to this Local Loans Fund.  He suggested that if the county councils wanted to get ahead with the restoration of roads and did not want to increase their rates they could approach their treasurers, their treasurers being the banks.  Naturally, the banks would charge a very much higher rate of interest than even the present Minister for Finance is charging for loans out of this Local Loans Fund.  Last year the Local Loans Fund <Col N="702" /> was used to pay portion of the grant to local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Whether it went through the Local Loans Fund or directly into the Road Fund, £.69 millions were paid to the local authorities. Last week the Minister for Local Government stated that local authorities who did not want to increase the rates could not get an advance out of the Local Loans Fund, but that they could get it from their treasurers. The difference as between the county councils borrowing from the banks, their treasurers, and borrowing from the Local Loans Fund represents a couple of per cent. or near it.  If the local authorities proceed in that fashion it is going to put an additional burden on them this year when a number of them are already assuming very heavy burdens for the improvement <Col N="703" /> and restoration of roads.  When the Minister says to-day that he wants to get money for the loan from the public in order to avoid inflation, surely he must see that, if the local authorities are going to borrow from the banks, their treasurers, that is going to add to the amount of money in circulation in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  When the Minister is replying, I should like him to say why he does not propose to alter the rate of interest for loans out of the Local Loans Fund.  He will remember that a large amount of the support that was got for the various Parties now comprising the Coalition Government was got on the understanding that, if they were given the power to control the affairs of this country, the rate of interest, instead of being the exorbitant one of 2½ per cent. which the Fianna Fáil Government was charging, would be nil.  But, instead of the Coalition Government reducing the cost of money and the interest charges on local loans from 2½ per cent. to nil, and giving the local authorities all the money they wanted, it has pushed up the rate of interest to 3¼ per cent., and is very choosey about the issues out of the Local Loans Fund to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a good thing for the country if, at this stage, the Minister would explain why he has changed his <Col N="704" /> mind in that regard.  I have always thought that he was slightly crazy in some of the things that he said in the old days, but a lot of people believed him and a lot of support was got for the Coalition Parties on the policy that they propounded.  The Minister obviously has changed his mind very drastically.  I should like to hear from him why he has done so.  I should also like to put him this question: would it not be less inflationary in the present state of affairs to give money out of the Local Loans Fund to the local authorities rather than to send them to their treasurers, the banks?  I think the Minister will agree with me that every bank loan increases the amount of money in circulation within the country.  He himself very properly pointed out in his statement to-day that he prefers to get a new loan from the general public, because in that way he will be decreasing the inflationary pressure.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to explain why he has not used a larger amount of various State funds for investment here rather than abroad.  He used to sneer very often at the waste paper that Fianna Fáil was buying when it made investments in British Government securities, but he himself, in reply to a question last July, told me that instead of decreasing the amount so invested he had increased it by £3,750,000.  It would be interesting if the Minister would explain the steps of his education in that regard, and explain thoroughly to the people why he changed his mind on it.  A discussion of that kind would be of some use to the country.  It might prevent a number of crack-pots getting votes for their ideas, as occurred in the last general election.</P>
    <P>I want again to stress the fact that a number of the borrowers out of this Local Loans Fund are the county councils and other local authorities, and that this year they are facing very hard days: that their grant for road improvement was cut down from £4,600,000, to £2,200,000, and that everything that possibly can be done to ease their burdens should be done. I would like the Minister to say why, in this financial year, he could not give <Col N="705" /> them loans out of the Local Loans Fund rather than to send them to their treasurers, the banks, who will charge them a very much higher rate of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the case that more money will be available to local authorities this year I am very glad to hear it.  I am sure the Minister is aware, or ought to be, that in the last two or three months there has been considerable unemployment and, consequently, a considerable amount of emigration from the country.  That emigration has been due, in the first place, to lack of employment, and in quite a number of cases to the want of housing facilities.  I believe that what the Minister has announced is a very good thing.  I believe it will help to increase house building and will thereby provide necessary employment. It is true that the local bodies saw the difficulties as we all saw them&mdash;that since we are passing through a period of inflation, the rents of these houses will have to be abnormally high.  For that reason I consider that it was a mistake to increase the interest on these loans.  On the contrary, I believe the Minister should have made an effort to reduce it.  It would, to some extent, help to reduce the rents that have to be imposed on these houses. The main reason why I am glad of this new move is that I hope it will stamp out this abnormal emigration and the enormous amount of unemployment we have in the rural areas.  Hardly a day, an evening or a night goes by but some unfortunate people are coming to me looking for work.  There is not a bus leaves County Meath that does not carry numbers of young people on their way to Great Britain.  Some go to the United States but most of them go to Great Britain.  If that is not stopped in some way or another there is not much use in building houses. There will be nobody there to build houses and when we come to all this development that is proposed we shall have nobody to employ.  I think this is a wise move on the part of the Minister. It may be a little late.  Honestly and candidly I believe that it is somewhat late.</P>

If the local bodies had been encouraged sufficiently the people would not have had to emigrate and would have gone into the houses.  Therefore, I am very glad that steps like this are being taken.  It is an indication and an encouragement to the people that there is some hope in remaining for a little time longer and trying to see what luck will bring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to say in his reply if money will be available to local authorities for the implementation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  Has he any information as to the extent of the new amount of the loan which will affect the operation of that Act?  I want to know what effect the new moneys made available will have on the administration of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  That is the Act by which the local authorities gave loans to the people on the security of a holding for the erection of houses.  The present position is that you can get a grant from the local authority.  Some counties, perhaps because they did not wish to raise money on the high rate of interest, have not adopted the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act or, having adopted it, they have raised a certain amount of money, have spent the money and let the matter drop.  I want to know if it would give new impetus to county councils to readopt, where they have already dropped it, the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act for the purpose of giving people loans to supplement the housing grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change with regard to the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  That money has <Col N="707" /> been provided before and money will be provided again.  The operation of that will all depend on the Local Government Department, but the provision of money is now being made and the limit has been raised.  So far as this particular estimate is concerned, no change has been made at all.  I gave the figure as being something short of £1,000,000 already authorised in connection with the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Reilly is driving at.  Up to this the limit that was provided by the standing legislation was £17,000,000 and is an extensive limit.  There have been moneys made available to local authorities in connection with housing. Twelve million pounds have been approved for housing.  There are more houses being built at the moment than ever before.  There is more money in circulation in the country, and I would call this a type of economic development scheme.  Existing advances to the local authorities from outside for capital developments, loans and smaller matters are running at the moment at about £3,500,000 higher than they were in the last financial year.  Three and a half million pounds more made available must have an effect on the problem of unemployment. If I take off £1,000,000, which in the year we are comparing with was appropriated to Aerlinte, and most of which was for the purchase of machines, the amount of money provided this year is about £4,500,000 higher than the previous year.  That must have its effect on unemployment.</P>

      <P>The question of roads has, of course, to be dragged into this debate.  The ex-Minister, Deputy Aiken, is quite concerned about the moneys for roads being cut down.  When he was in the Government he agreed, as he said in a communication to the local authorities, with reluctance, to extend the road grants for one year.  He viewed with astonishment the brazen proposal to make these funds available for a second time.  He reluctantly agreed but, at his request, his colleague in the Department of Local Government warned the county councils that this was only a yearly grant.</P>

There was all this nonsense about getting a lot of people to fill the Park with fuel and now we cannot get rid of it.  Am I to provide money to put on to the roads when the money has already been provided and continue that for ever more? Is this to be regarded as an annual burden?  No one can say that road-making is an industry.  It does give employment but it is uneconomic type of work.  We prefer to divert money from that to all these other schemes. The question is to provide money or not to provide money for the roads. With the greatest of ease I can agree <Col N="709" /> to money being provided&mdash;it does not cost me anything.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked about paper assets and Deputy Lemass was kind enough to adopt a phrase about paper claims.  It is a correct phrase and in the days when I was talking I was correct in saying that these were wasting assets.  I spoke, I think, in 1945 and the comment was raised that I was causing a scare in the country.  I said our assets would go down in value and I was told that was a shocking thing to say.  All I said was that they had gone down in value, and everybody now accepts that they have gone down by half.  I spoke in those days about the inadvisability of investing money abroad.  I still have the view that it is better to invest money at home.  I think the fall in the value of foreign held assets&mdash;the diminution&mdash;has stopped.  It is not <Col N="710" /> proceeding at such a rate.  Money invested in England has depreciated, moneys invested there pre-war have depreciated considerably, and that was the insane policy that was referred to.</P>

In August and September the Taoiseach. with his aide-de-camp and officers of the Department, went on an official visit to Canada and the United States. In November of last year the Minister for External Affairs and myself travelled to Paris for discussions with <Col N="711" /> Commonwealth representatives in connection with the repeal of the External Relations Act.  Those are the reasons why there is this addition to the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that one reason why a supplementary vote for travelling expenses is required now is because the Taoiseach visited the United States and Canada in September and October in an official capacity.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he paid an official visit to these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get further information on this matter, because when the Taoiseach left for Canada he was interviewed by Press representatives on the boat and he stated then, according to the report published in the Independent Newspapers, that his visit to Washington was entirely unofficial.  Subsequently, he arrived at Montreal and, again quoting the report published in the Independent Newspapers, he said, when questioned as to the purpose of his visit: &ldquo;I am a lawyer.  I am here as the guest of the Bar Association and for that period I have shed my political capacity and status.&rdquo;  That was in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 31st August, 1948.  If, as is now disclosed, the Taoiseach's visit to the United States and Canada was an official visit, for which the Dáil is being asked to vote money, it is rather difficult to understand why these statements which I have quoted were made by the Taoiseach at the time that the visit occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is more than of academic interest, because the House will recollect that during the course of his visit to Canada the Taoiseach not merely made there important pronouncements bearing upon the policy of his Government of which the people of this country learned through Press reports, but he also made other statements which appeared to be of even a more controversial character, statements which certainly aroused not merely a number of controversial discussions here but which provoked also <Col N="712" /> an explanatory announcement from the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    <P>I assume this is the occasion on which any questions relating to that visit should be raised.  Every official act of a Minister, or almost every official act of a Minister, comes before the Dáil eventually and generally in the form of a request to the Dáil to vote money to defray the expenses associated with that act.  We are now asked to vote money to defray the cost of an official visit by the Taoiseach to the United States and to Canada&mdash;a visit which the Taoiseach himself appears to have described at the time as unofficial.  Having regard to the events which characterised that visit, I think the Dáil should be slow to vote the money without getting some satisfactory explanation of these events.</P>
    <P>I do not want to widen the scope of this discussion to cover ground which was adequately surveyed in debates last year; but it will be recollected that shortly after the Taoiseach arrived in Canada the people of this country were startled to read in the newspapers that he had made the following pronouncement. I am quoting now from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 7th September. The <i>Irish Independent</i> quoted the Taoiseach as having made this announcement in the course of a radio broadcast; that appears not to have been correct.  The <i>Irish Press</i> reported the statement to have been made in the course of an interview; subsequent inquiries appeared to establish that account to be more accurate.  The announcement was to the effect that: &ldquo;Ireland was prepared to come to the aid of Canada if ever the Dominion were menaced by a communist country.&rdquo; Later, in the course of an address to a body called &ldquo;The Canadian Club&rdquo;, the Taoiseach appeared to have reiterated that undertaking.  The report which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 11th September, 1948&mdash; and which had been cabled by the United Press Agency&mdash;stated that &ldquo;Mr. Costello strong aligned Ireland against any possible Soviet aggression. He told his audience that Ireland will do her utmost to preserve peace but warned that &lsquo;to-day the very basis of civilisation that produced us is being <Col N="713" /> undermined by the most formidable enemy.  Throughout the world despairing multitudes sit parleying in the Valley of Indecision.&rsquo;&rdquo; The report then continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He added that Ireland would support the struggle for safeguarding democracy and liberty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That announcement by the Taoiseach, following his previous announcement, reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as made in the course of a radio broadcast but, as I believe, more accurately reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as made in the course of an interview with the representative of a Press agency, appeared definite and seemed to imply that a decision upon policy had been made and was being announced&mdash;a decision upon policy on which the Irish people had not been consulted and which represented a very decided change from the attitude previously indicated in Ministerial utterances, and certainly a very decided change from the attitude indicated in the utterances of these Ministers before their election to office.</P>
    <P>Later, however, there was a statement issued by the Government Information Bureau.  It was a very ambiguous statement.  It purported to deny or to correct the statements previously attributed to the Taoiseach; but, in fact, it does not appear to have done anything of the sort.  The statement which was issued on the 14th September, 1948, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following statement was issued by the Taoiseach, Mr. J.A. Costello, in Quebec on Sunday night, the Government Information Bureau announced yesterday: &lsquo;My attention has been directed to statements in a certain newspaper to the effect that in my address to the Canadian Club at Ottawa on September 10th, I defined the attitude of Ireland in the event of war.  The text of that address was circulated to newspapers and agencies.  The subject of the address was Irish-Canadian friendship and the role of Ireland in Canada in securing international co-operation for permanent peace on the basis of Christian principles and ideals.  I did not, in that address or elsewhere, define the attitude of <Col N="714" /> Ireland in the event of war.  In my Press conference in Ottawa on September 7th, I stated categorically that Irish national unity is a prerequisite to Ireland's joining the Western Union of Europe for defence purposes.  This statement was widely published in Canada and the United States of America.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Anybody reading carefully that official announcement issued by the Government Information Bureau would see at once that the Taoiseach did not deny in it that he had made the actual statements attributed to him.  He may not have regarded these statements as defining the attitude of Ireland in the event of war, but they were certainly interpreted here&mdash;and apparently interpreted in some quarters in Canada &mdash;as defining the attitude of Ireland in the event of war.  Uncertainty as to the position was not reduced by an announcement made by the Tánaiste, Mr. Norton, on 20th September.  Mr. Norton, according to a Press report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody here in respect of the Department of the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but I am quoting the Tánaiste in reference to this visit by the Taoiseach to Canada. The report said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Intervening in a debate at the resumed Labour Party Conference in Dublin yesterday on a motion dealing with Partition, the Tánaiste, Mr. W. Norton, said it was alleged by some, if not all of the Canadian newspapers, that Mr. Costello made a statement in a broadcast talk in Canada to the effect that he committed Ireland to rendering military aid to Canada in certain circumstances.  Since then there had been a categorical denial by the Taoiseach that he used the words attributed to him.  &lsquo;I have in my possession here,&rsquo; said Mr. Norton. &lsquo;a letter which I have since received from Mr. Costello, in which he confirms his Canadian denial and in which he avers that on the occasion of his Canadian broadcast he handed a manuscript of his talk to the Canadian newspapers and that manuscript does not bear the interpreta <Col N="715" /> tion attributed to Mr. Costello.  I think that ought to lay the bogey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as the Tánaiste's statement had reference to the facts, it certainly did not lay any bogies. As I have pointed out, he states that the manuscript of Mr. Costello's Canadian broadcast contains no statement bearing the interpretation which had been attributed to it. I have explained that the statement to which exception was taken, the statement which caused concern here and which was misunderstood in Canada was not made in the course of a broadcast.  It was made in the course of an interview with a Press representative.</P>
    <P>Similarly the official statement issued by the Government Information Bureau did not contain what the Tánaiste described it as containing&mdash;a categorical denial that he used the words attributed to him.  Mr. Costello, who is skilled in the use of words, presumably prepared that statement with care, and anyone who reads it with care will see that in no part of it does he deny that he used the words attributed to him.  If the Taoiseach made a statement on an important matter of national policy without preparation and consideration and realised afterwards that he had said something different from what he had intended, the right course for him to adopt was to have corrected himself as quickly as possible and have an official statement issued not merely to the Irish people but in Canada, where the significance of his remarks clearly was misunderstood.  If he spoke these words in what he thought was a private conversation with an individual who turned out to be a Press reporter and who publicised them, then perhaps they have still more significance, because it would be a disturbing matter for all of us if the Taoiseach, travelling abroad as a representative of this country, was using privately in a matter of that kind words different from those which he was using publicly.</P>
    <P>I prefer to assume that the Taoiseach used these words in the course of an <Col N="716" /> interview, knowing that he was speaking to a Press representative, knowing that the words would be published and that he did not decide that it was necessary to modify or to contradict them until he was informed from here of their repercussion on Irish public opinion.  If that is so, I think this is an occasion upon which he, or some of his colleagues in the Government, should clear up the position by a statement to the Dáil.  The Dáil is now being asked to vote money for this visit and to defray the expenses in connection with it.  I think that the Dáil would be held to have given a <i>post factum</i> approval to this declaration and other declarations made in the course of the visit, if it voted that money without getting such comprehensive and detailed statement as I have indicated.  I do not want to press that point further at this stage.</P>
    <P>On the technical point of the responsibility for these expenses, which I raised at the beginning, and whether in fact the Taoiseach went to the United States and Canada on an official visit, perhaps the Minister could also say at what stage, and in what manner, and when he received the invitation from the Canadian Bar Association, and why he thought it desirable, prior to making all these formal announcements of Government policy and all these controversial declarations upon matters of deep public concern, to state in Canada that he was going there as a lawyer, going as the guest of the Canadian Bar Association, and that for the period in which he was there, as guest of the Canadian Bar Association, he had shed his political capacity and status. Certainly, the preliminary announcements made by the Taoiseach&mdash;the statement on the boat before leaving, that his visit was entirely unofficial, and statements made afterwards&mdash;had not prepared Irish public opinion or Canadian public opinion for the important and controversial statements of policy which followed.  Many of the matters upon which the Taoiseach spoke then have been the subject of debate in the Dáil since, and I do not propose to refer to them.  I think, however, this question of an <Col N="717" /> undertaking to afford military aid to Canada in certain eventualities has never been satisfactorily cleared up, and that before the Dáil, by passing this Vote, declares the whole question to be closed, it should be cleared up. That is why I invite the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, or some member of the Government to intervene now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the matter were completely cleared up. I doubt very much, if it were an official visit, that he would have made the rather serious statements that he did make, that this country was prepared at any moment to help Canada if certain other countries attacked Canada. I always understood, and I think the people generally understood, that we as a people cannot be involved in any war either through promises or through action without the consent of the Dáil. <Col N="718" /> I think it is a thing that we should be extremely jealous about.  The technical aspect of the position does not make very much difference but in these times, when such visits are becoming more frequent, I think it would be a good idea if some definite rule were laid down in which it would be openly declared that the visits were official or otherwise.  So far as the other aspect of the matter is concerned, the promise that was made and withdrawn as Deputy Lemass said, has not been fully withdrawn.  Canada is a rather large country and I know myself that there are a great many people in Canada under the impression that at any time they are attacked we are going to go to their aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not saying that we would be very much use to them but at the same time there are people in the backwoods of Canada and in other places who did not understand, or who had no knowledge of the refutation that was made and they are still under that impression.  There can be no offence in discussing these matters and having them flattened out in a place where the matter can get genuine publicity.  I think that if there was a complete official explanation of it, it might in time catch up on the supposed promise made by the Taoiseach in which the Army of this country was compromised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequently the Taoiseach gave an address to the Canadian Club.  The text of that address was handed by him or by his aide-de-camp to the Press reporters. The reporters took the text of his speech and made a synopsis of it and cabled it throughout the world wherever the agency services were being accepted.  It came here and was reported.  I hesitated to think that the Taoiseach would make that declaration, in the precise form in which it was worded, in Canada without consultation with the Dáil or the people here.  I, therefore, waited for the publication of an official denial, and a statement came from the Government Information Bureau which purported to be a denial but which, in fact, was not. If the Taoiseach's answer to the case is that he never made the statement, why does he not say that in so many words: &ldquo;I never made the statement&rdquo;? If his speech to the Canadian Bar Association was misreported, why does he not say that?  What he did say in the course of the official contradiction, as it was described, was that in the course of his broadcast talk, or in the course of his address to the Canadian Club or elsewhere, he did not define the position of this country in the event of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the precise legal significance of that phrase is I do not know.  When it was followed by a further announcement by the Tánaiste to the effect that he had received a letter from the Taoiseach in which he averred that he gave the manuscript of his broadcast talk to the newspapers and that the manuscript did not bear the interpretation which was placed upon it, then it seemed to me that something was being covered up, because nobody ever alleged that in the course of his broadcast talk the Taoiseach made that statement.  It was reported that he made one statement in the course of an interview and another statement in the course of an address and the <Col N="723" /> attempt by the Tánaiste to reinforce the ambiguous denial which came from the Government Information Bureau, only made a confused matter still more confused.  It is a simple matter to put right and I am anxious to have it put right.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputies have suggested by their interventions, these statements were never made, this is the occasion on which that should be made clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand the Minister to say on behalf of the Taoiseach that these statements that he was reported to have made in the course of interviews&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that, I think that the Minister's assertion would be supported by the appearance of the Taoiseach in person.  I repeat it first of all because there is, as I have said, the fact that the report of the speech to the Canadian Club was handed out to the press agency there. The text was handed out by the Taoiseach's aide-de-camp to their representative. Secondly, so far as the Reuter reports are concerned, that association states definitely that the statement was made to their representative in the course of an interview.</P>

I want to say, by way of preface, that I am not objecting to expenses to the Taoiseach or to any member of the Government who has to go abroad to conduct the affairs of State.  While I am, to a certain extent, concerned with what our representatives say when they go abroad, I am rather inclined to think, in view of the Government's attitude to the Army, that the Taoiseach was inclined to be facetious when he was making such a statement.  The Taoiseach made a definite statement <Col N="724" /> that he was not going to Canada on official business.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may now continue my remarks.  We are getting to the stage in this House, and outside of this House people are in the same position, that when the Taoiseach makes a statement we are not sure whether it means what it says, because, as far as I can see, the Taoiseach has two guesses every time he makes a statement.</P>

      <P>If he wants to go to Canada on unofficial business he can do that.  He has the right to go there and carry out any business he desires, or accept invitations which he may receive from organisations over there.  But, if <Col N="725" /> the Taoiseach went there as a private citizen, why is this House being asked to vote a sum of money to pay these expenses?  I think it is a reasonable thing to ask that question.  I am not deeply concerned about what he said because, as I said a moment ago, he can hardly have been serious, particularly if we are to examine the policy of the present Government in respect to the armed forces of this State.  For that reason, I am not deeply concerned as to whether or not he made the statement. If he did make it, I think I can describe it as the statement of a humourist.  It is rather reminiscent of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle.</i>  What I am concerned about is, why this House should be asked to pay the expenses of a Minister who goes to a foreign country to conduct affairs which are his own private concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, if the case put forward by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Traynor is a genuine one, they have suddenly become very childish.  If they are going to entertain this House by indulging in quibbles as to whether this visit was official or not, and particularly in the light of the results, politically, for this country which this visit had, then I think that both Deputies when they come in here to quibble about a small sum of money are downright nationally dishonest. For the expenditure of this small sum of money, the Taoiseach by his visits to Canada and America was able to bring about a cementation of the relations between this country and those countries&mdash;something that had not been done previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that all that we have heard here this evening is a little bit of cheap Party politics and nothing else.  Deputy Lemass has sufficient intelligence to be able to read correctly and accurately the quotation which he gave to the House.  As to whether the Taoiseach said that for the period he was to be in Canada he was to be the guest of the Canadian Bar Association, and during that period shed his official capacity, I cannot see anything inconsistent in the Taoiseach being the guest of the Canadian Bar Association during a certain part of an official visit to Canada or in shedding his official capacity <Col N="726" /> during that period.  The Deputies opposite know full well that before ever he became Taoiseach he had received that invitation from the Canadian Bar Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With my normal intelligence I cannot see anything inconsistent. It has been done by many people before now.  Remember that even the tortuous stupidity of the Opposition cannot deny the fact that while in Canada there were conferences, meetings and various discussions carried out by the Taoiseach with results that you did not expect, when the External Relations Act was repealed.  Remember that we are in here dishonestly quibbling about the expenditure of a very small sum of money that facilitated, whether Deputy Aiken who has left the House likes it or not, the clearing up in a very expeditious manner the difference between external relations and the Republic of Ireland.  I got on my feet for the purpose of appealing to the Opposition to accept an assurance that has been given here by the Minister for Finance that the statement they allege is worrying them was not made. Possibly, in his attempt at facetiousness, Deputy Traynor may have hit on the truth because it does seem to me rather an inconsistent attitude between himself and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition if he says that the Taoiseach was humorous in referring to <Col N="727" /> what military aid Ireland might give Canada in view of the Government's attitude to the Army.  Deputy Lemass is gravely concerned that the Taoiseach should have made such a statement. He cannot have it both ways. The position is that the Opposition is now trying to make an issue of a statement which a Government spokesman has now said was never made and which the Taoiseach himself on previous occasions has said was never made.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that a simple and important matter such as this cannot be decided on proper principles. If we are to decide issues of finance purely on Party lines I think that we shall be setting an exceptionally bad precedent.  I had no doubt in my mind that when the Taoiseach left this country for Canada he left as a private individual on the invitation of the Canadian Bar Association.  He left it on that invitation because he was a distinguished lawyer and because he was following in the footsteps of many other distinguished lawyers from many countries who had been invited to address that assembly.  It was a great honour to the Taoiseach as an individual and a lawyer that that invitation should have been extended to the two of them.  At the time he went I had no doubt, and the general public had no doubt, that he left this country as a private individual and went there as a private individual.  That is borne out by what Deputy Collins just said &mdash;that the invitation the Taoiseach had was sent to him before he became Taoiseach at all.  If he accepted that invitation and travelled over there then obviously that is a matter for the <Col N="728" /> Taoiseach himself and it is not a matter for this Assembly or the Republic as a whole.</P>
      <P>I can admit that during the period the Taoiseach was in Canada and the United States he did make contacts that were useful and desirable from a national point of view.  If the matter were put to us in that way, that the Taoiseach did a considerable amount of national good in that visit and that as a special compliment to him this House should vote him a certain sum of money to cover expenses I do not think there would be any opposition whatsoever from the House. But if it is to be contended that this additional Estimate is necessary to cover a visit that was official, that was authorised by the Government and was part of the official duties and responsibilities of the Taoiseach at the time, then I think this House is being asked for something that the House cannot agree to give.  It is regrettable that the matter of the expenditure of public money should be utilised as the plaything of ordinary Party politics.  I think each and every one of us, irrespective of the Parties we belong to or whether we belong to a Party at all, has a very big responsibility to his constitutents in regard to the expenditure of public money.  I think the approach made by Deputy Collins is one that should not be made by any Deputy in this House to a matter of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a certain morality, a certain sense of responsibility, in regard to public moneys.  We shall get that sense of morality and that sense of public responsibility by an objective examination of the matter that is under discussion. It certainly came as a surprise to me to know that a visit that I believe was absolutely unofficial and purely personal made by the Taoiseach should now be made the grounds for an application in this House to sanction a Supplementary Estimate of £1,250.  That may seem a very small amount to Deputy Collins.  I suppose that in conjunction with the total national expenditure £1,250 is a small amount but <Col N="729" /> that is not the issue.  The matter that is involved here is the principle.  If the Taoiseach made that visit, as I believe he did, as a private individual and as a distinguished lawyer at the invitation of the Canadian Bar Association, I think this House ought not be asked to put up any expenses incurred in that visit.</P>
      <P>If it was the other way, that there was a substantial national benefit accruing from that particular visit and that this House in its generosity decides that it would be a good thing to pay those expenses, or portion of them, then that is another matter and one can look at that in a completely different manner.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to what the Taoiseach said in Canada, I always had a considerable amount of doubt about it until I heard the Minister for Finance this evening giving a definite denial.  No denial satisfactory to me was issued at any time.  There was a denial of something that was not alleged.  That was the position up to the present.  To-day in this House we had a categorical denial that the Taoiseach said in Canada at any time that if Canada were menaced we would come to their aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did, I have not seen it.  Until I heard the categorical denial by the Minister for Finance this evening my mind was doubtful as to what, in fact, the Taoiseach did say.  The denials that <Col N="730" /> were made were denials of something that was not alleged at all.  However, the matter seems to be specifically cleared up now by the statement made by the Minister for Finance this evening. That aspect of it is cleared up.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other aspect, I think it is the duty of the House, of every individual Deputy in it, to approach matters of expenditure such as this from the point of view of our public responsibilities and our duties as Deputies, and not because we may make some little bit of political capital against our opponents on the opposite benches.</P>

      <P>An attempt will be made to confuse this issue.  Is it not quite easy to understand that he has a dual capacity?  The Canadian Bar Association invited him before he was Taoiseach to address them as a distinguished lawyer.  Is it not possible to conceive that he could speak to them as a lawyer, putting behind him the fact that he was Taoiseach?  Is it not possible to conceive that before or after that date he was acting in his capacity as Taoiseach and accepted as Taoiseach?  I do not think the situation is so difficult to understand as some Deputies would pretend it is. That pretence is indicative to some extent because when the Deputy tries to make his case he distorts two newspaper reports and the presentation of them to the House.  Possibly that is a matter that the Deputy will take up with a member of his own Party later on when he tries to justify the statements made by him here to-night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The whole party were not officially there.  The people for whom the money is requested were officially there.  The Taoiseach was there for 27 days or nights.  Everybody knows that in the main he was there in an official capacity.  The proof of that lies in the invitations that he received.  The invitations were clearly those that would be accorded to a member of a particular State when visiting another State.  All the receptions were of an official type.  I understand that it <Col N="734" /> was suggested that he should be the guest of the King's representative in Canada.  The Taoiseach did not avail himself of that invitation.  But that was suggested at one stage.  There is no indication of any kind, examining the entire record, which would prove that he was there in any capacity except in an official capacity.  I always understood that he was going in an official capacity and I accordingly made provision for him and for some of those who went with him.  The Taoiseach has not said at any time that his visit was a non-official one.  He did say that it he made a <i>particular</i> visit that might be unofficial; but that did not actually occur.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Captain Cowan will appreciate that part of the visit was so to speak as a private individual.  But the Taoiseach, being Taoiseach, would never have gone to Canada merely to meet the Bar Association there.  He did there business which was of its nature wholly official business and what he did in the Bar Association was quite apart from that altogether.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matter, I would prefer to leave it on the complete denial of the comprehensive type that was given.  Deputy Cowan says, however, that he never saw a denial of a comprehensive type.  Deputy Lemass read or purported to read the denial as issued by the Government Information Bureau.  He made the case that that denial referred only to the address given to the Canadian Club.  I take that to be the Deputy's point.</P>

That editorial says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Yesterday the Government Information Bureau released the context of a statement issued by the Taoiseach in Quebec on Sunday night.  In it Mr. Costello says that neither in his address to the Canadian Club at Ottawa, or elsewhere, did he define what Ireland's attitude would be in the event of war.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy not misunderstand me.  I do not deny that certain Canadian newspapers carried that phrase.  The question at issue is whether the Taoiseach ever comprehensively denied that he made that statement. I said I was prepared to make that denial on his behalf.  Some Deputies said that I was going further than the Taoiseach was prepared to go himself.  But I do not think I am going further than that.  I think this matter should be allowed to rest.  A precise denial has already been given.  I do not think I have added anything to what the Taoiseach said.  But the Taoiseach is of the opinion that the matter ought to be comprehensively denied; and I am now comprehensively denying it for him.  With the exception of possibly two days, I believe that the visit was an entirely official one and that at no time was the fact that it was an official visit ever in doubt.  It was quite clear from the outset that it was official and provision was made, as provision would ordinarily be made in that respect, in accordance with practice and procedure.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain to me as a matter of technical interest, why the expenses incurred in connection with his visit and the visit of the Minister for External Affairs to Paris are accounted for in the Taoiseach's Vote?  The House is aware that the Minister for External Affairs has made other visits to Paris since. Presumably his expenses will have to be defrayed also.  Is it intended that those expenses will be accounted for on the Minister's own Vote or will they also be Charged against the Taoiseach's Estimate through another supplementary?</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that property occupied by the State is legally immune from rates but what happens is that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made to the local authority, although it is not legally due.

As the poundage has generally increased, we have to pay more to the local authorities in the way of rates set out in sub-head A.  It is a matter that automatically occurs.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for increased expenditure expected to be incurred on the services provided under certain sub-heads of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, offset by <Col N="739" /> estimated additional receipts under sub-head L &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid, and savings anticipated on other sub-heads. The gross additional expenditure is estimated at £305,500, the surplus receipts at £139,000 and the savings on other sub-heads at £113,500, leaving a net shortage of £53,000 for which the Supplementary Estimate will require to be voted.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under sub-head A includes substantial sums in respect of the following items which were not foreseen when the Estimate was framed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The purchase of Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, County Dublin, as alternative accommodation for Colaiste Moibhi, who had occupied portion of the former Hibernian Military School premises in the Phoenix Park.  The latter premises have been leased to the Dublin Corporation for hospital purposes.</P>
      <P>(b)  The purchase of a residence in Ottawa for the High Commissioner to Canada.</P>
      <P>(c)  The purchase of 3 Merrion Square, Dublin, for use as Government offices.</P>
      <P>(d)  The acquisition of the leasehold interest in premises in New York as office accommodation for the New York Consulate in place of less suitable accommodation surrendered.</P>
      <P>To meet this expenditure and provide for the contingency of further properties suitable for our requirements becoming available within the present financial year, an additional sum of £55,000 is required under this sub-head.  The necessity for the additional sums shown as being required to meet expenditure under sub-heads C, D (1) and D (2) arises mainly from increases in wages rates and of materials.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under sub-head 2 will be greater than anticipated due to increased rates generally and changes in rental terms.  To provide, in addition, for the cost of accommodation requiring to be leased for representatives abroad it is desirable that provision for the further sum of £4,500 be made under this sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Progress with the Brosna drainage scheme has been greater than anticipated so that expenditure under sub-head J (2) is expected to exceed the original sum provided by £29,000.  The position regarding the availability of plant and machinery proved much more favourable than was anticipated when the Estimate was framed so that it was found possible to purchase excavating machines and other plant in greater numbers than was originally expected.  Payments already made amount to £93,000 and further deliveries are expected before the end of the financial year.  To meet the additional expenditure a further sum of £119,000 is required for sub-head K (1).</P>
    <P>Surplus receipts from rents and fines are expected to amount to £122,400. This sum comprises unforeseen receipts, the principal item in which is a fine of £120,000 payable by the Dublin Corporation in respect of the lease to them of the former Hibernian Military School premises in the Phoenix Park. From harbour tolls, dues, etc., hire of plant, the sale of surplus and obsolete stores and old materials and miscellaneous items, further receipts in excess of the original Estimate are expected to be realised bringing the total surplus to £139,000.  The savings of £113,500, which it is expected will be realised on other sub-heads, consist mainly of savings on sub-head B (£40,000), sub-head F (£14,000), sub-head K (2) (£37,000) and sub-head K (3) (£19,000).</P>

      <P>On that question the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that some couple of months ago, with a number of colleagues from the constituency, I raised some of the points now raised by Deputy Smith.  I was wondering whether any inquiries had been made in the meantime regarding <Col N="741" /> the number of workers employed at that particular period and who were expected to travel long distances to and from their work.  Is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers as the work goes on and as the men have to go further afield from their own homes, to provide hutments, especially for single men?  There is also the question of working conditions and wages.  I should like to know whether there has been any decision on the part of the Government to improve the existing rates of wages following the increased rates given to agricultural labourers. I am not admitting that the principal portion of the workers employed on the Brosna are doing work that can reasonably be compared with the work normally carried out by agricultural labourers.  It is a work of a completely different kind especially in winter time.  I should be glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what steps were taken following the representations made to him a couple of months ago on these matters by Deputies Flanagan, T. O'Higgins and myself.</P>

      <P>On the question of wage rates on schemes carried out by the Board of Works or under the auspices of the Board, I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate the reasons why the wage rates are pegged to the agricultural rates in the different areas.  There does not seem to me to be any good reason for it.  In some cases I know of it means a definite hardship upon men.  For instance, there will be a rural improvement scheme carried out in County Dublin in the very near future and the proposed rate on that scheme would be the agricultural rate for the area. In my opinion it would be next to impossible to get men to do the job at that rate because it is so very much below the rate paid by the local authorities.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate why it is that the rate on this scheme is not at least on the same level as the rate paid by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned an increase of £29,000 under sub-head J (2).  I should <Col N="742" /> like to know what that actually represents, whether that £29,000 extra is for wages or, if not, how it is to be expended. I should also like to know if there is a sufficient number of men available to carry on the work on the Brosna.  His Department is in competition with Bord na Móna in respect of labour in that area.  In fact Bord na Móna have the advantage inasmuch as they have provided hutments for their men.  I should like to know whether the Parliamentary Secretary intends to provide similar accommodation for the men who at present have to travel long distances and for other men who will be called upon to work there as this scheme expands.</P>

      <P>With regard to sub-head K (1)&mdash;purchase of engineering plant and machinery&mdash;I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that machinery is more freely available now than it was.  Would he tell us what machinery is involved in this sum of £119,000 and how much more it will be able to carry out, how many schemes it can operate, and what is the reason for the delay in starting on other schemes besides the Brosna? When the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking in this House in years gone by he thought this work could be done a lot quicker than it has been done since he took over the responsibility for it.  In years gone by, when he had not any responsibility, he gave a different impression altogether to the people in the West of Ireland than the impression he has given now.  As to Shanganagh Castle, I understand it is being taken over for a school.  I understand that it is an awful place and that it is a scandal to ask young people to take up residence there.  I heard that, but I do not know how true it is.  I am told that it is not a satisfactory place at all.</P>

      <P>I understand there is a sub-head to provide machinery for the carrying out of these arterial drainage schemes.  Surely, that machinery will not be devoted entirely to the Brosna scheme.  I will content myself by asking whether it is proposed, in the near future, to go ahead with the Brick and Cashen scheme.  I understand that certain people, deeply interested in it, have been given to understand that it is likely to commence before the 1st July.  I do not want to pin down the Parliamentary Secretary to dates, but will he say if there is any foundation for the belief, which is widespread, that this scheme is likely to commence before the 1st July of this year?</P>

I wonder whether, on the sub-head &ldquo;purchase of sites and buildings&rdquo;, I would be in order in referring to a communication <Col N="746" /> sent to the Kerry County Council recently in connection with the building at Foynes.

In this communication, the Kerry County Council has been invited to take over the building at Foynes for tuberculosis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear as if this Supplementary Estimate were dealt with on the basis that all the extra money was for the Brosna scheme.  I am sorry that the sum for it is not three times or even ten times as much as it actually is.  Deputy Smith asked me about the Glyde and the Dee, and if all this new machinery is going to the Brosna.  We have not enough yet for the Brosna.  I went down there last week-end to see the position of the workers and to see what was happening there.  I am glad to be able to tell the House and the country that I was more than gratified with the work that is going on there.  Our labourers, our engineers, our gangers and the staff that we have there are doing their work perfectly.  If there are members of the Dáil interested in drainage work I would advise them to take a day off and go down to Ferbane and the Brosna and see what is happening there.  I think they will come to the conclusion that the great thing is not to rush drainage schemes.  They will see that what is being done there is well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the workers especially, and to give an <Col N="747" /> assurance to Deputy Smith and to Deputy Davin who raised a question about accommodation for the workers. I know that some of them have to travel long distances to their work.  As a worker myself, I fully realise that it is very hard for a man to give of his best if he has to travel a long distance on a bicycle and take his food with him.  At the moment we are at the outfall and hope that, within the next six months, we shall have it opened right to the Shannon.  We hope to be able to move our excavators and dredgers right up to Mullingar.  When we arrive at that stage, these men will not have to travel such long distances. One can never compare a drainage scheme with schemes such as those carried out, say by Bord na Móna or with a scheme for the provision of huts to accommodate the workers on the bogs for turf production during the period of the emergency.  The reason that one cannot make the comparison is that we hope to be moving soon from the point at which we are now. If we were to put up accommodation huts we would find in a few months' time that we would have to move further on.  Therefore their provision is impossible in our case.  We hope, in a few months' time, to have moved right up the Brosna and to be able to put our excavators at places where men will be readily available for work.  In that way there will be no accommodation problem for them.  I am sure Deputy Davin is satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>The question of the rates of pay to the workers was raised by Deputy Davin and Deputy Dunne.  I believe those men are entitled to good wages. They are good, sincere, honest workers. The rates of pay that we are giving them to-day are not pegged down to the agricultural rate of wages as was suggested by Deputy Dunne.  I want to point out to him that they are geting a higher rate of pay than the rate for agricultural workers.  If there are any complaints from those workers at any time as regards the rate of wages I assure Deputy Davin and the House that we shall be only too glad to take it up with them.  I can assure you that, while I am Parliamentary Secretary at <Col N="748" /> any rate they will get fair play because I think their work is what one may call number one in importance in this country.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the Glyde and Dee.  We shall go along there as soon as we possibly can and the same applies with regard to the Feale.  You learn a lot more if you go and see for yourself than if you are told these things.  I hope that the Dáil will co-operate in every way with me so that we can have three schemes going together.  One, like the Brosna, finishing off some day soon; the Glyde and Dee in full swing and probably the Feale area starting.  That is our intention so that we shall have three schemes going at the same time.  However, we have not got enough machinery for those jobs.  We are trying to get the machinery as you see in the Supplementary Estimate. Deputy Ó Briain, instead of referring to what I used to think about drainage, should start complimenting me on having such a huge amount in a Supplementary Estimate, an amount that I never thought there would be a hope of spending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish we could get machinery and plant so that we could deal with three or four times as much.  I know from my own Minister for Finance that it would be given freely and I am quite sure it would be the wish of the House that I should get it also.  Deputy O'Grady and other Deputies in the House referred to Foynes.  I think Deputy O Briain said that we put certain people in Shanganagh and it was not fit for them.  I am sure that Deputies realise that we consulted the authorities to ask whether they were good enough for them.  As the House knows, it was a first-class hotel. Surely it was good enough for them and was made suitable to accommodate them.  Even if it was a little hardship, and it was not, it really meant that people who were sick and dying from disease through the change being made could be accommodated in a hospital.  I think that is a great consideration for all our people.  The man <Col N="749" /> behind it was the Minister for Health. In his hard work the board co-operated with him and I believe that he did something that not only this country will thank him for but when he goes to his reward it will be marked down for him.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question of manufacturing furniture and said that Cork was not getting its fair share.  All our furniture is got by contract and if the people of Cork are not able to come forward as contractors and compete with the rest of the country we cannot help it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You dealt with them but not in the way in which I hoped you would.  My first question was, how many men are at present employed on the Brosna scheme?  How many men is the present organisation of the Brosna capable of handling at this moment?  If the number employed is not equal to the number that is capable of being employed there, why is it that a sufficient number is not recruited and if the reason for their not being recruited is lack of accommodation, what steps are being taken in <Col N="750" /> order to create that accommodation on the site of the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I missed that point.  It is not possible to give a definite number of men.  In the months of January, February, December everybody knows you can not have as many men employed in drainage work as you can in the summer months.  Sometimes we went up to roughly 500 men working on the Brosna.  At certain times of the year, for instance in the month of December after the huge floods, men did not come to us and we dropped down to roughly 130 men.  We are not short of men there.  You will not get as many men to turn out in drainage works in November, December and January as you will in the other months of the year and you do not want them to do so either.  As far as we are concerned the number over the year on the average is just the number that we require. When we look for them we get them. When we are short of men we look up others and we succeed in getting them. All I can say about the work on the Brosna scheme is that our engineering staff are down there and they are all doing their work.  We have no trouble whatsoever.  The House will be surprised to hear that through the work that they are doing we are now more than six months in advance of what we thought we would be.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that groups of men living in certain towns are expected to travel ten and 11 miles?  This is not the first time I have asked this question.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider the possibility of providing transport to enable large groups of men who are living, and available to work, in certain towns ten and 11 miles away from the point where the work is going on to get to their work under fairly reasonable conditions?  It is not fair to expect these men to cycle 11 and 12 miles each way per day.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will note that the extra money required is set out amounting to £21,360 and that savings on other sub-heads are expected to realise £21,350, so that the Supplementary Estimate that we are dealing with is a net total Estimate of £10.  It arises under three sub-heads.  The first relates to a grant that has been approved for St. Patrick's Agricultural College in the Diocese of Clogher close to the diocesan college in Monaghan.  This college was established in 1943 and it has the distinction of being the first diocesan college in Ireland, a fact of which the Diocese of Clogher has every reason to be proud.  It is the first diocese in Ireland which has realised, and given practical effect to that realisation, that the young boys leaving the primary schools in this country may legitimately choose between two forms of secondary education: either the classical and scientific education available in a secondary school or that particular secondary education which equips them to be competent farmers <Col N="752" /> on their own land.  In the Diocese of Clogher any boy leaving the primary school now can make that choice with the assurance that he will receive an equal standard of education in the agricultural college as is available in the traditional classical and scientific college provided by the diocesan authorities.</P>
    <P>Another peculiarly gratifying characteristic of St. Patrick's College is that it is organised and maintained with a view to providing education primarily for the sons of farmers who intend to return to their fathers' holdings and in due course to carry on the holdings, rather than as a college designed for the higher education of persons who desire to become instructors or enter official life in one capacity or other in the sphere of agriculture.</P>
    <P>This college has another remarkable and praiseworthy characteristic, and that is that its authorities have never hestitated to try various forms of educational theory.  It is sometimes not easy to persuade the sons of farmers to commit themselves to an academic course of one or two years in a residential college, but you can convince them of the desirability and advantage of taking a short course, say six weeks, three months, or six months, and that serves the dual purpose of conferring an advantage on the boy who takes the short course and also familiarising the young lads of the diocese with the experience of going to a boarding school and leaving their homes, which many young country boys have a profound reluctance to do.</P>
    <P>Those who have gone for short or medium courses have had to tell, when they return to their homes, that the experience has been agreeable and that they have found the atmosphere of the college congenial and friendly. We hope that St. Patrick's will be the pioneer of diocesan agricultural colleges which will ultimately be provided in every diocese in Ireland, so that any young man in this country who intends to become a farmer will have available to him a standard of education specialising in agriculture the equal of the education that is provided for any of his brothers who intend to <Col N="753" /> enter professions or other callings in life.</P>
    <P>Under the relevant statutes it is in the discretion of the Minister for Finance to provide grants to assist in the initial expenses of establishing a private agricultural college and, accordingly, after five years working at the college, the diocesan authorities approached me for such a grant and, all the circumstances having been carefully examined, the Minister for Finance authorised a grant of £10,500 which, as soon as the authority of the House is secured, it is proposed to pay over to the authorities.</P>
    <P>I believe I report them correctly when I say that in the event of Dáil Éireann approving that grant the college authorities will feel they have received a measure of co-operation from the House which they consider to be a fair and reasonable appreciation of their efforts.  I would wish to take this occasion of expressing to them, certainly on my own behalf and I dare to think on behalf of the whole House, our very warm appreciation of their enterprise and courage in launching this school and carrying it on during the early and difficult pioneer years, and to give them the assurance that so far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned, anything that lies in our power to help them in their work we shall be only most happy to be called upon to vouchsafe.</P>
    <P>The second sub-head of this Supplementary Estimate is for £1,650 and it relates to the salaries and wages which will become due as a result of our having expanded the soil testing service at Johnstown Castle.  This time last year the soil testing service in this country was located at Ballyhaise Agricultural School and the staff consisted of one soil analyst and one laboratory attendant.  The necessary agitation of samples was done by attaching a container to a bicycle wheel, which was rapidly revolved by the attendant.  I did not think that equipment was sufficient to meet the requirements of the country as a whole and I directed the transfer of the service to Johnstown Castle and the recruitment of a laboratory staff.  In May, 1948, the staff consisted of a <Col N="754" /> junior agricultural inspector, a soil analyst, four laboratory assistants, two laboratory attendants and a temporary clerical assistant, with a good deal of modern, up-to-date, scientific equipment.  I am glad to inform the House that the demands made upon this service rapidly outstripped the expanded staff which we then provided and it became necessary to employ additional staff, which has been secured in the recent past.  The Estimate now provides for the wages of ten laboratory assistants, three laboratory attendants and two clerical assistants.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled further to congratulate the House on the fact that the increasing payment for this service is brought about because of the additional staff and equipment provisions which we have had to make.  I must ask the House when my main Estimate comes before it for next year to make substantial additional provision and I feel sure that I correctly interpret the House's wish when I ask it to facilitate us in providing a service capable of keeping abreast of the ever growing demand for soil analysis which reaches us from every county in the country. During the period from April, 1948, to December, 1948, some 4,400 samples were tested.  We reckon that when the present staff is fully trained, which will take some little time, it should be able to handle 15,000 soil samples per annum.  I think we shall have to ask the House to make provision in time to enable us to train staff to handle a very much larger number of samples than 15,000 in the course of the coming financial year; but it is not necessary to trouble the House with that matter for the present.</P>
    <P>The third sub-head is a token Vote merely for the purpose of permitting us to implement to the wheat seed assemblers in respect of spring wheat the guarantee they enjoyed in respect of winter wheat.  Under that arrangement pedigree seed growers were assured that if they assembled winter wheat and any of it was left upon their hands they would be entitled to sell it to the millers and receive from the Government a compensating sum.  It transpired that my predecessor in office, contemplating a possible shortage in supplies of Atle spring wheat <Col N="755" /> brought in a quantity of that wheat.  I am not suggesting for a moment that he was blameworthy in the proportion he took, but the additional 50 tons that was brought in resulted in some surplus of seed remaining in the hands of the Pedigree Seed Growers and under the terms of the guarantee, had the guarantee covered spring varieties as well as winter varieties, they would be entitled to £338 3s. 3d.  I am sure I correctly interpret the House's wish when I ask them for authority to give that guarantee in respect of this small quantity of spring wheat, taking into account the fact that they have already given it in respect of winter wheat.  I believe that that substantially covers the matters provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  If there is any other matter upon which the House requires information I shall be glad to give that information when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with the complimentary references made by the Minister to the authorities responsible for the establishment of an agricultural college in Monaghan.  I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to give us some information as to the success which has attended that effort.  I would have preferred something of that nature rather than a merely gushing tribute to their work.  According to my information&mdash; I admit it is not up to date&mdash;the object in establishing this college was to give boys intending to settle upon the land an opportunity of training for the land. It was hoped that that training would equip them to carry on work on the land subsequently.  I heard it stated that in a certain town in that county scholarships were offered to farmers' sons.  The local authority providing the scholarships found it difficult, if not impossible, to find candidates for those <Col N="756" /> scholarships.  I think it is very desirable that we should examine the situation to find the reason for the difficulty to which I have just referred.  It is a fact that boys who enter agricultural colleges do so with the object of subsequently securing employment from the State, a local authority, or a private individual.  In the case of the small farmer it is often more economic for the farmer to keep his 14 year old boy at home on his own farm than to let him away to college.  I do not know what the reluctance was exactly in relationship to these scholarships in Monaghan.  I have certain suspicions myself as to the reason.  It would have been no harm if the Minister had attempted to explain why there is such a marked reluctance in taking up these scholarships.</P>

      <P>I thought it was so obvious that it was not necessary for me to deal with it, but I shall deal with it when I am concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the sub-head O (5).  I wonder is the explanation given by the Minister for this Supplementary Estimate entirely adequate.  When glancing at this Supplementary Estimate I immediately thought &ldquo;this has arisen because of the policy that was pursued by the present Minister since the 18th February last year.&rdquo;  The Dáil is being asked to vote a sum of money now because of the Minister's own policy on taking up office in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On his coming into office he issued public advertisements, paid for by moneys provided by this House from the pockets of the taxpayer.  He is entitled to do that as Minister but I have looked up these advertisements.  I have compared them with advertisements that were issued on my authority only a few weeks previously, and I find that in the advertisements for which he was responsible on coming into office, the dice was loaded, in so far as it could be loaded, through these advertisements and a pointer given to all farmers, with the emphasis not on wheat but on oats and potatoes.  I am not as I say, objecting to the Minister making that change.  He was within his right in coming along and saying: &ldquo;I <Col N="757" /> shall use public money for the purpose of advertising in the daily papers to give an indication to the farmers as to the way in which I want them to travel,&rdquo; but having used public money for that purpose, and having succeeded in inducing our farmers to grow 63,000 acres less wheat than the previous year and diverting our farmers to the growing of oats and potatoes he has created a need for a Supplementary Estimate for the purposes for which he has explained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now you have put your foot in it up to your knee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making this charge, that on coming into office the Minister for Agriculture used public money for the purpose of giving advice to the farmers to grow oats and potatoes on the assurance of himself and, I take it, of the Government, that they would find a remunerative market for these products.  As a result of that advice&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the need for this money arises because of the fact that the Minister appealed to our farmers to grow oats and potatoes rather than wheat, I feel I am justified in dealing with the matter in this particular way. I do not want to pursue it further than to say that while the farmers were advised to proceed along these lines, this House now finds itself asked to vote money to seed-assemblers to cover their losses as a result of that policy and as a result of the fact that farmers accepted the advice of the Minister to grow oats and potatoes for which they cannot now find a market.  Hence we see that farmers are no longer in a position to know where they stand, and as a result there is evidence that people are turning from tillage everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to note that farmers generally are anxious to ascertain the quality of their soil and are availing of the soil-testing facilities and equipment.  The Minister's estimate of 15,000 samples per year would hardly be adequate to deal with this problem as it exists at the moment. <Col N="758" /> There are 350,000 farmers in this country and I assume it will be necessary for each of them to send to the Department more than one sample of soil, because farmers have a variety of different soils on their farms.  Thus it would appear that, if our facilities are capable of dealing only with 15,000 samples per year, it will take a long time to have the soil of the entire State adequately analysed.  There is one matter to which I should like the Minister to direct the attention of this section and that is the question of whether those soil tests are absolutely accurate or otherwise.  I have in mind the case of a farmer whose soil, on test, was found to be very deficient in phosphates and lime.  He applied two tons of lime and half a ton of phosphate per acre and then had another sample taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In what form was the phosphate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was mainly rock phosphate.  Within a month after applying these fertilisers, he had the soil again tested and it showed a deficiency in both phosphates and lime. I know that in a test of this kind there is always the possibility that the sample may not provide a true and accurate test of the entire soil of a particular field and there is the possibility of error of various kinds but I think it would not be any harm if there were various checks and rechecks to ascertain, and to be absolutely certain, that the tests afford a true index of the quality of the soil.  I think everybody will agree that this service is very urgently needed.  At the present time it is only being availed of to a very small extent, so far as the farming community generally are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that, probably because the equipment and facilities are not yet fully developed, there is very little propaganda in favour of soil tests in the various rural areas.  I think there are very few agricultural instructors or very few people connected with the Department to urge strongly on the people to have these tests taken.  I am speaking of rural areas generally and I know what happens.  If those tests are to be very <Col N="759" /> valuable it would require better propaganda and publicity in order to have brought to the notice of every farmer the advantage of availing of these services. I know that at the present time if a farmer wants his soil tested, he has got to go chasing round to find an agricultural instructor to take a sample.  I do not think that should be necessary but that is a position which I think will eventually right itself.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the reluctance of farmers to take full advantage of the educational facilities that are being provided in institutions such as that mentioned here.  I think Deputies should know what is the real cause that farmers do not send their sons to such institutions or do not more largely avail of the educational facilities.  The real cause is acute poverty.  The small farmer or the agricultural worker who also needs agricultural education to a certain extent&mdash; certainly the small farmer&mdash;finds it very difficult to do without the services of his son when that boy comes to the age of 15 or 16.  He wants that boy to work on the farm to help him.  When we consider the low income of agriculture as demonstrated in the Minister's own county of Roscommon on a recent survey, we see the reason why these people are anxious to retain the services of their growing sons on the farm. It is unfortunate that that position obtains.  I am one of those who believe that the income from agriculture generally could be raised considerably by increased technical knowledge on the part of those engaged in the industry.  But, as I say, if a farmer is finding it difficult to carry on the work of his farm, if he cannot afford to employ an agricultural worker, and if he has a good, strong young boy of 15 or 16, the natural tendency is to keep that boy on the farm.  He will probably do just as much work as a grown-up man and give good service. That boy may be the eldest or one of the eldest of a family.  There may be many other young children and the farmer may find it difficult to carry on his work and may require that boy's services.  It is unfortunate that that should be the case, but we have to face facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> In connection with this matter of seed wheat assembly, will the Minister take steps to ensure that adequate supplies of Progress wheat will be available during the coming year?  I think there will be a fairly large wheat acreage in the coming year, and I think the value of Progress wheat is recognised by a great many farmers.  It has been found more satisfactory than Atle, and I think it will be widely sold if that variety of seed is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to soil analysis, that was very largely carried out by the sugar company in the years previous to this.  I should like to know from the Minister if he has any knowledge as to why the sugar company gave up carrying out these tests. Undoubtedly they were doing great service, and if the Department and the Minister take advantage of the technical knowledge that is possessed by the sugar company and their chemists, I think it would be cheaper in the long run.  I agree with him entirely that the present staff in Johnstown is totally inadequate for the work.  I have had experience of the tests carried out by the sugar company on various farms and, undoubtedly, they have succeeded in largely increasing the tonnage of the crops produced.</P>
      <P>In regard to sub-head O (5), this £9,200 is a burden on the State, but it only represents a very small portion of the loss that was caused to the farming community owing to the Minister's action.  On 3rd March last the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I ask you to do all you can to increase the area under barley, oats and potatoes.  For each of these three commodities there will be a certain profitable market next year. The more oats the farmer grows, the greater the service to the nation.  If any farmer finds himself with a surplus&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to discuss oats and potatoes?  I would enjoy that, but I would want to discuss them in great detail if they are to be discussed at all. The Ceann Comhairle ruled that we were not to discuss anything that was not in the Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If any farmer finds himself with a surplus and communicates with the Department of Agriculture arrangements will be made to put him in contact at once with a purchaser who will take his surplus at a satisfactory price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nothing there about walking it off the land.  At that time the seed assemblers had their spring seed wheat ready for the market.  There was an immediate change.  Farmers who had sold their oats the previous year at anything from £24 to £26 per ton immediately changed their programme and put in oats instead of wheat.  The result was that you had a reduction in the wheat area of 63,000 acres, which accounts for this £9,200.  On the average tonnage of wheat this year, that 63,000 acres represents £1,500,000, and for that 63,000 acres of oats the farmers got less than £500,000.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I have looked up the Estimate in connection with sub-head O (5).  The expenses in connection with imports of winter seed wheat were £6,000.  I take it that that is what this £10 extra is looked for under this sub-head.  The assemblers <Col N="762" /> generally estimate the quantity of seed required and fix their price.  I say that the Minister is absolutely right in looking for this £9,200.  That was due to his attitude and his advocacy of a certain policy here.  Further than that I do not intend to go, except to say that I do not think the Minister will have anything to pay this year.  I think the farmers have learned their lesson in what is, I admit, the dearest school of all, namely, that of experience.  Therefore I think that any advice the Minister gives them will see them rushing to do the opposite.</P>

      <P>There are three subheads to this Supplementary Estimate. With regard to the first&mdash;the sum required by way of Grant-in-Aid for the new experimental school in Monaghan &mdash;I wish we had a good many similar schools, not merely in Monaghan but in other counties as well.  It is an experiment, but I think a useful one.  It helps to fill a long-felt want&mdash;to provide higher education for farmers' sons, that is, for the sons of farmers who intend to become farmers as distinct from farmers' sons, and others, whose intention is to get employment through their knowledge of agriculture. I know a few boys who have spent a term there.  I can say that it has improved them considerably inasmuch as it has given an edge to their anxiety to acquire further knowledge on the subject.  It has made them eager to pursue a course of studies in agriculture. I hope that the enterprise will be entirely successful, and that it is the forerunner of many similar institutions that will be spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the fact that some local people were slow, and perhaps indifferent and disinclined to take advantage of the facilities provided. I suppose that is due to this, that most people imagine that anything local, simply because it is local, is not good.  I was forcibly reminded of that on one occasion when looking over a farm of land.  Standing in one field I noticed how green the next field was. I went to investigate how that was. <Col N="763" /> The one that I was standing in did not appear to be as green as the other. When I reversed my position and crossed over to the field I thought was so green, I discovered that it did not appear to me then to be as green as I had thought.  An idea of that kind seems to affect the minds of many people who fail to take advantage of facilities of the kind provided in this college.</P>
    <P>The next item deals with soil testing. I may say that this is an idea which I very much approve of.  I understand that, in other countries before a farmer prepares his cropping plan, he has every field tested in which he proposes to sow a crop in the ensuing year.  As a result of the test he is in a position to know the exact manurial requirements of each field.  He will know the fields in which certain crops may or may not be sown.  While these tests may not be 100 per cent. accurate, due to various causes, nevertheless they form a very valuable guide, so that any progressive farmer who wants to run his farm successfully will, I think, be well advised to take advantage of the facilities which are being provided.</P>
    <P>As regards the other sub-head, the one about which there seems to have been some controversy is that under which compensation is provided for the seed assemblers.  Whether the Minister intended it or not, his pronouncements from once he took office gave farmers throughout the country the idea that he was opposed to tillage, and particularly to the growing of wheat.  Now, I do not want to pursue that matter.  I think the Minister realises, and I am speaking in all sincerity when I tell him, that a great many farmers, particularly the bigger farmers went out of tillage.</P>
    <P>I heard of one myself who, immediately the change of Government took place, converted 200 acres of tillage into grass.  If that were done on a big scale, is it any wonder that there would be a big reduction in the area under wheat?  The Minister will, of course, not like to believe that, but he should make some inquiries from farmers up and down the country.  They will tell him that what I have said is the general consensus of opinion in the <Col N="764" /> country.  I wonder whether he meant to convey that idea or not.  At any rate, it got into the heads of the people, with the result that many of them last year switched from the sowing of spring wheat to the sowing of oats and other cereal crops.  That meant that the wheat was left on the hands of the assemblers, and now the Minister has to come here with a Supplementary Estimate to the tune of £9,200 to compensate them.  The Minister stated, and truthfully stated, that wheat can be a profitable crop. I was glad to hear him make that statement because on any land that is suitable for the growing of wheat it is undoubtedly one of the most profitable crops that a farmer can sow.  It can be grown here as well as in any other country in the world.</P>

      <P>On the question of soil analysis I do not forget that, at an early stage when speaking on this, the Minister indicated very clearly that he was speeding up the examination of soils.  He informed those sending up soils to be analysed that the tests would be done almost immediately.  I do not know whether that was a wise thing to do or not.  In my experience it is the agricultural instructors who usually send up these samples of soil, and they have complained to me frequently that they did not get any results.  The farmers then came along and told me that the instructors must not have sent up the samples at all. If that is a fact, if the Minister would do something to explain the considerable delays that there are&mdash;a large amount of analyses to be made and so forth&mdash;it would satisfy both the farmers and the agricultural instructors. I do not know if there is that considerable delay, possibly there is. I am quite sure they must have sent an amount of soil to be analysed.</P>

      <P>If some public statement was issued in that way it would make it more pleasant for the agricultural instructors and for all of us.  Farmers have complained to me bitterly.  They came to the conclusion <Col N="765" /> when there was so much delay that they had not sent up any soil for analysis at all.</P>
      <P>With reference to the wheat situation and this subsidy to compensate seed assemblers, I am afraid that the Minister is at fault there and he is quite justified in paying this money to them. The Minister definitely stated, since he became a Minister, that the farmers should grow plenty of oats.  Before he became a Minister he definitely stated that they should not attempt to grow wheat at all.  The situation has become very involved both as regards potatoes and as regards oats.  In one district alone in the County Meath in which a large amount of potatoes has always been grown there are now well over 1,500 barrels of potatoes that cannot be sold and which are likely to become a total loss.</P>

      <P>To be quite candid, the Committee of Agriculture did get in touch with your Department.  I do not know what the results are.  One week ago nobody had come to take them away and nothing had been done. That demoralises farmers a good deal. I think some effort should be made to compensate them, especially in potatogrowing districts, if these potatoes have become a total loss.  I should be obliged to the Minister if he would make some inquiries and indicate that he had some sympathy with those people.  That resolution was sent from the Committee of Agriculture at least a fortnight or three weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Estimate with the exception of the educational part of agriculture.  For years there has been great disappointment in that.  Pupils go to these agricultural schools and colleges with the definite intention of getting a job out of it.  I have seen quite a number of them who did not get a job at all. When they came back to their fathers <Col N="766" /> and mothers they were told they had no brains, that they could not get a job and that they were no use on the farm.  We should have sufficient propaganda or something else to change that attitude of mind which they adopt. Generally speaking, they do not go to these colleges for the purpose of getting educated specifically in agricultural production.  They go simply for the purpose of getting a job.  If they do not get a job out of it and come back to the farms they are simply looked down upon as duds and told they are inefficient and incapable. Instead of doing good it demoralises them.</P>

      <P>I am glad to support this Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture.  I am pleased to see he is taking a keen interest in the agricultural schools of this country.  The training of our young farmers is very important because agriculture is one of our main industries.  A great deal has been said by Deputies about too much oats and too much potatoes.  I should like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture on his great achievement of selling 50,000 tons of potatoes to the British Government.  I do not think that any man in living memory has known that amount of potatoes to leave this country.  I would say in passing that the farmers of this country are as well off as they have been in living memory.  That is a great credit to the Minister for Agriculture. Again I would like to compliment the Minister for Agriculture on what he is trying to do, working hard and conscientiously for the country.  I hope his efforts will prove fruitful.</P>

      <P>I am sure he has.  It was interesting.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is proposed at any future time to establish the temporary assistants in Johnstown provided for <Col N="767" /> in this Vote in the matter of soil testing. I think that is important.  I am sure that the Minister will also realise the importance of having that post established permanently.  I did not have the advantage of hearing the Minister's opening remarks on this matter but I gather there is a two months' delay in the matter of getting returns from soil samples sent in there.  Is it possible to provide for the shortening of that period to any extent?  That is all important for the farmers.  They complain about the length of time it takes to get samples returned to them.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of that.  An increase in the actual rate of progress and a shortening of the time would be an advantage to agriculture as a whole.</P>
      <P>With reference to item O (5) of £9,210 the Minister admits, I am sure, that the whole of that arose out of his pronouncements.  Wheat would have been sown by the farmers were it not that the tendency for farmers last spring, arising out of the Minister's pronouncements, was to switch away from wheat and to sow oats in the month of March when the farmers had all their land prepared for sowing. Last year 95 per cent. of the farmers had all their ploughing done that they were going to do for the year when the Minister's policy which was announced at that time indicated that he wished farmers to go away from sowing wheat on to sowing oats.  We know of the disaster all over the country that resulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There were very disastrous results.  Even at the present time, in the month of April now almost here, there are many farmers with the total products of their last year's harvest still on hands which they cannot cash to my own knowledge and they will not be able to cash in the present year unfortunately for themselves. <Col N="768" /> Many of them who depended on their oat harvest to meet all the liabilities of the year have been unable to dispose of their whole harvest.

The fruits of his policy are well known to the agricultural community, to their disadvantage in many directions.  I hope the Minister will provide more staff for Johnstown and extend the buildings there.  I understand that very soon the buildings will be found inadequate and it will be necessary to extend them as the demand grows for soil testing.  We hope that the Minister will be compelled in the near future to provide a larger staff.</P>

I wonder will the Minister try to get employment for people trained here as agricultural experts and instructors?  I welcome any scheme that will educate our people more in agricultural matters.  It is rather sad to think that during the last 12 months so many of our trained instructors had to leave the country.

The Chair having commented on the irrelevance of his remarks, he executed an elephantine departure.  There was, first, the reference to the oat-afflicted widow; then he begged the pardon of the Chair and rushed on to the next irrelevance. But the widow was standing in front of us with her surplus oats.  All that ráméis about oats was organised in the Fianna Fáil Party room.  Before they went home for their Christmas holidays every Deputy of the Party was told to go round the country and urge on farmers to sell their oats and potatoes for the purpose of creating a glut upon the market; and one unfortunate individual, not knowing the ropes, Deputy Davern, got up on a public platform and blurted out the whole thing on December 13th last, revealing that the whole squad were racing around the country deliberately trying to create a situation in which the <Col N="771" /> market would be flooded with potatoes in the hope that individual farmers would experience a loss and that there would be some confusion.</P>

    <P>Deputy Allen was anxious to know if we would accelerate the return of soil samples.  We are doing all we can in that direction and I am prepared to <Col N="772" /> certify to the House that the men working on this are performing veritable prodigies considering the task with which they have to grapple. Deputies will realise that the procedure of securing new entrants to the Civil Service is not the most expeditious that has ever been devised by the mind of man.  Additional recruits are bespoken; when you get them they have to be trained in the work.  We cannot expect the officer responsible for soil analysis to get all these recruits to work as expeditiously as they will be able to work when he has time to give them expert training.  I am glad to testify to the zeal and industry of everyone associated with this work and to assure the House that they are doing all they can to catch up on the arrears.  It is a source of some gratification to be able to recall that the arrears are due not to any slackening of speed in dealing with samples but to the ever-growing number of samples being sent in and I think that constitutes the highest tribute that the service could receive. Deputy Allen, another innocent babe in the wood, wants to know if I will guarantee that all the civil servants engaged in Johnstown Castle will be established.</P>

      <P>A very formidable distinction. I think all civil servants should be established civil servants.  I believe the whole system of having unestablished civil servants is a thoroughly rotten one.  I do not believe any Minister of an Irish Government ever took any other view. I imagine that most of our predecessors in office shared that view and most of their predecessors shared that view <Col N="773" /> also; and most of the Ministers of every British Cabinet responsible for running this country back into the middle of the last century shared that view.  But the Deputy knows that the whole problem of eliminating the system of temporary servants in the Civil Service is one of great complexity and difficulty in the attempted resolving of which many Ministers for Finance have burned much midnight oil.  I hope that the officers of my Department in Johnstown Castle will be in due course established civil servants, as I wish it for every member of the public service; I am sure the Deputy will share my rejoicings if and when that desirable end is achieved by any of us.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Lord Mayor of Cork for his kindly observations.  I am so old a hand at politics that I do not expect people to be grateful.  But the most hard-hearted of us has to confess that when somebody thinks it worth his while to speak an appreciative word it is very far from unwelcome and I thank him for taking the trouble to do what he did this evening.</P>
      <P>'Pon my word, I think the inspectors in County Meath would be a great deal better employed addressing their lamentations to their superior officers in the Department of Agriculture rather than to Deputy O'Reilly.  I shall certainly have a note made at once of the complaints made to Deputy O'Reilly by the inspectors of my Department about the inefficiency of their fellow employees in the public service.  If the complainants seek out Deputy O'Reilly again I would be grateful to him if he would remind them in a forceful way of the proprieties and decencies usually associated with the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Grady has a great deal to say about wheat.

From the harvest of 1947&mdash;the last harvest on which the radiance of Deputy Allen's countenance fell from this side of the House&mdash;we had 1,600,000 barrels of wheat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;Oh, no.  Since I became Minister for Agriculture for every good that happens, thanks be to God; for everything bad that happens, blame the Minister for Agriculture. For 16 years we have been treated to every ray of sunshine as a special dispensation of the Minister for Agriculture; and every misfortune was something that the poor man could not help because it was an act of God.  But I do not mind this reversal in the very least.  I prefer to be judged by results. Whether it was due to the benevolence of God and the rejoicing of Heaven for the deliverance of this country from the plague from which it suffered for 16 years, there is the result, and that is what matters.  When Deputy O'Grady deplores our reluctance to cry out for an ever-growing acreage of wheat as distinct from barley, oats or roots and other crops, does he ever advert to the fact that native wheat costs approximately £28 per ton delivered at the mill?</P>
      <P>Imported wheat costs anything between £20 and £25 and when Deputy Lemass used to go to town, in his solicitude to ensure that no one would go hungry, it was liable to cost almost anything at all.  The highest anybody ever struck was £50 a ton.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the House that Deputies should carefully consider this matter.  If the land of this country were given up to the growing of an ever-increasing harvest of cereals, roots and grass for conversion into livestock and livestock products, and if out of every acre we could profitably earn the price of 16 barrels of wheat, is it sound economics, instead of growing on that acre what could be exchanged for 16 barrels of wheat, to grow eight barrels of wheat?  Suppose I offered to Deputy Allen two varieties of wheat and said that the one in my left hand would give a yield of 16 barrels per acre, and the one in my right hand would give eight barrels an acre, which would the Deputy sow?  He does not care to answer that question. How very cautious the Deputy is becoming!</P>

      <P>He does not like to answer that.  I think he would prefer to sow the variety that would yield 16 barrels.  When the Deputy comes to learn that by growing another cereal crop and a green crop and converting them into protein foodstuffs, he can earn sufficient money to buy 16 barrels of wheat instead of growing eight barrels of wheat, I think he would be a silly-Billy if he went on growing eight barrels even though he thinks it is the Gaelic thing to do so.  I do not think it Gaelic to make a fool of yourself.  I do not think it Celtic to be incompetent. I do not think it is patriotic to be idiotic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that it is strictly relevant under sub-head O (7). About the first thing I said after I came into office was: &ldquo;The real test of a democratic Government is not to eject a defeated Opposition but having taken office, to show due regard for the feelings and convictions of the exGovernment which now constitutes the <Col N="777" /> Opposition.  A great many ardent supporters of the Fianna Fáil Government have a kind of mystic devotion to the wheat crop.  There will be those who will suggest to them that there is now a desire to trample on them and to completely abolish their whole approach to agriculture.  I believe it would be in the best interests of the country as a whole to give an early earnest of the fact that we are determined to deal in a generous way with the minority in this country who have just as sacrosanct rights as we have. Accordingly, if it will not involve the State in any serious loss, I must ask Parliament for authority to give the fullest reassurance to them that they are completely free to follow the agricultural policy in which they, as individuals put their faith.  I thought it was the right thing to do, if not from the economic, from the political point of view in the highest sense of the word, for the purpose of establishing that the minority in this country have rights just as sacrosanct as those of the majority and that a democratic Government, if it wishes to be democratic, must effectively acknowledge and respect these rights.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry complains that the sugar company has given up testing soil.  I did not know that but I do not control the sugar company.  I do not want to control the sugar company. I am satisfied that if it has a soil-testing station, it is excellently conducted. If they wish to continue it, they have my blessing.  If they have closed it down and wish to restart it they will do so with my cordial approval, if it is, in their absolute judgment, in the best interests of the company to do so. Deputy Corry also dwelt at some length on the subject of potatoes and oats.  I bear in my mind what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has had to say on that matter and I shall postpone any further pronouncement on these matters for a more suitable occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be distressed to hear, if it is true, that any farmer, as reported by Deputy Cogan, was chasing around to find somebody to test his soil.  So far as I am aware if a farmer in Wicklow or any other county will send a penny post card to the C.A.O. of the <Col N="778" /> county or simply to the county committee of agriculture, the agricultural instructor will call on him at the earliest possible moment, take the soil sample and send it away.  If in any county correspondence is not promptly acknowledged and attended to I will be glad to know of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke of a discrepancy between the test that was done on soil on which subsequently two tons of lime and ten hundredweights of phosphate were put and the test taken after that application.  I should like to know who took the samples.  A great many people imagine that the taking of soil samples is a perfectly simple procedure, but really it is not.  The taking of each individual sample is a comparatively simple procedure but the discretion which must be used in the number of samples taken and the mixing of them in order to get an average sample is not so simple as it looks.  I would be glad if the Deputy would inquire if these samples were taken by a competent person.</P>

      <P>In the same field on two successive occasions?  I would be glad if the Deputy would ask the instructor concerned to let me have particulars. The last point is the matter mentioned by Deputy Smith, who made sinister observations about suspicions which he was not going to mention.  Why he would not mention the suspicions I do not know.  He asked dramatically why students of agricultural colleges did not want to work on the land but wanted to become inspectors or instructors. Who, in the name of God, would want to work on the land for the last 15 years?  It was a constant purgatory.  The more you knew, the worse it was, because the more competent you were to judge of the disgusting folly which masqueraded as an agricultural policy and which reduced the soil to a condition in which the cows eating the grass could lie down and die of starvation.</P>

      <P>St. Patrick's?  I do not think it is full, but it has done a series of short courses.  It has a number of students in it and is, I believe, making steady progress.  That is something on which that college may be most cordially congratulated, because it is primarily designed to serve the sons of local farmers.  It does take boys from other dioceses, but when boys from the small farms in Fermanagh, Monaghan and the other counties in the diocese present themselves in sufficient numbers to occupy all the available places in it, the college will be primarily designed for them.  I would be very much surprised if within the next few years you will not see St. Patrick's College with no vacancies for any one other than a child born in the diocese of Clogher.</P>
      <P>I think I ought to make one thing clear.  When opening, I referred to the necessity for the supplementary under sub-head O (5) arising exclusively out of the purchase of Atle wheat.  In that I made a mistake.  The Atle purchase renders necessary only £338 3s. 3d. of the total sum asked for.  The assembly of domestic seed created a surplus of about 80,000 barrels, in respect of which the bulk of the £9,000 has to be paid under the implied agreement to indemnify the seed assemblers.</P>

      <P>My rejoinder to Deputy Allen was that I do not believe in having temporary public employment, that I thought all public servants should be recruited on an established basis.  That is, on the broad general question.  Some of these technical officers were junior inspectors in the Department's service, established officers.  As to the temporary clerical assistants, frankly I do not know how they were appointed.  They were appointed by whatever is the usual procedure in the Department.  They are not people with Civil Service certificates. How they were appointed, where they were got, or how they were got I have not the faintest notion, except that I am satisfied that competent officers of my Department saw that they were the best that could be got and that they were got in the most expeditious and satisfactory way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made a few minutes ago.  The allegation that Deputy Davern made a statement to that effect on the 13th December is, to the knowledge of Deputies, incapable of being true.  The Donegal by-election took place on the 6th December. The Government's plan to support the price of oats by establishing official buyers to buy oats at a named price was announced some weeks before that election took place&mdash; that is towards the end of November. Therefore, any statement made by Deputy Davern in December could not, in the least degree, have influenced any farmer in the matter of the disposal of his oats because by that time every farmer must be presumed to have known the Government's plan for supporting the oats price.  I would not have intervened at all except for the statement made by the Minister, and for the purpose of getting a complete contradiction of that statement on the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reaffirm in the most categorical and positive way that Deputy Davern, on a public platform in the County Tipperary, maliciously exhorted the public to sell their oats and potatoes, well knowing that at the time he did it the only possible result would be seriously to depress the price of both commodities, to double the difficulties of the small man who was most vulnerable and with utter indifference to the cruel and iniquitous wrong that he was perpetrating upon defenceless small farmers for a political end in which he was encouraged by the leaders of his Party. He in public did that which I believe his colleagues in private did&mdash;they sought to create every difficulty, every embarrassment and every exacerbation in regard to what appeared a surplus of these two commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did so well knowing that if, instead of taking a destructive and viciously irresponsible line, they had encouraged the farmers of the country to stay their hand where possible, a lot of these two crops would pass into consumption gradually, that none of the <Col N="784" /> admitted difficulties that were created need have been created, that none of the perturbation which they hoped would be grist for their contemptible political mill would be available, and that many unfortunate people who have been injured as a result of that irresponsible campaign would have come scatheless through the disposal of their crop.</P>
    <P>I say further that Deputy Davern's declaration from a public platform was not reckoned with by his leaders.  I believe that his colleagues were encouraging him to do so surreptitiously by whisper, rumour and underground, and that he blabbed it out in public&mdash;that, but for his silly indiscretion, it would never have become possible for me to expose the whole transaction before this House.  I repeat that that speech was made in the month of December, and that it was published in the <i>Tipperary Star.</i>  I refer Deputy Lemass to the issue of that paper for the month of December.  I attribute 90 per cent. of any inconvenience that was caused to those who had crops of potatoes or oats for sale to that malicious campaign that was conducted by most Fianna Fáil T.D.s by rumour, whisper and secret incitement, and by the poor innocent, loud-mouthed Deputy Davern off a public platform.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,350 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for the Expenses of the Maintenance, etc., of Criminal Lunatics in the Dundrum Asylum (8 &amp; 9 Vict., c. 107; and No. 19 of 1945).</P>
      <P>The additional sum required under sub-head A of this Estimate is mainly due to the very heavy expenditure in connection with medical treatment of patients.  Under sub-head B the additional sum required is due to improvements which have been made in the dietary of patients and also to increased prices of foodstuffs.  The extra expenditure on uniform and clothing under sub-head C is due to an underestimation of the cost of these items for the current year.  For some years it has not been possible to obtain full requirements or satisfactory quality in clothing materials and the improvement in this position during the current year is reflected in the extra cost under this sub-head.  Under sub-head D additional expense is mainly due to the provision of a cine-projector and to the cost of materials for occupational therapy.  There is also an estimated deficit under sub-head E due mainly to increased cost of feeding-stuffs and farm requirements.  The total amount of £1,622 required will be partially offset by increased Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £271 which arise from an increase in the receipts from the farm and garden, and the net additional sum necessary is, therefore, £1,351.</P>

      <P>A visiting committee has been set up to investigate and to give us all the assurance that the conditions in Dundrum Asylum are completely satisfactory.  I felt it was a desirable development that a group of people as in other institutions in the country should be authorised to investigate, to visit, and to hear complaints in Dundrum Asylum, and if there were any deficiencies in the organisation or inadequacies in the diet or living conditions that they would be reported to me and I should do everything I could to improve conditions.</P>

This is an institution in which there are persons under the care of the Minister for Justice really.

I raised the matter of the <Col N="788" /> selection of the officers to this board. They are not responsible to this House. They are responsible to the Minister. They have certain statutory responsibilities under the Acts of this particular institution, but there is a question of what arises in the institution which must be discussed somewhere. That is why I have sympathy with Deputy Connolly although I do not know anything about the case.</P>

      <P>I do not fully remember the question to which the Deputy refers but I think the particular questions around that time were the expression of a general feeling of dissatisfaction with conditions in Dundrum Asylum at that time and subsequent to that time.  It might be helpful to the Deputies to know that this visiting committee who went in with full authority to investigate every aspect of the organisation and administration of the institution found that on full investigation the only criticism of the place they could make was that there was an inadequate number of blankets supplied to the patients.  That is the sum total of the remarks made by this committee, and I think it is a reasonable answer to the other rather wider suggestions which have been made in regard to it.  That insufficiency in blankets has since been rectified.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I am quite in order in saying that for the last 26 years I have been holding inquests in Dundrum Asylum anything from six to 12 times a year and during that period a full inquiry has always been made into the death of any particular patient in that institution?  Never once has there been the least reflection on the administration there, nor at any time has there been any ground for thinking that any neglect has taken place.  I can assure the House that these inquiries were held sometimes with juries and sometimes without them, and on all occasions the fullest possible inquiry has been made into the death of the person.  Sometimes that involves an inquiry into the medical treatment which each patient receives there.  I can only say that after 26 years' experience there nothing could have excelled the kindness which was shown to the patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £324,225 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister of Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
      <P>The original net Estimate for the Department of Health was £1,355,590. This was later increased to £1,361,590, as a Supplementary Estimate of £6,000 to provide funds for an expanded scheme of health publicity was subsequently introduced.  It is now anticipated that, after making allowance for savings amounting to £11,000 on certains items of the Vote, the charges which will come in course of payment within the year will, for reasons which I shall presently explain in more detail, amount to £1,685,815.  It is accordingly necessary to seek a further supplementary grant of £324,225.  The sub-heads under which this Vote will be accounted for are:</P>
      <P>Sub-head E&mdash;Expenses in connection with international and other congresses, additional sum required £3,625.</P>
      <P>Sub-head H&mdash;Grants to health authorities, additional sum required £231,000.</P>
      <P>Sub-head M (1)&mdash;Child welfare, schools for mothers, etc., the additional sum required is £4,925.</P>
      <P>Sub-head M (2)&mdash;Grants for the supply of milk to necessitous children, additional sum required £1,800.</P>
      <P>Sub-head M (3)&mdash;Medical treatment, etc., of school children, additional sum required £8,675.</P>
      <P>Sub-head M (4)&mdash;Prevention and treatment of tuberculosis, additional sum required £80,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head M (5)&mdash;Treatment of venereal disease, additional sum required £4,700. <Col N="791" /> The provisions under sub-heads M (1) to M (5) represent balances of grants due in respect of years previous to 1948-49.  I shall now explain the details of the sums required under these sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The main increase arises under sub-head H&mdash;Grants to health authorities. The original Estimate for this sub-head was £1,450,000 and the additional sum now required is £231,000, making a revised total Estimate of £1,681,000. The grants under this sub-head are payable in pursuance of Section 4 of Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, and are intended to recoup the excess of approved health expenditure in the current year by each health authority over standard expenditure, which is the net expenditure on health services of each health authority in respect of the year 1947-48.  Pending the completion of the audit of local authority accounts, it was necessary to base the grants on estimated figures of standard expenditure as well as on estimates of the health authorities' expenses in the current financial year and it was, therefore, difficult at the time the Estimates were prepared at the end of 1947 to make accurate forecasts.</P>
    <P>The increase in health authorities' expenditure represented by the above figures arises under several headings and is a consequence of the intensification of health measures advocated by my Department and effected by local authorities during the present financial year.  In addition there was increased expenditure on stores and equipment, much of which was not available during the emergency.</P>
    <P>One of the aims announced by the present Government when it took up office was the taking of immediate steps to provide additional facilities for the treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis.  In pursuance of this aim my Department has concentrated particularly on the provision of extra beds and the progress made in this connection can be judged from the fact that over 800 extra beds have already been provided and this figure will, within a period of six months, be increased to approximately 1,300 beds.  A new service <Col N="792" /> designed to provide expert surgical treatment free of charge for tuberculosis patients of health authorities has been initiated on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>A scheme of monetary allowances to sufferers from certain infectious diseases, mainly tuberculosis, was brought into operation generally by health authorities on the 1st April last in accordance with the provisions of the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948.  These allowances have proved of substantial benefit to eligible persons by relieving them of anxiety for their own maintenance and that of their dependants while they are receiving treatment.  To ensure liberal administration of these regulations and to enable them to be of the maximum benefit to tuberculosis sufferers it was necessary during the year to amend the scheme of allowances.</P>
    <P>Special courses at home and abroad were provided during the year for medical officers of health authorities who are engaged on tuberculosis work and a scheme of training of probationer nurses for a new grade of sanatorium nurse was initiated with the co-operation of the General Nursing Council during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>New Infectious Diseases Regulations came into operation on the 1st April, 1948, and allowed amongst other things for the provision of free treatment of cases of infectious diseases.  During the year measures for the control and prevention of various infectious diseases were intensified.  Local authorities and voluntary bodies have been urged to proceed with the greatest possible dispatch with approved hospital projects and public assistance authorities have been urged to take steps where necessary to bring dispensaries up to a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>The intensification of these and other health measures has reflected itself in increased expenditure by local authorities and under the statutory arrangements made by the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, extra expenditure is in approved cases recouped from the Health Services Grant. Apart from the measures mentioned, substantial increases of remuneration to local health staffs and improvement in working conditions have been authorised <Col N="793" /> during the year and these also have the effect of increasing local expenditure on these services.</P>
    <P>The supplementary sums required under the sub-heads M (1) to M (5) are intended to meet the balances of grants for 1947-48 and previous years falling due as the audits of local accounts are completed.  The balances in respect of previous years are ineligible for inclusion in the health expenditure of health authorities for the purposes of the Consolidated Health Services Grant for 1948-49.  For that year and in future expenditure on these services will fall to be recouped from the Health Services Grant and will be provided for under the sub-head for that grant, instead of under separate sub-heads as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Of the £4,925 additional provision necessary under sub-head M (1)&mdash;Child Welfare, Schools for Mothers, etc., to pay grants not exceeding one-half of approved net expenditure of local authorities under approved regulations, a sum of £2,900 is for recoupment in respect of 1947-48 expenditure recorded by the local authorities after 31st March, 1948.  The balance of the new provision is necessitated by increased salary charges (in some cases retrospective to 1st November, 1946), increased cost of hospital treatment, etc.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head M (2)&mdash;grants for the supply of milk to necessitous children, the additional sum of £1,800 is also required to meet balances of grants in respect of previous years payable to local authorities.  The annual grant paid to each local authority under this sub-head was 100 per cent. of the approved expenditure up to the limit of the allocation in each case, based on expenditure on the scheme in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>The £8,675 additional provision under sub-head M (3)&mdash;medical treatment. etc., of school children, is required to pay balances of grants to local authorities in respect of previous years not exceeding half the sums spent on approved schemes.  Of this Estimate, £6,000 is in respect of expenditure for the year 1947-48 and the remaining £2,675 is necessitated by increased charges to be met by local authorities as a result of increased remuneration <Col N="794" /> paid to dentists, ophthalmologists, etc., and increased charges for treatment at voluntary hospitals. Under sub-head M (4), an additional provision of £80,500 is required to pay balances of grants to local authorities in respect of previous years, calculated on the basis of 50 per cent. of the net cost incurred by local authorities under approved schemes for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.  £47,000 of this sum is in respect of expenditure for 1947-48 brought into account after the close of the financial year.  The remaining £33,000 is necessitated by higher costs of operating local authority sanatoria and of providing treatment and nourishment, clothing, beds and bedding for tuberculosis patients.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £4,700 over the original Estimate of £4,800 is required under sub-head M (5)&mdash;treatment of venereal diseases&mdash;to pay balances in respect of previous years of grants to local authorities, calculated on the basis of 75 per cent. of approved expenditure. Apart from expenditure in respect of 1947-48 recorded after 31st March, 1948, the extra provision under this sub-head is necessitated by increased expenditure by health authorities following recognition on 26th June, 1947, of the Hospital of St. Margaret of Cortona as an institution for the treatment of venereal diseases. Prior to such recognition this hospital was financed by an annual grant from the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the excess on sub-head E arises from the payment of our 1948 contribution to the World Health Organisation.  At the time the original Estimate for sub-head E was prepared, the scale of contributions by member states of the World Health Organisation had not been determined and only very limited provision was made in the sub-head for such a contribution. The First World Health Assembly, which met in June, 1948, adopted a unit scale of contributions (based on UNO criteria) under which Ireland was expected to contribute 0.34 per cent. of the total budget of the organisation for the year 1948. This percentage may be regarded as favourable to us when viewed in the light of other contributions payable by this country to similar international <Col N="795" /> bodies.  The contribution amounted to £4,131 odd.  This is offset by a sum of £254 included in the original estimate in respect of our subscription to the International Office of Public Health. The functions of that office are being performed by the World Health Organisation and further subscriptions to the former body will not arise.</P>
    <P>It is expected that this country will benefit considerably from the exchange of information available through membership of this body, which as already mentioned performs the functions of the International Office of Public Health, Paris, and also of the Health Organisation of the former League of Nations.  Regular and helpful reports on the incidence of pestilential diseases throughout the world and much valuable data, on request and otherwise, in regard to other health matters have been received from the organisation which is only at the beginning of its work.  It is hoped that in time facilities for the grant of fellowships to Irish medical and ancillary personnel will be obtained.  An additional sum of £75 is also required to meet expenses of £45 in connection with the attendance of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals at a Congress of Mental Health held in London in August, 1948; and expenses of £40 in connection with the attendance of a representative of this country at a meeting of the Executive Board of the World Federation for Mental Health held in Amsterdam in January, 1949.  The holding of this congress and meeting was not foreseen when the original Estimate was drawn up.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that action should be taken without delay to obtain a survey of the natural resources of the country with a view to their early development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put on the Order Paper some time in March of last year, and it is a commentary on the conduct of business by Parliamentary institutions that, though the terms of the motion asked that action be taken without delay, we were not in a position, owing to the pressure of other Parliamentary business, to consider the matter until 12 months after the introduction of the motion.  In these circumstances, the mover of the motion might well be forgiven if he had fairly forgotten the terms of it and, as &ldquo;hope deferred maketh the heart sick&rdquo;, had come to the conclusion that the motion would never be reached and, therefore, had tired of preparing the material which might be considered necessary to impress the Minister and the Government with such cogent arguments as would lead to a favourable consideration and adoption of this motion.  Though we have been delayed in the presentation of this motion by 12 months, yet that too gives added force to the call of the motion for urgent action, because if, with the conditions obtaining 12 months ago, it was thought essential, in the opinion of those who put down the motion, that there should be a survey of the natural resources of the country, then with greater force might we argue to-day that that need should be given even more urgent consideration.  The situation is ripe, the conditions are favourable, the war has come to an end and it was the excuse for delaying many of the normal functions of the Government, particularly with respect to any attempt at any economic organisation.  The present Government has announced its policy to be based upon a peace-time development. If that is so, it is necessary that it should tackle this question of obtaining a survey of the natural resources of the <Col N="797" /> country with every expedition. Furthermore there is the necessity for a comprehensive survey, a survey which will give the data, the material and the basis for any planning that may be done.</P>
    <P>The motion does not stop there.  It does not merely ask for a survey, a point which hardly could be resisted; it asks that this survey be harnessed to some action with a view to the early development of these resources.  If we look back to our records, we have to go back to the administration of the first Government of the Irish Republic to see any such work done as is contemplated in this motion.  That first Government of the Republic, in very difficult times and circumstances, saw the need to undertake a survey of our economic, industrial, agricultural and other resources.  That work was carried on with great difficulty.  Parts of the report of a number of different sections of that commission are available.  Its work extended from about 1919 to 1922. Probably it would have continued its work were it not for the fact that the Black and Tans, as one might say, put a full stop to its proceedings.  So far as I can believe, no one has since seen fit to resurrect that report, to carry on the work that was done, to amplify it, to give it a more comprehensive scope, to complete the survey and make practical recommendations which might in some way act as a spur to whatever Government was in office to carry out the developments of those resources.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that the time is now opportune for a recommencement of this work, that a commission or commissions should be established to take over some of the basic work that was then done, to go further into the matter, particularly in view of the conditions at present obtaining, and to assemble from the different sources the data and the basis for any largescale planning which it will be the duty of any Government that will be in power in this country for a considerable time to come, to undertake. There would be, of course, good justification during the war or during the emergency for a suspension of this work.  There would be many difficulties <Col N="798" /> in the way of carrying it out, but I can see no such difficulties now.  The materials of industry are more freely available now than they were then.  It is possible to obtain the services of those who can make a detailed examination of our resources and sufficient intelligent opinion is available to make its impress upon the work of any such commission.  If this work is not restarted, then I think that a great deal of the talk we hear from time to time about schemes for full employment, schemes for developing of one or other of the aspects of agriculture or of industry, or for the control of industry or any definite section of industry such as transport, is without reality.</P>
    <P>Anyone here can speak upon these questions.  But only, I submit, with a qualified authority.  We cannot point to any such work as I have indicated since the days of 1919-1922 as the authority for the facts on which they would base their plans.  There have been, from time to time, fugitive suggestions about economic councils and various boards.  All these have been rather directed towards specific ideas and specific lines of approach to various problems that have come up from time to time and occupied public attention.</P>
    <P>The purpose of such a survey as I request in this motion is to give a foundation body of data to any Government, to any set of employers, any set of industrialists, any branch of the trade union movement, or anyone who is interested in the economic development of this country.  Without having knowledge tested by facts in regard to our resources our planning has very little relation to reality.</P>
    <P>There has been a pronouncement made recently, for instance, on what is called in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i>, the Industrial Advisory Authority.  I am not certain whether that is the correct or official title of the body, but it is a sufficient indication, I think, of the body to which I refer.  As an example of what I mean I shall quote what the correspondent, I presume with a certain amount of authority, a certain amount of insight <Col N="799" /> or imaginative ideas, sets forth as the functions of this authority.  He states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Among the functions of the body will be the initiation of schemes for the development of industry, with special reference to the prospects of export; to inquire into the effects of tariffs and the extent to which tariffs are fully taken up by industry; and to advise concerning possible new tariffs.  The Government is known not to be satisfied with the results of industrial development and to hold the belief that far higher production will be possible under a co-ordinated plan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One can ask straightaway: on what basis was such an authority to proceed? They can obtain direction from the Minister or direction from the Government as a whole.  They may have their own pet ideas, each and every one of them.  They may bring those ideas to the common board, sort them out, achieve some sort of agreement and put these more or less into effect, or recommend that such ideas as they have shall be given effect to.  But, in my submission, unless we have some other authority supplying them with the basic data, much of their work, no matter how commendable it may appear at short notice, how much it may satisfy local ideas or sectional aims, will not be to the national welfare, will not contribute to the national good over a long-term period.  It may or it may not.  We have no assurance.  We have no data by which we can judge what they are doing.  We have no way of measuring.  We have no yardstick by which we can estimate whether their ideas fit in with the known ideas in regard to our resources; what they amount to; how they can be developed; what is the extent of their development; whether it is economical to develop them this way or that way.</P>
    <P>I would wish, if it is possible, to get from the Minister on this motion some idea as to how far this Industrial Advisory Authority has the functions that might cover part of this motion. At first glance, when I heard of the establishment of such an authority I was inclined to believe that this could be taken as the answer to the motion <Col N="800" /> calling for this survey and for something more perhaps than a mere survey &mdash;calling for or giving the possibility of getting early development of these national resources.  The Minister may enlighten us upon this matter.  He may let us know whether this National Development Commission has such powers as I think any such authority should have if it is to be of real service to the community.  It should set in motion such a survey and see that the best brains in the country, the best minds, the best investigators, statisticians and experts in various fields are harnessed to provide us with an all-round picture of the national resources of this country, bring them up to date, give us a 1949 or 1950 picture of what was attempted to be done by the first Government of the Irish Republic away back in 1919.  That it should do more is axiomatic.  I do not know whether it is to be a planning council to advise the Minister; whether it has power of its own to set on foot certain actions, certain schemes and such schemes of public good and of national good as may recommend themselves to this authority, or whether it is a very restricted body.  It states, for example, in the extract that I have read that it is to be concerned with tariffs.  Tariffs, to my mind, are a very essential and very necessary part of the whole plan, but by themselves, and without such a survey on which they could be based, the granting, the taking off and the implementation of a tariff policy again appears to me to have little reality in relation to the good of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I submit that there was little, if any, planning in regard to tariffs in the past. There was no clear-cut economic policy running through any scheme of tariffs in the past, mainly not because of any lack of an all-over idea on the part of Ministers or of previous Governments but due, I think, to the lack of such an all-over survey of the whole situation of the country.  In the past&mdash;too often in fact&mdash;it may perhaps have been the general picture in regard to tariffs that they took on the character of a hand-to-mouth method of running the country.  There was no long-term policy.  Many tariffs were <Col N="801" /> determined by questions such as the desire to obtain revenue.  They were principally motivated from the Department of Finance in regard to their revenue-raising capabilities, such as arises often from protection and such as results from the confusion of the two ideas.  Very often tariffs were the result of sympathetic consideration by the Party in power, of local sentiment here and there to provide employment or to abate unemployment in a given district or to the natural desire of budding industrialists to have local industries in their own part of the country.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily criticising these ideas or aspirations as bad or detrimental to the country.  They may very often have worked to the good of the country and to the provision of employment in many cases, no matter what may have been the long view in their case.  It is sometimes said that often these were cases of the dog eating its own tail to feed itself.  Perhaps it is better it should do that than starve.</P>
    <P>The objection that I have to this haphazard method of dealing with tariffs, or any other aspect of the economic policy of the country by the industrial advisory authority, such as is suggested, is that each case is taken as an individual case, unrelated to the whole economy of the country, and to that extent it may or may not be detrimental. Very often I think it works out that it is not detrimental to the long-term economic development of our national resources.  That is inevitable in the absence of such a commission as is suggested in this motion.  Another aspect of this lack of any real knowledge of the resources of our country and of our countrymen and women as related to these resources is the haphazard method of the development of the various industries in the country. There is the persistence in the minds of industrialists in this year of grace 1949 that the spirit of <i>laissez faire</i> still exists and still is dominant, but the whole current of world economic development is against that.  I am sure that I need not elaborate very much on it.  Take one example from many, the shoe trade.  It was mentioned here <Col N="802" /> and in many reports that in that trade each manufacturer is permitted to develop as many lines as he thinks are profitable.  As fashions change his trade changes.  He finds that some lines are profitable and that some are not.  The whole trade, as a result of this individual attempt by each one to make the utmost profit out of changing fashions leads to haphazard development.  What I would like to know in regard to this industrial advisory authority is: is it to have such authority as that it can exert some pressure on industries that exist, on others that are growing up and on others that it will foster, as a result of its examination of the national resources?  Is it to give any direction to these industries as to the line on which they are to develop their trade? Is it to take a fatherly interest, or more than that, in the development of this trade or is it to have any jurisdiction in that respect?  Is it to be a commission sitting to discuss tariffs, to grant tariffs or to recommend the granting of them and, having finished its work, is it to be a real industrial council or commission which will take the broadest possible picture and look at the needs of the country as a whole? Will it see to it that each and every industry that is to be established will have some guiding hand applied to its activities so that these may be brought into some common balance with the rest of the country?  Is there to be any thought given by this industrial advisory authority to the question of whether an industry is utilising to the fullest extent the native raw materials of this country?  When we come to that we immediately see the necessity for such a survey because, apart from haphazard knowledge here and there of what may or may not be in the country, there is no authoritative report, document or body which can ascertain whether we have the native raw material that could be used in any given industry.</P>
    <P>We have no way of examining whether the materials used in any industry which are imported into this country could not be better supplied by the development of another industry or branch of industry in this country. The only criterion in that matter is the worn-out idea that the manufacturer <Col N="803" /> knows his own business best, that if there is raw material in the country he should be aware of the fact and that he would naturally use it.  Experience has shown in the past that that is by no means so.  Experience has shown that it very often requires a crisis in a certain business or a general crisis to get industrialists to depart from time-honoured methods of doing certain operations in that industry and from using time-honoured materials that they have always used for the application of certain results.  To my mind, there is ample excuse for the industrialists in this country not being as up to date as they should be in regard to the utilisation of the natural resources of our country, through the very absence of such a body as is indicated is required.  Is there to be, for instance, in this industrial advisory authority any thought in regard to the export possibilities of such industries as they would foster or recommend for improvement or development?  This, I need hardly say, is a matter of supreme importance.  The utilisation of our natural resources for the home market is, of course, important enough.  But the present economic condition of the western hemisphere and the part of Europe to which we belong is such that it is a crying need for every country such as ours to engage in export trade. In our country this is more than ever important because, with the small population we have, our markets are very restricted.  I need not give any examples of the restriction which imposes severe limitations on the expansion of certain industries or on the very establishment of certain industries in this country.  I could instance one. It is a coming modern industry which will have very great force particularly in regard to employment and which has great possibilities in regard to the displacement of several other materials that have been used over long periods. I refer to the question of plastics.  To develop a plastics industry the first essential, as anyone who has taken the slightest interest in the matter knows, is a very widespread market.  Plastics can only be turned out economically in huge masses.  It is an industry which I should imagine would be eminently <Col N="804" /> suitable to this country owing to certain factors in relation to the formation of such an industry as that.  There is no possibility, to my mind, of such an industry taking firm root in this country, of being developed in the way it should and of all the potentialities being extracted for the development of something of national worth unless such an industry could also engage in the export market; unless, in fact, it could use the possibilities of that widespread sale abroad to enable us to sell things in that line itself in our own country at perhaps a much cheaper rate than we could ever sell such commodities were we restricted to our own four shores for that industry.</P>
    <P>The motion states that the action should be taken without delay; that it is urgent.  Without quoting any great number of figures one could state that we have a condition of affairs in this country which over a number of years showed a decline in the productivity of work, a decline in the volume of the output per wage earner engaged in all the industries and services listed in the census of industrial production under the heading of those industries engaged in transportable goods.  We had a decline in the volume of output of the workers so engaged of 12 per cent. over the period 1938-44.  I do not know whether there is available any later figure than this.  I could not lay my hands on it.  There are later figures showing an increase in productivity for the last quarter but I have been unable to trace anything later than this figure showing a decline in the productivity per individual worker.  If that is a tendency which continues up to the present year&mdash;and I see no factors likely to have corrected it very much&mdash; it is a very serious tendency in our economic life to which any Government should direct its attention forthwith for remedy.  That, it may appear to some, has but remote connection with the terms of this motion.  To me, however, the investigation and survey of the resources of the country does not narrow itself down merely to a survey of the raw material resources of the country, the possibilities of what we could extract from our soil, our land, our industries and the other raw materials thereto appertaining.  It also <Col N="805" /> denotes, if it is to have any reality at all, the investigation into what natural resources we have in the form of labour force because all raw materials are themselves dead and have no value until labour force is applied to them. If, as is shown by the figure I have quoted, there is a drop in the productivity per worker that is a matter which requires to be considered earnestly by any industrial advisory body.  There must be causes for such. There must be reasons why there is a drop in productivity.  It may be an objective reason; it may be a subjective reason.  Whatever it is it requires investigation as part of the investigation and survey of the whole picture.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of that question to which, perhaps, I could devote a minute or two.  There might be&mdash;and it would be part of the investigation to be undertaken by such a body&mdash;the incorrect utilisation of the labour forces available in the country. There, again, we have the haphazard development to which I adverted. Industries have grown up.  Certain people have become allotted to them more by accident than by design.  It is difficult to know whether our wage earners as a whole are properly harnessed to the industrial machine from the point of view of the over-all good of the country.  I am not suggesting that such an authority should go to the extent of a direction of labour, but it might well come to that in the future, as there is no appreciable hope of any expanding population in this country for some years to come.  That was the opinion even of the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit as far back as 1938.  They warned that we could expect no notable increase in population over the next quarter of a century.  If we are going to expand industries, such as has been suggested, if the industrial machine in this country is to be brought up to date, then it might very well be a pertinent question for such a body as to which industry or section of industry is most entitled to utilise the labour force that is available.</P>
    <P>From time to time orators have spoken about the return to this country <Col N="806" /> of emigrants from over the seas.  It is a very favourable topic for some but, as a realist, as one who wants to look upon this matter from the point of view of economic development, I think there is a very restricted movement in that direction and it is very unlikely that there will be the rush back to this country that some economists or some theorists expected in the past, during the war years particularly.  There may be a certain number, and, even if it could be argued that there would be a flood of labour returning, then all the more necessity is there that there should be an examination of the resources of the country to see how this labour force can best be applied, not only in regard to individual industries, but in regard to the very big schemes of national development that any Government would have to undertake in the eventuality of a mass movement of workers to this country, making it necessary for such a Government to deal with hundreds of thousands, if you like to expand to that extent, of people without work.</P>
    <P>They could not be fitted into industry haphazardly; industries would have no place for them, new industries would not develop rapidly enough, and there would be a need for such an industrial authority to plan public works on a large scale.  It may be necessary next year that there should be large scale planning of works of public utility, such as have been called for by the Labour Party year after year.  It may be necessary to plan these in order to cope with unemployment, if the slump that some speakers have suggested comes about.  Whether that is the case or not, my argument is that, taking it on the most favourable or unfavourable basis, whichever way you like, there is a necessity for a survey of the country's resources by some such commission as I have suggested, which will be able to arm any industrial commission with sufficient data to enable them to plan correctly in the national interest and not stumble along from scheme to scheme according as one or other political crisis arises.</P>
    <P>I think the terms of the motion make it quite clear what I want&mdash;that we should have a far-flung scheme of <Col N="807" /> national development, one that will be not exactly above politics, because I think that it is impossible in this or any other country to be completely above politics.  Any schemes that evolve will have to take a certain amount of modification from whatever political Party or Parties may be in power.  Apart from that, there should be such a current of thought developing from the examination required in this motion that will maintain itself against most of the pressure of political Parties here, there or anywhere else in regard to this national economic development.  That would be the objective aspect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other aspect, what I would call the subjective aspect of that utilisation of the wage earners, there might be an incorrect utilisation of them in so far as these wage earners are given at the present time no great interest in industry.  In most of our development work the workers are completely dependent upon the employers. They have no interest in the development of the firm.  That figure I gave about the decline of the productivity of the workers could well be from a lack of interest in any desire of the Government to speed up production, to call for an export or industrial drive, or anything else like that, because the wage earners in the organisations to which this country is accustomed have no share in the management of industry.  The industry in which they are engaged is run and controlled by the owners completely&mdash;by the industrialists, the capitalists.  The workers as such have no share in the management, no control of the profits, and no voice in the development of the business.  They have no say as to how the profits should be assessed, whether the industry should be further developed and whether there should be a reserve build up for any crisis, unemployment, slump or anything else of that nature.  It occurred to me to ask whether this industrial authority which is being set up will have any function in regard to that matter.  Having found out what our resources are will they have any control or direction on the way in which those resources will <Col N="808" /> be used?  Will they, for instance, be able to direct the industrialists along lines which would give the workers some real interest in the development of the economy of the country as a whole by making them partners in these industrial enterprises and developments that are now being undertaken?  It may be that in other countries such an interest has been given to the workers on the initiative of the capitalists themselves.</P>
    <P>In my experience and knowledge I think there is very little expectation that the Irish capitalists, either those who are already old and well-established or the latest entrants into the ranks of capitalists, will make any effort to give the workers a controlling interest or share in the management of their industry.  Our capitalists still regard themselves as the absolute owners of industry; they believe that they, and they alone, know how to run and manage big business.  They regard themselves as the masters in their own sphere of industrial activity.  I think such beliefs can only be removed in this country by governmental action, action such as could be taken by a commission engaged in the type of survey I have indicated in this motion.  In my opinion that is the only way in which to eradicate these beliefs; they cannot be removed by a process of propaganda or by the education of our industrialists.</P>
    <P>Thirteen years ago the Labour Party interested itself in this matter of the setting up of some such authority as the commission I have indicated to make a survey of the natural resources of the country and organise their development for the economic well-being of the country as a whole.  In a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Labour's Constructive Programme for an Organised Nation&rdquo; the policy underlying this matter is correctly, if somewhat briefly, set out at pages 14 and 15:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic policy now being pursued in this country has had the effect, if not the intention, of protecting and encouraging many dubious and uneconomic forms of private enterprise on the entirely false assumption that the public interest will thereby be served.  Many <Col N="809" /> of the industries which have been farmed out to private enterprise are absolutely essential to the life of the nation itself and the exercise of control over them by the Government should have been preserved as a basic principle of our legislation.  The methods which have been adopted in regard to industrial development generally have not served the public interest, but on the contrary have acted as an incentive to greed and avariciousness without even the pretext of an assurance that the best use will be made by the capitalists of the opportunities provided for them. So as to correct the abuses that have revealed themselves over a number of years, and as a safeguard against future abuses in regard to the organisation and management of industry, the Labour Party would establish an economic council with the necessary subsidiary bodies, to explore and survey the industrial and agricultural potentialities of the country and to plan development along progressive and remunerative lines.  This council, which would be endowed with wide powers, would be independent of departmental interference; it would be presided over by a member of the Government and subject to the authority of the Government and of the Dáil, its financial resources would be limited only by the requirements of the country and its aptitude for employing them usefully and with advantage to the nation.  Both in regard to policy and administration, the economic council would be directly responsible to the head of the Government.</P>
    <P>The economic council would be authorised to establish for each industry and specific activity of the organised nation such subsidiary bodies as may be considered necessary to survey, plan, co-ordinate and direct the tendency of these industries and activities.</P>
    <P>While considerable importance must be attached to the research work which the economic council would undertake, primarily it will be concerned with the development and <Col N="810" /> co-ordination of industry, agriculture and transport.  The best manner of utilising the resources of the nation &mdash;land, waters, minerals, scientific knowledge, inventions, industrial plant and the labour power of the State&mdash;would be its immediate concern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the fault in the establishment of any industrial authority is that it leaves out of consideration that which is given first place in this resumé in the functions of an economic council.  It says here that it would be necessary to survey, plan and co-ordinate the tendency of these industries and activities.  Without such a survey as to the possibilities there are in the resources of the country, there is little likelihood that such an authority as that suggested will be little more than a place for the discussion and debate of pet theories governing the different economic interests represented on the board.  That is something we do not want.  We do not want mere idle discussion.  It is an urgent need of the country at the moment that the natural resources should be developed. Not only should they be developed but they should be developed with a proper regard to the interests of the labour force of the country and not merely to the interests of the industrialists.  The suggestion of the establishment of an economic council has as its primary basis a survey of our resources with a subsequent co-ordination and development of them such as is outlined in this further pamphlet published in 1940 entitled &ldquo;Planning for the Crisis.&rdquo;  In 1940 the Labour Party had put forward certain schemes to the then Government with regard to the development of our natural resources.  Most of these schemes were not acceptable to the Government at the time.  They were not compatible with Government philosophy in relation to industrial development. The result was that the Labour Party produced an alternative policy to the one then in use or about to be implemented by the Government of the day.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I was bitterly disappointed when the Taoiseach did not reply to my question on last Thursday, the 24th February, and appeal to illegal organisations to hand over their arms to the proper authorities and to disband these organisations.  I had hoped that the Taoiseach would avail of the occasion to appeal to the young men of this country who were prepared to defend its rights with their lives, to join the properly constituted Defence Forces of this State.  I have had a long experience of revolutionary organisations, both from within and from without, from the point of view of a volunteer within such organisations and from the point of view of a Government dealing with them.  I joined the volunteers in 1913 at the age of 15½. I continued to be a member for 12 years, and for 16 years, in some of the most critical years in the history of this country, I was a member of the Government and the Minister particularly charged with dealing with the revolutionary organisations that were attacking this State.  I had the experience too of fighting in the six occupied counties of Ireland, counties that are still occupied by foreign forces.  I know the people there.  I know the men there who want to get rid of the State that exists there and I know the terrain.  I believe in the moral right of the Irish people to use force to obtain their rights.  I am not a pacifist but with my experience I cannot believe that in the foreseeable future, I would vote in this House for the use of force for the achievement of Irish national rights in regard to the unity of our country, because I believe it would be the wrong method of approach.  Whether or not it would be right at any particular time for this Dáil solemnly to declare war in order to vindicate the undoubted right of the Irish people to unity, I have not the <Col N="812" /> slightest doubt in the world that it would be wrong for this Dáil or this Government to lend any countenance to revolutionary action fomented here for that purpose.  It would be a hard job for the regular forces, the recognised forces of the State.  As such I tried it.  But the Government here in 1922 decided to withdraw support and my comrades and I were out on a limb on which we were urged to go out, and it was cut behind us.  I believe that any attempt by a revolutionary force organised here to achieve the reunity of our country by force would only end in disaster.  The temptation to use force for the righting of an undoubted wrong in face of British hypocrisy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have given Deputy Aiken an opportunity to develop the relevancy of his arguments. I cannot see that he is doing so.  The question asked of the Taoiseach was &ldquo;whether in view of his repeated promises to take the gun out of politics through the repeal of the External Relations Act, he will now appeal to the illegal military organisation which is retaining and using arms illegally to <Col N="813" /> disband that organisation and hand up its arms to the proper authorities&rdquo;.

      <P>I am on the point.  We shall not argue the question now but if the Chair will allow me to pursue the matter on the lines along which I have been proceeding, I have no doubt it will be satisfied of the relevancy of every word I have used.  I asked the Taoiseach to appeal to these young men and his first answer was that he had taken the gun out of politics.  The second leg of his reply was that these illegal organisations did not exist.  The Minister for Justice admitted that in many parts of the country, including this city, a manifesto had been issued by a revolutionary organisation calling itself the I.R.A. in which it repudiated his repeal of the External Relations Act.</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach is not aware of the existence of this document, the people of this country are.  They have seen it.  They have seen it not only in my constituency but they have seen it in the Taoiseach's constituency and they can still see it.  Here is one taken from a wall here in Dublin.  I believe many people in the city, who are politically alive, also know of the existence of an I.R.A. paper.  They know that in the January issue of that paper an article entitled, &ldquo;1948 in Retrospect&rdquo; says that the paper was founded &ldquo;as the result of a conference of ex-republican prisoners who saw the need for a voice to preach the republican gospel.&rdquo;  What they call the republican gospel is <Col N="814" /> partly contained in this paper.  One writer of an article says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As there were men to step into the ranks of the Republican Army and take the places of those who fell in the fight, through all the years of struggle, so were there, and are there, men to man the ranks of the I.R.A. to-day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Urging the youth to carry on I.R.A. activities, there is an article in Irish entitled &ldquo;Um Nodlaig.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The name of the paper is <i>An t-Eireannach Aontuighthe</i>, printed and published in this city, and it can be purchased for 3d. by anybody. One of the things that the youth of this day are asked to continue to keep in their minds, according to one paragraph, is &ldquo;Um Nodlaig, '39 &mdash; Magazine Fort Raid.&rdquo;  In the leading article entitled, &ldquo;A Rose by any Other Name,&rdquo; they referred to the promise by the Taoiseach to take the gun out of politics.  The Taoiseach told me on the 24th February last that the gun had been taken out of politics.  The editor of this paper writes:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What exactly is meant by the claim that the Bill &lsquo;takes the guns out of Irish politics&rsquo;?  Is it intended that, for the future, acts of armed aggression against republicans will cease, and that spying upon them will cease?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on in that strain and winds up:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If this be what is in the minds of those who state that the Bill takes the guns out of Irish politics then they can rest assured of the support and co-operation of all sincere republicans.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago a number of citizens in Cork got a circular asking for subscriptions for this so-called I.R.A. from <Col N="815" /> the Cork No. 1 Brigade, Irish Republican Army, as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>The Irish Republican Army has one primary object, a successful military campaign against the British army of occupation in the Six Counties.  In view of the fact that any disturbance in the Twenty-Six Counties area would hinder the achieving of this object the army has definitely ruled out any kind of aggressive military action in the Twenty-Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That proposition is not new to the knowledge of certain gentlemen who are now sitting on the Government Benches.  The suggestion that the Government here should allow the organisation, the arming and equipment of revolutionary forces not subject to control by this State and allow them to carry on here in this part of Ireland with a view to making an armed attack on the Six Counties was made in 1932 by a gentleman who is on the Government Front Bench in this House, and again in 1939, and later in 1940 by a gentleman who is not here.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach very bluntly whether or not the same proposition was made to him, whether or not the proposition was made that the I.R.A. should be allowed to organise here and equip itself with a view to a successful military campaign against the British army of occupation in the Six Counties.  The danger is that a proper national ideal will be used for evil ends.  Undoubtedly, there are young men in this country who would give their lives to see this country completely free.</P>

      <P>It is a laudable and noble idea.  I do not want to see it used for <Col N="816" /> evil ends.  In 1932 friends of the Soviet Union were using the I.R.A.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1935, when Germany became public enemy No. 1 to Britain, there was an internal revolution and the I.R.A. changed its whole outlook from being Reddish to being of another type.  Then in 1940 there was another revolution within the ranks and the men who succeeded in that revolution were Reddish in hue.  We have the dangerous situation here that a war is facing the world and only God can save the world from it.  In that situation there is undoubtedly a temptation for foreign enemies of Britain to use Irish nationalists here against Britain.  I do not want to see Irish nationalists being used as cannon fodder for any foreign country whether it is Russia, Germany or any other country.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to do what I urged him in my question, to give a lead to the young men of the present day, to urge them to join the National Defence Forces, the properly constituted forces of the State and have nothing to do with social revolutionaries who are merely the tools of a foreign Power.  The danger at the present time is apparent to everybody who reads the daily papers.  There are new methods in the world which have been brought in in recent years.  We have had the confessions of Cardinal Mindszenty, of Stephen Hayes, and the Bulgarian Protestant clergymen, and I trust that no young men will put themselves in danger in that way.  I ask the Taoiseach to make a clam but firm appeal to these young men who want to fight for Ireland to join the Defence Forces of this State.  I ask him not to blind his eyes to the fact that these people exist because, if he does, his ignoring of them will be taken as a &ldquo;wink as good as a nod&rdquo; to them to carry on and organise here for a purpose which will bring nothing but disaster to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of a series of incidents during the last few days of the Dáil sittings by Deputy Aiken, in the presence of his leader, Deputy de Valera, to indulge in cheap sibes and vulgar sneers at me and at my professional appellation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He is welcome to any advantage, political or otherwise, that he may, with the consent of his leader, get from these cheap sneers.  So far as I am concerned, he is welcome to any damage that he may do to me politically by these methods.  His leader was present when these cheap gibes were made in the House.  I will do everything I can to save the country from the damage that is being done to it, and I do object to methods, actions and speeches which are deliberately calculated, I believe, to bring national damage to this country and to break the national peace that we have had in this country in the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>What was the suggestion in Deputy Aiken's speech to-night?  Amongst the primary objects for which this Government was formed was to get the gun out of Irish politics, and the insidious suggestion made here by Deputy Aiken was that I and my colleagues in the Government were allowing some unspecified, unnamed armed organisation or group of young men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a dangerous and an insidious suggestion, a suggestion that plays right into the hands of Sir Basil Brooke and the people in the North. I want to make this statement as clearly, unequivocally and as emphatically <Col N="818" /> as I can, that neither I nor my colleagues nor anybody who supports us in this House wants the gun in Irish politics on this side of the Border or on the far side of the Border.  Is that clear enough?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the greatest testimonial ever given to an Irishman was, under God's mercy and providence, given to me by my colleagues to lead them in the House.  I will do the job that I was put here to do.  I am proud and happy, and I thank God, that notwithstanding the effort that was made on the 15th of last April to bring destruction and disturbance in this country by a question very similar to this one&mdash;arising out of circumstances very similar to the circumstances out of which this question arises&mdash;that, notwithstanding, as I say, the attempt that was made to disrupt the peace of this country and to bring damage between the people who had come together to fight for the peace and benefit of the country&mdash;that effort failed.  Now, we have had 12 solid <Col N="819" /> months of peace such as has never existed in the last 50 years, and that is going to continue under this Government. There are going to be no guns in Irish politics or on this side of the Border unless Deputy Aiken and his supporters by provocative speeches deliberately attempt to bring the guns out and to inflame those young men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that we want to do is to end bitterness in this country.  The present Government was formed to end bitterness in the country&mdash;to bring unity between Irishmen of all sections many of whom had fought in the last 25 years.  There is only one section of the Irish people standing in the way of complete unity and of the end of all bitterness and that section is represented by the Deputies on the opposite benches.  They are the only people who are fostering bitterness.  So far as I am concerned, I will bend every energy that I have, so long as I am allowed to sit here as the head of this Government, to continue in the way that we started last February 12 months, and that is to end bitterness and to bring peace and unity amongst our fellow countrymen in this part of the country.  When we have that completely done, and it is nearly done, then we will try to end bitterness in the North.  We will try to bring unity amongst our fellow countrymen, Protestant <Col N="820" /> and Catholic, in the North.  I said at the Fine Gael convention a few weeks ago that we had a headline for our policy here&mdash;to end bitterness between sections of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>That was the headline we set ourselves&mdash;that our policy was to end Partition.  We will have to live with those people in the North when Partition ends.  We do not want to have them coming in with bitterness in their hearts and with past wrongs seething within them.  We want, by our policy, to end Partition, and to end it in such a way that they will merge and coalesce with us in a united Ireland.  The only people who are preventing that are Deputy Aiken and those who follow him in the opposite benches.</P>
