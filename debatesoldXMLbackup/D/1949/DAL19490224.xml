      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he stated at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis on the 15th February that in the well-ordered and peaceful conditions of to-day it has been forgotten that there ever existed a Military Tribunal to try people for so-called political offences, or that an Irish Government killed some of their own people for the difference between the External Relations.  Act and the Irish Republic; and, if so, whether, in view of the serious nature and implications of this statement he will amplify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion to which the Deputy refers, I certainly made a statement to the effect, or substantially to the effect, indicated in the question.  In doing so, I was repeating, in substance, what I said more than once in this House during the debates on the Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948.  For example, on the 24th November last, I included in my speech on the Second Reading of the Bill the following statement (Dáil Debates, Volume 113, Columns 379 and 380):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All through the history of this State from 1922 onwards we have had recurring cycles of violence and repression.  We have had one Party with a majority of the people behind it charged with a duty of enforcing law, and with the distasteful task of putting Irishmen into jail, of executing Irishmen and of shooting Irishmen because of ideals in which those Irishmen believed.  That is <Col N="488" /> a problem which has confronted any Government taking office in this country in the past and charged with the duty of maintaining law and order over the last 26 years.  I was determined that never again would I take any part in a Government that had to enforce order by extra-judicial processes.  I never will. From February of this year there has existed throughout this country from north to south and from east to west a measure of peace, concord and goodwill between every section of our community&mdash;such a measure of peace, concord and goodwill as has not existed in this country for the past 50 years.  I want that situation to continue.  This Bill is designed to do that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing was implied in my statement at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis beyond what I expressly said in the passage which I have quoted from my speech of the 24th November last.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that there is some confusion as to whether a Senior Counsel of the Irish Bar can describe himself as a King's Counsel; and, if so, whether he will make a definitive statement of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of members of the Bar who, before the Treaty of 1921, were called to the Inner Bar by being created King's Counsel. After the establishment of the state, the procedure was altered, and the practice which has obtained since July 1924 is that of the issue of a Patent of Precedence entitling a member of the Outer Bar to be called to the Inner Bar by the Chief Justice.  In accordance with professional usage, such member, when called to the Inner Bar, is described as Senior Counsel.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware, no confusion exists in this matter, which is quite clearly understood by the legal profession; although, probably because the description of Senior Counsel has a professional connotation equivalent to that of King's Counsel, the latter description is sometimes used in reference to Senior Counsel.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in a number of cases in the Dublin Public Assistance District payment of home assistance was reduced when the Social Welfare Act, 1948, came into operation. When the matter came to my notice I had inquiries made from the Dublin Board of Assistance and received an assurance that the cases were being dealt with specially; I am now informed that all the reductions which were made have been restored.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the Deputy's question, while I am precluded by law from giving any direction that assistance should or should not be granted in individual cases, I trust that local authorities will not avail of the increased rates of benefit made available under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, for the purpose of reducing such assistance to persons in necessitous circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have no power by law to direct a local authority to pay assistance or to refuse assistance in any particular case.

    <P>Seperate figures are not readily available for the area comprised in the Dublin South-Central Constituency.</P>
    <P>It was only in about one-sixth of those cases in which possession was given up that it was found necessary to resort to eviction in the sense of physically removing the parties concerned and their possesions.  That this was so is due, in no small measure, to the tact and patience with which the sheriff discharges his onerous and difficult duties.</P>
    <P>The answer to the last part of the question is in the negative.  If, as I imagine, the type of case in which the Deputy is chiefly interested is that in which sub-tenants are ejected in consequence of the sub-letting having been made in breach of a covenant against sub-letting, notwithstanding that they themselves are wholly free from blame, he will be glad to know that I am considering whether and to what extent it may be possible to provide relife in such cases by an appropriate amendment of the law.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that there is grave disappointment in the Swords district over the decision to charge £10 per night for the letting of the Sluagh Hall there, an increase of 100 per cent. on the 1947 charge; and, if so, whether he is prepared to have the charge reduced.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is grave <Col N="503" /> disappointment in the Swords district over the charges being made for the use of the Sluagh Hall.  The fee of £5 previously charged for the use of Slaugh Halls for dances was fixed early in 1940.  Having regard to the increased costs of building and maintenance and the fees charged for privately owned halls, revised fees of £7 10s. 0d. for dances up to midnight and £10 for dances continuing after midnight were fixed in September, 1948, for all Sluagh Halls throughout the country.  These charges are considered reasonable and I do not propose to reduce them.</P>

In view of the Minister's statements, and those of his colleagues, that the Government would reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent., is he aware that in this instance he is increasing it by 100 per cent. by charging £10 for the hire of the Sluagh Hall in Swords?

      <P>Apart altogether from the question of increasing or reducing the cost of living by stimulating the attendance at dances, it is a decided policy of the Government of this country, present and past, that these halls should not compete with the ordinary commercial ventures in the neighbourhood.  It was as result of charges going up on privately owned halls, and representations being made to the Department to the effect that we were affecting them adversely, that the altered rates were arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the service rendered by Mr. Thomas Kavanagh, Lower Main Street, Ballybay, in the Defence Forces.  The Army Pensions Board Medically examined him in February, 1946, and reported that they were not satisfied on evidence that the disease from which he suffered, viz., disseminated sclerosis, was attributable to his service in the Defence Forces during the emergency.  I can request the board to review their report only on the ground that evidence not available prior to the issue of their report has since become available and, if Mr. Kavanagh furnishes evidence of this nature, I will consider the question of reopening his claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's reply, I want to assure him <Col N="505" /> that in my opinion there is no need for Mr. Kavanagh to produce any additional evidence.  As the Minister is aware, the contributory causes of this disease&mdash;the specific causes are unknown&mdash;are fatigue, cold, exposure, heat and thermal conditions generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the cause is unknown, I should like to know why or for what reason the board arrived at the decision that disseminated sclerosis, as a result of which Mr. Kavanagh was invalided, was not attributable to his military service&mdash; having regard to the fact that Mr. Kavanagh's duties as blacksmith subjected him to the very conditions which are recognised contributory factors of disseminated sclerosis, namely, heat, cold, fatigue, exposure and thermal conditions generally.  Probably the Minister is not aware of the fact that on a number of occasions Mr. Kavanagh was taken from in front of the furnace while lathered in sweat, chucked on the back of a lorry and taken long distances in the country to attend to other jobs.  If that would not include thermal conditions generally, and exposure following fatigue, I am sure the Minister will agree with me that there are certain aspects of this question which definitely lead to that conclusion.  I have some experience of cases of disseminated sclerosis.  I am sorry to have to delay the House, but this case is important to the service, and I could not have it out in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will understand and sympathise with me if I cannot pick out a supplementary question from the speech which we have just heard.  But any point there may have been in the claim contended in the question was entirely blasted by the Deputy's statement that it is impossible to ascertain the specific cause of disseminated sclerosis. Surely the Deputy does not assert that the only thermal changes to which this particular individual was subjected occurred between the years 1942 and 1945?  But, as the law stands, a case of <Col N="506" /> this kind can only be reopened on new evidence not previously available.  I did not make that law and the Deputy's opinion does not affect that law.</P>

      <P>There is no official control over the distribution of cigarettes and the Minister for Industry and Commerce relies on the manufacturers to see that the system of distribution is an equitable one.  The manufacturers, in the interests of their established customers, have a rule not to open any new accounts.  This rule was relaxed in favour of ex-Army men setting up in business on demobilisation, and many such men received quotas of cigarettes from the principal manufacturers.

      <P>The percentage of registered premises visited under the Factory and Workshops Acts during 1947 was below the average for the years 1924-1939.  The decrease was largely due to a substantial increase in the number of premises on the register and to the fact that the inspectorate staff was not at full strength.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 13th September, 1948, I approved in principle the board's general proposals for the hydro-electric development of the River Lee.  To obtain an approval Order under Section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, it is necessary that the board should submit a detailed scheme with maps showing the area to be affected by the development, and the sites of the various works to be carried out, together with an estimate of the cost of the scheme.</P>
      <P>To allow of the preparation of a detailed scheme it is necessary that the area involved should be closely surveyed and hydrometric and geological investigations must be carried out.  It is understood that these surveys and investigations have been in progress for some months, and owners of properties have, in a number of cases, been informed of the extent to which their properties may be affected by the scheme should it be carried out.</P>
      <P>If, and when, a scheme is finally approved by Order under Section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, the board shall under Section 9 of that Act prepare and hold open to inspection by persons concerned, plans and maps sufficient in quantity and character to show on adequate scales the extent of the works in relation to which they are deposited, and also all property proposed to be acquired for such works and also every interference proposed to be made for the said purpose with any property or any public road or bridge.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate precisely when it is likely that the maps, plans, etc., will be deposited for inspection, but I understand that the board hopes, subject to the Order being made, to be in a position to have them ready for inspection within the next three months.</P>

The manufacturers were asked to make an exception from this rule for persons discharged from the Army under the general demobilisation scheme and they did so.

I think the Deputy will agree that any figures arrived at in the way he suggests would be purely speculative.  I would also like to remind him that it would take a considerable amount of time to get out those figures.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Parliamentary Secretary, I still consider that it would be most useful to county councils to obtain figures&mdash;making whatever assumptions it is necessary to make in regard to comparative types of vehicles&mdash;because it would give some indication to the county councils of the deficiency arising from motor vehicle taxation in relation to road expenditure.</P>

Circulars have been issued from time to time by my Department for the guidance of health authorities on this matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the urgent need for sanatorium accommodation for tuberculosis sufferers in County Dublin, he will take steps to secure premises in the area for use as a temporary sanatorium, with a view to alleviating the present very bad position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Institutional treatment for tuberculosis patients in Dublin County is provided in sanatoria and tuberculosis hospitals under the control <Col N="537" /> of the county borough health authority and various voluntary institutions in the vicinity of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am aware that additional accommodation for the patients referred to is required.  This, however, is part of a general problem for the eastern area and steps have already been taken to remedy the position by the establishment of the new St. Mary's Chest Hospital in the premises of the former Hibernian Military School, Phoenix Park, by extensions to Rialto Hospital and by the provision of beds at the Isolation Hospital, Pigeon House Road.  In addition, extensions are being carried out at St. Mary's Chest Hospital and at voluntary institutions, such as St. Laurence's Hospital, Peamount Sanatorium, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, and Newcastle Sanatorium.  These works are being pressed forward with all possible speed.  During the year 1948, 682 extra beds were provided in the country as a whole.  In addition, about 170 beds have been provided since the beginning of this year and a further 450 beds will be provided by next July. This total of about 1,300 additional beds will substantially ease the position in the eastern and other areas.</P>
      <P>If the existing rate of progress can be maintained in regard to further plans which are envisaged.  I am not without hope that by the end of the year the present waiting list of patients awaiting admission to sanatoria will have been largely dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for ordering a sworn inquiry into the operation of the opthalmic services in County Clare was to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the very unsatisfactory manner in which these services have been operated during the past two years.</P>
      <P>The scope of the inquiry was not limited to the acceptance of tenders for spectacles for use by public assistance patients and children under the school medical scheme.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at present to say how much the inquiry will cost.  The cost incurred by the officers holding the inquiry will in due course be certified by me and will be payable by the Clare County Council.  Such costs as may have been incurred by any other person in relation to the inquiry are payable by such person unless I certify under Section 91 of the Local Government Act, 1946, that a contribution shall be made towards such costs, in which case the contribution shall be made by the Clare County Council.</P>

I would point out to the Deputy that I have the highest regard for the excellent work carried out by these men.  In the nature of their work, however; they are from time to time temporarily laid off (not dismissed) as work on the particular jobs on which they are engaged ceases.  It is the normal practice of the Land Commission to re-engage the gangers with good records when work reopens in their areas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that there is great dissatisfaction in the town of Clonmel by reason of the fact that the factory there owned by Chappie Ireland Limited has been closed down for some considerable time, thereby depriving over 100 Clonmel people of employment; that it is <Col N="543" /> believed that the factory is not working because he has refused to allow this firm to export to the Continent canned meat the chief constituent of which is Irish horseflesh in tins embossed with the words &ldquo;Horse Meat&rdquo; or &ldquo;Horse Flesh&rdquo;, unless the tins also bear the words &ldquo;Dog Food&rdquo; or the words &ldquo;Not fit for human consumption&rdquo;; and, if so, whether he will explain his reasons for preventing the export of this meat in tins bearing a true description of the contents of the tins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and the second parts of the question is no.</P>
      <P>This firm was established for the purpose of exporting dog food to Great Britain but the British authorities declined to permit import.  That is the real difficulty.  The firm then proposed to export canned dog food to the Continent, and subsequently they sought licences to export canned horse for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I have already explained publicly that, in the national interest, I cannot agree to the export of canned horse for human consumption.  I am satisfied that, to allow such export, would seriously prejudice the reputation of this country as an exporter of high class meat which it is my duty to maintain, and would, therefore, be injurious to the interests of the country generally.</P>
      <P>The company in question has received licences to export substantial quantities of horseflesh as dog food.  The most recent licence was issued this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent this company from entering the canned beef trade.  In fact I suggested to them that they should do so many months ago, after I had negotiated a 10,000 ton order with the British Ministry of Food, and I pointed out that there was a market on the Continent as well as in Great Britain, to a share of which they would receive every facility for catering.  This company has approached the Department on this matter on many occasions and through divers channels; various proposals for the full employment of manufacturing <Col N="544" /> capacity have been approved, but they are apparently wedded to the project of exporting canned horse for human consumption, and that is a trade activity which I can neither encourage nor allow, without gravely compromising the interests of our valuable and growing cooked and canned meat industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the reason for the increase in the prices of artificial manures, amounting to an increase of £3 12s. 6d. a ton in the case of special potato manure and an increase of £1 a ton in the case of superphosphate over the corresponding prices for last season, and if he will consider making these fertilisers available to farmers at a cheaper rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The raw materials used in the manufacture of special potato manure have increased in price since last year.</P>
      <P>I do not, however, consider that an increase of £3 12s. 6d. per ton over last year's price in County Waterford is justified, as the net cash wholesale price ex-factory is £13 15s. 0d. per ton.</P>
      <P>There is also no good reason why superphosphate should be £1 dearer in Waterford.  The net wholesale cash price ex Cork or Dublin factories is £8 15s. 9d. per ton.</P>
      <P>In view of the largely increased supplies in sight for 1949, it was decided to withdraw controls on artificial fertilisers.  The manufacturers then reverted to their pre-war practice of quoting prices ex factory, to which have to be added transport charges and merchant's profit.  This is the reason for the varying prices being charged in different parts of the country.  I have made it clear in numerous public statements that farmers should make themselves familiar with the ex factory prices of the various straight manures and compounds which are on offer this year and thus be in a position to judge whether they are being charged reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> The prices of phosphatic fertilisers are in most areas below those ruling last year, and I hope that the competition provoked by more plentiful supplies will cause a further all-round reduction.  I shall do everything in my power along these lines to reduce the cost to the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the mere fact of making themselves familiar with the price ex-merchant is not going to result in a reduced cost to themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The best method of reducing an excessive price is to tell the shopkeeper to keep his merchandise, and if the farmers of this country have the good sense consistently to refuse to pay excessive prices, prices will come down.  I guarantee that to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the grave concern which the increased cost of fertilisers is causing farmers, and, in particular, the farmers engaged in the intensive growing of potatoes for seed, does the Minister not consider it necessary to fix a price for fertilisers and so give them some relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is seeking to create the impression that excessive prices are justified, I want to assure him that they are not.  The facts are that 35 per cent. superphosphate last season was £11 per ton ex-railway or canal station.  This year the wholesale price of Irish superphosphate is £9 5s. od. per ton ex-store.  The wholesale price of superphosphate in bulk from abroad was £7 12s. 6d. per ton c.i.f. Dublin; the buyer supplying the bags it would work out at £8 12s. 6d.  It is the duty of farmers when they go to buy their super to get from the shopkeeper who asks them for an excessive differential over those prices the reason why he asks it and to refuse to buy it if the shopkeeper tries to get it out of them.  There are other sources of supply and the Deputy would be very <Col N="546" /> much better employed familiarising himself with alternative sources of supply and telling his constituents what they are, than asking mischievous questions in this House.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not <Col N="549" /> exceeding £65,345 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to provide mainly for increases in the wages of forestry labourers, unforeseen when the Estimates for the year were being drawn up, additional fencing, planting and thinning and the purchase of additional supplies of fencing materials.</P>
    <P>In March, 1948, the wages of agricultural labourers were increased by 5/-a week and the pay of forestry workers was correspondingly increased.  Following the further increase in the agricultural wage rates last month the pay of forestry labourers is again being increased. Wage increases account for £27,750 of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Additional fencing work was necessary during the year to make up arrears which had accumulated owing to the shortage of fencing materials. Since the outbreak of war the greatest difficulty has been experienced in obtaining supplies of rabbit netting, barbed wire, etc., and such planting operations as were carried out were only made possible by using up the stocks in hand, lifting old wire and taking certain risks in planting without full protection.  It was only towards the end of the year 1947-48 that supplies began to come to hand in sufficient quantity to enable arrears of fencing to be undertaken and that item accounts for £2,500.</P>
    <P>During the emergency period thinning operations had to be postponed in some areas due to the pressure of work on fuel schemes and the difficulty of securing sufficient labour.  It is essential that thinning operations should be brought up to date to meet the sylvicultural requirements of the forests and it was possible to overtake more arrears during the present financial year than were estimated for before the year commenced.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this financial <Col N="550" /> year it was anticipated that the maximum planting programme would not exceed 6,000 acres.  As Deputies are aware a planting programme of 10,000 acres a year was contemplated, but had not been attained, before the war disrupted supplies and caused a diminution in the area planted annually. Supply difficulties in regard to fencing and plants have now been largely overcome for the time being and the Forestry Division hopes to plant approximately 8,800 acres this season.  If that figure be reached it will be the highest yet attained.  The Supplementary Estimate makes provision for approximately £22,000 additional to the original Estimate allowance for thinning and planting.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also includes the sum of £24,000 for the accumulation of reserve stocks of fencing materials which came on offer unexpectedly, and which it was considered essential, in present world conditions, to purchase.</P>
    <P>The balance of the money asked for (£11,000) is for extra payments of cartage and freight in respect of work carried out last spring on fuel supply schemes and for additional travelling expenses.  Some large freight accounts were not received in time for payment during the last financial year.</P>
    <P>Receipts in respect of sales of timber which are expected to exceed the Estimate by £10,000, and savings under other sub-heads to the extent of £12,000, are being utilised to reduce the amount asked for to a net figure of £65,345.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £496,900 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons (Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1948): for Supplements and for Allowances in Kind (No. 22 of 1946); and for certain Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> This Supplementary Estimate is rendered necessary in the main by the provisions of Part II of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, under which not only were pensions increased but, in addition, the means test was so modified that there were additional applicants for old age pensions; many persons not previously entitled to qualify for old age pensions now have an opportunity of qualifying under the provisions of the 1948 Act.  Broadly, the effect of the Act has been that approximately 102,000 persons who were previously in receipt of the normal maximum rate of pension of 12/6 per week are now receiving an old age pension of 17/6 per week.</P>
    <P>Approximately 25,000 persons whose maximum rate of pension was 15/- per week have had that pension increased to 17/6 per week.  In addition, some portion of this increased Estimate is rendered necessary by reason of an abnormal increase in the number of persons seeking old age and blind pensions.  The number in that respect increased during the year from ordinary causes, and the increase is due to the fact that, not merely had we a greater number of old age pensioners and blind pensioners in December than was estimated for during the year, but because the number of deaths of old age pensioners and blind pensioners during that period was apparently substantially less than in previous years.  A number of new applications which will be made under the Social Welfare Act are at present being investigated by local committees or are under consideration either by social welfare officers or by my Department.  It is not possible at this stage to give precise particulars as to the number of new applicants for such pensions, but it may be assumed that the number of new applicants will represent a substantial number of new claims.  The Estimate, in the main, is a normal consequence of the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1948.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding <Col N="552" /> £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for the Alleviation of Distress in Europe due to War, including Grants to International and other Organisations in respect of relief activities; and for relief supplies for refugees in Palestine.</P>
    <P>This is a token Vote of £10.  The original Estimate, as framed, is in terms of the alleviation of distress in Europe due to war.  During the year a request was made, in the first instance, by Count Bernadotte, the late mediator as between Palestine and Arabia for relief, and, secondly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations made a request for relief.  The relief that was requested in both these communications was in respect of about 333,000 destitute Arab refugees from Jewish-controlled areas in Palestine and about 7,000 Jewish refugees from Arab-con-trolled areas.  Thirty percent. of these refugees are children under five years of age and 10 per cent. are expectant mothers.  It was suggested that relief in kind would be the better way of giving this alleviation, and, after certain consideration, we decided on the sending of potatoes and oatmeal as the best way of replying to this appeal. Arrangements were accordingly made to ship about 200 tons of potatoes, the cost of which would be something short of £3,500, about £3,421 odd, and, at the same time, arrangements are still in course of being made for the shipment of 500 tons of oatenmeal at a cost of about £20,000.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, as the Estimate is drawn, to grant this relief, because the Estimate is tied to relief in Europe. The Supplementary Estimate is therefore introduced and has as an addition to the heading: &ldquo;For Relief Supplies for Refugees in Palestine.&rdquo;  A token Vote only is being requested, because there are savings on this Vote otherwise, and the amount of money can be found without any new money having to be voted.  Originally, for the relief of distress in Europe, a sum of about £3,000,000 was regarded as the proper expenditure, and because of the fact that particular commodities could not be obtained at certain times, it was <Col N="553" /> not possible to have that sum of £3,000,000 distributed within the year in which the original provision was made in 1945-46.  This, however, will be the end of it.  It is estimated that when the present year's commitments, which, of course, are more than the particular moneys I am looking for, are completed, not less than the amount of £3,000,000 will have been expended.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring in people who quite honestly did <Col N="557" /> not expect in the immediate future any Gaeltacht Housing Bill and who had done a fairly good job of reconstruction on their own houses and who, for the reason I have stated, did not make an application.  There may have been other but wiser ones who took the chance on it and made application and they now will qualify for a grant of £60.  I want the Minister to ensure that the others also can be considered, though they did not apply.  I think that his officers who deal with these questions in the Gaeltacht will be fairly good judges as to how they should use this power, if the Minister decides to take it.  I would ask the Minister to consider it very favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will realise the difficulty.  How can the Housing Section of Gaeltacht Services know when a reconstruction work has been carried out, unless an application has been made?  I do not believe there was a single case where reconstruction or improvement was done on existing dwellings without application having been made, since all the time they knew there was £40 there to be got. Is not that so?  I could not accept the amendment, as it would upset the whole balance of Section 3.  The best way to regard this amendment is to let Deputy Bartley imagine himself as a housing inspector under the Gaeltacht Services.  Johnny So-and-So notifies the Department that he did reconstruction work a year or two years ago and is now applying for a grant for it.  The inspector comes on the scene.  How is he to judge the age of the work or the quality of the work? This is very important, as at the very least we would like to keep a fairly strict supervision to see that the quality of the work is right.  If we accept this amendment, it means that applications for reconstruction works may come in for works that were not done or were done a very long time ago.  Secondly, we have no means whatever of checking up on the quality of the work done and may be asked to pay out the taxpayers' money for a very inferior or patched up job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has one test as to the age: he could ask the man who did the work the name of the <Col N="558" /> firm who supplied the materials.  That should be a check.  As to the quality of the work, the Minister's officers are, in any event, fairly well acquainted with all the jobs done in their area in the Gaeltacht, including the reconstruction jobs done without sanction. As the Minister says, they are not many and I agree with him there, and for that reason perhaps he might consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said our officers in a particular area would know of a particular work.  How could they?  They might know through local gossip, hearing things from people they meet in the discharge of their duties, but surely we could not entertain that? I am sure the Deputy realises that we must have an application.  I would like to meet him on this, and I might add that the Minister can always use his discretion.  He is not tied down by a hard and fast rule here in most of these cases, and whether it is I or some other Minister who is in power and in charge of Gaeltacht Services, he can be assured no Minister will be inclined to trim and save on the people of the Gaeltacht areas above other people in the country.  He can set his mind at rest on that.  I can assure the Deputy, from a close examination as to the effect of the amendment, that it would really do more harm than good.  I could not recommend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose this section.  I think that it is the most serious blot of all in the Bill&mdash;the withdrawal of assistance formerly given for the erection of piggeries and hen-houses. The Minister indicated in his speech the other day that he was satisfied that, as a result of the farm buildings scheme, people erecting houses in the Gaeltacht would not suffer in any way by the removal of this provision from the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act.  The ex-Minister for Education pointed out to him that it was undesirable to have two Departments dealing with the one question of Gaeltacht housing.  I think that that is a point the Minister ought to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question, namely, that people who get loans and grants under the Gaeltacht housing schemes are entitled to privileges in respect of rates and, in the operation of the Gaeltacht Housing Act, it was not necessary that a family should be Irish-speaking in order to qualify for grants for the erection of hen-houses or piggeries, while it was absolutely essential that the family should be Irish-speaking if they were to qualify for a grant for a dwelling house.  That meant that a number of families who were not Irish-speaking got grants and loans for the erection of piggeries and hen-houses.  These people were also entitled to the concession that their valuation should <Col N="560" /> remain static for a period of 20 years. If you remove the provision in regard to hen-houses and piggeries entirely, that privilege will go in respect of that class, even though it may be a limited class.  In any event, it is undesirable that applicants should have to deal with two Departments and two sets of inspectors where one set has done the work very efficiently up to the present. From the point of view of public funds, it amounts to the same thing, because it will take the same amount to erect piggeries and hen-houses in either case, and it would be better, in my view, to provide the amount of money necessary for the administration of the scheme under this Bill.  I commend that to the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered this point between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of the Bill?  I do not know whether he gave any undertaking on the occasion of the Second Reading that he would reconsider the question of out-offices and of the withdrawal of the provision in the old Acts from the present measure under which people were entitled to get grants for piggeries and hen-houses.  I consider that the removal of this provision would inflict great hardship on the people in the Gaeltacht.  After all, at the commencement there must have been some great motive in the minds of our legislators when they made this provision.  I think the motive was to establish an industrial tradition in the Gaeltacht.</P>

It appears to me that a certain amount of responsibility in this connection is being transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  I do not know whether that is wise, because, after all, the Gaeltacht Services Branch would be best fitted to deal with the problems of the Gaeltacht.  It was always the practice of the Gaeltacht Branch to try to co-ordinate the activities of other Departments in connection with these measures for the Gaeltacht.  I should like, before this <Col N="561" /> debate closes, if the Minister could give us some indication as to whether he has made up his mind that this provision by which people in the Gaeltacht could get grants for piggeries and hen-houses is to be suspended.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, there cannot be very much ground for complaint.  Furthermore, seeing that we were withdrawing the grants for poultry houses and piggeries from this Bill, for a definite reason, we have asked the Department of Agriculture to give a preference to applicants for a grant under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts either for a new or reconstructed house.  I think that should meet the case.</P>
      <P>Again, the element of compulsion to erect a poultry house and a piggery under the 1929 Act often caused delays and these delays were referred to by several Deputies on the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have cut the red tape as much as possible.  If an applicant applies for a grant for a new dwelling-house or for the reconstruction or improvement of an old one there will be the very minimum of delay.  He can get to work on the spot. There will be no certificate, no building licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Combined Purchasing Section which existed under the old Acts will be brought into operation again firstly, to speed up the building or the improvement of the house, once application has been made, and secondly, to produce the stuff as cheaply as possible and to dump it on the site so that the applicant can get to work with the least possible delay.  Deputies need not worry about the withdrawal of the grant for poultry houses and piggeries under this Bill.  It only meant delay previously, and it was really for the purpose of speeding up the erection or the reconstruction or the improvement of dwelling-houses that it was withdrawn. It was withdrawn in the certain knowledge that the Department of Agriculture was better equipped and that their officials were more suitable for dealing with the erection of any out-office than our Housing Section.  I would suggest to Deputy Bartley that there is no necessity to press the amendment.  The people of the Gaeltacht will not be any worse off.  I think they are getting very liberal terms.  The building or improvement grant and the erection of any out-office will be much speedier than the old method which proved cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has made a case for the amendment. He refers to the combined purchasing of materials.  It seems to me that it is far better to have one set of officials operating this combined purchasing&mdash;buying the materials for the dwelling-house, for the poultry house, and for the piggery&mdash;than to have a set of officials from the Department of Agriculture coming in to set up poultry houses and piggeries in districts in <Col N="563" /> which grants for dwelling-houses were given.  It will, in my opinion, militate against the smooth working of the combined purchasing if these two sections of the work are divided, one section working under one Department and another section working under another Department.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to check his statement that there has been compulsion under the old Acts in regard to the erection of poultry houses and piggeries.  I think that that compulsion was replaced by a discretion which was given to his officers in that respect. If the officer, in consultation with the local agricultural overseer, could report that the out-offices were sufficiently good the applicant was not compelled to build new ones.  I think the Minister will find that that has been the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>But, even in the case where the compulsory erection of poultry houses and piggeries existed under the old Acts, it was the officials of the Department of Agriculture who supervised the work on the one hand while officials of my Department supervised the erection of the dwelling-house on the other hand.  You had the very same thing.  We are now separating the two, and if a man wants a dwelling-house only he can have it from us without any trappings and so forth. On the other hand, if his dwelling-house is completed he will have absolutely no trouble in getting whatever grant he may require not alone for poultry houses and piggeries but for any other out-office he may require. The Deputy points out that some people in the Gaeltacht area may have out-offices sufficiently good as it is.  So they have.  The position is that though some of their dwelling-houses may be thatched they have in some cases wonderfully good out-offices.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with me when I say that these people would prefer it to be left to their own discretion. If John or Tom wants a new dwelling-house or to improve or reconstruct his dwelling-house, let him do so.  If he wants a grant for any out-office do not tie him down and force him to build poultry houses and piggeries. <Col N="564" /> Perhaps he may require a piggery but not a poultry house and, on the other hand, perhaps he may require a poultry house but not a piggery.  Very well.  Let him build what he requires.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy and, in fact, all the Deputies from the Gaeltacht areas, know quite well that since the passage of the 1929 Act the whole face of the countryside in the Gaeltacht areas has been changed and improved out of all bounds.  This Bill is designed to put the finishing touches to a job which was well begun under the 1929 Act and which was carried out without a hitch until the years of the emergency upset it and made new housing grants both in the Department of Local Government and in the Gaeltacht housing section necessary.  The Deputy may rest assured that I have asked the Minister for Agriculture about this matter and that he has assured me that the applicants from the Gaeltacht areas will get preference in the matter of grants for out-offices&mdash;particularly if application is made by a person who is at the same time either erecting a new house or reconstructing or improving an old house under this scheme.  I hold that the scale of grants, taking everything into account, is fair.  The State has not money to burn all the time and I think that this scheme of grants given by the Department of Agriculture under the farm buildings scheme is fair.  I do not say that they are wonderful or that they are anything like what either the Deputy or myself would like to see in operation but they are as good as the finances of the State can permit at the present time.  Again, let me say, the Deputy need not worry about that point.  I want to see the people in the Gaeltacht being facilitated in regard to out-offices equally with the people in the plains, let us say.  I feel sure that, before 12 months, the Deputy will find that there will be complaints from the people in the plains that the people in the Gaeltacht are getting preference in the matter of grants for out-offices.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that the Minister's objective will not be achieved by the method he is adopting now.  He says that he is going to cut red tape as much as possible.  If a <Col N="565" /> man applies for a grant for the erection of a new house under this legislation he will have to apply to Gaeltacht Services for the grant and, if he wants to erect a poultry house or a piggery, he will have to apply to another Department about that matter and fill in another set of forms.  That system will be only adding to red tape and it will make confusion worse confounded. It would be far better to have the whole scheme administered by the Gaeltacht Services section which was specially set up for that purpose.  If there is any co-ordination to be done between the Department of Agriculture and Gaeltacht Services it should be done by the officials who should simplify things as much as possible for the applicants for grants for new houses or for poultry houses or for piggeries.  This proposal by the Minister will add to the confusion of the situation by dividing the control instead of having more co-ordination and unification as far as services of this character in these areas are concerned. If the Minister accepts the amendment of an Teachta Mac Parthaláin he will be doing away with a lot of red tape that will arise under the proposal in this Bill.  A lot of extra red tape will arise under the Minister's proposal in the Bill.  I think Gaeltacht Services should control and administer the whole thing for the Gaeltacht areas and, if there is to be co-ordination, let that co-ordination be carried out between the two Departments here and let the scheme be simplified for the people who will benefit by making applications for grants under either scheme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Briain says <Col N="566" /> there are two sets of forms and that will cause delay.  Such will be the case still because, supposing we take over that particular section dealing with the building of out-offices from the Department of Agriculture and that we administer it, an applicant will have to fill up two sets of forms and supply two copies of specifications to show the type of house and out-office that he wants.  At the present time the agricultural instructors, as they are called, are constantly on the move all over the country, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, and any man who wants a grant will know where to find the instructor.  I must pay the instructors this compliment, that they are most helpful and very courteous and most willing to facilitate the people in every way.  They will put through the necessary forms, which are really very simple.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputies are just as sincere in this matter as I am but I can assure them that the experience of the Department is that the fact that the provision of out-offices was tied up with the housing grant had the effect in a good many cases&mdash;not all&mdash;of delaying the erection or improvement of the dwelling-house.  For that reason I have every confidence in recommending the section to the House.  Any person in the Gaeltacht who wants a grant for an out-office will get his preference and the grants are fair and liberal.</P>

Now you remove that provision in this Bill and turn over to the farm building scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That was all right where you were operating a scheme under the former Acts whereby your housing inspector got the certificate or <Col N="567" /> the word of the local agricultural overseer that this man's piggery or hen-house was satisfactory or was not satisfactory.  You gave a decision accordingly.  If the local agricultural man said it was satisfactory you did not compel the applicant to erect a piggery or hen-house and, if he said it was not good enough, you insisted that he should first build his piggery and his hen-house.  How are you going to ensure that a good house will also have a suitable piggery and hen-house?  How are you going to give the people the benefit of the combined purchasing? Are you going to retain the rating privilege to which the Minister referred and which is given under these Gaeltacht Acts?  I would ask the Minister to look up that matter.  Under the Gaeltacht Act, if a man gets sanction, his valuation remains static for 20 years.  The 1934 Act made it compulsory that the family should be Irish-speaking in order to get a dwelling-house. But, if a person had a good dwelling-house but had not a suitable piggery or hen-house he could apply, even though his family was not Irish-speaking, and when he got sanction he also got the advantage of having his valuation remain static for 20 years. In that type of case that privilege is being lost.  That is not as important as the other matters referred to by the three Deputies who have spoken.  They want the benefit of the combined purchasing retained for the building and out-offices, and they want to cut out the red tape of having to go through two Departments and two sets of officials.</P>

I maintain that the Bill as it stands is a definite improvement and that the amendment will only mar an otherwise good measure.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the greatest amount of facility to the people in the Gaeltacht to improve their dwelling-house first and then to allow them absolute freedom to erect whatever type of out-office they want because, as I have said, some may want a piggery and may not want a hen-house.

I will look into it and see if we could also extend the combined purchasing where a grant would be made available for the erection of an out-office.  I would like to see them getting the benefit of the cheaper material.  I am sure it would result in a saving.

      <P>We erected a hen-house and piggery in almost all cases heretofore with a grant of £5 and a loan of £2 10/-.  That had to be passed by an official of the Department of Agriculture.  What we propose to do now is that we should have nothing to do with the erection of any out-office that the applicant for the dwelling-house wants to erect, to leave it to himself, to let him erect whatever buildings, of whatever size or shape or for whatever purpose he desires.</P>
      <P>There is a liberal scheme of grants available for him under the Department of Agriculture.  As a matter of fact, our aim under this Bill is to make the erection of a dwelling-house as free from red tape as possible and give as good a dwelling-house as is possible at the cheapest figure and with the most liberal grant.  At the same time, an applicant is free to avail himself of the fairly liberal scheme of grants under the Department of Agriculture to erect whatever type of out-office he wants and for whatever purpose he wants it.  We do not propose to interfere and say: &ldquo;You must keep pigs or hens whether you like it or not; you must put up the out-house whether it will be empty or full.&rdquo;  We are denying him nothing.  As a matter of fact, I would not stand over any section or sub-section if it were denying these people anything.  As I said, if we want to save, we do not propose to save on people who live in the Gaeltacht areas. We want to facilitate them in every way and to make their lives, which otherwise would be drab, as bright and gay as we possibly can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I think the Minister is misleading us.  I do not accept the Minister's statement that we were compelling them to build hen-houses and piggeries.  There was no compulsion.  There was consultation between the Department's office and <Col N="570" /> the local agricultural inspector as to whether the existing buildings were suitable.  If they were, the person was not compelled to build out-offices. If they were not considered suitable, he was compelled to make them suitable.  That was the only extent to which compulsion existed.  I think there was compulsion under the 1929 Act, but as a result of experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That compulsion was never eased off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  If the Minister looks at the 1934 Act I think he will find it was.  In any event, whether it was done by Act of Parliament or by regulation, the fact is that in the course of time this practice grew up: that if the officers decided that the existing buildings were all right the person was not compelled to build new ones.  I should like to put this to the Minister. He has removed the limit on the valuation.  There was no limit to the valuation in the other Acts except to this extent: that three-fifths of the total money voted heretofore was earmarked for houses on holdings whose valuation did not exceed 21/- and the other two-fifths was without limit of valuation.  Now there is no limitation at all and a man with £100 valuation can qualify for a Gaeltacht grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>He can if the Minister lets it pass.  The Minister has a discretion in the matter, or at least the officials of his Department.  Surely they would not be so blind as to give a grant to a man like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher you go with the valuation the more likely it is that the applicant will not require out-offices. For that reason I think the Minister ought to preserve this facility. Otherwise an impression will be created that there will be a bias in favour of the people with the higher valuations who do not require them.  I think the reasons adduced by Deputy Ó Briain and Deputy Kissane are the best ones put forward&mdash;that the Minister is introducing extra red tape by having two Departments dealing with the matter, two applications, and two sets of officials, and that people are <Col N="571" /> being denied the benefit of the combined purchasing scheme.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that people who will apply under the farm buildings scheme cannot as readily get building materials from a supplier as they can under this scheme, because they will now be building under the farm buildings scheme on their own initiative and will have to do their own ordering of materials.  Under this scheme the officers in the combined purchasing section get the stuff delivered on the site.  I submit that this is a retrograde step, is introducing extra red tape and making the matter far more difficult for applicants who dislike intensely having to handle official forms.</P>

      <P>As to the advantage of purchasing materials under the combined purchasing scheme, the Deputy says that applicants will lose that. They will not, because it is quite possible for an applicant for a farm buildings grant under the Department of Agriculture to come to us and the combined purchasing section will buy the material for him in the same way as for a dwelling-house.</P>

      <P>No, but if it is brought to my notice I will give the person the advantage of the combined purchasing scheme.  The Deputy referred to people with high valuations applying for a grant.  There are very few people with high valuations in the Gaeltacht area. Every single grant will have to be sanctioned by the Minister or the director of the Gaeltacht Services or some official like that.  We know what the spirit of the Act is&mdash;to come to the rescue of persons with small valuations <Col N="572" /> in the Gaeltacht area.  If a person who is wealthy enough to build a house without a grant was so shameless as to apply for a grant and take advantage of the scheme, I think he would not pass through the mesh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I hope, no necessity for my dwelling at any great length on our reasons for introducing this Bill.  Justification for our having <Col N="575" /> done so will be evident to any Deputy with a knowledge of Section 73 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, and who will carefully consider it and compare it with the amendments we have introduced.  May I say at the outset that Section 73 of the 1934 Act has been the bugbear of, and a source of continued dissatisfaction and irritation to, not alone the medical profession but members of the legal profession as well, who are frequently nonplussed by the manner of its loose interpretation, to say nothing of its irregular administration.  I think it well, at this stage, to point out to the House the portions of Section 73 which we have incorporated in our new amendments.  It states that where compensation is payable under the Act and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;such workman has received, whether in hospital or elsewhere, medical or surgical treatment in respect of such injury, and any fees are due by such workman to a medical practitioner in respect of such treatment, and such compensation is fixed by an order of the court or under a weekly payment agreement, commutation agreement or an agreement by way of compromise registered by order of the court under Part VI of this Act, the court may, if it so thinks fit&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I may point out that in our opinion it is this wording</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the court may if it so thinks fit&rdquo; that is giving rise to such confusion and misinterpretation of the section. We have suggested that it be changed to &ldquo;the court shall.&rdquo;  The original section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Upon the application of such medical practitioner made immediately upon the making of such order...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that in all those cases of workmen's compensation one of the first witnesses called is the medical practitioner and as those cases proceed for quite a long time, perhaps a couple of hours, it is quite impossible for the medical officer to remain in court until the case has been decided in <Col N="576" /> order to comply with the regulations and make a personal application for his fee.  In justice, however, shall I say, to the learned judge in the areas where this grant is made he has not adhered strictly to the letter of the law in this matter and he has on a number of occasions, I know, permitted the counsel or solicitor for the workman to make this application.  However, the fact of the matter is that strictly in accordance with the law the medical officer in order to receive £5 or less is compelled by the section to make a personal application.  It says in the original section :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;upon the application of such medical practitioner made immediately upon the making of such order, direct the employer to pay, in addition to the compensation, to such medical practitioner in respect of such fees such sum, not exceeding £5, as the court may fix.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have suggested instead of that :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The court shall, upon the application of such medical practitioner or upon the application of the workman's counsel or solicitor made immediately upon the making of such order direct the employer to pay, in addition to the compensation, to such medical practitioner in respect of such fees such sum as the court may fix having regard to the period of reasonable medical attendance upon such workman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have suggested that instead of: &ldquo;a sum not exceeding £5&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that later.  To my knowledge the cases are legion in which the fee paid to the doctor has been a maximum of £5, irrespective of the length of time that he has been in attendance.  With regard to Deputy O'Higgins' remark, it may interest him to know what my own experience has been in some cases in which I was concerned as medical attendant.  This is one.  I was attending an injured workman for well over a year; his compensation was fixed and at the end the sum of £5 was divided between the county surgeon and myself. <Col N="577" /> Cases of that sort have happened on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed section, as it stands, would cover attendance whether fees were chargeable or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that fees are always chargeable.  It may be that other portions of the Act, as well as the part of it to which I am referring, are interpreted in a different manner. I have dealt with cases in which some proportion of the £5, if not all of it has been made.  I want to tell the House that, in certain Circuit Court areas, the Act is so misinterpreted that the medical attendant to the workman is very often refused not only the £5 but even a portion of it.  I should like to instance a case in which I was appearing for the insurance company. The workman was found to be incapacitated up to the day of the trial.  Full compensation was paid.  His medical attendant, an eminent and conscientious man, made application through a solicitor for payment of the £5, and the learned judge refused it.  This medical gentleman assured me that, even had he been granted the £5, the fee would fall far short of covering his expenses in connection with that case.  He had been attending the workman for well over a year.  That is not by any means an isolated case.  The amazing thing about these cases is that the one person on whom the onus falls of restoring the workman to a condition which will enable him to return to work, is refused even this paltry remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that there are certain areas in the country in which this section of the Act is either ignored completely or, if observed at all, would appear to depend entirely on the humour or whim of the learned judge hearing the case.  We must remember that any workman whose claim for compensation eventually reaches the Circuit Court, has been receiving medical attention for at least six months.  That has been my experience extending over 15 years.  Indeed such people, generally speaking, have been receiving treatment for a year.  I have known of cases that have gone on for two years.  My submission is that it is <Col N="578" /> disappointing, to say the least of it, that the medical attendant's chance of getting the miserable pittance provided is just a matter of pot luck.  Deputies should also bear in mind the multitude of cases of minor injuries that occur in which the persons concerned recover and return to work.  For their treatment of these cases, the medical attendants receive absolutely no remuneration whatever.  We have absolutely no redress in the matter, though I maintain, and justifiably I think, that the responsibility in these cases should be that of the employer.</P>
    <P>Now, it may be alleged by some Deputies that, if this Bill goes through, the insurance companies will increase the premiums on employers.  In view of the fact that following the passing of the 1934 Act, insurance companies increased their premiums by 20 per cent. I feel that ample provision and sufficient safeguards were made by them to cover this £5 which was tentatively suggested as remuneration for the medical attendant, but which, I assert, has never been paid in almost 50 per cent. of the cases.  Therefore, I do not think anybody should allow this question of a possible increase in insurance premiums to affect him when considering this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-section (2), we are all aware that a number of workmen's compensation cases are settled out of court, the registration of the agreements eventually going before the county registrar.  We thought it was necessary to make provision for a settlement of such cases out of court. I know of instances where these cases have been disposed of without any provision whatever being made for the medical services given.  When one considers the scant consideration and unspecific provision made for those services we can understand the omission, however regrettable, on the part of the workman's solicitor.  I admit that does not happen very often, but the fact is that it can happen.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the medical profession, I want to say that we are merely seeking what I believe reasonable people will concede we are entitled to, namely, adequate recompense proportionate to the services rendered as is the custom in every walk <Col N="579" /> of life as between doctor and patient. Regarding the wording of the section itself, all we desire is that it be couched in such unmistakable terms as will ensure uniformity in its administration and an end to confusion and misinterpretation.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House ought to know something of the background of workmen's compensation and of the slow and early beginnings of our code of social legislation so far as workmen's compensation is concerned.  The original and principal purpose of the workmen's compensation code was to provide compensation for injured workmen. Every other aspect of our workmen's compensation code was subsidiary to that main consideration, namely, to make provision for the man who was injured.  I should, therefore, like the Deputies who are supporting this Bill to keep that point of view in the forefront of their perspective and to remember that the whole approach to this problem must be to consider the main purpose of the original and every subsequent Act.  Our workmen's compensation code is probably the oldest of any piece of social legislation now in existence.  The original Workmen's Compensation Act was passed in 1897. Prior to that workers had no right under any workmen's compensation code.  Admittedly they had rights of common law against negligent employers or under the Employers' Liability Act of 1880 which was in operation for the 17 years between the enactment of that Act and the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897. However, the workers' rights of common law then were both difficult and costly to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enactment of the 1897 Act represented a very substantial revolution in workmen's compensation inasmuch as it enthroned the first Workmen's Compensation Act and established the worker's right to compensation in respect of industrial injuries in a manner which had not <Col N="580" /> previously existed.  The Act at that time covered specially hazardous occupations such as employment on railways, in mines, quarries and engineering works and was then limited to persons in those classes of employment.  In 1900 the Act was extended generally to take in agriculture and in 1906 it was extended to cover all classes of employment where the relationship of master and man existed, except for non-manual workers in receipt of salaries in excess of £250.  That £250 was increased to £350 for non-manual workers in the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1934 did one thing in respect of medical fees which was not done under any previous code of workmen's compensation legislation.  It established for the first time the rights of a medical practitioner to go to the courts, either in person or through a solicitor, at the time the settlement was being made there and to ask the court to award him a sum of money in respect of his treatment of the injured workman.  The court could, if it thought fit, grant the medical practitioner a sum not exceeding £5 in respect of his attendance on the injured worker.  However, bear in mind that the outstanding feature under which a doctor could get £5 medical fees as set out in the 1934 Act was this.  He could go to a court or a solicitor.  The court had a right to say yes or no to his application and the sum could never exceed £5 in respect of any one doctor.  Two doctors could make an application and both could get £5 or, presumably, 32 could make an application if they could show they had attended the injured worker, and they could all get it.  But the amount could not exceed £5 for one doctor, and the court had the right to say whether or not he should get £5, £1 or anything between £1 and £5.  That was the setup. Bear in mind that up to 1934 no previous workmen's compensation code had ever provided for the payment of medical fees to persons who attended injured workers and since 1934 no workmen's compensation code, either in the Six Counties or in Great Britain, provides for payment to a doctor who attends an injured workman as such. <Col N="581" /> The 1934 Act, therefore, was responsible for the introduction of what might be called a medical novelty in the sense that it provided the right under certain circumstances to a doctor to secure a maximum fee of £5 in respect of attendance on an injured workman.  That has been the position from 1934 until the present date.  We alone in this area of jurisdiction provide that entitlement to fees.  No such entitlement is provided in Britain or in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the Workmen's Compensation Act was passed in the main to provide compensation for injured workmen.  It was not intended that it should provide sources of income for insurance companies.  It was not intended as a source of income for doctors, dentists or surgeons.  The main purpose of the Act&mdash;and it is still the main purpose&mdash;was to provide compensation for the injured workmen because the legislators said that a workman injured in the course of his employment had a legitimate claim against his employer for compensation in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>A feature of all our workmen's compensation legislation has been that it was always restrictive in character.  If a workman met with a very serious accident, was mauled in the wheels of an engineering plant and, as a result, suffered not only serious physical damage and impairment but suffered also a very considerable loss in earning, the maximum amount of compensation to which he was entitled under the 1934 Act was 30/- per week.  Thus, under that Act, a workman earning £6 or £7 a week, with a wife and four, five or six children, when he met with an accident in the course of his employment which resulted in his being unable to follow his occupation for three, six, nine or 12 months, got as a maximum 30/- per week.  That is all he got between 1934 and 1943 when, under an Emergency Powers Order, the maximum compensation was stepped up from 30/- to 37/6 a week.</P>
    <P>In the Workmen's Compensation (Amending) Bill, which I introduced in this House recently and which is now law, the maximum compensation has been raised from the 1934 level of 30/-to the current level of 50/- per week. <Col N="582" /> It is worthy of note that here again that is still the maximum compensation which can be secured by an injured workman incapable of following employment as a result of injuries sustained in the course of his work.  Even though that workman may to-day, if he had not met with the accident, be capable of earning £7 or £7 10s. 0d. a week, he can get only one-third of his normal wage as a maximum&mdash;that is, 50/- per week.  Not only in the 1934 Act, but in all previous pieces of workmen's compensation legislation there has been that restriction by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The workman is entitled to some compensation, but the compensation has fallen short, in some instances very substantially short, of his normal rate of income.  Even if the workman should lose his life, under the 1934 Act his widow and children going to court cannot get from the court the actuarial value of his income, ascertained by actuarial standards.  There is a limit set there to the amount of compensation which the widow can get if she loses her husband.  The actuarial value with regard to a man of 30 years earning £8 a week might be reckoned at £8,000 or £10,000.  The widow cannot get that.  There is a ceiling of £600 for the widow if her husband is lost at the age of 30 years.  That is another instance of the restrictive character of our workmen's compensation legislation.</P>
    <P>In short, therefore, the 1934 Act said to the injured workman: &ldquo;The maximum compensation you will get under this Act, mainly introduced to provide compensation for you, is 30/- per week,&rdquo; now adjusted to 50/- per week. That was a variation of a rate of benefit which existed from 1897 to 1934.  The medical attendant of the injured workman previously could not recover from the employer.  It was in the 1934 Act for the first time he got the right to recover from the employer.  The employer did not employ the doctor.  The employer may not be in the country at all, but he may be liable for the workman who meets with an accident in the course of his employment.  Under the 1934 Act the medical practitioner got the right to recover compensation from the employer, even though the employer <Col N="583" /> had nothing to do with engaging the doctor.</P>
    <P>The 1934 Act said to the injured workman: &ldquo;Your ceiling is 30/- per week,&rdquo; and to the doctor it said: &ldquo;Your maximum fees will be £5.&rdquo; Since 1934 we have amended the 30/-maximum compensation for the workman so as to enable him to get to-day a ceiling of 50/- compensation.  That is the maximum amount to which he is at present entitled.  Nobody will deny that that legislation was overdue, inasmuch as it gave to an injured workman some additional measure of compensation for the shrunken purchasing power of money and to compensate for the fact that wages generally had risen.</P>
    <P>This Bill is seeking to break new ground, not on behalf of the injured workman, but on behalf of doctors and dentists and surgeons who may attend injured workmen.  In the past the court was empowered to give a doctor who attended an injured workman a sum of not more than £5 as fees for his attendance on the injured man.  But it was not an automatic right to pay. The doctor or his solicitor had to go to the court and say to the district justice or the Circuit Court judge trying the case: &ldquo;I claim payment of fees for attending the injured workman&rdquo; and the court could grant a maximum of £5 or it could refuse it.  That was the relationship of the doctor and the injured workman under our 1934 code of workmen's compensation legislation, and that is the relationship which exists to-day, with the 1948 amending Act grafted on to the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill wants to reverse that relationship entirely.  From a position in which the doctor or his solicitor had to go to the court and ask for payment of fees, subject to a maximum of £5, this Bill seeks to put the medical attendant on the injured workman in a position immensely superior to anything he has occupied in the past and in an immensely better position than the injured workman, for whom all our compensation legislation was introduced. The amending Bill says that whereas in the past the court might, if <Col N="584" /> it thought fit, award compensation, it will take completely out of the hands of the court the right to refuse compensation. The doctor has merely got to go into the court and say: &ldquo;I am proceeding under Section 73 (1) of the measure introduced in the Dáil by Deputy Maguire and Deputy Brennan,&rdquo; and the judge thereupon looks at the section and says: &ldquo;Well, I have got to do what these two Deputies desire; I must award compensation.&rdquo;  He cannot refuse.  He has to start off from that angle.</P>
    <P>Every time a doctor demands payment under Section 73 of this measure, if it is passed, the judge has to find out how much he has got to award.  He need not bother asking himself will he make any award at all.  This measure renders it unnecessary for the judge to trouble himself with such an academic question as whether or not he will make an award.  Deputy Maguire and Deputy Brennan say to the judge: &ldquo;Forget about it; it is none of your business in the future.  You have got to make an award and you have no discretion whatever to refuse.&rdquo; The judge says: &ldquo;How much have I got to award?&rdquo;  and he looks at Section 73 of the Act of 1934 and he says: &ldquo;Under the Act of 1934 I am limited to awarding a maximum sum of £5.&rdquo;  But under this new Bill the sky is the limit so far as medical fees are concerned.  He is not obliged to award a maximum of £10 or £20 or £30.  Any Circuit Court judge can award £1,000 medical fees between surgeons and specialists and psychiatrists and dentists or anybody else under Section 73 of this new Bill; and each of those could get the full amount awarded.</P>

Section 73 of the 1934 Act allows him to award £1 or £2 or £3 or £4; but it also stipulates that you cannot charge the employer more than £5.  The section proposed provides that there shall not be any limit to the sum of money which may be awarded as fees to any medical attendant who goes into court and claims compensation under this new <Col N="585" /> Bill.  In the first place he must get it; the Circuit Court judge cannot say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He has got to make the award and there is no limit to that award.</P>
      <P>When I saw this Bill I took the trouble to ask the insurance companies with whom employers lay off their liabilities under the Workmen's Compensation Act if they could tell me what additional premium would be required to cover this risk: firstly, the judge must award a sum of money for medical fees and, secondly, there is no restriction on what he can award any doctor, specialist, surgeon, dentist or anybody else.  The insurance companies told me they did not know what it would cost.  I myself have no idea what it would cost because this is uncharted territory.  There has never been any experience to show what the annual payments under this would amount to in a Bill which makes the sky the limit so far as the payment of medical fees is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is asked to pass a Bill, therefore, under which it is not possible to measure the liability to which the House is committing itself.  If this Bill is passed any person who employs a workman will have to find out from the insurance companies what increase in premiums he will have to pay if this new Section 73 is inserted.  I have not been able to find out how much the employer will have to pay.  Of one thing I am certain and that is that he will have to pay a very substantial increase in his present premiums.  A man might be a small industrialist, merchant, shop-keeper or farmer who elects not to insure his workmen but decides to carry the risk himself.  If this Bill were to become law he would undertake a liability for the payment of disablement benefits at a maximum of 50/- per week.  To some extent that can be measured because there are statistics available from which it is possible to discover what the normal liability is.  He may decide to carry the risk in respect of fatal injuries as well.  Again, it is possible to find out what that risk is from statistics.  But he is now being asked to shoulder another risk.  He is being asked to shoulder the risk which would accompany the enactment of this amending <Col N="586" /> Bill and which would take the form of committing the employer to accept a risk&mdash;he may be a relatively small farmer or man of modest income&mdash; whereby he would be held liable for the payment of medical fees awarded by a court which was not empowered by the Act to fix any ceiling in respect of the sum which it could award for medical expenses.</P>
    <P>Not all of us live up in the clouds. We know that it is easy enough to go to an eminent surgeon and run up a very hefty bill running into three figures for a not very major or prolonged operation.  The figure represents the measure of value which the surgeon attaches to his own skill.  The surgeon may decide that the operation he performed on a particular person is worth 200 guineas.  He is entitled to fix that fee.  As many Deputies are aware, many surgeons get fees running into such figures.  If an injured workman were to receive medical attention from an eminent surgeon or physician who thought highly of his medical knowledge and practice the Circuit Court judge would be obliged to award such medical fees as might be demanded without any legislative restriction as to the maximum amount which could be awarded.</P>
    <P>If an eminent surgeon who is used to getting fees of 200 and 300 guineas for operations goes into court the Circuit Court judge would not find it very easy to award him £10 if the surgeon elects for £200 or £300.  It cannot be pleaded, on the other hand, that the employer cannot pay because by then it will be pretty well known that an insurance company is standing behind the employer.  In the long run the insurance company will not lose because it will adjust its premiums to cover that risk and it will collect the additional premiums necessary from the person who thinks it desirable to cover his risks with an insurance company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Maguire and Deputy Dr. Brennan would not attempt to prophesy what additional cost premiums of this kind would involve.  A somewhat similiar proposal was put forward when the 1934 Act was being enacted.  The then Minister for <Col N="587" /> Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, hazarded the view that it would result in an increase of 50 per cent. in the premiums for workmen's compensation purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no ceiling on the fees which could be awarded to doctors.  I think he arrived at that figure of 50 per cent. because of a similar proposal which was made in Australia some time previously in respect of which somewhat comparable legislation would cost up to 50 per cent. more.  I have not been able to ascertain on what figures precisely he based his calculation.  The matter is not sufficiently clear to me.  At all events the Minister in charge of the 1934 Act made the case that it would cost 50 per cent. more.  Assuming that 50 per cent. is exaggerated and that it would only cost 25 per cent. more in premiums, does Deputy Dr. Maguire realise what even that involves?  Present premiums paid in respect of workmen's compensation amount to approximately £1,000,000 per year.  A 50 per cent. increase would mean pushing that up by £500,000 if that basis of calculation were correct.  I do not say that it is either right or wrong.  It was put forward by Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Assuming it was 50 per cent. exaggerated it still represents an increase of £125,000 on the present premiums payable for workmen's compensation purposes. That must come out of the pockets of those who pay premiums for workmen's compensation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to Deputy Maguire and Deputy Brennan, both of whom are reasonable men: do they think it equitable in all the circumstances that, in a code of legislation designed to benefit the injured workman, the main purpose of which is to befriend and assist the injured workman and by which the injured workman himself is compelled to accept a fragment of his wages in lieu of his normal earnings, there should be no ceiling so far as the expenses which could be claimed by the medical attendant on an injured <Col N="588" /> workman from an employer who did not employ the medical attendant?</P>
    <P>If there is to be a ceiling for the unfortunate mangled workman&mdash;that is what the 1934 Act and every other previous Act imposed&mdash;and if there is to be, as the 1934 Act provided, a ceiling of £5 maximum fees for the medical attendant, is it reasonable to say to-day in all the circumstances that, while you will keep the injured workman's compensation down to a maximum of 50/- per week, irrespective of his injuries, their duration or his domestic circumstances, you will allow the medical attendant to get from the Court any fees that the Court awards, without the Court being restrained in any way in the matter of fixing a limit to the fees claimed?  I suggest to both Deputies that that is not a reasonable approach to a problem of this kind and that it is not reasonable to keep the workman tied down to a specified figure, while the medical people can make claims for fees and get, without any legislative restriction, the full value of their claim.</P>
    <P>Let me concede this, however, and I do it at once.  When the 1934 Act was introduced, it contemplated a relationship between the injured workman, the doctor and the legislation.  It said to the injured workman: &ldquo;Your maximum compensation will be 30/-&rdquo;; and to the doctor: &ldquo;Your fees will be £5 as a maximum.  That is what both of you now can get out of the benefits provided under the 1934 Act.&rdquo;  Whatever we do, I think that relationship has to be preserved in some way or other. I will concede at once that if 30/- a week was regarded as adequate compensation for an injured workman in 1934, it cannot be regarded as adequate in 1949, because of the change in the value of money in the meantime.  It is because I did not believe that that I recently introduced the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, which increased the 30/- to 50/- and thus gave the injured workman an increase of 66? per cent. on the 1934 figure.  In all the circumstances, the medical attendant would scarcely think that he ought to get more than the injured workman.</P>
    <P>The relationship of 1934 was 30/- to £5 and the injured workman has got <Col N="589" /> a 66 per cent. increase on his 30/-.  I put it to Deputy Maguire that there is no argument he can adduce to show that the doctor should get more than the man for whom the Act was primarily intended.  It would, therefore, be reasonable to say to the doctor who attends an injured workman: &ldquo;If £5 was a reasonable figure for you in 1934, it cannot be regarded as reasonable in 1949 in view of the changed value of money&rdquo; and I should be prepared to meet an argument based on such a contention; in other words, to maintain, in relation to 1949 rates of benefit and fees, the money relationship which existed between these in 1934 and which is now ascertainable on the basis of the increase between 1934 and 1949 in the amount of compensation paid to the injured workman.  I am sure, however, that it will not be contended by any reasonable Deputy that the medical attendant ought to get a higher percentage increase on the 1934 rates than the injured workman.</P>
    <P>If this Bill were a Bill asking for an adjustment of the medical fees in relation to 1934 levels and in accordance with the adjustments already made in respect of the injured workman, one could approach it in a reasonable way and find a yardstick by which to measure what the shrunken value of £5 in 1949 is in relation to its 1934 buying power; but that is not the position. This Bill wants to deprive the court of any right to refuse a claim and wants to prevent the fixing of any maximum by law.  I should be prepared to look at this Bill from an entirely different standpoint, if the claim were: &ldquo;Since you gave the injured workman an increase in his 1934 rates, you ought to give the doctor an increase as well.&rdquo; That is a reasonable and understandable approach, but Deputy Maguire perhaps unconsciously&mdash;and Deputy Brennan is in the same position&mdash;wants to open a door which would give rise to grave doubts as to whether this Bill is properly called a Workman's Compensation Bill at all, because it seems to me that the workman's portion of the cake would be pretty small, with the restrictions imposed on the kind of knife he can use when operating on the cake, compared with the substantial portion of the cake that would be distributed <Col N="590" /> to medical attendants by Circuit Court judges in the future.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to believe that Deputy Maguire and Deputy Brennan have the feeling that the medical profession are not getting a fair deal in being tied down to £5, but, as I said at the outset, that was an innovation.  It is an innovation which is not known in the Six Counties or Britain.  I do not want to take that fact as even a guide to an approach to this matter, but it is a fact which ought to be kept in mind. It will not be very long until the House will have to deal with a comprehensive social insurance scheme which will embrace not only all our present unco-ordinated schemes of social legislation but, I hope, workmen's compensation as well.  How we are going to deal with it in the future I cannot say at the moment.  Whether by State operation of the service or by integrating workmen's compensation in a common social insurance scheme or by following the present pattern of workmen's compensation, I cannot at the moment indicate.</P>
    <P>No matter what course we adopt, we will still have to face up to dealing with workmen's compensation legislation, and, knowing that the problem will come under comprehensive review in the near future and that they will have an opportunity of dealing with the matter on a broader canvas than is available on this narrow amending Bill, might I suggest that, having given their point of view an airing, the proposer and seconder might reasonably be content to withdraw this Bill, so that they might see the whole problem in a different and broader light in the future.  In any case, if they are not satisfied with the position in the future, or not satisfied that they are seeing the Bill with the expedition they desire, there is nothing to prevent them coming in here in a few months' time with a similar Bill and taking any course they wish in connection with it.  I am sure it is not just for fees that both Deputies are arguing this matter.  I prefer to believe that they are advocating a line of policy which they feel, looking at it from their angle, represents a grievance to a class of the community which <Col N="591" /> they represent.  However, seeing that the £5 maximum has been in the Act for the past 15 years and that it does represent a relationship to the compensation payable to the injured workman, then they might agree, having heard my views on the matter and of the legislation which is coming, together with having ventilated their own point of view, to withdraw the Bill on the understanding that they will have an opportunity of dealing with the problem in a bigger and more comprehensive way at a date which will not be too far distant.</P>

      <P>After the closing statement of the Minister, it would be a waste of time to continue this discussion very much longer, unless the opportunity were to be used as a time when certain views on this question could be aired.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am perfectly sure that Deputy Dr. Maguire would agree with me&mdash;the course which the Minister has suggested is one which we shall gladly take.  The Minister will not, I hope, take the remarks which I am about to make in a very few sentences in any other way than as being intended to assist, to be constructive on this subject of workmen's compensation, in so far as it relates to doctors, in regard to an outlook which I think he has developed through smoked glasses so far as the medical profession is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that the primary object of the 1934 Act was to provide compensation for injured workmen, but surely the basis of providing compensation is in some way related to the restoration to health of the injured workman and it is not unreasonable to expect that, whatever incident may be responsible for the injuries to the workman, it is the duty of the State to see that that workman receives adequate medical attention. When my colleague, Deputy Dr. Maguire, and I introduced this Bill, we were not really personally concerned. We regard the provisions of the 1934 Act, under which the amount payable to a doctor was £5, as entirely inequitable and unjust.  We have been reliably informed that, when that Act was introduced in 1934&mdash;if I am wrong, the Minister will correct me&mdash;the insurance <Col N="592" /> companies said that such a provision would mean the raising of the premiums 20 per cent.  At any rate, the fact was that the doctors were very rarely paid £5.  It is no justification to this House that the Minister, or any Minister of State in this country, could come to this Dáil and state that because such a set of circumstances prevail in Northern Ireland or Great Britain they should prevail here also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see that, when it comes to an analysis of the £5.  It is no ground for even attempting to show how well off doctors were here to compare the conditions which prevail in Northern Ireland and Great Britain with those which prevail here.  It is well known that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland there is a large industrial community and that the circumstances which exist are not at all comparable with those which exist in our divided portion of the country.  The Minister said that he wanted to show how well off the doctors were because they got £5.  Suppose they got the maximum, suppose that after two years a doctor went to court, probably to give evidence.  Before going to court, he had to write a report for a solicitor and before doing so he had to attend the patient for any time from two months up to two years.  For all that, he gets the princely sum of £5.  If he does go to court and employs a solicitor, the solicitor will charge him at least £2 or £3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical profession do not desire that the humanitarian motives which inspire most of them to do their bit for the sick and the injured should in any way be curtailed or restricted. <Col N="593" /> They do think, however, that in present conditions it is not right for the State or for any authority to presume on the existence of these motives in order to satisfy the needs of something which the State itself should provide.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House any longer, nor do I wish to make any further comment on what the Minister has said.  Our Bill was not intended to be accepted in the manner which the Minister indicated.  If he said there was a ceiling, there was also a floor. There is nothing in the Bill which we introduced which would prevent a judge giving the smallest possible fee to a doctor but it did give to the judge the power of exercising equitably his judicial functions to state what in his view would be an equitable fee for attendance over a long period of time. The Bill, if it were passed, could be amended in such a way as to suit the desires of any Deputy desiring to put down an amendment but in view of what the Minister has said, that it is his intention to introduce a comprehensive social insurance scheme and that then an opportunity will be afforded to discuss this question of medical fees, I am quite prepared, so far as I am concerned, to withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill seeks to substitute a new section for Section 73 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.  It has been my experience, since the passing of the Act of 1934, that there is a rather serious defect in Section 73 which this particular Bill would remedy.  The position at present is that under Section 73, the £5 to which the workman's doctor is properly entitled in certain circumstances, has to be claimed by the doctor himself. It has certainly been my experience and the experience of many legal practitioners who have been appearing in workmen's compensation cases since 1934, that that is a rather unworkable provision.  This section does strike a new note, in this respect&mdash;that it differs from Section 73 by giving to the workman's counsel or solicitor the right to apply for the £5 in question. I think that is a matter which the Minister should consider when introducing <Col N="594" /> his new Bill.  If he consults anybody who has experience of these matters in the Circuit Courts where workmen's compensation cases are tried, he will find that what I am stating is absolutely correct.  Since the passing of the Act, in practically every one case out of three the £5 that is justly due to the workman's doctor as provided by the Act, is not received by the doctor by reason of his reluctance to get up in court and claim what is justly due to him.  The practice grew up of permitting the workman's solicitor to apply on behalf of the doctor, as if he were instructed to do so, for the £5 in question.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for that by giving the right to the medical practitioner or the workman's counsel or solicitor to make the application.  I think that it is not only in the interests of the doctor concerned but also very much in the interests of the workman that he should get the best medical attendance that is provided for and contemplated by the Act of 1934.  As the section stands at present, that intention is not properly carried out.  If the Minister in the Bill which he contemplates introducing, would keep that aspect of the matter in view, I feel certain that it would meet the wishes and desires of those who have considerable experience in those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to allow this opportunity to pass without giving my views as a member of the Bar who, like Deputy Sir John Esmonde, has appeared in these workmen's compensation cases from time to time.  I agree with both Deputy Dr. Maguire and Deputy Dr. Brennan that this is a matter that should be ventilated. As matters stand at present, medical practitioners who attend workmen have a considerable grievance and in that respect I agree that it is proper to have the matter ventilated in the House.  Nevertheless, I endorse the views of the Minister as to the effect which the Bill as proposed would have on the entire administration of the workmen's compensation code.  It is necessary, in a code such as the workmen's compensation code is, that some limit or ceiling should be placed on the fees to be charged.  It <Col N="595" /> is also necessary and proper that a discretion should be given to the court as to the allowing of any particular sum.  I feel that those two safeguards are reasonable and proper and, as the Bill proposes to do away with any limits and to make the allowances compulsory on the court, I feel it goes too far.  As a professional man myself, I certainly welcome the hope the Minister has held out that he would be prepared to consider favourably, either in another Bill or when the comprehensive scheme is introduced, the question of increasing the fee at present allowed to the workman's doctor.  I think that such an increase would not merely redress the doctors' grievance but that it is also a very necessary step in the interests of applicants for compensation because I do know that, particularly in country cases where the question often is as to whether there had been an accident or incapacity flowing from an accident and where the issue is very finely knit, the insurance company from time to time has the benefit, and certainly uses it, of the best medical advice and help, while the applicant endeavouring to establish his case may be restricted to services not so eminent.  I know that, of course, the question of witnesses' expenses or fees allowed for attendance in court is outside Section 73 and that such fees may be allowed by the court as part of the ordinary expenses of the case but the practice has now grown up amongst judges who feel the hardship on doctors of the £5 limit, of making some redress in the fee which they allow for attendance in court. That is straining both the rules of court and the practice but it is a straining which has been found necessary by reason of the statutory limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in the interests of workmen, in the interests of the code generally, some increase should be allowed in the fee.  I would suggest that an increase of 100 per cent. in the fee should be sanctioned in the coming legislation.  I think it is necessary to ensure that the workman will have the best of medical attention&mdash;not only attention to his injury or the treating of his incapacity but also attention in establishing his rights in court if they <Col N="596" /> are challenged or disputed.  Deputy Dr. P.J. Maguire and Deputy Dr. J. P. Brennan have rendered a considerable service in raising this matter and, in having obtained from the Minister, I shall not say the assurance, but the hope he held out to-night, they might well leave the matter as it is.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should refer to a statement made by Deputy Sir John Esmonde during the course of this debate.  I understand that under that portion of the new Circuit Court rules dealing with workmen's compensation, which rules were made under the last Courts of Justice Act, provision is made for the application by the applicant's solicitor or counsel for payment under Section 73.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, before the Deputy concludes, to mention one point which might be helpful.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde raised a point in regard to the provisions of Section 73 of the Act of 1934.  I think he gave the impression that a doctor had to employ a solicitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctor had to ask himself.  I am advised that the provisions in the section specifying that the application is to be made by the medical practitioner must be read with Rule 49 of the Circuit Court, Workmen's Compensation Rules of 1942, which provides that alternatively the application may be made by a solicitor on behalf of the medical practitioner or, with the practitioner's consent in writing, by the workman or by the workman's solicitor.  That seems to bring about a considerable simplification of the position which I think Deputy Sir John Esmonde thought was more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. P.J. Maguire Dr. P.J. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. P.J. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I appreciate the viewpoints expressed by Deputy Sir John Esmonde and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins. The Minister seems to have expressed no sympathy with our primary reason&mdash; I am sincere in that, our primary reason&mdash;which prompted us to bring in this Bill, namely, the manner in which Section 73 had been, shall I say, abused, misinterpreted, and irregularly administered in many Circuit Courts <Col N="597" /> throughout the country.  On numerous occasions medical practitioners, having attended a case for six months and perhaps for almost a year, were refused anything in the nature of remuneration for their services.  There is no denying that at all.  I assure the Minister and the House, on behalf of Deputy Dr. J.P. Brennan and myself, that we and all other members of the medical profession would resent any suggestion that we should avail of any improvement in a workman's compensation Act in order to better ourselves.  I hardly think there is any necessity for me to have mentioned that.</P>
      <P>The Minister alleged that the sky was the limit in this.  We had a limit on it, in making out this section.  However, it was decided&mdash;I think I was really responsible for this part of it&mdash; that instead of fixing a limit we would leave it, in view of our past experience, very safely in the hands of the judge to decide what remuneration we were entitled to, having regard to the period of reasonable medical attendance on the worker.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dr. Brennan has said, it is the duty of the State to provide adequate medical attention for the worker and to ensure his recovery and return to work as quickly as possible, and therefore the State should be responsible for medical fees.  I myself have had very few cases where three-figure expenses were incurred in connection with specialists.  The only specialists I have ever had on cases of that type were employed by the insurance company to contest the workman's claim in the court.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with the question of the doctor not being in a position to have a representative apply for his fee.  I was not aware that that has been amended, but I am glad to hear that it is.  In view of what the Minister has stated to the effect that he will give ample consideration to the views which we have expressed in this Bill&mdash;and I am sure that he will, in any future legislation he contemplates in connection with social services&mdash;I now withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that it is essential in the national interest that immediate action be taken to prevent a recurrence of flooding throughout the country and calls for a much more active and urgent implementation of the Arterial Drainage Acts.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down by Deputy Seán Collins and myself because, being Deputies who represent rural constituencies&mdash;like other Deputies representing rural constituencies&mdash;we appreciate that the drainage problem in this country is one of the gravest problems facing any Government and that it requires immediate and active and continuous attention.  It is surprising to learn that we have still in this country 1,500,000 acres of land which is subject to flooding.  We have still 1,500,000 acres of land which is lost to its owners and lost to the country from the point of view of production and the yielding of wealth.</P>
      <P>I put down this motion because I believe that the question of drainage, particularly arterial drainage, has not received the attention that it should have received.  That belief was based on my knowledge of the blatant neglect of this problem evidenced by the previous Administration.  I do not intend to waste the time of the House in discussing what the previous Government did or failed to do while they were in office but it is right to say that, whatever useful work they may have done in other spheres or whatever plans or schemes they may have had in mind, they gave no outward sign of concern for the drainage problem.  It is true that the Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945, with the support and assistance, I think, of all political Parties, but it was not put into operation, so far as the people could see, until June, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the years following 1945 the country suffered very considerably from flooding, particularly in the winter of 1946, with resultant hardship, damage, and injury to the agricultural industry.  It is not possible under any extensive scheme of drainage to deal <Col N="599" /> with abnormal flooding but it is possible to pursue a scheme of arterial drainage more actively than has been done in the past.  I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I know I am speaking to a man who is concerned about this problem and aware of the need for action&mdash;that in the last 26 years very little has been done to reclaim what I might describe as floodable land.  Some progress was made, particularly in the years prior to 1932, but in the last 16 years very little has been done.  The problem has now become part and parcel of the drive for greater production in agriculture and in other spheres of our economic life.  We can only get that production if we use every acre of land and that is possible only by proper drainage and reclamation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the powers at present available to the Government are sufficient for dealing with this problem. Under the 1945 Act, the old drainage boards and drainage districts were abolished and their particular powers and functions transferred to the county councils.  Power was given under the Act for arterial drainage in catchment areas of particular rivers. That Act is now seeing its first application in the drainage of the River Brosna in my constituency, but one is forced to the conclusion that the drainage problem cannot be dealt with exclusively by arterial drainage in a catchment area.  There are problems in each county and in each constituency which are too small for the arterial drainage programme, so small that their place in the programme would mean that they would be attended to in, perhaps, ten or 12 years.  Yet these particular problems or difficulties may be of such magnitude as to be outside the scope of any special employment scheme.  They are too small for one and too big for the other.  If the powers of the Government remain as they are at present, problems such as these will not be attended to until they are dealt with under the arterial drainage programme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any Government that is satisfied with a situation like that&mdash;as the previous Government was &mdash;is a Government which is serious <Col N="600" /> about tackling the drainage problem. I welcome the assurances given in the last week or so and in this House last night by the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that arrangements will be made to tackle what I would call the in-between drainage problem.  I am not concerned as to how that is done but I am concerned to see that it is done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal that in each county council area provision will be made for the draining and maintenance of rivers and waterways by the county council engineer at the expense of the Central Fund.  Apart altogether from the employment that such a proposal will give, it will mean material improvement of rural areas that have been flooded in recent winters as a result of badly maintained and neglected rivers and waterways.</P>
    <P>If I were to conclude without mentioning the pet problem in my constituency of Knockbarron, I could scarcely go back to my constituents. In one particular area in my constituency near Kinnity there is a local drainage problem because a particular river has become completely choked and has changed its course to run along a public road, flooding the land of some seven or eight farmers, depriving the people of the locality of a public road and causing considerable hardship and damage.  That particular river, known as the Camcor, at Knockbarron, will be reached on the arterial drainage programme, I understand, in a period of some ten or 12 years.  It has been flooding the lands of the people of Knockbarron and the surrounding district for the past four years.  I do not know what was done before, but I have raised the question of getting some work done with the county council, who stated: &ldquo;It is no concern of ours. There is no drainage district surrounding this particular river and it is not vested in us.&rdquo;  I have raised it with the special employment scheme office and they, of course, very properly stated that the work involved is too great to be undertaken by them.  I have raised it with the Land Commission, who also have declined responsibility. I have raised it in this House with the Minister for Local Government <Col N="601" /> and pointed out to him that, as a result of the flooding, a road has ceased to be usable.  Again I was told that it was no concern of his Department.</P>
    <P>I am certain that there are many similar drainage problems and I just instance that as a case where, by reason of lack of unified responsibility, lack of powers and, to use a Civil Service phrase, lack of functions, a problem will not be attended to.  I am glad that now, apparently, powers which were lacking in the past are going to be taken by the Government. I hope that when these powers are taken problems such as the one I have mentioned in Knockbarron and others in areas in my constituency which I could mention, will receive the immediate attention of the Parliamentary Secretary or whatever officer of the Government will be carrying out this programme.  I emphasise to the Parliamentary Secretary that this problem needs active and continuous attention.  It would be a serious crime if, after the experience of the winter of 1946, we were to have in any part of this country again flooding of such a sustained nature extending over a period of three or four weeks by reason of the neglect of drainage in the past. It would be a serious thing if, after that experience, a repetition should occur next winter or any coming winter.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this problem and I trust that when these new powers have been taken the problem will be followed up and dealt with extensively.</P>
    <P>The need for drainage is not localised in any part of the country.  In Kerry they have their own particular problem, and in Cork, in the West, and in the Midlands the problem is acute and damage, hardship and injury have been caused in the past.  I hope that the problem will now be one of prime concern to this Government.  It was one of the matters which had its place in the ten-point programme upon which this Government was formed and I hope that in the coming six or eight months we shall see real progress made towards the solving of our local drainage problems.  Drainage is a problem <Col N="602" /> which needs immediate action and I hope that at the end of this debate or during it we shall hear from the Parliamentary Secretary his plan and policy for the coming 12 months and that we shall see in our constituencies practical evidence that that policy and plan are being carried out.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the Deputy who has spoken, because in Bridgetown in my constituency when heavy rain comes serious flooding is caused.  In the Macamores district serious damage is caused to farmers who cannot get to their land.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that something is done in these areas.  It is all very well to start drainage work in Leix and Offaly, but the work ought to be spread out so as to help farmers in other areas who suffer from damage to their land and loss of cattle.  Since I became a Deputy I have heard a lot of talk in this House about drainage work. There has been talk about it since 1943, but very little drainage has been done.  The previous Government made a start at drainage work.  Since this Government came into office machinery has been brought in and drainage work put into operation in Leix and Offaly. We are glad to know that a start has been made, but in every constituency where flooding is doing damage to land and property it is the duty of whatever Government is in power to go ahead with the work and not sit down on the job as the Fianna Fáil Government sat down on it for 16 years.  The reason why Kilkenny and other places were flooded is that nothing was done.  We hear talk about the promises which this Government and the last Government made and some people on the far side call us a popular front, but I am glad to say that we have done something. I must congratulate the Departments and the Parliamentary Secretaries for the efforts which have been made. Deputy Killilea may smile over there.</P>

      <P>We are doing something and that cannot be denied.  Let that progress go on.  For the past few years with every flood we had, all the Deputies in the House from Wicklow to Tipperary put down questions about the loss of cattle, sheep and produce on the land under the floods.  The reason was that the scheme was inactive for so long.  No scheme was put into operation&mdash;it was on the Order Paper all right, but it remained there.  Now a start has been made in Deputy O'Higgins' constituency which is giving good employment.  Let that progress be continued.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the points I have made for the people I represent in Wexford, where floods have taken place, where whole areas in Macamores were flooded for want of drainage.  I will ask him to give consideration to those points and do something in our area as has been done in Laoighis-Offaly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to hear from the benches opposite that the problem of drainage is, after all, a serious one.  We were told when they were in opposition that even the drainage of the Shannon was a simple operation.  I remember listening to the present Minister for Defence, who at that time represented an area that was, and is, suffering as a result of lack of drainage, stating in this House that enough men left one small village in his constituency at the confluence of the Brosna and the Shannon to drain these rivers.  Nothing, I think, could be worse than to hold out false hopes to the people of the country that drainage is a problem which can be solved overnight. I appreciate the difficulties confronting the Parliamentary Secretary and I would be honest enough at least to admit they are there, for I know something of the problems which he has to face.  They are not simple and they will not be easily overcome because, if you take the broader view of this problem and not a mere narrow parochial outlook, the principal artery of this country is the Shannon.  I would like some of the people on the opposite benches to tell me how the Shannon is going to be drained in a short time or how it is going to be easily drained. <Col N="604" /> Whether for good or for ill, the establishment of the Shannon scheme put a barrier to the drainage of the Shannon. The fall in the water from the time it leaves Lough Allen until it reaches Killaloe, a distance of 111 miles&mdash;I forget the exact distance but it exceeds 100 miles&mdash;is only 11 feet.  When you tackle the drainage of that river and its tributaries, as is being done on one of its tributaries at the present time, and continue that work, you can see the difficulties that lie ahead.  In time of severe flooding, such as that referred to by Deputy O'Higgins which occurred during the winter of 1946-47, you will have a huge increase in the volume of water flowing into the Shannon.  Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, incidentally, that the area of land liable to flooding in this country was something like 1,500,000 acres, but he did not mention how much of that area lies in close proximity to the Shannon.  It would be interesting to know&mdash;and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give us the figures&mdash; exactly what area of the country is flooded by the Shannon and its tributaries, because that is the really big problem in the drainage of this country.</P>
      <P>We were told that nothing had been done by the previous Government, forgetful of the fact that all the whistle-blowing that took place in June could not have taken place were it not for the preparations which had been made for the drainage of the Brosna.  It was ready for implementation not in June but in April, 1948, and as a result of the change of Government or of some other crux that arose subsequently it was deferred from April to June.  There has been no addition to the number of schemes which have been undertaken. Three other schemes were ready, for instance, the Glyde and Dee.  Twelve months have elapsed and there has been no question from the opposite benches as to the delays which prevented the implementation of that scheme.</P>

As far as I am aware, there has been no great addition to the solution of the drainage problem since then.  I hope there will be and the more success that attends the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary the better we will all be pleased.  The scheme which is under way at the moment is estimated to cost £1,080,000.  That is only for a tributary of the Shannon and there are several such tributaries.  That in itself should make Deputies understand that this problem of national drainage is not a small one and that it will take the best efforts of our engineers and the best engineers that can be had.  One of the problems which the Parliamentary Secretary will have to cope with is engineers.</P>

      <P>Again I repeat that I did not interrupt the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There are many other problems, not, perhaps, of as great dimensions as those of the Shannon, in every constituency and in every county in Ireland. Even in my own constituency, Clare, there are several rivers which come within the category of &ldquo;in between rivers.&rdquo;  They are not considered sufficiently large to be made the subject of a drainage scheme under the 1945 Act and they are too big a problem to be brought into a minor relief scheme or any of the other schemes which have been in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> This problem of drainage has been with us for a good many years, despite all the prophetic utterances that we used to have from Deputies on the opposite side of the House.  I could very easily get up here and say to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;Hurry up with the job; it is an easy one; you will have no difficulty in dealing with it; all you have to do is to blow another whistle and you will have it all settled in a couple of years.&rdquo;  But, I suggest, it will take a good deal of whistling before a quarter of the rivers that are flooding the land of this country are drained.  I appreciate the necessity there is for drainage.  There is a lot of talk at the moment about the reclamation of waste land and of bringing it back into productivity.  I fully realise that you cannot bring land into productivity while it is water-logged. The first essential towards the reclamation of waste land that is liable to flooding&mdash;some of these lands incidentally, are carrying a very high valuation &mdash;is drainage.  The drainage of waste land, and even field drainage, depends for its success on the water on these fields being able to get away into the rivers and, ultimately, into the sea.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to speed up drainage in the future.  He has an advantage which, at all events, the Fianna Fáil Government had not.  He has machinery available to him now which was unobtainable during the war years.  We tried by every means in our power to obtain the necessary machinery, but during the emergency it was not possible to get it.  Now that there is an improvement in that direction, I hope he will be able to get all the machinery that he requires and that he will not hesitate to purchase whatever machinery is necessary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to Deputies on all sides of the House not to try to minimise the importance of this very difficult problem for, as I say, nothing could be worse for our people than to leave them under the illusion that this problem of drainage is a simple one.  For instance, the Minister for Defence told us on one occasion that a few men from the little village of Brosna could drain the Brosna into <Col N="607" /> the Shannon.  The Deputy almost left me under the impression that he could drain the Shannon with his stethoscope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion.  I congratulate Deputy O'Grady on the tone of his speech in which he appealed to Deputies on all sides to help the Parliamentary Secretary to make this drainage question a success.  There is no doubt whatever that, owing to the lack of drainage, large tracts of land are going to waste. They are producing nothing owing to the fact that they are water-logged. There seems to be no immediate hope of the water being taken off those lands.  In fact, I think the acreage of land wasted in that way has been on the increase during the last number of years.  In my opinion it will require the active support and co-operation of all concerned, including the farmers, if the intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to this drainage question are to be crowned with the success which, we all hope, he will be able to achieve.</P>
      <P>I know that in the county I represent schemes for the drainage of land there have been held up during the last six or seven years.  If it had been possible to carry them out they would have brought great advantage to the county.  I know, of course, the difficulties which confronted the then Parliamentary Secretary.  There was the lack of machinery during the war years.  We in Louth did not pillory him in the House because we knew the circumstances that existed at the time. We were prepared to wait until better times would enable the Board of Works to carry out these necessary works.  I want to refer particularly to the deepening and widening of the River Glyde.  I understand that work has been on the stocks for some considerable time, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to get it under way as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Grady as to the difficulties which confront anybody who is concerned with the drainage of land or the deepening or widening of rivers.  Water is a very fickle thing. In the past it has baffled engineers of very high standing, and it certainly can <Col N="608" /> be said that drainage is not the very simple matter that some people seem to imagine.  It calls for the exercise of patience and foresight, and those responsible must ensure that plans are well laid before work is undertaken.  It is work that requires time and money, and, above and beyond all, it calls for the goodwill and co-operation of the people.  In that connection, I think the Deputies can play a most important part, each in his own district, by bringing before the people the drainage schemes that in their opinion are essential for the draining of the land in their areas.  They should point out to the people that it is their duty as well as in their own interest to co-operate to the fullest extent in the steps that may be taken by the Parliamentary Secretary for the drainage of the land of the country.  The execution of drainage works creates not only employment but brings great prosperity to the people because it has the effect of increasing beyond measure the productivity of land that otherwise would be wasted.  I hope that the efforts of the Parliamentary Secretary, aided by his officials and supported by the co-operation of all concerned, will be crowned with success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to one particular problem which has arisen in the County Kildare and which, possibly, has also arisen in other constituencies.  As everybody knows, we have in Kildare a very big expanse of bog.  That expanse was, to some extent, drained during the period of the emergency to assist in providing a fuel supply for the City of Dublin; but the drainage that was carried out by Bord na Móna in the Bog of Allen has created for the farmers living in the area of the bog a new problem.  Prior to that, the situation was that when, in the ordinary course, we had a heavy rainfall, the bog acted as a sort of sponge.  It held the water until it actually came down off the bog and went into the Rathangan River, or the Barrow in the south, or the Blackwater or Boyne in the north.  Now, however, the situation is, as a consequence of drainage done from Rathangan to Edenderry and across to Timahoe by Bord na Móna, that the sponge <Col N="609" /> that was there no longer operates as a sponge, so that when we get a heavy rainfall the water over a large area of the bog rushes straight down and floods very large parts of the land surrounding the verge of the bog, parts which heretofore were never subject to flooding. It is a new problem, therefore, to that extent.  It is a problem which will have to be tackled and tackled fairly soon if substantial damage is not going to be done.  I agree for once with Deputy O'Grady that the whole problem of drainage is a difficult one, but it is a problem that has got to be tackled with energy, foresight and imagination. Unless it is tackled in that way we are going to arrive at the situation where though we may be improving the drainage in one particular area we travel so slowly that by the time we come to the next area the full benefits of the first may have gone.  Therefore, I am very glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government as a whole are tackling in a substantial way the problem of drainage throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We have in North Leinster in particular the big problem of the Boyne. Not merely does the Boyne flood a great deal of land on its own but its tributaries do substantial damage in addition.  Particularly in my constituency the Blackwater renders a very large part of the North Kildare land almost unproductive, certainly not anything like as productive as it should be.  As I said in the beginning, that problem has been gravely accentuated and influenced by the draining of bogs by Bord na Móna as the result of which not merely has the water which used to be soaked up like a sponge come off the bogs but it has thrown silt into the Blackwater and the Boyne in a way that was never known before. I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, to take early steps either on his own account or in conjunction with Bord na Móna to deal with this problem.  The people in those areas have been put in the position in which they now find themselves as a direct result of Governmental action in the matter of fuel provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady mentioned the Electricity Supply Board plant at <Col N="610" /> Killaloe and the effect that it was having on the Shannon reach.  I gathered from him that as far as drainage was concerned he thought it was a pity that there was a hydro-electric works there.  It is only fair that I should say in that respect that our experience in regard to the Liffey reservoir in Kildare is exactly the reverse.  Prior to the set-up in Poulaphouca there were substantial areas that used to flood along the lower reaches of the Liffey.  Since the hydro-electric station was set up on the borders of Kildare and Wicklow there has been no evidence of that flooding. Therefore, in that one instance there certainly has been an easement of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the House during the course of the emergency I seem to remember somewhere about the beginning of the compulsory tillage scheme a statement made by the Minister at that time that we had lost something like 1,000,000 acres of arable land.  I think it is acceptable without question that the loss there was on the previous consideration of the problem about 25 years before, had largely arisen from lack of drainage, through old drains silting up and through arterial drains not being attended to.  That alone should make the problem that has to be faced quite clear to us.  It is the only way in which we can adequately ensure that there will be greater productivity from our land on a really large scale as apart from the land already in operation.  The reclamation of large areas will assist very substantially in settling more people on the land and it will without question bring greater wealth to much of the rural areas around.  I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure in the time that lies ahead that there will be real, active and energetic steps taken in regard to this whole matter.  If he continues in the same way as during the last 12 months, regardless of whether the plans were made by the Fianna Fáil Government before or the Parliamentary Secretary now, the results under his aegis and the Board of Works will be such that we shall be able to come along here in a few years time and say that we have been able to reclaim a substantial <Col N="611" /> proportion of land that was previously not arable.  In addition we shall have been able to make the life of those living in the flooded areas more congenial for them to earn their living on their own land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all in agreement in this House that the major problem facing us is that of drainage.  No matter how much we talk about agriculture and productivity of the land we can never hope to have that productivity until the land is drained.  The first time I spoke here on the Estimate of the Board of Works on drainage I said that I considered the Board of Works should &ldquo;get the works&rdquo;.  I have not changed my views on that in any way.  The main reason why I want to speak here to-night is to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government that our Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party, insist that this problem should be faced in a workman-like manner.  Any question of finance or of cheese-paring cannot and will not be allowed to enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago to carry out a certain scheme on the Shannon.  I asked him whether it would be possible to open the sluice gates at Banagher in order to relieve the summer flooding.  I had made previous representations on that matter and so had other Deputies.  As a matter of fact it has been going on for years.  The board gave the answer that the opening of those sluice gates would not affect the flooding in the region above it at all.  However, the people living in the area told me that the flooding would be reduced and I pointed that out to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I said that it was the Board of Works' word against the peoples'. I should like to have a record here that when the pressure was brought to bear the Parliamentary Secretary agreed to give a trial to this matter of opening the sluice gates.  As a result of that trial numerous people in the surrounding areas have written to me saying that it had been of immense value to them during the summer period when they wanted to get their hay in.  That is a typical example of what the &ldquo;new <Col N="612" /> look&rdquo; can do if a man is prepared to face up to his work.  With all due respect to the experts' opinion, even in a case like that it was better to satisfy the people locally and show them one way or the other whether it could be done or not.  In that particular instance it could be done and I should like to have that placed on record.  I hope that during his term of office the Parliamentary Secretary will show the same outlook towards the drainage problem as he showed in that particular item which I put before him.  I can assure him that, as far as Deputies of our Party throughout the country are concerned, anything we can do to help him in this matter we shall be only too glad to do.</P>
    <P>I could be very sore about this problem because I come from an area that is flooded for seven or eight months of the year.  I could give a long list of the faults of Fianna Fáil and deal with their lack of attention, when in office, to this drainage problem.  I do not want to do that.  I want to see this Government tackling the drainage problem in a thoroughly workman-like manner.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does that, he will have the thanks not alone of this Government, but even of the supporters of Fianna Fáil, whom it concerns just as much.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the speeches on this motion have been so brief and I thank the Deputies who have spoken. I am one of those who believe that it is not talk that will help us in this matter.  I believe it is hard work from our engineers and experts.  I hope, with the exception of the statement we have had from Deputy O'Grady, that the House will endeavour to keep this matter of drainage above politics.  To all of us, no matter on what side of the House we sit, and to the people outside, drainage is an important matter and it would be a bad thing for us if we tried to score political points off one another in relation to something that is so vital as drainage.  I hope it will be kept on that plane by any speakers who follow me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one statement made by Deputy O'Grady to which I must refer. He mentioned the blowing of a whistle <Col N="613" /> and he wanted to make little of the start on the first of our great arterial drainage schemes.  If he wants to belittle it, he can do so, but I may tell him that his statement that that scheme was ready to start in April is not correct.  What could I start it with last April?  Was it with a few rusty excavators, 20 years old, and out of commission?  Could I have started the scheme with them?  Certainly not.  I had to wait until some of those were repaired and until I could purchase other machinery.  That is the reason why the scheme was not started in April.  The machinery with which to start it was not there.</P>
    <P>The Deputy stated that the Glyde and Dee scheme was prepared a year ago.  It is not finished yet.  According to the Act, the Glyde and Dee scheme has to be exhibited, and that will mean a delay of a few months more.  I can assure the House that if we could go forward with it to-morrow morning, we would gladly do so.  The moment the scheme is prepared we will go ahead with it.  The same thing applies to another scheme now under survey.  The survey is nearly complete. There is the field catchment area taking in the Brick and Cashen in South Kerry.  That is also nearly complete. I hope within a short time that we will have at least three major drainage schemes in operation.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there is no one as interested in having drainage carried out as I am.  There is no use in my saying that I am satisfied with the progress at the moment.  I am not.  Any man who has the responsibility of getting this work done placed on his shoulders and who knows that there are over 1,000,000 acres subject to flooding, cannot be satisfied no matter what progress is being made. He must feel that there is a danger that he will be dead and gone before all the land is fully restored to our people.  Every man with any sense of responsibility realises that the sooner that land is brought back to fertility the better for the people.</P>
    <P>Even if I am not satisfied with the progress made, I fail to see who can be blamed.  I cannot blame the commissioners, the officers of the Board of <Col N="614" /> Works; I cannot blame the engineering department and I cannot blame the workers where we have schemes in operation.  They are all doing their best, and still I do not feel satisfied, no matter how fast we move in the direction of having the job done.  I would not feel satisfied even if it were possible for us to have ten major schemes in operation.  I fully realised, when the Taoiseach asked me to take charge of the Board of Works, he did it with the intention that drainage should be my main object.  I fully realise the responsibility I have taken over.</P>
    <P>When a motion like this is put down, it often occurs to a person to come to the conclusion that some members of the House must feel he is not doing his duty, is not moving fast enough.  I looked up the records and I found that this motion was put down at the end of February last.  It is my duty to make clear what has been done since last February.  I am not going to criticise what was done before then.  I have no doubt that as far as the outgoing Parliamentary Secretary is concerned he was probably doing his best, and so was the man there before him.</P>
    <P>I have looked up the records and I find that Deputy Smith was also interested in this problem.  I may as well be honest about it, that, even though any of you might think quite differently, the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was a godsend to this country. I say that, having been in the office for the past 12 months, an office where we have got 100 years' experience of drainage at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that we had piecemeal drainage carried on in this country.  Any amount of money was spent in the past on piecemeal drainage. On looking up the records in the Board of Works one finds that very often after thousands of pounds had been spent on a scheme people complained that the cure was worse than the disease.  Such drainage has proved of no advantage whatsoever.</P>
    <P>A drainage commission was set up ultimately and on their report and recommendations the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was passed unanimously by this House.  That Act provided that <Col N="615" /> drainage should be done in catchment areas and that such drainage should be maintained.  They recommended that there should be no piecemeal drainage of any kind.  Everybody knows that when a cup is full you cannot put more liquid into it.  With piecemeal drainage in operation certain portions of rivers were drained. Those certain portions had no outfall and the result was that such drainage proved for the most part a costly failure.  The Drainage Commission recommended that drainage operations should begin at the outfall and that the whole catchment area should be completely surveyed.  Only under such circumstances could drainage be a success.  The Brosna has abundantly demonstrated the proof of that.  The next important recommendation was that drainage should be maintained. Rivers are like roads.  If you construct a road and then ignore it for ten or 15 years you find at the end of that time that the road, however well constructed in the beginning, is impassable. Something similar happens in the case of drainage.  A drainage scheme which is not maintained has no utility.  It deteriorates day by day. Piecemeal drainage which is not maintained must be a complete failure.</P>
    <P>No matter how slowly we may move in implementing the Act of 1945, our progress is sure.  Arterial drainage must of its very nature be slow.  In the first place a complete survey must be carried out; the area must be mapped and all the regulations governing drainage must be carried out.  Once that is done success, so far as our engineers in the Board of Works are concerned, is guaranteed.  Even if work is slow the fact that its success is guaranteed must in a large measure outweigh its apparent slowness.  At the moment we are in process of building up.  We are in a situation something like that of a building contractor. When a building contractor starts a scheme he has first of all to assemble his machinery and materials. The first ten houses will be slow but, once the organisation is there, the work will go on more and more rapidly.  We are doing something like that in relation to drainage.  We are building up. <Col N="616" /> As soon as we have our plans, our machinery and our material we shall move faster and faster.</P>
    <P>There are, roughly, 100 catchment areas in the country.  Deputy O'Grady said that I deserved sympathy. That may be true, but whether I shall get it is another matter.  We have now started arterial drainage and all over the country people in the different catchment areas are demanding that we should do their area first although for many years, when no drainage at all was being done, there was not a word heard. Now they are crying out that their area be done immediately.  But we cannot proceed like that.  The Drainage Commission laid down a certain priority list.  On that list the Brosna was number one.  Then there was the Glyde and Dee, the Feale catchment area in Kerry and the Brick and Cashin.  They laid it down that those were the most important schemes.  It is our intention to proceed along the lines they recommend.  We feel that in certain areas we may not recover as good land as might be anticipated but to those areas where people are subject to flooding in their homes we shall also turn our attention.  In that direction we have at the moment on hands a survey of the Corrib.  That is the most difficult scheme we have yet tackled because the catchment area covers over 1,200 square miles.  It comprises the reclamation of 300 or 400 acres of land and includes important tributaries and an area around Lough Corrib and on to Ballyhaunis and Roscommon.  When I went into the Board of Works I thought it desirable that we should do some drainage work in that particular area.  It is because of that that we are now engaged on a survey of the Corrib. The Glyde and Dee scheme is almost ready except for the exhibition of the scheme.  The Brick and Cashin scheme is well on the way to preparation. There is a fourth scheme under survey. I expect that in the near future we shall have three of them working simultaneously.  In this respect I should like to remind the House that it is not possible to carry out a survey to-day and start work within a month or even a year.  Even if we had all the <Col N="617" /> machinery necessary it would still be impossible to carry out work with that degree of rapidity.</P>
    <P>The Brosna is a huge scheme.  A survey had to be made of the entire catchment area&mdash;an area comprising 500 square miles.  That survey commenced in August, 1942, and all the available drainage engineers in the Office of Public Works were engaged on that until the summer of 1944.  More than 530 miles of rivers, streams and drains and an area of about 95,000 acres of land and bog had to be examined in detail.  The Brosna scheme entails interference with the water-rights of no less than 34 mills and two distilleries.  It interferes with the water system of a few towns and villages.  It entails the building, reconstruction and underpinning of 400 bridges.  Coupled with that there is some minor interference with two private properties.  Now the Brosna is not one of our larger schemes though it is an important one.  Yet it has taken years to do that much work on it.  We are working on it now.  We feel, however, that surveys must be carried out more quickly.  For one thing we are now getting machinery more quickly than we thought we would.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute now to our Minister for Finance.  He fully appreciates the necessity for this work and, as far as I am concerned, the purse is always open.  Any money that is required for drainage to reclaim more than 1,000,000 acres of our land is willingly and readily given.  Because of the magnificent co-operation I am getting from the Minister for Finance I must take full responsibility if the work is not carried out with desirable rapidity. If the work is not done satisfactorily then it is upon my shoulders the blame must lie.  Since this Government came into office, we have purchased £250,000 worth of machinery and brought it into this country.  We have more on order and in the near future the board will be meeting again to discuss getting more machinery.  At the moment, we have on the Brosna some excavators weighing 60 tons, machines which can take up in one <Col N="618" /> bucket two tons from the bottom of the River Brosna.  We are doing there roughly the work of 4,500 men per day in manual labour.  As the House will realise, when we have three schemes going together, as I hope we will, so that work of that description can be carried on, we may hope to see the day when the work will eventually be completed.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that, so far as I am concerned and so far as the commissioners and the engineering staff are concerned, they are pushing an open door in asking us to speed up drainage work.  We intend to double, and, if possible, to treble, our survey gangs for the coming year and in the near future we shall be in the market for engineers.  Drainage, however, is a rather strange problem and every engineer is not suitable.  Many of the engineers we take on, we have to train, and it takes some years before an engineer becomes equipped sufficiently to be of value to us.  In the near future, however, we hope to put these engineers on a solid established footing so that we will get men, good young engineers, who are willing to devote their lives to this very necessary work. In the past few months, I found a certain amount of trouble in the Board of Works, in this respect, that people were not being patient.  I felt that the 1945 Act was to a certain extent a hindrance, because the moment that Act came into operation it prevented county councils, the Board of Works or any other body from interfering in certain repair works and drainage works.  For instance, when the Act became law a county council was not entitled to remove obstacles from a river&mdash;obstacles such as a tree which had fallen across a river or silting which had taken place under bridges.</P>

      <P>A deputation came to me from the county councils, and, realising the terrible gap between our Arterial Drainage Act and work of that description&mdash;work which probably could be carried out by our Special Employments Schemes Office&mdash;I made a recommendation to the Minister for Local Government, which, as he announced here last night, I am glad to say, has been accepted by the Government, that, for the future, local authorities should be given authority to get their engineers to carry out schemes for the removal of such obstacles and that full cost grants should be given by his Department.  I am glad that that recommendation has been accepted, because in many cases these obstructions were becoming worse and worse and doing harm further upstream.  There was a great cry for us to go in there, but for years it was not possible for us to go into some of these catchment areas.  I believe that this move is a move in the right direction and I believe it will ease quite a lot of the flooding which took place last December and November, following the heavy rainfall.</P>

      <P>The Minister told you that last night.  These are a few of the things I want to put before the House with regard to the way we are working and what our views are.  I can assure the House that the great interest of the Board of Works is drainage particularly. We are doing our best in every possible way and it is our hope to go forward as quickly as possible.  As I said, drainage is not a matter on which the different sides of the House should attempt to score political points.  It is not worth while for either of us to do so.  Deputy Killilea and I come from an area where there are different political viewpoints, but it is an area where, regardless of those different political viewpoints, we realise the great necessity for drainage work, and in putting forward this motion Deputies are, as I say, pushing an <Col N="620" /> open door.  I know that the motion has not been put down as a vote of censure.  I am sure that the mover and seconder of the motion, realising the work we have done and the way in which we are trying to do it, will feel satisfied and will withdraw the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I found myself in substantial agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary in his defence of the general drainage plan, recommended to the Government by the Drainage Commission, on which the 1945 Act is based.  I was, in fact, in doubt as to whether the Parliamentary Secretary would deal with another aspect of drainage about which there has been some fairly loose talk in these last few days, in the hope that he might at least clear my mind as to the Government's intention in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>When I came to this House some time in 1945 with the Drainage Bill, as it then was, the one thing I found during the course of the discussion was this.  I am not going to trouble Deputies by referring to the records, but I suggest that those who are interested should go back and have a look at the records, to get a picture of the criticism that was levelled against me as the person responsible for recommending these proposals for legislation, not only in this House but in the Seanad.  I am not now saying, nor did I say then, that I had any objection to a person being critical as to the powers that I sought in that Bill.  The peculiar thing is that those who were critical&mdash;and so critical that they described these powers as dictatorial&mdash;are now coming along and suggesting to the House and to the country that the 1945 Drainage Act was, as the Parliamentary Secretary has described it, whether he intended to do so or not in his concluding remarks, obstructive in dealing with certain problems.  I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary did not see fit to give us some fairly clear indication of what this three-line Bill is going to be like, which will empower county councils, we are told, to enter upon lands and carry out all necessary functions so as to effect improvement in the drainage condition of those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> I will tell the House a little of my experience while I was in the Office of Public Works.  Just like the Parliamentary Secretary, I am not a technical person in these matters.  When you go into an office of that kind, you go in, of course, with respect for people who have technical training and technical knowledge; but at the same time you go in with a certain amount of suspicion.  I had been, I suppose, like the Parliamentary Secretary, associated with local bodies for many years and I had watched these technical people, engineers and others.  They were often right, of course; they were often wrong; they were often faulty in their judgment and they often bewildered me as a layman as to the extent that I should rely upon the advice and guidance which they tendered to me on problems with which I had to deal.  When I went into the office of the present Parliamentary Secretary, I had that sort of idea at the back of my mind and every time a case came before me where it was suggested by those technical people that if even a minor drainage scheme were carried out in some particular area, costing maybe from £100 to £500, damage would be done to somebody down the stream, I hesitated to believe that in many cases, because it was not a thing I wanted to believe.  I had to come before this House with an Estimate every year and I was sure to be attacked by Deputies on all sides&mdash; just as much on the side of the Government, if not in the House, certainly outside it, and sometimes in the House, too.  There were people interested in the production of turf, or specially interested in good meadowland, or in rescuing land from water in areas where the farms were small, and so on.</P>
    <P>As I say, I was naturally hesitant to accept the advice of those technical people when they informed me that harm would be done by the execution of such works.  I want to make this admission to the House, that I held that doubt so firmly that, in a number. of cases, I actually gave a direction that the works should be carried out&mdash; because it was not clear to me that what was feared would transpire.  And I do openly here admit that I have positive evidence now, evidence that I <Col N="622" /> can gather with my own two eyes any winter's day I like, that the advice given by those technical people, which I did not act upon, was sound and correct. The Drainage Commission was, after all, composed of many men, whose names I cannot give now, who had both a technical and a practical idea of the drainage problems of this country.  When they in their report suggested that piecemeal drainage was a dangerous proposition, however much I might dislike that in a sense that it would obstruct the carrying out of a certain type of work that might appear to be useful in a particular district, I must admit that it was sound.  Is it any wonder, then, that I should express my disappointment that I have not heard more about the way in which this Dáil is, in a three-line Bill, to give to local bodies the necessary power that will enable them to tackle this problem&mdash;which is described by Deputy O'Higgins in moving this motion as &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; drainage work?  I must confess that I have no idea of what the mover of this motion had in mind when using that term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy an illustration of why I am somewhat puzzled by the term &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; drainage work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to have some land situate in a district that separates two catchment areas.  As a matter of fact the water from this land flows into two catchments.  I can stand there and look at a stream flowing towards the Erne. I can turn to the right and see a small stream&mdash;in both cases the streams are very small and very insignificant&mdash; flowing towards the Boyne.  Now it is possible to determine to the fraction of an inch where the Boyne water starts from my farm and where the Erne stream commences.  I make this point and I have proven it from that very farm.  I shall tell you why I have proven it.  I have also land situated along the bed of the Anna Lee which is a very large contributory to the Erne catchment.  I know that schemes that have been carried out for the last 20 years in the areas that separate the <Col N="623" /> Erne catchment from the Boyne, have resulted in enabling the water to move more quickly down to the main artery and, as a result of the speed of the movement of the water, because of the small drainage work carried out there, I find that the land along the Anna Lee, which is the main tributary of the Erne, is flooded much more frequently and to a greater extent, and the roads in the district are covered with water much more often than they were ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>I am not, as I say, a technical person but I have been interested in this problem just as every countryman has for many years.  I have no complaint to offer on the score of the views put forward by Deputy O'Higgins because, after all, I could not, in fairness, expect him to have a practical man's view of the difficulties of this problem but these difficulties I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary are there.  He or the Government, to-morrow or in four or five or six months' time can introduce legislation that will give authority to local bodies, as he says, to clean and remove obstructions, say in the Anna Lee, but they will find themselves up against a very big problem.  I do not know so much about the condition of other rivers but I speak from a knowledge of the river in my own district and the picture I have in mind of that river, and I know it is not far different from the conditions in which you will find any similar artery in the country.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday&mdash;I do not want to deal with this matter in the sense of going back over the debate that took place yesterday&mdash;in all genuine sincerity, how local authorities were going to deal with this problem.  I mentioned machinery.  I had not in mind the type of machinery that has been acquired by the Board of Works for the execution of major drainage under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945, but I had in mind the necessity for some machinery because the river I have in mind could not be dealt with by the local authority in the manner described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If the smaller in-between rivers <Col N="624" /> that I know Deputy O'Higgins has in mind, are dealt with without dealing with the Anna Lee, then I may leave the district.</P>

      <P>Deputy Giles should not be so unmannerly.  I am surprised that he would not be more kindly disposed towards a neighbour.  All I am looking for is information.  We were assured by the mover of the motion that a certain approach was being made to the problem.  If that is so, I am glad to hear it.  As a practical man with a practical man's knowledge, I should like to be told just how this problem is going to be tackled.  I will admit that when the Arterial Drainage Act was being prepared, I was conscious of, and could see, the difficulties associated with large tracts of river that were never included in any drainage district.  I could see the appalling condition in which many of these rivers were.  It certainly baffled my mind and the minds of those whose advice I sought at the time as to how that problem could be tackled.  Whether you believe me or not, I was as anxious to find a solution to the problem as anybody else.  That is the mildest way in which I can put it.  I cannot say that anything I have heard since this debate was initiated, or anything that I heard yesterday, has convinced me in that respect.  I am being led to believe that these powers are going to be taken in a further Bill but I should like to assure the House that farmers have certain rights.  If, for example, you are going to take powers in this House to enable drainage work of the in-between type which Deputy O'Higgins has in mind to be carried out, and to drain this water down through these small schemes on to my land and the land of my neighbours, you will be up against all sorts of difficulties.  I know a man, a mill owner, who has to go to live upstairs three times a year because <Col N="625" /> of flooding.  If you give the local authority power to deal with the in-between flooding of the type Deputy O'Higgins has in mind, in that district without attacking the problem associated with the Anna Lee&mdash;and I suggest you cannot tackle that problem without removing the major obstructions&mdash;you will wipe that man out.  We hear a good deal these days about the rights of landowners.  Mind you, I am not one of those who stood for, or tolerated, if I could overcome it, an unreasonable objection or an unreasonable attitude on the part of any landowner to State intervention or the intervention of local authorities, to improve general conditions whether in regard to drainage or other matters, but I have always recognised that private individuals have certain rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk these days about the necessity of ensuring that nobody will go in on anybody else's land, unless the owner has first extended an invitation, and of a three-line Bill being introduced to give local bodies power to do what I have described.  I have not given an exaggerated description of the problem as I see it in the district I know best.  If any technical or practical man goes there with a reasonably open mind I will satisfy him that, without attacking the main artery of the river I know best and the major obstructions, it will be unfair to the farmers in the region and, after all, they, too, are entitled to live.  I was pleased, not because I was the person responsible, with the defence by the Parliamentary Secretary of the general scheme of the 1945 Act, but I was terribly disappointed with the limitations of the explanation which he gave in regard to what is intended as to the powers which are being given to local bodies in regard to drainage.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me, the House, and the country, if this scheme that is in a few months' time to solve all our ills has been recommended by the engineers of the Board of Works.  Are they standing over it?  What do the technical people in the Office of Public Works who are responsible, and who have enormous knowledge of drainage problems, think of it?  What do the law advisers to the <Col N="626" /> Government think of the prospect of giving powers in a three-line Bill to do what was described here would be done by the local authorities?  These are, naturally, questions to which this House should be given an answer.  I am not going to raise them in any obstructive sense but from the point of view of the individual's right, before that Bill becomes law, I shall certainly insist upon answers.  When I look around me I see on my right Deputy Cogan.  He has been seeking, in a different respect, the protection of the law for farmers.  He is concerned because he thinks that the law has made encroachments upon the owners of land that it should not have made.  I am going to see, in regard to this drainage problem, that there will be no encroachment.  I am anxious to see that individual rights will be protected. I am not a lawyer and I have no legal knowledge of these matters but I cannot see how such action could be regarded as constitutional.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary and other speakers have stated, attempts have been made to make this problem a political one.  Nobody with any sense or knowledge would ever dream of doing so.  The Government that preceded us introduced in a hurry a Bill that became an Act.  It was the 1924 Drainage Act, and I admit that it was designed to give employment at a time when it was necessary to provide employment. I went into the Office of Public Works only a few years ago, and looking impartially at the result of the 1924 Act, and looking back on the records of that Office, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the work done under that Act, and I am not blaming anybody for that, was a dead loss.  The 1925 Act was an improvement. To some extent it more or less gave the local authority responsibility for taking the initiative in the introduction of a scheme under which, as the members of the House know, the State contributed 50 per cent. towards the cost of drainage.  If the scheme was regarded as 15 per cent, 20 per cent., 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. economic the local landowner was supposed to pay that percentage and the local authority the balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> Deputy T.F. O'Higgins complained &mdash;and here again I do not mind whether you make political capital out of this or not&mdash;that the previous Government did nothing about drainage. I am sure that the records will show that it was we who in 1932, seven years after the passage of the 1925 Act, really implemented that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There you have the answer to piecemeal drainage.  Anyhow, it is all very well for Deputies here who are members of the local bodies and who see, under the 1945 Act, an opportunity of getting this work done at State cost but I would point out that in those days the local authority as well as the local landowner were involved in the cost.  There was not as much enthusiasm for carrying out the 1925 Act under these conditions but in my county, while I was chairman of the county council, we carried out the largest scheme that was carried out, with one exception, from 1932 to 1935 under the 1925 Act.  I say, looking at the result of that £75,000 to £80,000 scheme, when wages were only about one-third of what they are now and when general costs were only one-third of what they are now, that while some good resulted from the carrying out of that work it certainly could not be described as a successful scheme because it was piecemeal in character.</P>

      <P>There was action at one <Col N="628" /> time of a different kind, but the records of the Board of Works will show, unless they have changed since I left, that we have carried out every year our full legal maintenance.  I will go further and say that from the point of view of our record as a drainage authority we were well in the front, with the exception perhaps of Kildare. Anyhow, that is only a side issue.  My point is that Deputies can talk about drainage now because it has been made a State charge but they were not half so vigorous in their demand for drainage work when the local authority had to make a contribution in addition to what the local landowner and the State contributed.  Some of these Deputies would not trouble themselves to go back to 1925 and go on to 1930, 1937 and 1938 to see to what extent their local bodies attempted to use the Act of 1925.  We have the 1924 Act, the 1925 Act and the 1928 Minor Drainage Act which was introduced for the purpose of giving local bodies an opportunity of dealing with drainage schemes costing £1,000 and under and in respect of which&mdash;speaking subject to correction&mdash;the Government gave a grant of 40 per cent.  There was only one county which made use of that opportunity and it was never re-enacted because, apparently, it was not favoured by the local bodies for whose purpose it was designed.</P>
      <P>When it became apparent, after the operation of the 1925 Act, that things were not satisfactory, the course that the Parliamentary Secretary has described was taken of setting up a body composed of technical and practical men.  The present Act is based on their recommendation.  The matter on which I seek information&mdash;if I do not get it now, I hope I will soon get it&mdash; is that if there is now something being done that seems to run counter to or to be in conflict with the piecemeal drainage that the Parliamentary Secretary described as harmful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is all right to talk about drainage and land reclamation and it is all right to ignore the question as to whether it appears to be an economic proposition or not, but there are limits to the extent to which you can ignore that question.  I see land being sold every day in the week, not the best of land, but fairly good land and, costly as land and <Col N="630" /> property are, you can buy the best of it at from £25 to £60 an acre.</P>

      <P>What is the intention of drainage?  Has not it been pointed out by the Deputy and others that reclamation cannot take place while land is saturated?  I do not mind making the case that reasonable risks from the point of view of the economic value of drainage should be taken by the State but there is a point at which we must stand and ask ourselves whether or not it is wise policy to reclaim, at a cost of £80 an acre, bad waste land that will need constant attention and that will revert to its original condition if not constantly attended.  With wages at the point at which they are, one can imagine how costly it will be to maintain such land. It is no harm to put the question as to whether it is wise to go to the extent <Col N="631" /> of spending the amounts that Ministers have admitted have been spent in recent months in reclaiming poor land that must be poor, no matter what effort is made to improve it, while fairly decent land can be bought out at a lesser figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy O'Grady's recommendation to every member of this House who regards this as a serious problem.  I remember when I was in the House defending the 1945 Bill I went out of my way&mdash;as the records of the House will show&mdash;to warn Deputies of the time it would take to deal with this problem.  I did that, not because it was a pleasant duty.  It was one that I need not have carried out.  I might have allowed the world outside to think that drainage was going to be dealt with following the passage into law of those legislative proposals.  I knew there were people who were being seriously affected by flooding and I wanted to give them fair warning that with whatever enthusiasm a person might proceed it was going to take a fair amount of time before many of these areas would be touched upon. Whether it is this Government or some other Government is in office, any man who conveys to the people any other impression than that will be misleading the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that in normal times, such as I hope we are getting into now, much greater progress could be made than was possible during the war years, even if the legal position was such that we could proceed with drainage.  But even with the most ideal conditions and with special machinery, it will still be a considerable time before you can catch up with the drainage problems that are to be found in the 100 catchment areas to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred and to which I referred on previous occasions when the responsibility for that office was mine.  It is because I have had experience of office and know the problems that are there that, whether in opposition or otherwise, I am not going to get up in this House <Col N="632" /> and say that by some wave of the hand this can be done.  Certainly I am sceptical about believing that the passage into law of a three line Bill will solve this problem in the course of a few months.  More luck to those who think they can solve this problem in that time.  If they do, I will not hesitate to stand up and say: &ldquo;Good luck to you; you did it well.&rdquo;  But, do not blame me for saying in advance of the introduction of these proposals that if you attempt to do the things I have described, if the passage of this legislation results in what I have described taking place, then you will be doing some people an enormous injustice and certainly going very far away from a real solution of the drainage problems as they were approached in the report of the Drainage Commission and in the Act which is based upon that report.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any political capital out of this because there are nothing but complications and problems in connection with drainage, no matter from what angle you approach it.  It is with the fullest understanding of these that I am making these remarks. You have not heard from me since the change of Government, nor will you hear for many years if the Government remain in office, a critical word if I see what I regard as a reasonable effort being made to approach the problems of drainage along the lines on which I know from my experience in office they should be attacked.  I warn the Government that when the proposals which appear to me to be thought of merely to plug a hole or stuff a gap and would appear to have arisen in their minds in a very frivolous fashion come before the House we will need to get a great deal more information as to the proposals and their effect than the Dáil got when it was asked yesterday to accept them as an alternative to employment that was provided otherwise for men all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected a helpful contribution from Deputy Smith, as he occupied for a fairly considerable time the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and had in his charge the Board of Works and the Special <Col N="633" /> Employment Schemes office and must have accumulated a reasonable amount of experience and knowledge of the problem under discussion.  He seems to have a very gloomy outlook.  His whole speech was devoted to warning the Government of the pitfalls ahead: &ldquo;Do not be too optimistic that you are going to do great things.  I am telling you that you will not.&rdquo;  That is a very gloomy outlook.  If that was the mentality that the Deputy had when he occupied the position that Deputy Donnellan occupies now, it is no wonder that the drainage of the country was as forgotten and neglected as it was.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down shortly after the present Government was formed and that showed that there was a desire on the part of some Deputies to tackle the problem of drainage, because it is a pretty huge one and an urgent one.  There was only one little atom of knowledge in what Deputy Smith said.  He mentioned that some 20 years ago the question of flooding was not as serious as it is to-day.  That is the case, but the Deputy did not say why.  He warned us that when what he referred to as the three-line measure comes before the House in the near future proposing to give certain powers it will not solve our problems.  I hope that the measure that is to come before the House will enable local bodies to do exactly what the old boards of trustees did in days gone by, namely, give an annual cleaning or scouring to the main channels, starting at the outfall. The Deputy was perfectly correct when he said that if an attempt were made to do work on the small drains in the upper catchment areas, leaving the outfall as it is, it would only mean transferring water from one place to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance will examine this whole prolem very carefully with the help of the skilled advice and experience of the experts in each of the Departments.  The obvious thing to do is to start at the outfall.  Even children would not dream of tackling the problem in any other way.  We might have been opposed to <Col N="634" /> the old boards of trustees who were in charge of the rivers, but no matter what their affiliations were from a national point of view or otherwise, they did a fairly good job of work in connection with the drainage of the country.  They kept the main channels open.  Every year since, however, they have fallen into disuse.  The drainage problem has become an acute one and is growing worse each year.  It has now been brought home to us very forcibly that the annual cleaning or scouring the old boards of trustees gave the rivers and drains at least kept the water on the move and let it out and flooding did not exist then to the same extent as it exists to-day.  This trouble is growing day by day.  I have no proof of what I say, but I have not the slightest doubt that the experts in the Board of Works and the Department of Local Government are aiming at giving local bodies the same power and authority as these old boards of trustees had to do the work which they did without trying to do piecemeal arterial drainage in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith strikes me as being a man who, now that he is not in a position to do anything, would do great things.  He strikes me as a man who feels that if he were back again in power he would do the things which he is very sorry he did not do.  Useless regrets like that will not get a person anywhere.  In my view, it is a warning to those in charge that if they want to do a job the only time to save the hay is while the sun shines.  The only time for a Government or a Party to do the work the people elected them for is when they are in power and have the authority in their hands.  Vain regrets like those of Deputy Smith come a little late in the day.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Killilea, the Deputy's Party came into power in 1932 and 1945 was 13 years later.  Did the country not want draining during that period or why was the Bill not introduced until 1945? Was it not rather in the evening of Fianna Fáil day that the Bill was introduced? When it was introduced it <Col N="635" /> cannot be denied that it was a good thing&mdash;I want to give merit where merit is due&mdash;but no serious attempt was made to implement the Arterial Drainage Act which was a good measure in itself when it could be implemented. Certainly very little attempt was made by the Deputy's Party when it was in power to put it into operation. That is one of the causes which contributed very heavily to putting that Party on the other side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Field drainage does not come into this motion at all although it was mentioned by some Deputies, but field drainage will play a very important part in the future in two ways.  Deputy Smith seems to think that land reclamation and field drainage is going to be a serious thing and poses as the champion of the farmers.  He says that the farmers have their rights and he talks about the river Anna Lee up in County Cavan.  The rights of farmers <Col N="636" /> are in perfectly safe hands when they are in the hands of the present Government. The present Government will not alone keep a watchful eye on the protection of their rights, but will try to give them the right to live and give them assistance to live and not alone to live but to help the country by producing more on the land which is now not capable of production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins seems to be very interested in this problem but he was not in the House earlier and I will not address my remarks to him but to his Party.  I wonder could it be calculated how much damage has been done for want of foresight in developing bogs in many areas before clearing the rivers and letting vast floods of water into the fertile lands in the plains underneath without using some of the money to make an open channel.  That happened in the Deputy's county.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take himself easy.  There was flooding of the Maigue due to bad management in the development of bogs before making a channel in the river to take the water.  It is an excellent thing to drain bogs.  Deputy Smith talks of the rights of farmers, but to talk of their rights is only humbug when the river channel was not cleared to take away the water before the bog was developed. A bog of some hundreds of thousands of acres is a very big sponge to drink up a lot of water.  I do not want to see farmers flooded out because people rush in in a thoughtless and rash manner to develop bogs without taking the precaution of providing a main channel for taking the water away.</P>

      <P>I know there is a time limit on this debate and hence I shall be very brief.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that arterial drainage is a serious matter and ought to be tackled seriously and with determination. I was also glad to hear from him that the drainage authority had turned their eyes towards the West. Now that they have made their survey there I should like if he would turn their eyes towards the East.  There are very grave problems in connection with arterial drainage in the Leinster counties that ought to be tackled actively.  It may be said that Wicklow is a county that least requires arterial drainage on a large scale, inasmuch as the rivers there are, in the main, fast flowing.  Nevertheless, there are very large areas in the county which are water-logged, and which call for the carrying out of drainage schemes on a large scale.  I am in the happy or unhappy position that not only do I represent one constituency in the Dáil but that I represent another constituency on a local authority.  As a member of the Carlow County Council, the woes of the people in Carlow, Leighlinbridge and other towns in that county have been brought to my notice, due to the effect of flooding by the River Barrow.  I know, of course, that <Col N="639" /> that ancient river did cause a great deal of worry and anxiety to the Board of Works in the past, and that large sums of money were expended on it.  I hope it will again come under review, and will be tackled not at the upper end, as was done at the first attempt to remedy the defects there, but at the outfall, so that something will be done to remove the water which is causing such destruction there.</P>
      <P>I should also like to endorse what the Parliamentary Secretary said on another matter because it confirms a view which I have held for a considerable time.  He said that every engineer is not suitable for drainage work.  In other words, engineers have to become engineering experts if they are to make a good contribution to this problem.  This has a bearing on a question which puzzled, amazed and worried me yesterday, and is still worrying me.  The question is, why was it decided to divert the engineering staffs of the county councils to drainage work?  Would it not be better to employ the engineers in the Board of Works on all works of drainage, large and small, because they are experts in that work?  We all know that the engineering staffs of the county councils have two big jobs on hand at the moment, namely, to provide houses for the people, and, secondly, to provide roads leading to those houses.  These two jobs ought to be able to occupy 100 per cent. of their time for many years to come.  I know that, in the case of the Carlow County Council, it has been a rather hefty problem to try and build up an efficient engineering staff to tackle housing.  The men who are on that staff are competent, and I believe have settled down to dealing with the problem.  They have made their estimates and their plans and, in my opinion, it would be a disastrous thing to take them away from that work and put them to deal with a problem of which they cannot have an expert knowledge.  There was a good deal of grumbling amongst the engineering staffs when they were diverted to the bogs for the production of turf.  I can see them being faced with much the same difficulty if they are now to be called upon to carry out drainage work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> I realise quite well that there are very grave difficulties to be faced in carrying out even small drainage schemes.  There are engineering difficulties and difficulties in regard to property ownership.  There was, in my own immediate neighbourhood, a rural development scheme which was an admirable piece of work to which all the affected landowners agreed to contribute. They were very anxious to get the work done, but it was found that at the outfall of the stream, that which they proposed to clear, flooding would take place upon another farmer's land farther down the stream.  The engineering staff were brought to inspect the land.  They confirmed the view of the landowner that flooding was likely to occur farther down, and in view of this the scheme had to be abandoned. Water is not a thing you can put in a heap.  You have to make arrangements for its disposal.  If you divert it from one place it has to go somewhere else. You must see that it does not adversely affect the property of other people.</P>
    <P>These are all matters of very great importance.  In my opinion, all this drainage work is of a specialist character. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should build up a drainage staff of engineers sufficient to deal not only with the larger river areas, but also with the smaller areas, and thus leave the engineering staffs of the local authorities to do the job that they have been specially trained for, a job that urgently requires to be done.</P>

      <P>I think that the real object of this motion when it was first put on the Order Paper was that a much more urgent and active implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act should be carried out.  Listening to Deputy Smith's speech, I was reminded of what has often been said, namely, that when a speaker uses the personal pronoun, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; it is a sure sign, and is symbolic of the fact, that he is an egotist.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith to-night was inebriated by the exuberance of <Col N="641" /> his own egotism, and his contribution to this debate was null and void.  We had another side of his egotism when he said of himself that, even though he had good technical knowledge available to him during the time that he was responsible for the Office of Public Works, he sometimes went against the advice of his own technicians, and so carried out schemes which he now knows to have been wrong.  He has only to go down to Kerry to see a scheme of his which was carried out there, a scheme which it was thought, by whoever implemented it, would drain the river Maine.  The drainage began at the source of the Brown Flesk, a tributary of the Maine, and it was done for about two miles down the river.  Ever since then the people of one of the richest valleys of this country are drowned with water.  I have seen it quite recently.  When about ten square miles of beautiful land are flooded the temporary lake formed is known as &ldquo;Smith's Pool,&rdquo; so evidently he must be considered responsible for all the destruction that was caused.</P>

      <P>There was another instance which occured while the last Government was interested in drainage. The people of Kilkenny had to leave their homes and suffered a great deal of damage.  Yet Deputy Derrig, who is Deputy of that area, did absolutely nothing and nothing has been done since to carry out the drainage scheme there, until Bishop Collier, of course, forced him to do something in order to comfort the people who lost their homes.  That was the only thing that was done by the Deputy for Carlow-Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I should like to refer to these small drainage schemes that would be introduced in the three-line Bill and which gave such anxiety to Deputy Smith and perhaps to other members of Fianna Fáil, too, because they now realise that <Col N="642" /> if they had done something like that, perhaps they would be on the side of the House that we are now on.  Instead of spending millions of pounds in the purchase of aeroplanes glittering in the skies that were going to fly over the Atlantic, if they had devoted that money to carrying out the drainage schemes since the cessation of the war perhaps they would still be on this side of the House.  If the three schemes of drainage could be co-operated we should begin with arterial drainage, which is the most important of all, because we must not do as Deputy Smith did in the case of the Brown Flesk.  We must begin with the main rivers and then continue with the tributaries of the main rivers.  The officials of the county councils can then operate this new drainage system when all small rivers and streams are cleared.  We can then deal with farm drainage, the drainage of the fields and lands.  I think that is the system of drainage to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The only grievance I have against the Parliamentary Secretary is that I am afraid he put the drainage necessary in various parts of Kerry too far back.  I should like to remind him that quite recently there was serious flooding there.  I happened to be in the vicinity of the place and met one of the farmers there.  In the course of the discussion of all the destruction that was caused he mentioned to me that he was a bachelor.  I asked him how that was as he seemed to have a good farm.  He said: &ldquo;The only woman I could expect to marry here would be a mermaid.&rdquo;  So I hope that Deputy Donnellan will be able to get more machinery and send a whole lot of it down to Kerry.  I feel perfectly sure he is quite anxious to carry out the scheme and to accelerate it in every way.  In years to come we hope that millions of acres of beautiful land will be reclaimed in order to produce more stock not only to feed the people of this country but also to help feed the people of other countries whose lands are not as fertile as ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this question of drainage as it is one which affects us very much down in Feoholagh where we <Col N="643" /> have two very small but important catchment areas.  I think that we gave an example to all Ireland in a scheme that was organised quite recently. Some time before Christmas two Deputies and myself were invited by the organisation responsible for that work to a meeting.  We were hoping that the responsible Minister for drainage would be there but instead we had Mr. Blowick, the Minister for Lands.  He received a deputation from the area of the lower Deel and the upper reaches of the catchment area of the Maigue of something like 24 square miles or more.  I am sorry that he made such a <i>faux pas.</i>  He told us that the flooding of the Maigue catchment area was due to floods in the bogs.  There is not a bog within 24 miles of the Maigue catchment area.  When he came to the upper reaches of the Deel he afterwards attended a meeting in West Limerick where he made a statement to the effect that we should hear on the following Tuesday night a very important announcement from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donnellan. As I mentioned before it was to be a kind of Christmas box for the farmers who had suffered there for years.  We tuned in but for some unexplainable reason we did not hear anything from Deputy Donnellan as regards this scheme and now we are being told that it is going to be a three-line Bill.  That is all right.  We in West Limerick understood from the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 that we should wait our time and our turn as regards the drainage of the Deel and the Maigue because we were far down the list.  However, when I heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us here yesterday that a three-line Bill was about to be introduced by the Minister for Local Government and that the drainage of the rivers and streams in West Limerick could be effected by men with picks, shovels, spades and horses I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if Mr. Blowick, the Minister for Lands, was acting on his behalf when he came down to County Limerick to supply us with excavators and so forth and, if possible, blasting machinery, because <Col N="644" /> we have rocks and weirs in the upper reaches of the Maigue that men with picks, spades and shovels would not remove in the next thousand years.</P>
      <P>It is important to us and we should like to see this Bill coming into operation if it is of such a nature that it is going to be of any value to the farmers of Limerick.  If, however, under this three-line Bill this very difficult situation which we have in the upper reaches and the lower reaches of the Deel is going to be approached by men with picks, shovels and horses I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government that they are simply making themselves ridiculous in the eyes of the people. We have layers of limestone rocks, weirs and so forth that have to be blasted out of the way in order to reach the upper reaches of that particular catchment area.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a point that Deputy Palmer has mentioned in regard to the drainage of part of Southeast Kerry.  I think that if Deputy Palmer would examine his conscience a little he must admit that whatever drainage was effected in that particular area of South Kerry was done under the 1924-25 Acts.  Unless I am mistaken Deputy Smith did not take over responsibility until about 1943 or 1944.  The Deputy mentioned that the flooding in this fertile valley in South Kerry is known as the Smith Pool.  I expected more from Deputy Palmer.  Deputy Smith brought out some important points in the course of his speech. He made a speech which was educative, constructive and instructive&mdash; instructive for the Parliamentary Secretary.  He made some telling points and I feel it was very unfair of Deputy Palmer to hit back in the way he did as regards Deputy Smith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion because of its importance.  In so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have always been strongly in favour of drainage.  I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary made at least two appeals to the House to-night to keep this matter out of politics.  Deputy Smith, in the course of his speech, did his utmost&mdash; and so did Deputy O'Grady&mdash;to be most helpful to the Parliamentary Secretary.  They pointed out the difficulties that lie in the way of drainage. But if the Parliamentary Secretary's colleague, the Minister for Lands, did not try to twist and turn every word uttered by Deputy Smith, I do not know what he did.  He told us Deputy Smith was sorry that when he was in office he did not do greater things.  He pointed out how Deputy Smith made no effort from 1932 to 1945 to do anything.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Smith made the position quite clear as to his efforts in those days.  Deputy Smith pointed out quite clearly that when he came into office he had to examine the position that existed prior to Fianna Fáil coming into office.  We had the 1924 Drainage Act and, to put it as mildly as I can, that Act could not be counted as anything other than a disgrace to any Government who would try to implement it or put it on top of any county council or any body other than a county council because of the type of work to be carried out under it. Deputy Smith passed over that very lightly and he came on to the 1925 Act and he pointed out that during the years that the Government prior to Fianna Fáil held office they made no effort to give effect to that Act or to see whether or not it might work out satisfactorily.  He said he was prepared to try to give effect to it and to see exactly what could be done.</P>

      <P>Do not always act as a jack-in-the-box.  Give someone a chance to make his case.  Those tactics will not get you very far.  Deputy Smith was not 16 years in office when he tried to give effect to the 1925 Act. Deputy Smith pointed out quite clearly that when he came into office he tried to ascertain the value of that legislation.  Communications were sent out to the different county councils and they were given an opportunity of submitting schemes.  They did so, and when the people who would benefit by the drainage were asked to sign a document that they would contribute a certain sum, they were prepared to sign.  The county councils also were prepared to put up their portion, but after a number of these schemes had been carried out it was found that the people were not able to bear the burden.  The Parliamentary Secretary is as well aware of all this as I am, because he is a member of a public body that tried to give effect to that drainage scheme in an effort to benefit the district that he represented at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a number of these schemes were given effect to it was found that the people were unable to bear the burden placed on their shoulders and that something else would have to be done.  It was decided that the responsibility of sharing the burden that was previously shared by the people concerned with the drainage that was done, as well as the local authorities, would have to be shifted if the drainage was to be a success.  The Drainage Commission was then established and they went out to examine the job, which the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted was a tremendously big job &mdash;and for a long time to come it will still be a big job.  They examined the whole position to find out exactly what could be done and they made certain recommendations.  Immediately the recommendations were made the Fianna <Col N="647" /> Fáil Government gave effect to them through the medium of the 1945 Drainage Act.</P>

He now realises that it was a mistake and he says that the drainage that was done in the bogs caused extra flooding in the rivers.  If that is so why is the present Government carrying on the same policy in relation to drainage?  If I had sufficient time to do it there are a number of aspects into which I would like to go and I am sorry that more time was not allocated to this particular motion because I think it is a very important one.</P>

It is typical of the mentality of the Opposition that Deputy Killilea's contribution should be one of their few contributions to an important debate like this.  Deputy Killilea, in so far as he said anything in this debate, repeated Deputy Smith's speech but did not make the points as well as Deputy Smith made them.  As far as I could understand Deputy Killilea's defence in relation to inactivity on the part of Fianna Fáil in respect of the drainage problem, his defence rested on an attempt to explain to the country that it took Deputy Smith a period of 13 years to read the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925.

      <P>It did not require a tremendous amount of money, comparatively speaking, to start arterial drainage in this country.  The money that should have been spent on drainage was spent on aeroplanes, luxury tourist hotels and other matters of that nature.  For 16 years not a single penny was forthcoming for constructive work in connection with the reclamation of land.  I know that a matter like this must cause concern to the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I was not surprised at Deputy Smith's speech here. I think he made his speech with the best intentions in the world&mdash;the best intentions anyway towards the present Parliamentary Secretary and the best intentions so far as he and his Party were concerned.  If there was a single word of criticism from Deputy Smith or a single word of optimism in relation to drainage, Deputy Smith nevertheless damned himself and damned his Party.  He had to be gloomy.  He had to say that the problem was a terrible one and that any scheme this Government might propose was bound to fail. He had to say that in exculpation of the record of his Party while in office. I do not know much about the technical end of drainage.  Possibly I know considerably less about it than Deputy Smith.  But I have some experience of the damage caused in different parts of the country because of lack of drainage.  I have some experience in that respect of Deputy Smith's constituency.  Time and time again when Deputy Smith occupied the position now occupied by the present Parliamentary Secretary I played my part in getting compensation for people who were injured or suffered damage through neglect of drainage.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the reason why drainage in this country was neglected during the years when the Party opposite was in power.  Deputy Smith has approached both the schemes which were mentioned in this House yesterday with the long face of the wise man who knows that something cannot succeed &mdash; the gloomy prophet of gloom, as all members of the Party opposite are inclined to be. It is no good, he says, endeavouring to do what I have called the in-between scheme &mdash; it cannot be done and can never succeed.  Deputy J.J. Collins represents a constituency where the decent people, despite Deputy Smith's Party, have succeeded in solving some of these problems.</P>

      <P>No matter how small it may be and no matter how insignificant it may be, if you multiply it 20,000 times, you will be getting something done for the country.  That is something Deputy Smith could not understand.</P>

      <P>The in-between schemes&mdash;clearing away of obstacles, dealing with bridges where obstructions are caused and work of that kind&mdash; can be done and will be done by this Government.  It may be&mdash;I am sure it is so&mdash;that, in order to enable schemes of that type to be carried out by local authorities, statutory powers are necessary, and Deputy Smith has referred to a three-line Bill.  He can never get away from the fact that the Arterial Drainage Act comprises about 200 pages and he can never get away from the fact that it took him or his Party 13 years to prepare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Let him remember that Fianna Fáil is not now in power, that there is in power a Government consisting of men of action who are prepared to get the wheels turning and get the work going, despite all the Fianna Fáil talk about gloom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Deputy Smith was also very gloomy about the other scheme mentioned last night&mdash;the scheme of reclamation. Again, that is something of a constructive nature, irrespective of Deputy Smith's views as to its success.  It is a proposal of a constructive nature&mdash; reclaiming land and making sour or flooded land fertile.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith appreciates the impact of a scheme like that, if it is successful, on his Party and his Party's fortunes, and particularly on himself in flooded Cavan.  Of course, again, it cannot succeed and will not succeed, according to him, and the very cost of it is going to be more than the value of the acre of land which is reclaimed.  That is the type of mentality that looks at everything of a productive nature from the point of view of its cost in L.S.D. which prevented anything of that nature being done when Deputy Smith occupied the office of Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>You were. Indeed, if Deputy Smith wants to talk about throwing money down sewers, there is a certain place called Santry Court not far from here that swallowed up a bit of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <P>And Deputy Davern was trying to sabotage this country not so very long ago.  This debate has been useful in illustrating the escape which the farmers of this country had from the mentality that obsessed Government Departments until 14 months ago&mdash;the gloomy outlook that nothing is possible because it <Col N="653" /> might be difficult or might involve a little reading of Acts or of law.  I am glad that that has been changed and I can guarantee from what I know myself that the schemes mentioned here in the past two days will be tackled and tackled with enthusiasm.  They may be successful or they may not, but at least the people realise that something is being done to tackle this problem. They also know that there is no shortage of money at present for work of a productive nature under this Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davern has mentioned road grants.  The Deputy, of course, always imagines that productive work begins at one end of a road and finishes at the other; but we know that there is land on both sides of the road and on that land much work will be done.</P>

      <P>I travelled the roads long before Deputy Smith and, I suppose will travel them long after Deputy Smith.  Deputy Smith may get annoyed with what I am saying.  He is entitled to do so, and, as was said here before, I should be very annoyed if I were in his position.  I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to-night <Col N="654" /> paying a tribute to the Minister for Finance when he said that not a single penny asked for in respect of this important work was grudged or refused, and that in fact more money is available than can be spent in getting together the materials and the machinery for an extensive drainage programme.</P>

I know that other schemes which will be implemented in legislation shortly will be welcomed by the country, if not by the Party opposite.</P>
