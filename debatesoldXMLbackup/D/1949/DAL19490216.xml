      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether the Government, while welcoming the reciprocal rights in the British Nationality Act, 1948, has protested against the inclusion in this Act of the nationals of the partitioned six counties and their treatment as common British citizens, to which at least some one half million of them object.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what particular declaration of the British Prime Minister the Deputy is referring, but I can tell the Deputy <Col N="3" /> that the most effective action we can take in view of any effort to reaffirm or continue Partition is to redouble our efforts to mobilise all the moral energies of the Irish people, at home and abroad, towards bringing Partition to an end.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that there has been from time to time public dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Local Appointments Commission has discharged its functions and if he is prepared to set up a committee of Dáil Éireann charged with the task of examining the manner in which the Local Appointments Commission is operated and reporting thereon to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that dissatisfaction of a limited character has from time to time been expressed with the operation of the arrangements for the selection by the Local Appointments Commissioners of persons for local appointments.  In a reply to Deputy Sweetman on the 21st July, 1948, I gave an account of those arrangements and dealt with certain complaints to which that Deputy had referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Local Appointments Commissioners exercise scrupulous care in administering the enactments and in applying the regulations which govern their methods of selection.  It may be that the system which they operate tends, in itself, to produce occasional anomalies, or apparent anomalies, in practice.  No case has been brought to my notice, however, in which investigation did not result in a satisfactory explanation. Any individual complaint that may in the future be brought to my attention will be fully investigated, and, if the number or character of such <Col N="4" /> cases would seem to warrant a general inquiry, I shall consult with my colleagues in the Government as to the steps that should be taken to have such an inquiry carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 2nd February, 1949, purporting to give an account of Government decisions regarding transport.  I am not in a position to state the circumstances in which this article was published in a newspaper for which I have no responsibility, officially or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> Every intelligent journalist is entitled to exercise his ingenuity on known facts and, therefore, to draw such conclusions or intelligent anticipations as he may deem proper.  I am fully satisfied that that is what happened in this case.  I wish to state emphatically that there was no disclosure in advance of the decisions which were taken by the Government and were officially announced on the 4th February, and that there was no leakage of information in regard to those decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in view of the recent increases in the cost of bread, meat, eggs and other essential foodstuffs and the general increase in the cost of living, he will provide a special bonus for temporary clerks in employment exchanges whose wages do not exceed £4 11s. 0d. weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant to any class of civil servants of a bonus designed to offset an increase in the cost of living is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy in putting his question would appear to be unaware <Col N="6" /> that, in common with certain other classes of civil servants, temporary clerks in employment exchanges had their wages revised in November last with retrospective effect to the 29th May, 1948.  The effect of this revision was to give such temporary clerks, irrespective of the figure of £4 11s. 0d. per week mentioned, an increase of 11/-a week to men and 5/6 to women and juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he has received any representations from the association of temporary clerks in employmen exchanges and whether he proposes to give any answer to these representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. As to the second part, all representations from the association in question have been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state the nature of the representations received in general on behalf of these temporary clerks and what action was taken in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The representations received from the Association of Temporary Clerks in Employment Exchanges covered five subjects: (1) continuous employment; (2) revision of certain regulations governing the order of dismissal in the event of redundancy of staff; (3) increase of overtime rates, and (4) revision of regulations which prescribe that temporary clerks lose continuity of employment for sick leave and incremental purposes if they are unemployed for a period of three months.  The last question was that of increased wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Were these the only representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the only representations which were received and all these matters have been dealt with in this connection.  The position, in respect of continuous employment, was that, in 1947, 192 temporary clerks were paid off during the currency of the Employment Period Orders.  Last year it was possible to meet their natural claim for continuous employment <Col N="7" /> to the extent that in 1948 only 62 were paid off, as compared with 192 the previous year.</P>
      <P>The previous practice, in respect of overtime rates, had been that temporary clerks did not receive any extra rates for overtime but their normal flat rate.  As a result of their representation, the overtime was increased from the flat rate to time and a quarter for the first 12 hours, time and a half for the next six hours and double time for hours in excess of 18.</P>
      <P>On the question of the effect of loss of employment in respect of incremental and sick leave rights, the previous practice was that where the officers were paid off for a period of three months, they lost continuity of employment for the purpose of these rights. That regulation has now been revised to provide that they will not lose these rights unless paid off for a period of 12 months, and that is a contingency which is not likely to arise.  Another claim dealt with the question of the basis of terminating the services of persons due to redundancy.  In the past there appeared to be no defined method of selecting people for retention or dismissal.  It has now been agreed that in the future the order of discharge will be determined on the basis of seniority, with due regard to efficiency.</P>
      <P>The last claim was in respect of increased wages, and I have already furnished the House with information in the reply which I have just read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether most of the temporary clerks in employment exchanges are performing duties which are normally carried out by established officers on a salary scale ranging from £380 to £540 per year; whether most of the temporary clerks thus engaged have had service with the Defence Forces during the emergency, and whether, in view of this, he will take steps to secure the establishment of all temporary clerks who show that they can perform their duties with efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Temporary clerks in employment exchanges do not perform <Col N="8" /> the full duties of established employment clerks, whose scales of salaries range incidentally from £220 to £413 per annum and not from £380 to £540 as stated by the Deputy.  There are 242 temporary clerks at present serving in the employment exchanges, 85 of whom had service in the Defence Forces during the emergency.  The majority of these would, no doubt, already have had an opportunity of competing for established posts in the Civil Service through one of the competitions confined to ex-Army men held since the termination of the emergency.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that a wider scheme of social insurance is in course of preparation in my Department. It is not possible to forecast at this stage what effect this scheme will have on the staffing of employment exchanges and, in the circumstances, I cannot say what are the prospects of an examination, confined to temporary clerks, being held for appointments to established posts as employment clerk. The Deputy may rest assured that the interests of the temporary clerks have received and will continue to receive my sympathetic attention.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that a number of county council workers employed by the Kerry County Council were prevented from receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, due to a certain dispute which took place while work was going on in the Ballydesmond, County Cork, area, although other workers who were engaged in the same dispute received assistance; and, if so, whether he will state the circumstances in which the manager of the Tralee Exchange refrained from paying assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that claims to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance made by a number of men who were employed at Ballydesmond, County Cork, were refused because they had lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute <Col N="9" /> at the premises at which they were employed.  The claims of five of these men were subsequently allowed because it was established that their employment was not terminated on account of the stoppage of work due to the trade dispute.  In another case the man concerned obtained employment elsewhere in his usual occupation during the stoppage of work, and when he did so, the disqualification ceased. A fresh application for unemployment assistance which he subsequently made was allowed.</P>

There is on hands an area of over 400 acres and further estates and holdings are noted for early inquiry involving an area of approximately 4,700 acres.  The claims of uneconomic holders and of the other classes referred to will be duly considered in connection with the division of any lands acquired.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if there will be a guaranteed price for this year's flax crop and whether a market will be assured to growers of this crop in County Monaghan in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1939, all the flax produced in this country has been purchased by the British authorities at prices agreed in advance with my Department.  Some time ago the British authorities declared that this arrangement would cease after the 1948 crop had been disposed of and that they expected the linen industry to negotiate the purchase of the 1949 crop.  Subsequently, representatives of the Northern Ireland Fax Spinners' Association, Limited, called on me and made a tentative offer for the purchase of 4,000 tons of flax at a price to the grower based on 31/3 per stone for Grade V dam-retted, hand-scutched flax.  This was 3/3 per stone lower than the price of the 1948 crop.  I informed the association that if they were prepared to pay prices equivalent to those payable for the 1948 crop I would encourage farmers here to grow flax.  The association promised to consider the matter and to communicate with me but did not do so until a very long time had elapsed when they made the surprising offer to purchase 2,000 tons at the unattractive price of 32/-per stone for Grade V, while at the same time a price of 40/- per stone for growers in Northern Ireland was fixed (but that included a Government subsidy amounting to about 7/4).  This offer was even less satisfactory than the previous one and as a counter proposal I informed them that I would <Col N="29" /> recommend growers to accept, under protest, 35/- per stone for Grade V but that the limitation on quantity to be purchased should be removed.  The matter is now being reconsidered by the association.  Unless they can see their way to improve their offer it will not be possible to make any official arrangement with them for the growing of flax in the coming year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that owing to this, untold hardships will be inflicted on the farmers of County Monaghan in the matter of sale for their flax?  The Minister must be aware that they have suffered considerable losses over oats and that they were trying to retrieve the position by sowing flax.  This is not very encouraging for them.  Does the Minister hold out any hope that the farmers in Monaghan will get the price for their flax they are demanding?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to maintain, as I intend to maintain, that none of our people are dependent upon the charity of the Northern flax millers, and if they do not choose to pay our people a fair price for the extremely laborious crop of flax, this Government will be no party to the exploitation of our people by the Northern flax spinners. I trust that we will be able to provide from our own modest resources some other form of reward which will ensure that the Northern flax spinners cannot now or at any future time inflict hardship on our people.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that a good deal of land in my constituency has already been prepared for this crop, could the Minister give us an assurance that he will endeavour to terminate the negotiations at present proceeding as expeditiously as possible and make an effective and categorical <Col N="30" /> statement on the hookery of the Northern buyers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that lands are now being let in the area which he himself represents and in some other areas as well and that while the price to be paid by the Northern spinners is of great importance, a more urgent question still is whether there is to be any limitation on the amount to be taken by those spinners?  From his contacts with those people over the past few months he ought surely, I suggest, to be in a position to say now at the mouth of the month of March whether or not an unlimited quantity of flax will in fact be accepted by that organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must realise the importance of this cash problem to the farmers of Monaghan, particularly to the small farmers.  After all it is their main cash crop; they do not grow wheat or barley or beet. This is pretty bad news for those farmers.  I would ask the Minister, if it is a thing that the negotiations with the Northern spinners break down, which looks likely, he should guarantee to the farmers of Monaghan that the Government will come to their rescue as it did to the beet growers and wheat growers with a form of subsidy. After all, I fail to see why the Minister cannot now open negotiations with the British Government to take any surplus flax that we have, in view of the fact that we grew flax for them during the recent emergency.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to assume that those who have asked the last supplementary questions did not advert to the consequences of what they have done.  Up to to-day, my negotiating position was reasonably strong.  As from to-day, my position, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Northern Ireland spinners, is that all the Deputies of the Opposition take the view that I should gratefully accept the offer, the grossly inadequate&mdash;the shamefully inadequate offer&mdash;that they have sought to thrust on our people.</P>

      <P>If Deputies have overlooked that aspect of the matter, I wish they had consulted wiser heads before they intervened as they have done here to-day.  I would like to know, am I to interpret the supplementary questions addressed to me by the members of the Opposition as an expression of their view that I should submit, on behalf of our people, to an ultimatum from the Northern Ireland spinners that they will take 2,000 tons at a price 8/- per stone lower than is going to be paid for the same crop produced in the six north-eastern counties of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I opened these negotiations last October, and the spinners attempted to drag them out until the ever of the sowing season in the hope that I would be embarrassed by the pressure of the sowing season coming upon us and the natural anxiety of our farmers.  I confess that the risk of my being so harassed and embarrassed in this House by Deputies representing flax-growing counties was one with which I did not reckon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the very substantial increase in production costs during the past year, it is the intention of the Government to increase the price paid to producers of milk for human consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be under a misapprehension in that connection.  The price fixed for liquid milk is designed to give to the producer a return for the total gallonage of milk delivered by him in the milk consumption area he serves, and so, taking the average of the price fixed <Col N="35" /> for the whole 12-month period, the result works out at an average basic price for all the milk delivered.  It was believed that those who maintain a uniform supply, winter and summer, would be advantaged by giving a higher premium in the months of November, December, January, February and March.  If the milk suppliers make representations to me that they would prefer to have the higher price spread over the months of October, November, December, January, February, March and April, that could easily be arranged in fixing next year's schedule of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion on the Order Paper standing in my name:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, shocked by the unjust and violent measures taken by the Government of Hungary against the persons of His Eminence Cardinal Mindszenty and the leaders of other Christian Churches in Hungary; <Col N="36" /> sympathising deeply with the people of Hungary in their subjection to a religious persecution so unworthy of their noble traditions of Christian culture;</P>
    <P>and convinced that respect for fundamental human rights, including the right to worship God truly in the manner He Himself has ordained, is an essential condition of international peace and understanding;</P>
    <P>HEREBY PLACES ON RECORD its solemn condemnation of the iniquitous actions of the Government of Hungary in violation of the freedom of the Christian conscience, as well as its conviction that the sufferings of His Eminence and the other victims of this persecution will but serve to ensure the ultimate victory of Christian civilisation over the forces of evil.</P>
    <P>It is only in circumstances of a most exceptional character that a House of the Parliament of one country would feel itself called upon to comment on proceedings by way of charge or trial in another country.  The circumstances of the condemnation of His Eminence Cardinal Mindszenty are entirely exceptional. We have seen in him a great prelate, a Prince of the Catholic Church, arraigned like a common criminal, subjected to the greatest indignity and sentenced to imprisonment for life as a result of proceedings which it would be an abuse of language to describe as a trial.  The issues involved are fundamental to the general human conscience, and they have deeply moved not alone our Catholic people, but the members of every religious community in the country.  The Government are conscious, therefore, not only that they are justified in taking the unusual step of proposing a motion of this kind, but that they would be failing in their duty if they did not invite the Dáil to place formally on record a solemn protest against the persecution and unjust trial of Cardinal Mindszenty and his fellow-sufferers, and against their condemnation by methods which are shocking to our ideas of natural justice as well as to Christian principles.</P>
    <P>The case of Cardinal Mindszenty has justly attracted the particular attention <Col N="37" /> of all the free peoples of the world by the great eminence of the victim and the overwhelming evidence of abuse of the forms of justice which has shown itself in the course of the so-called &ldquo;trial&rdquo;.  We do not forget, at the same time, the similar sufferings of leaders of other Churches, including, in Hungary, those of the Lutheran Bishop, Louis Ordass.  It is clear that the attack is aimed not only at the Church to which the great majority of our own people belong, but at the whole Christian concept of life and morals, and the belief in God.</P>
    <P>I feel that this motion does not call for any advocacy on my part.  The facts are so well known to all Deputies that there is no need for me to recapitulate them.  From the earliest stage of the proceedings against Cardinal Mindszenty, the Irish Government have made known to the Government of Hungary the deep concern of the people of Ireland, and we have not failed to impress on the Governments of the various States with which we have diplomatic relations the anxiety felt in this country, or to urge how important it is that the treatment of the Cardinal should not be regarded with passive indifference by freedom-loving nations.  The conscience of the world has been profoundly stirred by the occurrences in Hungary, and I know that the elected representatives of the Irish people will not be slow to express, by formal resolution, their feelings of abhorrence and condemnation.</P>
    <P>This is a period of great trial and suffering in many countries for those who profess the Christian faith.  We can only trust that, as the Cross came before the Resurrection, so may the persecutions of these dark times be a prelude to a glorious day when Christian charity will inform the relations between man and man, and nation and nation, throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree with the Taoiseach that it is only in circumstances of extreme gravity that it would be proper that the Government of one country and its Parliament should solemnly condemn as iniquitous the actions of another. <Col N="38" /> Every one of us here, however, knows that the circumstances are such as to demand such a condemnation, and I feel confident that this motion will be accepted unanimously by the House, and that it corresponds to the feelings not merely of every Deputy, but of every citizen.</P>
      <P>The facts are known.  We have all seen, since the war ended, one powerful State using its influence and strength to affect neighbouring countries, to put into power in these countries a minority who could never have got into power by democratic methods, or maintained their position were it not for the active assistance of that foreign State.  We have seen the steps by which that was done.  By the aid of the army of this State, the democratic representation of the people had the minority group forced upon it &mdash;into the Government.  Once they got in, pressure was used to compel the others to accept them as the ruling body.  The rule of the minority has been maintained since then&mdash;maintained by force and by tyrannical methods.  What has happened in this case&mdash;that of Cardinal Mindszenty&mdash; has come to the notice of the whole world because of the eminence of the victim.  There have been similar tortures in thousands of other cases, but that is not so well known and so well recognised.</P>
      <P>Nothing offends human feelings so much as the use of methods of torture, particularly when used for the purpose of forcing so-called confessions and so-called admissions of guilt which are perversions of truth.  Cardinal Mindszenty, knowing in advance the methods that would be employed, and knowing how they were operated against others, warned the people of Hungary and, indeed, of the whole world, that if confessions were to be made by him, these confessions could not be taken as voluntary or the truth.  He warned the people that any such confessions could only be those wrung through the destruction of his real self and as a result of the attacks made by infamous methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that his warning had the fullest foundation.  We know what has <Col N="39" /> happened.  We sympathise deeply with him and with the people of Hungary.  We appreciate that the majority of them would rise up and end the present situation had they the power to do so.  We know that those powers which might have been strong enough through the world organisations to put an end to this situation have not done that or, at any rate, have not done so up to this.  Through our own history we have some knowledge of what religious persecution can be. When we read of the events that are taking place on the Continent of Europe, we read with the understanding of a people who know what happened in their own country in the past. The methods used to-day are not those that were used heretofore.  They are more infamous still.  The general attempt to compel people to abandon their religious beliefs and to abandon what is dearer to them than life itself is similar in character to that which obtained in our own country at certain stages of our history.  We of all peoples fully appreciate then what is being attempted.  We fully realise how infamous are the methods adopted.  We hope that the people of Hungary will not suffer too long.  We hope that help will come to them speedily so that those who wish to live in accordance with Christian traditions may be enabled so to do.</P>
    <P>That is my hope.  That is the hope of every Deputy here.  That is the hope of all our people, and I am sure that it is the hope of all right-thinking people throughout the world.  We have no difficulty in voting for this motion. As the Taoiseach said at the outset, it is altogether exceptional.  I hope that this fact will itself demonstrate how iniquitous in our opinion is the trial of this great Catholic prelate, and how intolerable are the conditions under which the people of Hungary now live.</P>

      <P>This Order is similar to that operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The purpose of the Order is to synchronise our time with Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Some time ago an inquiry was held into summer time and in the report of that inquiry it was recommended that the same time should operate here, provided that the Government of Great Britain and the Government of Northern Ireland made an Order regulating summer time, so that there might be no difference between our time and the time obtaining in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  In making this Order, we are accepting the report presented, and it means that the same times will operate in this country as in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that postal, train and shipping times will be the same in the two countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Away back in 1915, this matter of the altered time first came into operation, when a difference of 25 minutes was provided for.  I do not know who got the idea that it would confer a great benefit&mdash;some theorist in middle Europe, or somewhere else, I expect&mdash;but it was put across and put into force by the then British Government. At a later stage, a further hour was added and that position has been accepted by the various native Governments in this country.  I am at a loss to know what are the arguments for it. I am at a loss to know what are the great reasons for it, or what are the great savings that will accrue to the country as a result.  It is all very well to say that we must agree to it in order that our time will synchronise with the time in Northern Ireland and in England, but there are other considerations which should be taken into account before we follow suit in the matter.  I often wondered why, if we wished to have the times synchronising, we could not do it by another method &mdash;by Government Departments, transport companies and all the others concerned commencing work an hour earlier&mdash;rather than by advancing the clock.  That method would be much more acceptable, so far as the agricultural community are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not alleging anything against the present Minister &mdash; I am merely voicing what I felt during the term of office of similar Ministers under previous Governments.  We have a position now in which the time is advanced <Col N="43" /> not merely by an hour, but by an hour and 25 minutes, as compared with 1915.  The period during which this new time order operates is the period when the farmers are most concerned with the sowing and harvesting of their crops.  There are various other sets of workers whose conditions of employment are, if not provided for in the Conditions of Employment Act, well guarded by their organisations, and for the farmer, particularly in the harvesting season, the best part of the day is the period from 5.30 until 7.30 or 8 o'clock on a summer evening.  It is all very well to say that farm labourers do not go to work as early as other workers.  In some parts of the country they go to work as early as, if not earlier than, road workers and other persons employed on public employment schemes.  I want to bring to the Minister's notice and to the notice of the House that that has a very serious effect on those engaged in agricultural production.  Whether it is the hired worker on the farm or the members of the farmer's family, the fact that they see these people going home, their day's work finished at 5.30 in the evening at the very time which is most useful to the farmer, particularly in the harvesting season, has a very dampening effect on the energies and work of the people engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it, too.  I do not claim to be an expert by any means, or to know very much about health matters, but we are spending millions of pounds, and there is a clamour for the spending of more, on improving the health of our people and preventing disease.  I do not think that the operation of this new time is in any way helpful in the matter of giving us a healthy people.  It is all very well for the people in the cities whose children can go to the nearest school by bus or tram at a cost of a penny each morning, but I am thinking of the children of the rural community who live three and four miles in many instances from the national school.  These children have to be in school about 9.45 a.m. That hour corresponds to the time of 8.20 a.m. when we were youngsters, and in order to have them in time for school <Col N="44" /> they have to be wakened about 6.30 a.m., that is the normal 6.30 a.m. of our time.  I hold that that is far too early an hour to get children of six, seven, eight and nine years out of bed.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Why should they not go to bed in time?&rdquo;  As the old saying goes, it is impossible to put them to bed at the time the hens go.  If they were put to bed at that time, they would not go off to sleep.  They go to sleep according to nature's own time. It is a humbug to be wasting so much money on health services while at the same time we are doing something which is most injurious to the health of the children.</P>
    <P>I will be told, I am sure, by the present Minister for Justice much the same as I was told by previous Ministers for Justice, that this is a matter for arrangement between the managers, the teachers and the parents.  We know very well that the teachers are human just the same as everybody else and that they are quite anxious to enjoy a few hours of sunshine in the evening.  That is well known to the parents and even though it might be the feeling of the parents&mdash; as I am quite sure it would be if a plebiscite were taken&mdash;at the same time they do not want to do anything that might rile the teacher in any way. After all, the teacher is either living within 100 yards of the school in his residence, or if he has no residence he is living in some town a distance away and has a motor car to bring him to the school.  It would be no great inconvenience or loss to him, but certainly those children who have to travel distances of two or three miles, as I know, on Shank's mare at that early hour in the morning, must be called out of bed at an unnatural hour; and that is causing untold hardship to the health and physique of the rising generation.</P>
    <P>I have not discussed this with any members of my own Party.  I expect their views are divided upon it and I am expressing my personal opinion. The sooner this Order is set aside the better, unless we are given strong, logical arguments to show how it is benefiting the country materially, financially and physically.  Otherwise, an Order of this kind should not be made; <Col N="45" /> and if this House had the interest of the rural community at heart, it would not agree to the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We hear it said very often that agriculture is the principal industry of this country.  I would like to remind the Minister and Deputies that agriculture must be carried on in accordance with nature.  Nature regulates the time of the rising and setting of the sun and so regulates the time when agricultural operations should be carried on.  The proposal at the moment is more or less a detail&mdash; to synchronise the coming into operation and the ending of summer time with that in operation in Great Britain and the north-eastern counties of Ireland. The whole principle of summer time as applied to those engaged in our principal industry is unnatural.  Just imagine a farm worker endeavouring to make hay during the summer months at approximately 6 o'clock in the morning by the sun.  The thing is unnatural.  The important time for harvesting work&mdash;it does not apply in the same way to spring work&mdash;is the afternoon and this new time is a great disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the disadvantages to the commercial and urban portions of the population.  I am sure that, if I belonged to any of those classes, I would be just as anxious as they for summer time, as in the cities people are glad to get out in the summer during the sunlight of the day. Even as a Deputy, I would be glad to have summer time, so as to escape from here three hours before midnight, as it would be if we had the original natural time of one hour and 25 minutes later than at present.  The agricultural community is at a disadvantage under this summer time regulation and I have no hesitation in saying that it causes a considerable amount of loss in crops at harvest time.  I would suggest that a further inquiry be undertaken to see if some other method could not be adopted to leave the agricultural industry at peace in the one sphere in which it can operate both profitably and smoothly, that is, in accordance with natural sun time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the speakers before me, I speak from the agricultural point of view.  I would like to bring other views before the Minister that do not seem to have been brought up before.  When this Act was introduced, it was known as the Daylight Saving Act in Britain and was then introduced for the purpose of saving light at a particular time.  In my opinion, there is no necessity for us to save light now in the cities.  If we take it from the city man's point of view, he closes his shop now at 5 or 5.30 in the evening, whereas in 1917, when this Act was introduced, his shop closed at 8 or 9 in the evening.  Possibly there was a case to be made then for a Daylight Saving Act, to increase the length of our day by an hour and save an hour's light.  These conditions do not obtain to-day.  We have changed, our shops have changed their hours of closing, and consequently there should be no necessity whatsoever for continuing this system of extending the light of the day by one hour into the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It affects agriculture very seriously at a particular time of the year, at haymaking and harvesting periods.  Men come into work in the morning at 8 o'clock the whole year round, as it is a standard hour, but when we come to the daylight saving period our hour is driven further and our men come in at 9 in one sense or at 7 in the other.  At 7 o'clock in the morning you cannot do agricultural work.  You cannot save hay, as there is a dew on the hay at that hour.  The same thing applies in the harvest time.  From the 1st June to the 1st October there is a dew in the morning, to defeat the Daylight Saving Act in so far as it was meant to help the people.  It may have helped those in the towns in the past, when you had a late closing hour, but that does not obtain to-day, when shops are closed in the City of Dublin at 5.30 in the evening.  There is no necessity for this extra hour as far as saving light is concerned, but there is a necessity in the country to remain at the old time, where men come in and start work immediately in order that you do not lose an hour one way or another.  The position, as I see it, is that if you have <Col N="47" /> this new time in the country you are losing this hour.  Consequently, I am opposed to what is known as the new time.  I agree with Deputy Beegan and Deputy O'Reilly in asking the Minister not to enforce this.  If there is no reason in our own country for enforcing it, do not enforce it because it suits somebody else to do so.  If you think it is for our benefit, then enforce it. Speaking as one coming from an agricultural community, however, I say do not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years I have on every possible occasion been advocating that this Summer Time Order should be discontinued.  I am glad that there are quite a number of Deputies in the House who share my views on that matter.  I have often wondered why we, in an agricultural country, allow ourselves to be dictated to in a matter of this kind by purely city interests.  Nothing as much as this system of time, which is altogether contrary to our interests and to our way of life, reveals the inferiority complex of the whole rural community.  As Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out, the people who work in the agricultural industry work close to nature and nature cannot be dictated to by manmade laws.  No Act of the Dáil will compel the sun to rise an hour later or to set an hour later than it does at present.  I think it is time that the Minister who, I know, has a very sympathetic view in regard to rural matters and who understands rural life just as well as anyone, should have this whole matter reviewed.  He should try and bring our time into conformity with what is necessary and desirable for agriculture.  Some people will say that those in rural Ireland who do not like this summer time can ignore it and go on with their work just as they have done heretofore.  That is all right in theory but it is rather difficult in practice.  To begin with, as it has been pointed out, the law provides for this change of time.  Professional people, such as teachers, who find that this change is advantageous to them, will press very strongly to have it brought into effect.  It is difficult for people in rural Ireland to resist that demand. <Col N="48" /> In the same way people working for local authorities, county councils and in factories, will also insist on summer time as it gives them a longer evening. Thus we have a number of people working this summer time and the difficulty of people in the scattered rural areas resisting the change becomes all the greater.</P>
      <P>With regard to children, the position is particularly objectionable.  If people in the rural areas continue to work according to the old time, it means that the children go to bed at the old time; but if the schools open at the new time the children have to rise in the morning an hour earlier.  That means taking one hour off their rest and that fact cannot be disputed.  There is also a considerable amount of confusion prevailing. People are told that a bus arrives at a certain time and they have to inquire whether it is the new or the old time.  As a matter of fact, I introduced a farmer into the Gallery of this House and he found it necessary to ask whether the time the Dáil was going by was the old or the new time. This state of confusion is undesirable and unnecessary.  There is no national or economic advantage in having this summer time.  We do not save electricity by it as some people have pointed out.  A summer day is short enough; it ends at 6 in most industrial occupations.  It ends at 7 or 8 in practically all business houses, and, therefore, closing an hour earlier saves no light.  It might, perhaps, save an hour's light in the public houses, which are open until 10.30 p.m.  That would be only a very insignificant saving and against that we have all those disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might, of course, be contended that it would be a disadvantage to have a different scale of time from that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I think we ought to assert our independence in this matter.  We have, so to speak, kicked the British Crown into the Irish Sea.  Why not kick the English clock into the Irish Sea also and adopt our own time here?  If trading and transport conditions require that all clocks should be set by the same time, why do the British not insist that the Americans go by British time? <Col N="49" /> There is as much, if not more, commercial and passenger traffic between Great Britain and the United States as there is between Great Britain and Ireland, but nobody suggests that those two countries should adopt the same time.  I think, therefore, that there is no case for summer time as far as this country is concerned and since there is no case for it, the logical thing to do is to discontinue it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the proposal made here against summer time.  It is rather peculiar that the Government of this country seems to be catering only for the favoured few, or this Dáil is always catering for the city as against the country.  You have the same thing in regard to Licensing Acts and you have the very same conditions as regards this proposal.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the milk of this country is now sold in liquid form in cities and towns.  Once you come on to summer time, it means that those farmers and their men must be clear an hour earlier in the morning.  During the summer and the harvest time, men have to be in the yard at 6 o'clock to milk the cows.  The milk must be sent off and the men come back at 9 a.m. new time and they cannot work on the hay field before 11 a.m.  They lose very precious time during the hay season and the harvest season owing to the same thing.  That is a major consideration and I cannot see any justification for it.</P>
      <P>Of course, I am one who has given up hope of seeing anything like common sense in this House.  I never saw it yet and I do not expect I ever will&mdash;in so far as the country people are concerned anyway.  I have seen Deputies here, even Deputies like the Minister, representing rural constituencies coming in and saying that the city fellow should have his pint and that the countryman I represent should not.  This Order is what might be described as a continuation of that attitude of mind towards the ordinary country community, and I cannot see any justification for it.  I can see no good in it.  I cannot see anybody standing up in this House to defend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather surprising to hear Deputies from the other side objecting to the enforcement of summer time.  For a long period now we have had summer time and we still have the same sun, the same summers and the same country.  So far as the rural community are concerned&mdash; and I would be interested in anything conducive to their convenience and welfare&mdash;I do not think it bothers them one way or the other, whether they have summer time, old time or new time.  It is perhaps a fact that in some districts where they may have to attend creameries and deliver milk&mdash; a matter in which Deputy Corry of course would be interested&mdash;they may have to rise a bit early.  So much the better, because I believe that in this country we sleep too much.  Farmers generally would be much better off if they were out earlier and so would all of us.  I think the time has come in this country, if we want to make any progress, when we must get out early and even work later.  If the enforcement of summer time is regarded as being beneficial or necessary for that purpose, I see no reason why it should not be continued.  In all other States in Europe summer time was enforced whenever it was considered necessary for the benefit of the people, especially during the emergency periods.  We still have a period of emergency and therefore I think we should continue anything which we consider necessary <Col N="51" /> in order that we may work in harmony with neighbouring countries with which we have dealings of a commercial type and in order also to facilitate the passage to and fro of people from these countries.  I fail to see how anybody should object at this period to the enforcement of summer time or how it affects the farming community because, as I say, except in a few cases they regulate their own time.</P>

      <P>Since the embattled farmers are all aligned against the Minister I should like to say a few words in his defence.  It was a builder who first introduced the Summer Time Act and my experience in the building trade enables me to say that it has been a very valuable Act for the building trade.  Listening to the speeches of farmers, not merely on the Fianna Fáil side but on the other side of the House, it would seem that anything that would lengthen the day would be valuable because we hear so many long speeches.  I have always regarded the present Government as a Government of subterfuge and this is a very justifiable subterfuge&mdash;the idea of getting us up a bit earlier in the morning.  I do not believe for a moment it will injure the health of the people.  I think it is a very valuable thing and I give the Order my entire support.</P>

      <P>I certainly consider myself an early riser but I do not know what that has to do with it.  When I was living in an agricultural community down in County Cavan, not very far away from Deputy O'Reilly's district, we did get up very early in the morning in my young days.  I agree with Deputy Palmer that it is necessary that more people in this country should get up early in the morning.  There is too much laziness, too much of the habit of sleeping in bed in the morning when people should be out.  My principal object in rising, however, is to point out that old ideas die very hard.  For the last 34 years we have been listening <Col N="52" /> to the type of objections raised here to-day by Deputy Beegan, Deputy Corry, Deputy O'Reilly, Deputy Cogan and other Deputies who have spoken. They have been at it for 34 years and they are not beaten yet.  It reminds me of what happened when the date of Christmas was changed.  You had at that time also quite a volume of opinion which adhered to the old date for quite a considerable period.  The same thing applies in this instance.  It is the same type of mentality which says that you always thresh your wheat or oats best when you use an old flail. Some people say that you get a better yield by threshing with the old flail and that you should not have anything to do with up-to-date machinery.  We have heard Deputy O'Reilly suggest that we should try to run agriculture by the sun but not so very long ago I happened to see threshing mill contractors going out and working by artificial light in the middle of the night. That is not in accordance with nature but it is in accordance with common sense.</P>
      <P>This motion is based on common sense.  The statute of 1925 gives the Minister power to make the Order.  I have not looked up the statute and I hope I am correct, as I think I am, when I say that what we have to decide is whether we agree with the dates prescribed by the Minister in connection with this Order.  If we want to change the whole conception of the Act some Deputy should introduce a Bill to do away with the Summer Time Act of 1925.  That would be a straightforward way of disposing of it.  However, the Order is there.  The Minister has made the Order.  It is a sensible Order brought in for the purpose of synchronising the time between Britain and this country.  I understand that this arrangement is not confined to Britain and this country; I understand that it is adopted in many other countries in Western Europe.  I believe that the Orders made under this Act are very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Corry when he says that the people who live in the cities are the favoured few.  We in Dublin comprise at least one-fifth of the population of Ireland.  We are not a favoured few.  If you add to that the <Col N="53" /> population of Cork City, of Limerick City and of other citities and towns I think it cannot be said that we are the favoured few and that this motion is being introduced to benefit the favoured few.  It is not.  It is introduced to benefit the majority of the people of this nation and, therefore, I support it.</P>

      <P>Anywhere in the country. The people in the country rise earlier than any other section of the community. Deputy Palmer, and others like him who live in towns, goes to work at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m., by which time the farmer has half a day's work done.  I suggest that the Minister should extend the summer time period. I believe that it would be in the interests of the agricultural community to have the period extended from the 1st March to the 1st December each year.  I have seen summer time in operation amongst farmers and I never saw them any the worse for it.  They got their work done just as well as those who kept to the old time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand Deputy Beegan's objection and, in fact, the objection of anyone who comes from the West of Ireland to this motion.  We, in the East, are one hour and 25 minutes in advance of the sun.  In the West they are one hour and 40 minutes in advance of the sun.  The point must be kept in mind all the time that&mdash;in addition to the one hour and 25 minutes that we, in the East, require to bring us up to Greenwich mean time&mdash;there is a lag of 15 minutes in the West of Ireland. That is the difficulty which the people in the West of Ireland have in regard to this matter.  They are up in the middle of the night, according to summer time, if they like to think of it that way.  My belief, however, is that summer time is an advantage to the agricultural community just as it is <Col N="54" /> an advantage to every other section of the community.  It is particularly so at this time of the year and in the late autumn.  In the months of October and November a farmer will have more daylight during which he can work in the fields, if summer time is in operation during the whole of these months. I would ask the Minister to consider, for future reference, my point about the extension of the period of summer time next year, if he should be the Minister who happens to be making the Order.</P>

      <P>The only purpose of this Order is to synchronise the time for a very short period, at the beginning of the Summer Time Order and the ending of it, between the two countries. Whether this Order is approved or not, the Summer Time Act of 1925 is not under review.  The Summer Time Act of 1925 will operate whether I like it or not until this Parliament changes or abolishes the Act.  The only question that confronts the House and on which it has to decide is whether summer time should commence on the 10th April or on the 3rd April&mdash;seven days&mdash;at the beginning of the period, <Col N="55" /> or whether it will finish on the 2nd October or on the 30th October. Deputy Allen says that he would like to see summer time in operation from the 1st March to the 1st December. The help that he has given me is very sound from the Ministerial point of view but it is not good from the point of view of the farmer and, as I am a farmer, I should like to be able to take his point of view.  However, all I am asking is that we will do this for the sake of everybody concerned.  When I say &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; I have in mind, among others, the farmers and the Dublin Cattle Market.  Mark you, if the cattle were an hour late to meet the train the farmers would not be pleased and if the prices were bad, because of some miscalculation of the time, the farmers would not be too pleased about it and they would ask why the Government did not avoid such a contingency by arranging the times in such a way that everybody could understand them.  I am not going to go into the arguments which have been made during this debate but I should like to remind the House that the Order is made under Section 3 (2) of the Summer Time Act of 1925, Section 1 of which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister for Justice may, whenever it appears expedient to him so to do, by Order appoint that the period appointed by this Act or by any previous Order made under this section to be the period of summer time for the purpose of this Act shall, either generally or in any particular years or year, not be the period of summer time for that purpose, and that in lieu thereof some other period specified in such Order shall, either generally or in such particular years or year (as the case may require), be the period of summer time for the purpose of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section under which I am making the Order is sub-section (2) of Section 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An Order made by the Minister for Justice under this section shall not come into operation unless or until it has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, <Col N="56" /> but such Order when so approved shall have statutory effect as an amendment of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In introducing the motion, I said that I was giving effect to the report of the Summer Time Committee set up by my predecessor in 1941.  Evidence was received by that committee from every section of the community.  The committee was representative of business, farming and labour&mdash;a very good committee. They made a recommendation that the Minister should retain summer time but that, if the British changed the time or the period, the Minister should make a similar Order.  The wording of the recommendation is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that the British Government made a similar change, the period of summer time should be extended so as to commence on the 1st day of April and end on the first Sunday in November.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Because of the Order that the British have made, which is that summer time should commence on the first Sunday of April and end on the last Sunday of October, I have made a similar Order. That is for the better management and arrangement of the affairs between the two countries and for the convenience of everybody.</P>
    <P>On the question of schools, which Deputy Beegan raised, everybody knows that whatever time is decided by the local manager is the time that shall operate.  The Minister for Education has given an instruction to that effect.  If Deputy Beegan has any difficulty, let him use his good offices and influence with the local manager so that the children about whom he is so perturbed will not have to get up too early.  If he uses as much persuasion with the manager as he used in the Dáil, I am sure it will be effective.  I do not think that any school teacher is anxious to get up too early in the morning, because he is tired after a long, arduous day.  The teacher and the children, I believe, are probably of the same frame of mind, that the later they get in and the earlier they get out, the better they would like it.  As I have said, I shall not follow all the arguments that were used.  I am glad that Deputy Moylan <Col N="57" /> has pointed out that the Summer Time Act was designed by a builder.  There is much building required in the world to-day and I trust that the plan of the builder will be given effect to by the Summer Time Act or by the endeavour of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I move that the Order&mdash;not the Summer Time Act&mdash;the Order made <Col N="58" /> under the Act by the Minister for Justice, be approved by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is being introduced to amend and extend the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts 1929 and 1934 and to repeal the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1939.  The general purpose of this measure is to make more money available for Gaeltacht Housing and to bring the level of the grants available under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts into line with the revised grants for which provision has been made under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Gaeltacht) Act, 1929, which was the first and principal Act passed by the Oireachtas to cater for the special housing requirements of the Gaeltacht, made provision in respect of grants and loans for one quarter of a million pounds (£250,000).  Subsequently under the amending Acts of 1931, 1934 and 1939 further moneys were made available which brought the aggregate sum by way of grants and loans for housing in the Gaeltacht to three-quarters of a million pounds (£750,000).  Under the present Bill it is proposed to increase this amount by a further sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds (£150,000), thus increasing the aggregate amount available under the Acts to nine hundred thousand pounds (£900,000).  This is being done under Section 2 of the Bill. The balance remaining from the £750,000 referred to is approximately £90,000.  This balance together with the provision of £150,000 proposed under this Bill, will give us a total provision of £240,000 for new grants and loans for housing in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, the grants available under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts for persons erecting houses for their own occupation were up to the time of the passing of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, greater than those obtainable under the general Housing Acts.  By Section 3 of this Bill I propose to restore the differential in favour of applicants from the Gaeltacht.  Under sub-section (1) (a) of Section 3, I propose to increase the grants in respect of dwelling-houses, the erection of which commenced on or after the 1st day of November, 1947, to the sums specified in the First Schedule to this Bill.  The maximum grants which could be made heretofore were related to the aggregate rateable value of all the property of the applicant. They were: (a) £90 where the aggregate rateable value did not exceed £5, (b) £85 where the aggregate rateable value exceeded £5 but did not exceed £10 and (c) £80 where the aggregate rateable value exceeded £10.  For the future, I propose that the making of grants on a valuation basis shall be discontinued in respect of applications sanctioned under Section 3 of this Bill, and that the grants in respect of dwelling-houses the erection of which commenced on or after 1st November, 1947, will be as follows: Where sewerage and piped water supply are not available: (a) for a house with three rooms, £150; (b) for a house with four rooms, £200; and (c) for a house with five rooms or more, £250.  For similar roomed houses where sewerage and piped water supply are available, the grants will be (a) £200, (b) £250, and (c) £300.</P>
      <P>The maximum improving grant under the present Acts is £40.  Sub-section (1) (b) of Section 3 provides for the increase of this improving grant to a maximum of £80, in the case of an improvement or extension commenced on or after 1st November, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new housing grants of sub-section (1) (a) of Section 3 represent an increase in each case of £25 over and above the maximum grants available for similar houses under the Housing (Amendment) Act of 1948.  The increased improving grant provided for <Col N="61" /> in sub-section (1) (b) of Section 3 is the same as that available under that Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 3 makes provision for grants in respect of dwelling-houses the erection of which commenced on or after the 1st November, 1945, but which were not occupied on or before 1st November, 1947.  The amounts of these grants, which are specified in the Second Schedule to this Bill, will be as follows:&mdash; Where sewerage and piped water supply are not available (a) for a house with three rooms, £105; (b) for a house with four rooms, £140; and (c) for a house with five rooms or more, £175.  For similar roomed houses where sewerage and piped water supply are available the grants will be (a) £140; (b) £175 and (c) £210.  These grants, which are to be made available irrespective of rateable values, represent an increase in each case of £17 10s. over and above the maximum grants available in similar cases under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>I also propose in this Bill to increase the amount in the case of an improving grant where the application therefor was made before the 1st day of November, 1947, and where the improvement or extension, in respect of which the application was made, was commenced but not completed before the 1st November, 1947.  In sub-section (3) (a) and (b) of Section 3, I am making a provision to have the improving grant in such cases increased to £60. This is in line with what has been done under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 3 is self-explanatory. As I mentioned earlier, I propose that the making of grants by reference to aggregate rateable value will be discontinued in respect of future sanctions.  This sub-section is inserted to cover my proposal in this regard.  It provides that the amount of any grant which may be sanctioned under Section 3 of this Bill will not be subject to the limitations imposed by the relevant sections of the 1929 and 1934 Acts, whereby the amount of the individual grant was governed by the aggregate rateable value of all the property of the applicant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> As the Acts stand at present, a person to whom a grant has been made may also be provided with a loan when it is apparent that the assistance given by way of grant is not sufficient to enable the work of house erection or improvement to be undertaken.  In the case of the erection of a new dwellinghouse the maximum loan which may be sanctioned at present is £80.  I propose in Section 4 to increase the amount of this loan to a new maximum of £100. In this connection, I am providing in the Second Schedule of this Bill for the repeal of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the 1934 Act which limited the aggregate amount of building grant and loan in any individual case to £160, as such provision could no longer apply in the altered circumstances.  No change is being made in the amount of the maximum loan of £40 which is available in cases of improvement or extension of existing dwelling-houses.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the cessation, after the enactment of this Bill, of the sanctioning of grants for the erection of poultry-houses and piggeries.  In order to provide for any cases where the sanction has already been issued and where the work has not so far been completed the relative sections in the 1929 Act are not being repealed. The Minister for Agriculture has agreed that provision in the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts for grants for poultry-houses and piggeries is no longer necessary in view of the general farm buildings scheme being administered by his Department, under which larger grants are available than those provided for under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.</P>
    <P>Following on Section 5, provision is being made in Section 6 to repeal sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 7 of the 1929 Act.</P>
    <P>These sub-sections refer to poultry-houses and piggeries and made the granting of assistance for house erection or improvement conditional on the provision of suitable accommodation for the keeping of poultry and pigs.  Under Section 6, the whole of the 1939 Act is also being repealed. This Act dealt only with the aggregate amount provided by the Oireachtas for grants and loans, and is now superseded by Section 2 of the present Bill.</P>

      <P>The one great difficulty I find in rural areas with regard to housing by the small farmer or labourer who is enterprising enough to build a house for himself is the difficulty of getting materials.  Some time ago when building costs were not so high and materials were in better supply, it was possible for a man intending to build a house to make arrangements with the local builders' <Col N="64" /> provider to get materials.  That is no longer possible.</P>
      <P>Everywhere I find complaints from small farmers and labourers that they are unable to avail themselves of the grant or carry on their building because of the fact that they are unable to get material on credit from builders' providers.  That position obtains in my constituency, and I must assume that in poorer districts, such as the Gaeltacht, the difficulty is accentuated.  There used to be a system whereby certain contractors were appointed by the Gaeltacht Services under which it was possible for a man building a house in the Gaeltacht to get credits that were not available in any other part of the country.  I sincerely wish that the Minister will be able to ensure that such a system will obtain again.  There were certain people appointed in the Gaeltacht or, perhaps, I should say for the Gaeltacht, who were regarded as contractors and who would supply materials on credit to people building.  Now, since it has become impossible for people elsewhere to get such credit, I assume that this difficulty in the matter of credit is accentuated in the Gaeltacht.  The whole thing will be a complete failure unless the Minister again appoints these contractors, or in some other way ensures that people who intend to build houses can get the materials that they require on credit.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo agus traoslaím don Aire ar é a chur roimh an Dáil.  Tá buíochas mhuintir na Gaeltachta tuillte aige as an Bhille seo a thabhairt dúinn nó dhéanfaidh sé maith mhór do na ceantair bhochta sin.</P>
      <P>Tá sé anois fiche bliain díreach ó tugadh isteach an chéad Bhille den chineál seo agus is iomú athrú a tháinig ar an tsaol ó shoin.  Níl amhras narbh é sin ceann de na hAchta ab fhearr a tugadh isteach sa Dáil seo ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tugadh amach na céadta muiríneacha as sean-tithe salacha mí-fholláine agus tugadh tithe nua glana téagartha dóibh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Molaim an Bille go mór.  Is céim ar aghaidh é ar an chasán ceart.  Tá súil agam go mbroslóidh sagairt, dochtúirí agus oidí scoile muintir na Gealtachta <Col N="65" /> le iomlán tairbhe a bhaint as an Bhille seo.  Chuir na tithe seo cúl ar thinneas agus aicídeacha agus thug siad saol úr agus sláinte do shean agus óg a rinne cónaí iontu.</P>
    <P>Is maith is cuimhin liom fiche blian ó shoin an troid agus an saothar mór a chuir an Teachta O Mongáin as féin le deontais maithe d'fháil do dhaoine bochta an iarthair. D'éirigh linn deontas cheithre scór punt d'fháil nuair a tugadh isteach an chéad Bhille fiche blian ó shoin.  Dar linn gur mhaíth an deontas an méid sin san am a bhí ann.  Acht anois tá deontais suas go dtí £300 le fáil&mdash; deontais fiúntacha fearúla mar bheitheá ag dréim leis ó fhear mhór-chroíoch fláithiúil mar an tAire.  Tá cheithre scór anois ar theach a dheisiú agus má tá iasacht a dhíobháil tá £100 le fáil do réir an Bhille.  Ansin beidh an teach úr saor ó ghearradh ar feadh fiche blian ach cibé gearradh a bhí ar an sean-teach beidh croí agus uchtach ag na daoine bochta tithe a thógáil sa Ghealtacht anois nuair atá an rialtas ag tabhairt cuideadh chomh fiúntach dóibh.  Is feasach dom féin mórán t'aos óg sa Ghealtacht a phósfadh dá mbeadh teach cónaí acu.  Acht ní riarfaidh an Bille seo dóibh mura gcuirtear leasú leis.  Caithfidh siad fanacht go bhfuighidh an tseanbhunadh bas.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill now before the House will be welcomed generally by the people of the Gaeltacht.  They have waited a considerable time for its introduction.  The soaring costs of building materials nullified, to a large extent, the provisions in the previous Bill.  As soon as the war began that Bill was of little assistance to anybody who wished to build a house.  In view of the fact that the price of building materials continued to soar, we in the Gaeltacht felt that the Minister in this Bill would have gone further in the matter of grants and loans.  We welcome the increases, but in view of the fact that the Minister is dealing with people of very small valuations&mdash;dealing with landholders whose average valuation in the Donegal Gaeltacht is about 30/&mdash;one would have imagined that he would err on the side of <Col N="66" /> generosity in the Bill before us, which I may say, has been so very long delayed.</P>
      <P>The Gaeltacht Housing Act was of great benefit to the Gaeltacht.  As visitors to that area will have observed, it has changed the outlook there considerably. It has had the effect of providing really decent comfortable houses in place of the insanitary dwellings in which people had to reside prior to its introduction.  I hope that the Bill now before the House will have the same success as the earlier Act.  In saying that I ask the Minister to ensure that there is as little red tape as possible connected with the administration of this measure, and that in all cases he will speed up the issue of building certificates.  Now, if housing certificates under this measure are to be issued at the same speed as they are being issued under the Local Government (Housing) Act, I am afraid that the people in the Gaeltacht will derive very little benefit from this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The issue of building certificates under the Local Government (Housing) Act is proceeding very, very slowly.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to see that the grants are paid speedily.  The Minister, as I have said, will be dealing with people who have very little of this world's goods.  They cannot afford to sink a lot of money in the erection of a house unless the grants promised by the Government are speedily forthcoming. What, in my opinion, will make or mar this Bill is the speed at which grants are made available.  If the people of the Gaeltacht find that the grants are being held up in the same way as they are under the Local Government (Housing) Act then I am afraid that the housing drive under this measure will be a very small one.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister, but I am very sorry that, in the matter of grants and loans, he has not gone further when dealing with the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down said that we have waited a considerable time for the introduction of this Bill.  We have, but the fault did not lie with the present Minister or the present Government.  At <Col N="67" /> the time that the last Government increased the grants for ordinary housing schemes, I fail to see why they did not make the provision for housing in the Gaeltacht that the Minister for Lands is now making.  I think it was a very serious matter that that did not take place at that time.  It was a source of grievance for the people living in the Gaeltacht and it has inflicted on them a hardship which they do not deserve.</P>
      <P>For those people who live in difficult conditions every provision should be made.  They should be given an opportunity of securing decent housing conditions.  That would be an incentive to keep them in the Gaeltacht areas and not have them, as they were for some years past, flying from those districts.</P>

      <P>I can assure you that the provision the Minister is now making for them will help to brighten their lives.  I fail to see why in the past something was not done in connection with the building of Gaeltacht houses. I also fail to see that more people are leaving the Gaeltacht now than the 150,000 who left during the 16 years the last Government was in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not refer to the numbers who left the Gaeltacht if it were not for the interjection of the Deputy.  The questions asked by Deputy Moylan were rather peculiar, coming as they did from the man who was responsible for this Department during the period his Party was in power.  If he did as well during his time as the Minister is doing now, we would have better housing conditions in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good point in this Bill that the farm building scheme will apply to the Gaeltacht and there will be better <Col N="68" /> loans and grants for that purpose.  It will not be compulsory on people to build poultry houses or piggeries, as was the case before.</P>
    <P>When inspectors visit the homes of those people who intend to build Gaeltacht houses, they are sometimes very strict about the Irish language.  I have known cases where they were unfair in their rewards because of the language. You can scarcely expect at this time, when the Irish language is declining, that all the household would have a thorough knowledge of it, but some inspectors insist on that before a grant is given.  I think the inspectors should use more common sense in that respect.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  He has brought it in at the earliest possible moment, and I feel sure that when it is enacted everything possible will be done to speed up the building of houses in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Applications were made on behalf of a few people who had been allotted land and who, in pre-war days, would be entitled to a house.  They were informed that for the present the Land Commission do not propose to go ahead with the building of houses for these people.  I am making the point that, if that is so, these people might be given an opportunity of obtaining houses under this particular legislation.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Palmer with regard to inspectors.  I know of a case where the inspector refused to sanction a grant because the lady of the house did not have Irish, although other members of the household spoke excellent Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out what happened, so as to prevent anything similar happening in the future.  There are cases where sanction was given under previous legislation for the building of houses, but the war intervened and the people could not go ahead.  I would like those people to qualify now under this measure.  They were granted certain concessions a year or two years ago. A few of them commenced operations but they had to postpone the work.  I ask that these people should be given the maximum grant now.  These cases should be reviewed and these people should be allowed to qualify for the maximum amount available under this legislation.  There are such people in my district, and I make that case on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I observe a great improvement in this measure.  The grants have been increased.  It is legislation that undoubtedly will be welcomed in the country and I must congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deserves to be welcomed in so far as it remedies the unfair position that existed.  There is this difficulty, that one had hopes of better financial provisions.  This Bill, as it reads now, gives a person building a house in the Gaeltacht £15 more than that person would receive if he were building a house under the Local Government Housing Act through a public utility society.  In the case of a reconstruction grant, it gives just a similar amount, £80.  I suggest to the Minister that the reconstruction grant should be raised.  If £80 was the amount provided under the Local Government Housing Act, I suggest that the amount should be increased when we are dealing with places like Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am more anxious about is that one of the great advantages of the earlier Act was that materials were provided for applicants anxious to build houses.  There was a contract on behalf of Gaeltacht Services with the merchants to supply the materials.  I should like that system to continue, <Col N="70" /> because there was definitely a benefit for the applicants there.  I suggest that materials should be provided in the same way as in the past.  If that practice is continued, then the Bill is doubly welcome, though I should like to repeat that its financial provisions could be improved.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus bfhearr i bhfad go bhfanfadh cuid de na cainteoirí ar an taoibh eile gan bheith a rá nach ndearna an Rialtas a bhí ann cheana tada i dtaoibh tithe na Gaeltachta. Ar ndóigh, ceapann siad nach bhfuil ag daoine ach cuimhne gairid ar na rudaí seo.  Is cuimhin le gach duine gur thug an sean-Aire Rialtas Áitiúil Bille faoi thithe don tír ar fad isteach.  Agus ní raibh sé ach díreach rite tríd an Dáil nuair a cuireadh Rialtas Fhianna Fáil as oifig.  Chomh fada le mo chuimhne, ní raibh an Rialtas nua tar éis teacht isteach nuair a chuaigh an Bille sin don tSeanaid. Má deireann daoine gur fhág an tiarRialtas sin ceist tithe na Gaeltachta chun deire agus nach ndearnadar tada faoi, agus an t-eolas sin acu nach raibh seans ag Fianna Fáil é a thabhairt isteach, tá ceist agam orthu.</P>
      <P>Má tá oiread sin imní orthu, cad chuige ar fhanadar go cionn bliana ó thangadar isteach gan tada a dhéanamh faoin cheist seo?  Dá dtiocfadh Rialtas Fhianna Fáil ar ais tar éis an toghachán deireannach, bheadh an Bille seo ina Acht le suas le bliain anois.  D'fhanadar bliain gan faic a dhéanamh faoi thithe na Gaeltachta agus sin é an locht is mó atá agam ar an rud atá déanta ag an Aire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá locht le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta air, freisin, mar ní raibh aoinne sa Ghaeltacht ag súil leis an mBille seo. Béidir nach gcreideann an tAire sin, ach d'dhéadfadh sé é a ghabháil uaimse.  Bhí daoine sa Ghaeltacht nach raibh muinín ná dóchas acu go dtabharfadh an Rialtas seo an Bille seo isteach&mdash;agus cén t-údar a bhí acu leis an tuairim sin?  Is é an t-údar a bhí acu leis ná go raibh stopadh ar fad nó gearradh á chur ar sheirbhísí eile, agus gurb é polasaí agus beartas an Rialtais airgead a shábháil.  Níor chreid aoinne sa Ghaeltacht go dtiocfadh an <Col N="71" /> Bille seo isteach go ceann i bhfad. Cén toradh a bhí ar an bhfaillí seo a rinne an Rialtas?  Mar gheall ar an bhfáth nach raibh siad ag súil leis an mBille, b'éigean dóibh dul go dtí an Roinn Rialtas Aitiúil agus iarratas a dhéanamh faoin scéim sin&mdash;agus níl aon iasacht airgid ag dul le iarratas a déantar faoi scéim na Roinne Rialtais Aitiúil.  Tá na daoine bochta sin anois ag cur suas le haon deontas amháin&mdash; agus pé bith breis airgid a theastós uathu le tithe a chríochnú, caithfidh siad dul go dtí na bancanna nó go dtí siopadóirí.  Tá siad fágtha i leataoibh ar an gcaoi sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Palmer&mdash;níl tada agamsa in aghaidh an óráid a thug an Teachta Mac Pháidín mar bhí sé féireálta&mdash;agus thug sé na rudaí sin isteach, nach ndearna Fianna Fáil tada mar gheall ar an gceist seo.  Sin í mo cheist air&mdash;cad chuige ar fhan a Rialtas fhéin go gcionn bliana, agus an locht sin le fáil anois ag muinntir na Gaeltachta ar an Rialtas?  Tá cuid mhaith acu a raibh tithe ag teastáil uathú go géar, daoine nach raibh in ann tada a dhéanamh le linn an chogaidh, mar bhí gach rud gann.  Ansin thug an t-iar-Aire Rialtais Aitiúil an Bille isteach, agus ba Bhille mhaith freisin é.  Tá buntáistí i scéimeanna na Gaeltachta i gcónaí, go bhfuil iasacht ag gabháil leo.  Má tá tuille Teachtaí ar an taoibh eile le labhairt, ba mhaith liom go bhfreagódh siad an cheist sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, freisin, a insint don Teachta Palmer nuair dúirt sé gur chuidigh easba tithe le imirce as an tír agus go raibh na daoine ag imeacht as an tír, go bhfuil difir amháin idir scéimeanna tithe don Ghaeltacht agus scéimeanna tithe eile, agus is é difir é go bhfuil an deontas ag gabháil leis an gabháltas agus ní leis na daoine.  Mura bhfuil talamh ann, ní haon mhaith bheith ag cur isteach ar dheontas faoi scéim na Gaeltachta.  Agus má tá na daoine óga ag imeacht agus más é ceal tithe is cúis leis an imirce, ní réiteoidh scéim tithe na Gaeltachta an cheist sin mar níl sí inmholta.  Níl teideal acu le teach d'fháil faoi aon scéim ach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá locht amháin ar gach scéim de na <Col N="72" /> scéimeanna seo faoi thithe na Gaeltachta agus is é locht é sin go bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeadh sean-teach ar an ngabháltas.  Sul a rithfear an Bille seo tríd an Dáil, tá mé ag moladh anois don Aire go leasódh sé an Bille ar an gcaoi sin, nach mbeadh sé riachtànach feasta aon tsean-teach a bheith ar an ngabháltas.  Mar shompla, dá gceannóch dream óg gabháltais sa Ghaeltacht, nach bhfuil sean-tithe ar bith orthu, ba cheart go mbeadh sé ar chumas na lánúna óga sin deontas agus iasacht airgid d'fháil le teach nua a dhéanamh.  Sin locht mór atá ar an scéim ar fad agus tá súil agam&mdash;agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire é a dhéanamh&mdash;go scriosfar amach as an mBille seo é.</P>
    <P>Níl aon mhaith bheith ag insint don tír go bhfuil £300 le fáil ag duine sa Ghealtacht.  Tá a fhios ag gach duine sa Ghealtacht nach bhfuil ach fíor-corr teach go bhfuil uisce ag teacht ann trí píobaí agus nach bhfuil dréineáil mar atá leagtha síos sa mBille seo ag aon teach ar fiú trácht air sa Ghealtacht.</P>
    <P>Os rud é go bhfuil ceist an valuation bainte amach as an mBille seo, béidir go dtiocfadh duine isteach anois faoi chuid a haon den Sceideal, duine a bhfuil £60 valuation aige mar níl teorann ar bith ar an valuation anois.  Béidir gur locht é sin, go mór mór déarfainn gur locht é ar chuid de na daoine a bhfuil siad ag freastal orthu&mdash;na daoine bochta.</P>

Má tá ar intinn ag an Aire glacadh leis an moladh sin, molaimse teideal an Bhille seo d'athrú agus an focal &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; d'fhágáil amach as.  Béidir go bhfuil sé deacair go leor ag an cigirí mar tá sé cheana.  Má tá tú ag dul ag glacadh le tuairimí a tugadh i dtaoibh an méid Gaeilge atá riachtanach le ceann de na deontais seo d'fháil, déanfaidh sé praiseach den scéal ar fad.  Ní dóigh liom gur maith an rud é na deontais a <Col N="73" /> bhí le fáil roimhe seo le tithe na gcearc agus tithe na muca a thógáil, a scriosadh amach as an mBille seo.  Tá sé ráithe ag an Aire&mdash;agus duirt an tAire Talmhaíochta freisin é&mdash;go mbeadh buntáistí anois ag lucht tithe na Gaeltachta as an Scéim na dTithe Feilme atá á oibriú faoin Aire Talmhaíochta. Tá a fhios ag an Aire Talmhaíochta, mar atá fhios ag an Aire seo, nach bhfuil aon tithe feirme a ndéanamh faoi láthair, agus nach bhfuil cosúlacht ar bith go mbeidh go gcionn i bhfad, ach tithe na gcearc amháín.  Agus má tá daoine anois ag iarraidh teach a dhéanamh do na muca, caithfidh said é a dhéanamh as a bpócaí féin.  Ní bheidh tada ag teacht ó Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta na ó Roinn na Talmhaíochta.

      <P>Tá mé ar aon intinn leis an Teachta O Floinn nuair a mheabhraigh sé don Aire go bhfuil go leor daoine sna Gaeltachtaí&mdash;tá sa Ghaeltacht san iarthar ar chuma ar bith&mdash;nach féidir leo aon deontas d'fháil faoin Rialtas Aitiúil ná faoi Sheirbhísí na Gaeltacha i ngeall ar nach bhfuil a gcuid talaimh socraithe.  Má tá sé ar intinn Choimisiúin na Talún socrú a dhéanamh ar na gabháltais, ní féidir leis an duine sin, nó aon duine den dream sa mbaile sin, nó ar an eastáit sin, aon deontas d'fháil &mdash;agus tá daoine fágtha sáthach fada mar sin.  Bhí sé sin ann le linn Fianna Fáil agus le linn Cumann na nGaedheal roimhe sin, agus tá siad fágtha fós.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire rud eigín a dhéanamh anois&mdash;tá Coimisiún na Talún faoina chúram, freisin&mdash;féachaint chuige go ndéanfar rud eigin i riocht is go mbeidh na daoine sin in ann na deontais d'fháil faoi scéim tithe na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní féidir leo aon rud a dhéanamh leis na tithe nó na gabháltais nuair nach bhfuil a fhios acú cá mbeidh a gcuid talún féin.  Is maith liom gur choinnigh an tAire sa mBille seo an bhuntáiste atá ag tithe na Gaeltachta thar na tithe eile.  Ná ceapadh aon duine go bhfuil an tús níos mó nó níos fearr ná an tús a bhí ag na daoine seo faoin sean-Bhille.  Tá anois £15 sa mbreis le fáil ag daoine faoin scéim seo thar mar atá le fáil faoin scéim <Col N="74" /> Rialtais Áitiúil.  Roimhe seo, sul a dtáinig an dá Bhille isteach, bhí £10 sa mbreis le fáil ag duine as an nGaeltacht thar duine eile.  Bhi £90 do dhuine sa Ghaeltacht in aghaidh £80 do dhuine faoin scéim Rialtais Áitiúil. Anois tá £15, sin £250 in aghaidh £235. Ní cúis gaisce ar bith an difir sin, ach is maith liom go bhfuil an difir ann.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile ba mhiam liom a iarraidh ar an Aire.  In Alt 3, fo-alt (3), tá sé leagtha síos mar seo&mdash;áit ar bith a raibh feabhsú déanta ar theach agus go raibh iarratas isteach roimh an chéad lá Shamhna 1947 agus go raibh an feabhsú túsaithe, go bhfuil £60 le fáil air.  Is í an cheist atá mé a chur ar an Aire, cad chuige a bhfuil sé riachtanach iarratas a bheith istigh ag an duine sin roimh an chéad lá Shamhna. Má tá cigirí na Roinne sásta go ndearna duine feabhsú ar an teach, agus go mór mór nuair nach raibh sé ag súil le aon Bhille nua faoi Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta, cad chuige a bhfuil sé riachtanach an t-iarratas a bheith istigh aige?  Má tá an feabhsú déanta aige, nach leor é sin má chuireann sé iarratas isteach tar éis an chéad lá Shamhna 1947? Molaim don Aire go leasódh sé an Bille, i riocht is go mbeidh fear a dhéanfas an t-iarratas tar éis an chéad lá Shamhna, 1947, i ndon an deontas sin £300 d'fáil, chomh maith leis an duine go bhfuil an t-iarratas curtha isteach aige roimh an lá sin.</P>
    <P>Cuirim mo ghuth le guth na ndaoine eile a mhol an Bille seo.  Is maith liom go bhfuil sé tugtha isteach&mdash;deireannach is uilig mar tá an tAire leis.  Sin é an locht is mó atá agam air, gur fhan an Rialtas blian gan tada a dhéanamh. Tá dhá thuairim ag daoine faoin moill sin.  Tá daoine a admhaíonn go raibh an Rialtas ag iarraidh airgead a shábháil&mdash;agus tá airgead bliana sábhálta acu air sin.  Tá daoine eile ann agus ceapann siad, dá dtabharfaí an Bille seo isteach ró-lua tar éis an Rialtas nua a theacht isteach go mbéidir go mbeadh cuid den chreidiúnt ag dul don tsean-Rialtas.  Is mór an trua go ndeanadh an mhoill, mar tá daoine anois agus ní féidir leo athrú ó scéim eile go dtí an scéim seo agus tá siad anois ag iarraidh na tithe a dhéanamh gan cúnamh d'fháil mar iasacht.  Molaim an Bille agus deirim leis an Aire go bhfuil súil agam go <Col N="75" /> ndéanfaidh sé maitheas do na daoine seo.</P>

      <P>Fiche bliain ó shoin, nuair a cuireadh an tAcht seo i bhfeidhm an chéad uair, fuair Mícheál Og MacPháidín agus mé féin anró mór alt faoi leith fháil don Ghaeltacht faoin Rialtas a bhí ann an t-am sin.  Ach sa deire ghéill siad dúinn agus cuireadh alt don Ghaeltacht ar bun.  Gan aimhreas, ba é an chéad rud a thaspáin don Ghaeltacht go raibh Rialtas dóibh féin acu mar d'oibrigh siad uile go cruaidh ag tógáil na dtithe dóibh féin. An chuid is mó acu, tar éis go raibh iasacht airgid le fáil, níor thóg siad mórán den iasacht.  Rinne siad na tithe as a saothrú féin agus as an deontas a bhí ag dul dóibh.  Na hAchta Rialtais Aitiúil i dtaobh tithe, a bhí ann roimh an Acht atá anois ann, ní raibh mórán maitheasa iontu le haghaidh na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfidh an tAcht seo cloch chóipeála ar an Acht a chuaigh roimhe.  Tá an deontas atá le fáil againn go hiontach ach ní hé an deontas amháin ach an méid eile atá ag imeacht lena chois.  Ní bheidh aon rátaí faoi leith ar na tithe seo go ceann fiche bliain.  An luacháil a leagfar ar na tithe seo, timpeall trí puint ar a laghad.  I mbliana i gContae na Gaillimhe beidh na rátaí seacht scilleacha fichead agus réal, mura mbeidh siad níos mó, sa phunt.  Acht fágaimís na 27/6 iad sa phunt.  Trí 27/6 sin £4 1s. 6d.  Dá mbeadh 20 bliain ann sin £81 10s. 0d., in éindigh leis an deontas eile.  In éindigh leis sin ceannófar déantúisí an tí ó na siopadóirí faoi chonradh.  Sábhálfa sé sin ar a laghad ó £25 go £30.  In éindigh leis sin, fágfar an stuif ar foundation an tí.  Ní bheidh ar na daoine bheith ag cailleadh a n-aimsire ag dul go Gaillimh &mdash;40 míle óna mbaile&mdash;ag iarraidh a leithéide seo agus a leithéide siúd agus, b'fhéidir, tar éis é a ghealladh dhóibh nach dtiocfadh sé amach agus go gcaithfidís dul chuig nó sé huaire dá iarraidh.  Ach anois ní bheidh orthu dul á iarraidh.  Tógfa an fear a bheas os cionn an tí an liosta uathu agus cuirfear chucu é.  Tiúrfaidh sé sin misneach an domhain do na daoine. In éindigh leis sin gheobhaidh gach <Col N="76" /> uile dhuine acu iasacht suas go £100&mdash;é d'íoc ina leath-ghálaí gach aon bhliain go mbeidh sé íoctha, ach tá mé cinnte nach mórán acu a thógfas an iasacht. Na daoine bochta sin as an iarthar ní maith leo gad a chur faoina muinéal go gcinnfidh sé orthu.  An chuid is mó acu, tá siad deaslámhach agus beidh siad i ndon an obair a dhéanamh iad féin agus déanfaidh sé fir ceirde dhíobh chomh maith le gach aon rud eile.</P>
    <P>Níl aimhreas nach mó a rinne an tAcht seo a tugadh isteach fiche bliain ó shoin le deis a chur ar an nGaeltacht ná a rinne an C.D.B. a raibh moladh mór ag gach uile dhuine orthu.  Anois níl aon mhaith bheith ag caitheamh nár rinneadh níos mó dhóibh le deich mbliana anuas.  Ná bacaimís leis an ní atá imithe ach tagaimís le chéile agus déanadh gach uile dhuine againn a dhícheall le haghaidh an tAcht sea a chur i bhfeidhm sa spioraid céana a bhfuilimíd á fháil anois.  San Acht a caitheadh, ní raibh mórán &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; ag baint leis mar na daoine a bhí os a chionn Gaeilgeoirí a bhí iontu agus thug siad cúnamh an domhain le haghaidh gach rud a dhéanamh.  Anois má fuair muid an méid sin cúnaimh an t-am sin ó Aire as Contae Chiarraighe tá súil agam go bhfaighe muid an oiread céanna ón Aire atá anois ann as Contae Mhuigheo.</P>

      <P>Séard tá le rá agamsa mar gheall ar an mBille seo ná gur fearr go mall ná go bráth. Ba mhaith liomsa an cheist chéanna a chur ar an Aire a chuir an Teachta MacPhartoláin air: céard é fath na moille, cad na thaobh gur fhan an tAire agus an Rialtas blian leis an mBille seo a thabhairt isteach agus cad na thaobh ar fhágadar muintir na Ghaeltachta i muinín an Achta a cuireadh i bhfeidhm i 1947.  Tugtar Acht na dTithe, 1948, air, ach sa mblian roimhe sin a cuireadh i bhfeidhm é, do réir mar is cuimhin liomsa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl ach dhá rud le rá agam ar an mBille.  Bille í seo, an Bhille is fearr a tháinig ós ár gcomhair, le cabhair faoi leith, cabhair speisialta, a thabhairt do mhuintir na Ghaeltachta, sin iad na Gaeilgeoirí dúchasacha, agus ní d'aon duine ach iad san.  Tá cabhair de shórt eile le fáil ag Béarlóirí, ag muintir na Ghalltachta faoi na hAchta <Col N="77" /> atá dá gcur i bhfeidhm ag an Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil, ach déarfainn leis an Aire, agus iarraim go láidir air, gan glacadh leis an gcomhairle a fuair sé ón Teachta Palmer agus an Teachta O Floinn, gan aon bhogadh dhéanamh mar gheall ar an rial atá ann i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Ceapadh Achta na dTithe (Gaeltachta) chun cabhrú go speisialta le Gaeilgeoirí agus aon teach in aon Ghaeltacht atá ag lorg cabhair faoin mBille seo agus ná fuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga teaghlaigh ann, ní ceart go bhfuighdís cabhair faoin mBille seo.  Tá deontaisí eile faoi na gnathAchta le haghaidh tógáil tithe le fáil ag an duine sin agus ba chóir claoí leis an gcuspóir agus leis an aigne a bhí sna hAchta eile gan cabhrú le tógáil tithe sa Ghaeltacht in oibriú an Bhille seo.  Cuirim go láidir i gcoinne na moltaí a tugadh, go múchfaí na rialacha sin.  Tugadh sochar an Bhille seo dos na daoine a bhfuil sé tuillte acu, a bhfuil sé ar intinn é a thabhairt dóibh, sin iad na Gaeilgeóirí, agus fágadh na Béarlóirí i muinín na ngáth-Acht.  Ná bogtar an scéal d'aon teach in aon áit in aon Ghaeltacht sa tír, a bhfuil Béarla dá labhairt ann. Cuireadh an Bille seo i bhfeidhm i dtosach, chun cabhrú leis na daoine sa nGaeltacht agus chun cabhrú le buanú na Gaeilge san am chéanna&mdash; agus ná deantar a mhalairt.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile agam le cur ós comhair an Aire&mdash;is é sin méid na n-iasachtaí atá le fáil.  Ba chóir go mbeadh siad sin níos mó.  Do réir mar thuigimse, tá £80 le fáil, agus ba cheart don Aire é d'árdú go dtí £100.  Níl mórán difir idir na deontaisí seo faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltachta) agus na gnáthAchta, ach dá laghad an difir, beidh muintir na Gaeltachta buíoch dá bharr, agus tá súil agam go mbainfear an oireadh maitheasa as an mBille agus a baineadh as an sean-Achta.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an méid a dúairt an Teachta Donnchadh Ó Briain.  Is cuimhin liom, mar a duirt an Teachta Mac Pháidín agus an Teachta Ó Mongáin, nuair a cuireadh Acht Tithe na Gaeltachta i bhfeidhm ar dtúis, gur thug sé misneach dúinn uilig a raibh suim againn i gceist na Gaeilge.  Fuaireamar anmhisneach, gan amhras, agus fuair <Col N="78" /> muintir na Gaeltachta misneach nuair a tháinig cigirí óga agus oifigigh óga chúcu ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, daoine a bhí oilte ar Ghaeilge, a rinne a gcuid oibre trid an teanga náisiúnta.  Chun an Ghaeilge a choinneál beo sna h-áiteanna a bhfuil sí, táimid ag brath ar na daoine atá sna ceantracha seo ar dtúis, chun tuille cabhrach a thabhairt dóibh.  Agus, sa tarna háit, táimid ag brath ar an bhfoireann anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Ní raibh aon fhuireann níos fearr ná iad ná níos dílse don Ghaeilge, taobh amuigh den Roinn Oideachais.  Rinne siad an obair ar fad tré Gaeilge agus ní raibh aon bhaint acu leis na Béarlóirí.  Muintir na Gaeltachta a bhí i gceist agus rinneadh an obair ó thús tré Ghaeilge agus leanadh mar sin.  Ní bheadh aon chiall bheith ag brath ar Ghaeilgeoirí na Gaeltachta agus ar na daoine óga anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath ag oibriú na scéimeanna má táimid chun géilleadh sa bhunchuspóir, is é sin, pé buntáiste atá le fáil, trí dheontaisí, go mbeadh siad le fáil de bharr na Gaeilge, agus gan ligint do dhaoine nach bhfuil ag cleachtadh na Gaeilge dallamallóg da chur orainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá tuairimí maithe againn, trí chigirí scoile agus cigirí eile cé hiad na daoine atá ag cleachtadh na Gaeilge sa mbaile agus cé hiad na daoine nach bhfuil, agus tá discréid ag na cigirí má tá iarracht maith á dhéanamh, má tá duine amháin de na tuismitheoirí, gan aon locht air féin, gan aon Ghaeilge aige&mdash;duine, bean nó fear, ó leasmuigh a tháinig go dtí an áit&mdash;tá saghas leithscéil aige, ach más duine é a rugadh agus a tógadh sa Ghaeltacht, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon leithscéal aige.  Sílim nach n-éireodh, freisin, leis an scéim, mura gcuire an tAire suim faoi leith ann, agus mar mhol Teachtaí eile, breis ábhair, admhad agus eile, a chur ar fáil.  Tá roinnt ceanní maith san iarthair, atá i ndon dul i gcomórtas le haon cheanní anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus go dtí seo rinneadh socrú faoi leith leis na ceannaithe sin agus fuair na daoine an tadhmad agus na huirlisí eile go saor.  Bhí £10 freisin, mar a dúirt an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin, le fáil ag daoine a bhí an-bhocht ar fad, cuir i gcás, in áiteacha mar an Trágh Bhán i gConamara.  Mura bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an scéal ó chonnaic mise an <Col N="79" /> áit, déarfainn gur ar éigin atá daoine níos measa ná iad ó thaobh an tsaoil sa tír ar fad.  Tá a fhios agam freisin go bhfuil rudaí go han-dona in áiteacha i dTir Chonaill agus, is dócha, i gceantracha eile sa Ghaeltacht.  Is maith an rud é go raibh an £10 le fáil.  Is dócha nach fiú mórán £10 faoi láthair ach an am a chuireadh an chéad Acht i bhfeidhm is é an chúis a bhí leis ná chun slí a thabhairt do na daoine nach raibh feoirling acu tosú ar an obair agus an bhun-chloch a leagadh, mar adearfá. Tá ní eile, freisin, agus ba mhaith liom go dtiúrfadh an tAire miniú dhúinn faoi, go bhfuiltear chun an chuid sin den scéim a bhain le cró muc agus cró cearc a chur ar leataoibh mar tá na cróanna sin le fáil faoi scéim eile agus d'fhéadfaí a rá nach ndéanfaidh sin cúis.  Ach beidh ar na hiarrthóirí dhá achainí a dhéanamh&mdash; ceann do Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta faoi thithe conaithe agus iarratas eile a dhéanamh don Roinn Talmhaíochta. Is dóigh liom go dtiúrfadh Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta níos mó aire agus níos mó cúraim don obair sa Ghaeltacht, mar tá an tslí acu agus sin í an obair atá acu go speisialta, ná an Roinn Talmhaíochta. Agus, mura bhfuil an tAire sásta anois, sílim go bhfuighidh sé féin amach tar éis ama gur fearr i bhfad a rachaidh an dá rud le chéile mar tá oifigigh Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta ag dul mórthimpeall agus cigirí agus innealltóirí atá in ann pleannannaí agus mar sin a dhéanamh amach do na daoine bochta annsin agus sílim go mbeadh sé níos saoire sa deire.  Ach, ní hé sin an príomh-phoinnte ach go dtiocfadh níos mó as&mdash;go rachadh na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ar aghaidh leis na cróanna níos tapúla agus níos fearr dá mbeadh an taobh sin den scéim á oibriú faoi Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an scéim agus tá súil agam go n-oibreofar go maith í agus go mbeidh na daoine sásta glacadh leis na buntáistí sin.  Gidh gur éirigh go han-mhaith leis an scéim in áiteacha, tá áiteacha eile a bhfuil a lán drochthithe acu fós.  Má tá na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ag iarraidh daoine atá ag foghlaim na Gaeilge a choinneáil ar lóistín sa tSamhradh, ba chóir, ní hamháin go mbeadh tithe maithe acu, ach go mbeadh a lán rudaí eile acu atá <Col N="80" /> in easnamh sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair. Tá muintir Bhaile Atha Cliath oilte ar thithe maithe agus uisce reatha agus uirlisí eile nach bhfuil le fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom go molfaí go speisialta do mhuintir na n-áiteacha a bhfuil cuairteoirí ag dul isteach iontu chun an Ghaeilge d'fhoghlaim ní hamháin go mba cheart go mbainfeadh siad buntáiste as na scéimeanna seo ach go gcuirfidís tuille seomraí leis na tithe cónaithe.  Tá a lán déanta acu cheana féin in áiteacha agus bíonn cuid de na cuairteoirí go han-tsásta agus molann siad an aire agus an cúram a gheibheas siad.  Tá áiteacha eile nach bhfuil chomh maith.  Molaim don Aire an obair a bhaineann le saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a choineáil fána chúram féin chomh maith agus is féidir agus &ldquo;job&rdquo; ceart, mar a deirtear i gConamara, a dhéanamh den rud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is encouraging to note the way in which this Bill has been received by both sides of the House.  It is certainly a measure that can be recommended since its purpose is to fill a long-felt want on the part of the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan referred to the combined purchasing system under the old Acts.  That system will be resumed at once.  It was a system which was of considerable benefit to applicants under the Acts.  Should we find it impossible to resume that combined purchasing system that would, in my opinion, militate very seriously against the operation of this Act and the Act would have neither the benefit nor the advantage for those people that we would wish it to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies mentioned the erection of piggeries.  There was a certain amount of compulsion in the old Acts and it is proposed under this Act to leave that compulsion in abeyance. Deputy Bartley labours under the misapprehension that the Minister for Agriculture will not give these grants.  In my opinion the grants are fairly liberal.  In the case of poultry-houses £20 is given for 100 or more adult birds; £15 is given for 75, or more, birds; and £10 is given for less than 50 birds.  In the case of piggeries £20 is given for a double house, each <Col N="81" /> portion of which has an area of 100 square feet or over; £12 is given for a floor area of less than 100 square feet with a yard of not less than 100 square feet.  Under the old system for poultry houses and piggeries the maximum erection grant was £50 and the loan £2 and the maximum grant for improvement is £2 10s. and the loan £2 10s.  I think there is a very big difference in this present measure and it should certainly meet the situation. There might be cases where an applicant for a housing grant in the Gaeltacht would not find it convenient to erect either a piggery or a poultry house.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn mixed up the functions of the Land Commission with this Bill.  He referred to a townland in Kerry which the Land Commission is proposing to rearrange. Apparently the inspector told the proposed allottees there not to build until the holdings were rearranged. That is a precaution which has to be taken because a tenant might build on a portion of land which would subsequently be allotted to a neighbour. But that is not to be confused with the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Somewhat reluctantly, I bring it to the notice of the Deputy that his colleagues, whatever about himself, have contributed in large measure to that belief in the Gaeltacht areas.  I could quote cases where the people were advised to go to the Department of Local Government and not to wait for this Act, although it was common knowledge at the time that the Bill was in course of preparation. These people will now lose certain advantages.  They lose the benefit of the increased grant and the advantage that their houses would have been free of rates for 20 years as against seven years in the case of the grants given by the Department of Local Government.  All that was brought about by misleading propaganda on the part of Deputy Bartley's colleagues.

      <P>Deputy Breslin mentioned that he would like to see as little red tape as possible.  I can assure him that such will be the case.  I would <Col N="84" /> like to see all red tape cut away.  I give my word that there will be the least possible delay in the issue of these grants.  There will not be certificates issued in relation to Gaeltacht housing grants as there are in the case of local government grants.  Apparently Deputy Breslin's fear is that the poor people will be pushed out.  There is no danger of that.  Each case will be examined by the Minister on its merits.  Business people, owners of public houses and so on or those who are working and who ought to be able to get on without the aid of the grant, will definitely not get it.  As anybody can see there are no trappings or flag waving about the Bill.  It is intended primarily, and will be kept, for the very poor of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>Any Deputy interested in the question of the Irish qualifications will see that the section dealing with that is not tampered with.  It stands, and that is that.  There should be no doubt about that subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley also referred to the people who have no existing houses and asked why is it that they do not qualify.  I ask Deputy Bartley just to recall the very important work of another section of the Department.  If such assistance were granted, would it not go a long way towards increasing the congestion of that area?  At least, in a very short time that congestion would be aided and abetted by one section of the Department whose duty it is to abolish that congestion or to relieve it as far as possible.  The assistance grant is for the purpose of preventing congestion from arising in the Gaeltacht areas.  Many people would get a site&mdash;as we know, sites are not so very valuable in some of these areas&mdash;and many people could get set up in, perhaps, a small portion of land. Immediately you get a new congestion added to the list and a problem created there and then.  I am sure that if Deputy Bartley were Minister for Lands he would not condone that for a moment.</P>

      <P>I shall only keep the House a few minutes.  When this debate was before the House on the 1st December last, I set out my views. I think it was a great mistake that Deputy Cogan introduced this Bill.  I agree entirely with the principle that a man who has not merely the occupancy but also the title to his land a man who has vested land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill contains one sound principle; that a man who has, as I said, not merely the occupancy but also the title to the ownership of vested land should be paid a just and a fair price.  It is not the first time that that has been brought up in this House or in the other House.  It was brought up many times before and it was very unfortunate that when that absolutely just claim was being brought forward that it should have been modelled by Deputy Cogan on another principle over which it is impossible to stand. Deputy Cogan is trying to drag a red herring round Section 2 of this Bill.  He is trying to pretend to the people of Wicklow and anyone else who reads about it, that what he is asking for is fixity of tenure.  That is not the case. This Bill does not provide that.  This Bill would not provide it if it were passed.  This Bill, because Deputy Cogan has introduced Section 2 into it, has lost a chance which the farmers might have of getting a fair price if the net issue had been kept before the House in the proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Deputy's idea was in mixing up two parts but he has done a very great disservice to the farmers of the country in dealing with the matter in the way he has.  In effect, the result of his section, if passed, would be that the Land Commission could not under any circumstances operate at all.  I want to make it perfectly clear that while I am entirely and absolutely in favour of the principle that where, to remedy a social injustice, it is necessary to acquire the land of any farmer, that man should be paid the full and just price.  The only way to pay him a full and just price is to pay him the market value just as the market value has been paid since 1931 for resumed holdings. Equally we must remember there is a certain monopoly in land.  There is not as much land in the country as everybody would like, and where people do not make proper use of the land, particularly in regard to the giving of employment, there must be a loophole left by virtue of which the Land Commission can step in.  So far as I can appreciate the effect of this Bill&mdash;no <Col N="87" /> doubt the Minister will give us his view later&mdash;it would be effectively to prevent the Land Commission from stepping in to acquire any land anywhere at all in future.  I am not prepared to vote for it under such circumstances but I am prepared at all times to vote for the principle that a man should get a fair and just price for his land.  I hope the Minister will in the not too distant future be in a position to introduce to this House a Bill that will give the landowner that fair price, and that in giving a man with vested land a fair price he will base it on the same system on which resumption prices are fixed and have been fixed by virtue of the Acts of 1923 and 1931.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill.  Coming from an area in which such a high value is set on land, and believing that if this Bill were passed through the House, as presented, its effect would be to stop the Land Commission completely from working as it has worked for many years, I feel it my duty to utter a word of protest against the Bill and to inform the House and everybody concerned that I shall vote against it.  On the other hand, I can assure Deputy Cogan that I do not lay too much blame on him for bringing this Bill before the House.  Perhaps if he were a representative of a western area, as the Minister and I happen to be, his opinions might be moulded along the same lines as mine have been in an effort to get better concessions for the majority of his constituents.  It would seem from the terms of this Bill that Deputy Cogan represents an area the residents of which are almost entirely large farmers who do not wish to part with a single acre of their land for the relief of congestion or any other worthy purpose.  In his efforts to safeguard their interests, he is endeavouring to cut clean across the policy that has been operated by native Governments for the last 25 years and by an alien Government for 20 years prior to that in their desire to acquire land, to relieve congestion and to resettle as large a number of families as possible on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sections in this Bill <Col N="88" /> which is unlike many other Bills that have been presented here dealing with the Land Commission in previous years.  The first of these sections absolutely restricts the power of the Land Commission.  Any sensible person would realise that with land at its present value nobody is going voluntarily to allow a Government Department or anybody else to take away any portion of his land.  Under this Bill if a man owned even 10,000 acres unless the consent of the owner is given to its sale the Land Commission officials could remain in the same place as the officials of the Minister for Agriculture have now to remain&mdash;outside the fence. There would be no power of compulsion of any kind for the acquisition of land.  That is a state of affairs that would be intolerable and it is very wrong to ask the Land Commission to stand stock-still in the cleaning up of the rural slums and in the remedying of social injustices, simply because it might not suit one section or other of the people.  I can assure the House that I have very little confidence in the manner in which the Land Commission has been operated for 20 or 25 years past.  Its progress is slow enough as it is, but it would become absolutely stagnant and useless if its powers were further restricted.  If these powers were to be further curtailed, the effect would be to leave the congested farmers and the small landholders for all time in the state of poverty in which they have been sunk down the years and in that event it woud be much better to spend the money which is now allocated to the Land Commission on something else.</P>
    <P>So far as Section 3 is concerned I am not in full agreement with it, but I am not as opposed to that section as I am to the previous one.  There is no doubt whatever that the price paid by the Land Commission for quite a considerable time in the acquisition of land is not by any means satisfactory.  It does not represent by any means the real value of the land, but if the Land Commission is to pay the real market value of the land it has to take into consideration the question of where the money is to come from.  If the tenant who is to be resettled on that land is asked to pay out of his own pocket <Col N="89" /> over a period of years the amount that would be necessary to give the full market value, then that tenant farmer would be much better off by not accepting that land at all.  He could never be expected to pay by means of rent or annuities the full market value of such land.  On the other hand, if the Government had to provide the money to purchase such land it amounts practically to the same thing.  Money does not rise from a spring well in this country.  It has to be provided by the taxpayers, and there again the purchase of such land would impose a very heavy burden on the taxpayers who are, after all, the ordinary people of this country.  I think if the Land Commission set about the task, it would be possible to evolve some system of a sliding scale whereby up to a certain scale an increased price would be given for land so acquired.  Let us assume that where land was taken over, for the first £20 valuation the price to be paid, if not the full market value, would be as close as possible to it, and then for every amount in excess of £20 valuation, the sliding scale would operate with a downward tendency.</P>
    <P>I think that the Land Commission should be able to give a little more than they are giving at present and, if necessary, extend the period of repayment for the tenant who would get the land so that his son or his grandson might participate in the repayment of the annuities on that land.  That is the only suggestion I have to make in that regard but, again, I would not be as opposed to Section 3 as I am to Section 2.  Of course, if this Bill were passed it would mean the repeal of sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923, which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards untenanted land the price shall, in default of agreement, be such an amount as may be fixed by the Land Commission (other than the Judicial Commissioner), or by the Judicial Commissioner on appeal from the Land Commission, and in fixing such a sum regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The price of land definitely has increased <Col N="90" /> since that Act was passed in 1923 and, if the Land Commission did increase the price paid, then there could be better negotiation and better agreement between the person from whom the land was being taken and the Land Commission.  I say this merely as a sort of pointer to what my ideas would be in order to get a speedier solution of the land question. We have to pay for the land that we take as reasonably as we can, confiscate it, or pay a price so low as will be regarded as almost confiscation by the man from whom we take it.  If the Minister would get his officials together and try to arrive at some system, it should not be impossible to clear up this whole problem.  It would bring a great deal of case and peace to Deputy Cogan and myself and other Deputies who are anxious with regard to the land question.</P>
    <P>However, I could not at any time or in any way support this Bill as it stands because it sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No holding shall be acquired or resumed by the Land Commission without the consent of the owner in any case where it is used as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even, as it is, the Land Commission are very slow to move in on any man who is using his farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry. But &ldquo;proper methods of husbandary&rdquo; may mean anything.  A man who has a stud farm may be regarded as using his land in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.  &ldquo;Proper methods of husbandry&rdquo; as defined here might mean having a couple of hundred cattle grazing on the land which would be well attended to and looked after by the farmer.  It might mean having five or six hundred sheep on the land. Proper methods of husbandry to the Irish farmer should mean mixed farming where there is a certain amount of tillage and a certain number of grazing stock.  That is the only system I understand and that is the system I should like the Minister to understand as a proper method of husbandry, because unless that is regarded as a proper method of husbandry we shall have bullocks on the land instead of people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> I do not intend to go into any details as to the rights and wrongs of the Land Commission.  There have been enough Land Bills passed in the last 25 years to resettle the land of the world, not alone the land of Ireland.  Instead of making the job anything easier, each Land Bill which is brought in seems to make it harder.  If you try to study them you find that a Bill brought in, say, in 1933 or 1934 took away the powers that were given in a Bill passed in 1923 or 1924.  These things were not in any way helping the Land Commission. I am opposed to this Bill because, if it were passed, it would mean an absolute stand-still in regard to the powers of the Land Commission.  There is no man in Ireland so foolish, with the value of land as it is, with the prospects and outlook for farming securer than they have been for many years, as to consent to allow his land to be taken away from him.  On the other hand, compulsory powers must be retained.  Taking all these things into consideration, I feel that I must be totally opposed to this Bill.  I can assure the Minister, who comes from the same constituency as I do, that if he is in agreement with this Bill he will have quite a lot to account for when he comes to see the people of South Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should first protest against the cavalier treatment accorded to Private Deputies' Bills.  In dealing with a Bill produced by a Government you know when the First Reading will be taken; when the Second Reading will be taken; and when the final debate will take place on it.  You can make some preparation for discussing the matter and your memory will be clear as to what was stated in favour of the Bill or against it.  In this particular case, it is so long since Deputy Cogan made his opening speech&mdash;a very long and boring one too &mdash;that I quite forget what exactly were the points he was driving at.  This Bill has been buried very deep amongst various motions that are not by any means as important as this Bill is or could be.  I should like to urge the Minister to put before the Government <Col N="92" /> the idea that more fair and reasonable treatment ought to be given to Bills introduced by Private Deputies on subjects as important as this is.</P>
      <P>I agree with what I heard from Deputy Sweetman in relation to the Bill.  He said that important points were embodied in the Bill but that added on to them were certain features that nullified the apparent purpose of the Bill.  But Deputy Sweetman, when he was a Senator, also introduced a Bill into the Seanad of this nation. Neighbour of mine as he is, he did try to keep his Bill clear of any extraneous matters and I think that his friends and supporters at the time when the Bill was debated were much to be blamed for making the Bill obnoxious to anybody more concerned with land division than Deputy Sweetman himself. Again we had another attempt to introduce the same idea in a Bill produced by Senator Counihan in the Seanad.  The debate on that and Senator Counihan's attitude was such as to damn the idea for all time&mdash; with me anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second section is drafted apparently for the purpose of ensuring fixity of tenure.  Deputy Commons would say that we have too much fixity of tenure.  The Land Commission, wide as their powers are, are surrounded by limiting regulations which prevent them from doing things they might do according to Deputy Commons.  There is no need for anybody in this country to worry about fixity of tenure.  We have fixity of tenure and all the arguments that have been made in proof of the idea that there is not real fixity of tenure are null and void.  I have&mdash; we all have I suppose&mdash;talked loosely now and again even on subjects of importance.  Many people preach the idea that the State has an overriding right to land which transcends the ownership of the farmer.  I do not agree in any sense with that point of view.  I think that the farmer who has been placed on his land by Government action through the Land Commission is entirely the owner and the State has no right or claim in any sense to the land that farmer owns.  I think we must be clear about that point before we start anywhere else.  To <Col N="93" /> suggest that the Land Commission should be cribbed, cabined and confined in a section such as Deputy Cogan has in this Bill would not merely altogether prevent any activity by the Land Commission but any activity by any Department of State and I am entirely against that particular idea.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons talked about a sliding scale.  As far as I can gather, he would pay the market value or a little more to the small farmer but if the farmer proved to have many more acres the more and the wider the acres he had and the better land he had the more the sliding scale would be a slippery slide for him.  I do not think we could stand for that; every man should get the same fair deal.</P>
    <P>I do agree that an adequate price has not been paid for land in many cases, yet the Land Commission price has never been so far off the market value as some of our orators in the House pretend it has.  With regard to this tremendous fixity of tenure we know that the man who has incurred a tremendously heavy mortgage on his land expects when the Land Commission has to acquire that particular land that the annuities are going to be forgiven him and the mortgage ignored. That is not correct and that is one of the reasons for the argument that the Land Commission has not paid adequate prices.</P>
    <P>I approve, of course, of Deputy Commons' view that legislation by reference is a bad thing, but I do think that the Land Commission is a rather temporary Department even as the Minister is a temporary Minister and it would be hardly worth while now-adays to start a codification of the whole land code and I do not think we should make it more difficult or intricate by adding this particular Land Bill of Deputy Cogan's to it.  I would support the Minister if he brought in a Bill without any complications such as Deputy Cogan, Deputy Sweetman and Senator Counihan have added to their Bills, to ensure that the Land Commission pays the fullest price to the owner of land, the absolute market value.  I will support that Bill but I cannot support this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this Bill will be very brief, and I would not speak at all on the subject did I not come from a part of the country which is congested and in which this question of land acquisition and division is a very burning one.  I do not know to what class of farmers Deputy Cogan belongs, but I do not think he has any real idea of the necessity of placing people on the land.  It is all very fine to talk about giving the full market value for land and all the rest, but I wonder what price a lot of the big landowners in this country paid for their land.  It is no use pretending that this question has just begun now; this question of land tenure goes back for a long time.  It is no use our shutting our eyes to the fact that tenants were driven out in their hundreds and thousands, and that the people who took over their lands paid practically nothing for them, if they paid anything at all.  I think that is a background which you cannot ignore.</P>
      <P>I think this Land Bill of Deputy Cogan's is absolutely unnecessary.  It betrays a frame of mind, I think, which is very, very conservative indeed, and I cannot conceive that any Minister for Lands, either Deputy Blowick or anybody else, could possibly adopt it, and if we have a Government who could accept the principle laid down here I do not think they deserve to represent our people. I hope that the Minister will promptly turn this Bill down.</P>
      <P>I have consulted some people since I heard of this Bill&mdash;of course it looks very simple.  I consulted people who know a great deal about land division and who are absolutely impartial, some of whom have been entrusted with the acquisition and division of land for many years.  I put it to them as a quite impersonal question, and all the opinions I got were decidedly against Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 2 the proposed legislation is unnecessary because the existing Land Acts and the Land Commission's operation of them ensure that no average man who keeps his eyes on his farm and works properly can be deprived of it.  From all the information I can glean, a single case could <Col N="95" /> not be cited from any part of the country where a person has been so deprived of his land.  If a man has resided on the land and worked reasonably he has not been deprived of that land, and I would like to know of any example of such a thing happening. If that is true, as I believe it is, where is the necessity for the clause about fixity of tenure?  I maintain that there is sufficient fixity of tenure and quite agree with Deputy Commons that we have been altogether on the careful side on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to talk about fixity of tenure, but we have in every county in Ireland men with 200, 300, 400 and in some cases, 1,000 or 2,000 acres of land. In normal times they just employ a herd and a few dogs.  They support nobody.  Some people seem to think that that sort of thing ought to be allowed to go on indefinitely, and that it is no concern of the nation.  I say that it is of very deep concern to the nation, and that the sooner any Government that is in office realises that it has a duty to the country in that matter, the better it will be.  There is then this question of the proper use of land.  Who is to decide that?  One Minister for Agriculture will insist that a certain proportion of land must be tilled.  But what about your present Minister for Agriculture who has repeatedly stated that the best crop to grow on land is grass?  Can that be adopted as a national policy&mdash;that hundreds and perhaps thousands of acres of land are to be occupied by one man maybe, and used merely for grass, and in many cases supporting nobody?  In some cases there may be one family living on the land.  In other cases, there may be no family on it at all except perhaps an old bachelor.  Is that position to continue while that land could be utilised to provide a living for 20, 30 or perhaps 40 families? Is such a situation as that of no concern to the State?  I say that it is, and I am sure that no Minister for Lands can ignore that aspect of the case.</P>
    <P>I am certain that there is no necessity for Section 2 of the Bill.  I have not been shutting my eyes to this question <Col N="96" /> of land acquisition.  I know of many owners of land who do not live on it.  Some even have lived in America.  They have not been in the country may be for 15 or 20 years.  They have nobody occupying the land except possibly a relative.  Some of them have the land set and they have got off scotfree. I do not think there is any cause for complaint in the case of any occupier of land if he has been at all reasonable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of price, there has been a good deal said about market value.  I certainly will not be on the same side as Deputy Moylan if he carries out the promise that he has made.  Whatever Government may be in office, I think that this question of market value is surely a very relative thing.  Who is to decide what the market value is to be?  Is the Land Commission going to enter into competition with other would-be purchasers or with what are called at auctions &ldquo;puffers&rdquo;?  If there is to be this question of getting the market value for land at auctions, then what is going to happen is this&mdash;you will have a number of people&mdash;&ldquo;puffers&rdquo;&mdash; putting up the price on behalf of the occupier.  Surely the Land Commission is not going to enter into competition with them.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with Government Departments, but with the Land Commission at the moment.  I am certain the Land Commission does not do that.  I can assure the Minister that if the Land Commission were to do it, it is not the market value it would have to pay but a far higher value, because the occupiers would be cute enough to have a number of people there to shove up the price.  I cannot conceive that the Land Commission would be mad enough to do anything like that.  In any case, I think that there is a fair method of procedure at the present time.  In my experience the Land Commission has been offering a good price &mdash;perhaps not an inflated price&mdash;for land.</P>

      <P>I was taking vested and unvested land together, and that the Land Commission offers a fair price for it.  If it does not, there is the appeal court to go to.  The Deputy is a solicitor and he knows that.  I know that, in some cases that have been brought to my notice, where there was an appeal to the court, prices were increased by a very big percentage indeed.  Looking at this question from the broad point of view, I think there has been a reasonable price paid for land, especially in recent years.  It may be that in times past the prices paid were not so good.  The prices paid on the market in those times were not so good either.  I think that will be agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 3, I think the Land Commission could not comply with its terms because it would be absolutely impossible to define market value.  In the case of an ordinary farm an auctioneer or a valuer might value it at a figure that would, perhaps, be £1,000 more than the value put upon it by the Land Commission or anybody else.  The matter would then resolve itself into a competition in raising prices and you cannot have that.  I think that the method of procedure that is there at present is as fair as anything that could be devised.  I do not know what the attitude of the Minister is going to be on this Bill.  I come <Col N="98" /> from the same part of the country as he does, and possibly I belong to very much the same type of people and represent the same type of people in this House.  My advice to him is to have nothing to do with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not altogether agree with Deputy Cogan's Bill.  What I am concerned about is to have some statement from the Minister as regards the price the Land Commission is paying for land.  I have heard a number of Deputies suggest that the Land Commission should buy up every farm that is put up for sale.  I think that if the Land Commission were to act on that advice, they would destroy the value of land in this country.  If it were known that the Land Commission were going to do that, an agitation would be got up by local people whenever a farm was put up for sale.  In consequence of that, the value of land would go down.  It would also have this effect, that if a farmer wanted to get accomodation from a bank on the security of his holding, no bank would advance him anything.  Nobody would bid for a farm if there was a local agitation got up in connection with the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke seemed to think that the Land Commission have been paying a good price for land.  If he knew some of the sad stories that I have heard, I do not think he would say that.  I can quote the case of two decent, respectable farmers.  One of them had four or five sons.  He bought a farm for one of them.  He had not all the money to pay for it and had to go to the bank.  These people set part of the land and, by working hard, paid back what they could to the bank.  The times then changed.  They could not set the land or make enough to pay the interest due to the bank.  The farm was then taken up and divided by the Land Commission in 1938.  It had been purchased originally for £2,000 or £3,000.  When the Land Commission took it over, the price they paid for it left the position this way: that the widow of the purchaser found that she had to face a debt of £3,000.  That was how she found herself, while her sister's husband, who went security when the farm was purchased, was proceeded against by the bank.  That <Col N="99" /> purchase broke the two families, and that is their position to-day.  Will the Minister tell me why is more paid for a farm that is not vested than for a vested holding?  In the case of a vested holding, the occupier may have been paying annuities on it for 40 or 50 years to the Land Commission.  The two farms may be of equal value and may be side by side.  A rotten, bad price is paid for the vested holding, while the owner of the unvested holding&mdash;for the same quality of land&mdash;gets three or four times more than the owner of the vested holding.  That illustrates one aspect of the injustice done by the Land Commission in taking land.  The unvested land makes more than the vested land.</P>
    <P>These lands are equal in value and size, yet a man gets nearly ten times as much for the unvested farm as he gets for the vested farm which he has paid annuities on over the years.  I say that is a great injustice to the farmers.  People are not so much afraid of land division, but they are afraid of that clause.  When the Land Commission take a holding, the price might look a big one, £2,000 or £3,000, but you must remember you have to pay the annuities.  The man who is not vested at all gets away with all that, and that is a great injustice.  I would like the Minister to make some statement that will clear up the uneasiness that is there.  When a farm comes up for sale there are people who say that the Land Commission will buy it.  If the impression gets abroad that the Land Commission will purchase it and if I want to get a few hundred pounds from the bank I will not get it. If it is known that the Land Commission will buy a farm that is up for sale, that immediately lowers the value of the land.  People may be in very poor circumstances and their land has to be sold.  If it is known that the Land Commission may come in, there is no other buyer for it.  I do not agree with all parts of Deputy Cogan's Bill, and I would like the Minister to make a statement in order to clear up the uneasiness that exists with regard to the value of land, vested and unvested.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fagan has put <Col N="100" /> his finger on the root of this trouble. Why is it that no bank will advance money in connection with land if there is an impression that the Land Commission may step in when a person offers a holding for sale?  There can be only one reason and that is that the Land Commission are not paying the value of the land.  That is the only reason that can be given if there is any truth in Deputy Fagan's statement. The Land Commission are not paying the value of the land and, therefore, the bank will advance nothing on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have any amount of sympathy with that portion of Deputy Cogan's Bill.  The land in many instances has been bought and in other cases it has been inherited.  It has been paid for.  If any Government said: &ldquo;We are going to take over the firm of Arthur Guinness and we will pay them only half the value of it,&rdquo; what an uproar there would be?  If the Government said they were about to take over Clery's or the private property of any man and that they would pay only half its value, what an outcry there would be?  I have seen instances of this and I suggest that Deputy O'Rourke's statement is largely correct.  I have observed the value put on land by the Land Commission and the value put on it by the appeal judge, and the judge's value was in some cases nearly double what the Land Commission put on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are valuers in the Land Commission paid big salaries.  They are either good valuers or they are not.  If there is a gap such as I saw of £800 or £900 in a holding of 150 acres, who is wrong?  Is it the Land Commission valuer who valued it at so much, or the valuer who came down on the appeal or the Land Commission judge who allowed that appeal and gave £800 more?  To whom is public money being paid who does not know his job?  The Land Commission valuer values a farm.  The farmer from whom the holding is being forcibly taken goes to the appeal court.  The farm is valued a second time and the valuation <Col N="101" /> is £700 or £800 more.  Which of the two valuers should be sacked?</P>

      <P>I was rather amazed at the statement by Deputy Commons.  I did not think we would find in this country a farmer's representative who would stand up and make an excuse for paying a farmer less than the value of his holding because the State would have to pay more.  If the State, for the benefit of the community, considers it right that a farm should be taken over, then the State should be prepared to pay the owner the value of his holding.</P>
      <P>The statement made by Deputy Fagan as regards vested and unvested land is correct.  I have seen that worked out over a number of years. They take the value of the land first, then they take over the value of the annuity, the balance of the capital that the land was purchased with.  When that is taken out of it, in some cases there is practically nothing left.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for Deputy Cogan's Bill.  Where the Land Commission, for the general good of the community, decide that a holding must be taken over, then it should be taken over at the proper value of the land and not, as Deputy Commons put it, taken over at portion of its value.</P>

Who is to decide as to what is good and bad husbandry?  There is a certain kind of farming that can be done in the back yard.  In the back yard a man can keep 30 or 40 old pigs and a few hens.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help the interruptions. The danger that I see is in relation to the decision as to what is good or bad husbandry.  One of the Deputies on the Government side of the House said that the decision should be taken on the basis of the amount of employment given.  To my mind that is a good way in which to take such a decision.  But if by any chance there was a Minister who was prepared to take the &ldquo;tune of the bullock&rdquo; as good husbandry a lot of farmers might be <Col N="103" /> thrown out as being guilty of bad husbandry. That is a danger.  Recently that has become a somewhat live danger.  In spite of that, I regret that I cannot agree with the second portion of this Bill.  I certainly am in favour of the principle that the full market value should be paid for land.  If the Government decides to take over land for the benefit of the community generally, then they should pay for that land on the basis of market value and on that basis only.  I do not wish to delay the House on this measure, but I do not think it would be right for me to record a silent vote for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Cogan in his introduction of this Bill. I have known Deputy Cogan for a number of years.  I know that he is sincere in the views he expresses both inside and outside the House.  I know that the motives which prompted him in the introduction of this Bill are genuine motives.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen is very anxious to hear what Government policy is on this Bill.  The Bill is at one and the same time both good and bad.  It is only fair that I should make it clear at the outset that I do not agree with the method that has obtained in the past whereby the Land Commission was compelled by statute to fix the price of vested land.  Long before this Bill was introduced I had put proposals before the Government and received the consent of the Government to alter the method obtaining and to bring it into line with the method adopted in the case of unvested land.  To some extent Deputy Cogan stole my thunder because, in reply to a question during the course of my closing speech on the Vote for the Department of Lands last summer, I indicated that I was not exactly enamoured of the present method under the 1923 Act whereby the price paid for vested land was fixed by statute as a price which &ldquo;is fair to the Land Commission and fair to the owner&rdquo;.  At the present time a Bill is in course of preparation dealing with that particular matter.  I hope to introduce that Bill before the Estimates come on.  One of the features of that Bill is that vested land will be paid for in the same way as unvested land is paid for at the present time.  I do not know whether Deputy Cogan knows that; I do not know whether Deputies in the House do or not. Section 2 of Deputy Cogan's Bill runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Land Purchase Acts no holding shall be acquired or resumed by the Land Commission without the consent of the owner in any case where it is used as an ordinary farm in accordance <Col N="105" /> with proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That takes us right back to the reasons why the Land Commission was established at all.  The Land Commission, the State Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board were established by an alien Government in this country years ago to come to the rescue of the farmers of this country in general.  The principal purpose of the establishment of these three bodies was to make the farmers of this country the owners of their land.  The second and no less important reason was to eradicate completely, if possible, the question of congestion.  The Land Commission have practically finished with the vesting of the land of this country.  That part of the work is practically complete.  I think I made quite clear the position both of this Government and of the Land Commission in general on the question of fixity of tenure.  We hear speeches in the House sometimes and I often imagine that strangers in the gallery must think that the Land Commission is a kind of lion seeking to grab fixity of tenure away from the farmers at every possible opportunity they get. Such is not the case.  I think I made it clear on one occasion that they are doing no such thing.  As I said last June, in reply to the debate, suppose the Land Commission take the responsibility, suppose the present Government decides to give into the possession of the Land Commission the ownership of all the land in this country.  Where does it get us?  Is it not taking on a huge responsibility.  I might say that, with the exception of about 40,000 holdings that remain to be vested, all the land in this country has been handed back to those to whom it should belong.  We are vesting holdings at the rate of about 10,000 to 11,000 per year and that will continue until the last of the holdings are vested.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept Section 2 of Deputy Cogan's Bill, I think it would be much easier to accomplish the purpose of that Section by deleting it as it stands and substituting the words: &ldquo;The Land Commission shall be hereby abolished.&rdquo; because that is what it means.  We could spare a <Col N="106" /> whole lot of print in that section by doing that.  At the moment the prinpal activity of the Land Commission is to relieve congestion.  I am speaking to the Deputies who know what congestion is.  I am not speaking to the Deputies with scurrilous tongues who choose to refer to the small farmers and the poverty-stricken farmers as &ldquo;hen-roosters.&rdquo; I suppose more contemptible terms would be used if it were possible.  I did not think the time has come when elected representatives to this House should abuse and look down on the small farmers who are just as good Irishmen and women as we are and certainly a lot better than the public men who refer to them here on certain occasions as &ldquo;hen-roosters.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Bill stands in the middle of the road and puts a pistol at the head of the Land Commission. Section 2 says: you shall not go any further.  I want to point out to Deputy Cogan the magnitude of the task in front of the Land Commission at the present time. There are at least 40,000 holdings in this country in the congested areas that need rearrangement.  There is one estate not far from my constituency which is yet under the same conditions as when the landlord handed over in 1923 under the 1923 Act.  There were 617 tenants on that estate and the average poor law valuation amongst them would be about 23/-.  The housing conditions on that estate are fearful; they have to be seen to be believed.  I could quote the case of another estate which I visited during the autumn.  I saw in my own native county a sight I should be ashamed to reveal in this House or to make public.  I saw families living in what was an outhouse a hundred years ago.  In one room about 10 feet by 12 you had the father and mother, a married daughter, the young son-in-law and six children. There was a manure heap outside the door and four of the children were black and grimy from playing there when they had no other place in which to play.  I shall not refer to it as a &ldquo;hen-roost&rdquo;.  The haggard of that little holding was smaller than the open space on the floor of this House.  These are Irishmen.  They are not responsible for the &ldquo;To hell or Connaught&rdquo; policy which left them in that position which they are in to-day.  Is it proposed to let Section 2 stand and that we here in this House&mdash;comfortable, snug and warm&mdash;should leave these people in the position they are in.  Remember there are 40,000 of these families.</P>

      <P>It has.  Let me develop <Col N="108" /> it.  Before we can come to the rescue of these people it is necessary to acquire at least 150,000 acres of land. I state here in this House that neither the Land Commission nor I like to take land from anyone if we can help it.  The Land Commission seeks out the cases where it imposes least hardship on the owner.  We take holdings where we know it will cause the least possible hardship.  The price of vested land paid in the past was not in my opinion adequate.  The Deputy is, I suppose, aware that that has been the case for 25 years now.  Deputy Corry asked what is the cause and why is it there. I do not believe that the Deputy raised his voice on that subject once in the 16 years that his own Party was in power and while a member of his own Party was Minister for Lands.  He could have set that right perhaps if he had done so during that time.  I treat himself and Deputy O'Rourke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In case I am belying the Deputy, I shall withdraw my statement if the Deputy can point out to me anywhere in the Dáil Debates where he raised this question during that period of 16 years.  I have never seen it and I can assure the Deputy that I spent some time in reading <Col N="109" /> his speeches.  The policy of the Government is to acquire land for the relief of congestion.  This Government does not propose to turn its back calmly on the 40,000 people, most of whom have to be provided with public assistance in one shape or another. They have either to get outdoor assistance or the dole.  They have not sufficient land to support themselves. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the compulsory powers of the Land Commission or of the Congested District Board were not first conferred by an Irish Government.  Cumann na nGaedheal could not be accused of establishing that system.  It was established by a foreign Government under pressure from this country.  It was established by the British Government in the House of Commons. Compulsory powers for the acquisition of land were first given, in a small way, in the 1907 Act and were extended two years later in the 1909 Act.  These powers were operated many years before a native Government was established here.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies say that it is a shocking thing that a man has not security of tenure but we have no desire to interfere with the vast majority of our farmers.  Time and time again&mdash;it is futile to repeat it&mdash;it has been stated that any farmer who is residing on his farm and who works it in a proper manner will not be touched.  In reply to a question some months ago I told Deputy Cogan that any farmer who works his land will not be disturbed in it.  There is more derelict land in this country to be dealt with under the compulsory powers of acquisition than the Land Commission could attend to during the lifetime of this Government, the next Government or the next Government after that.  Is that clear?  Every single case is very carefully examined to ensure that no hardship or injustice will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We frequently hear Deputies making jokes as to the slow progress of the Land Commission.  That is solely due to a desire to see that no mistake will occur and that no person will be treated unjustly in the acquisition of his land.  I know what it is to own land and I would consider it frightfully <Col N="110" /> unjust if the Land Commission came along to acquire my land when I am working it properly.  They examine every case very carefully and for that reason they are neither the tyrants not the vultures that some people represent them to be.  If there is the slightest doubt about any case reported by their inspectors, they examine it thoroughly. I have known two Commissioners to travel to the West personally to investigate a report of one of their inspectors with which they were not quite satisfied.</P>
    <P>There are three points of view in this House and outside it.  One is that no land should be acquired at all, that we should leave everything as it is and vest all the holdings, that we should not improve rundale estates or come to the rescue of smallholders who can only exist with the assistance of the dole and allow them to export their sons and daughters.  The emigrant ship then would be the only hope for them. Then you have the diametrically opposite view, in which it is hinted pretty openly that land should be taken <i>ad lib.</i> from everybody.  I must say that these two sections are very small either in this House or outside it.  The course which the Land Commission and the present Government are pursuing is naturally the middle course between these two extreme views, that is, to acquire land under the laws laid down by the Oireachtas for a very definite purpose, the relief of congestion.  That is our policy.  Deputy Allen wants to know what is the Government policy. That is the Government policy in a nutshell.  We have not the slightest intention of altering that policy.  We must first attend to the needs of our smallholders who are trying to eke out an existence on economic holdings. That was the policy even before this State was established and the policy since this State was established, and we do not propose to change it.  We propose to speed up the work of ending congestion if we possibly can.  It is a pretty big job.  It means the acquisition and resumption of, roughly, 150,000 acres.  The question of breaking up the big farms to settle the largest number of landholders on them is one that can be taken after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> The relief of congestion, amongst 40,000 small uneconomic holders who are living under frightful conditions&mdash; conditions that must be seen to be believed&mdash;must be the first aim of the Government.  Let there be no question of doubt about it.  In my opinion the price paid for vested land up to now was totally inadequate.  It is proposed to change it in the near future but when Deputies ask what is the cause of it&mdash;Deputies who have been in the House for long enough and who have done nothing up to the present to change it&mdash;I think their complaints sound very hollow and insincere.  It should have been changed long ago and when I found the position as it was I immediately got to work and put the matter before the present Government and it is going to be changed.</P>
    <P>Much talk has ranged about the question of what is the market value of a farm.  The market value at present is paid for unvested land.  How is that determined?  The market value for vested land will be determined in the same way.  I think that should settle the doubts which most Deputies have raised.</P>
    <P>The other section of the Bill, Section 2, would completely prevent the Land Commission from acquiring or resuming further land.  No landowner is going to give his consent to the acquisition of his land.  It would be possible for a landowner to reside in America, Australia or anywhere at the four ends of the earth, and to use his land here at home in any way he likes.  Again, who is to determine what is good husbandry?  It would put a complete standstill to the operations of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Land Commission, after it has made the farmers of this country the owners of their holdings and farms, is the relief of congestion &mdash;in other words, to carry on the very object for which the Congested Districts Board was set up.  The Congested Districts Board mentality is still there.  That work will go on. Therefore, I recommend to this House that this Bill be rejected.  I think Deputy Cogan should be satisfied, now <Col N="112" /> that I have given him an assurance in regard to the price question raised in Section 3 of his Bill.  It may not be the very assurance he requires but, nevertheless, it is the very best we can do.  We are not anxious to take land from people at a price which is less than the market value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry accused Deputy Commons of making an excuse in regard to the taking of land from a farmer at less than its market value.  Deputy Commons was trying to be helpful to the Land Commission and to me in putting forward a suggestion.  He made it quite clear that the suggestion was his own and that his remarks were made from his own point of view in the hope that they would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke completely misquoted the Minister for Agriculture. He went out of his way to point out that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture is a policy of grass and more grass.  Deputy O'Rourke must know quite well that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture is to give the land that is tillage-tired after the emergency, and that has stood up so well to the needs of the country, a rest. I think the Deputy would not have made the remarks he made if he were a farmer or if he knew the first thing about farming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to set Deputy Cogan's mind at rest by reading to him some of the safeguards in some of the Acts as regards fixity of tenure.  Section 29 of the 1933 Land Act provides that where tenant or proprietor of land declared by Land Commission to be required for relief of congestion resides on or near the land and uses it as an ordinary farmer would in accordance with proper methods of husbandry then if he does not own other land value £2,000 or over the Land Commission must be ready to give him an exchange of his <Col N="113" /> entire holding.  That is a pretty sweeping safeguard.  It may not be easy to realise all that that means until one has an intimate talk with the Land Commissioners in the discharge of their ordinary duty.</P>
      <P>Section 32 (2) of the 1933 Act provides that where tenant or proprietor would be entitled to an exchange under Section 29 his land may not be acquired compulsorily for any purpose other than the relief of congestion or for sportsfields, parks, etc.  Is that not a fairly sweeping safeguard, Deputy Cogan?</P>
      <P>Section 32 (3) of the same Act provides that land shall not be acquired compulsorily for any purpose other than the relief of congestion or for sportsfields, parks, or, if the Commissioners are satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is producing an adequate amount of food and providing an adequate amount of employment.</P>
      <P>I should like to know in what way that can be improved on to safeguard fixity of tenure for a farmer.</P>
      <P>Section 39 (6) of the 1939 Act confirms that Section 32 (3) of the 1933 Act applies to resumed holdings:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would, therefore, appear that, no matter where the proprietor or tenant lives, the Land Commission must not acquire or resume compulsorily, except for relief of congestion in the same locality, or for sportsfields, etc., any land which is producing adequate supplies of food and giving adequate employment but that it is only the owner or tenant who resides on or near the land who is entitled to an exchange.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These safeguards are there&mdash;cast iron safeguards for the farmer.  Something like 21 Parliamentary Questions were addressed to me to-day on the subject of the acquisition of land.  Many of the questions were put by Deputies from County Galway and other Western areas.  Some Deputies get vexed because of the slowness of the Land Commission in acquiring and allotting land.  It is the attitude of men such as Deputy Cogan and others which has forced the Land Commission to go slow and to take the greatest possible care <Col N="114" /> to ensure that no injustice is being done in acquiring property.  I would point out to Deputy Cogan that other Government Departments have powers of compulsory acquisition&mdash;the Department of Local Government; every county council and county surveyor; and the Department of Industry and Commerce, if they want to use it, for airfields and so forth.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Cogan, now that he has had an assurance on the question of price, to withdraw his Bill.  I would ask him not to pursue it and not to ask this House to adopt a measure which would leave 40,000 uneconomic holders in the terrible plight in which most of them are at the present time. I would invite the Deputy to visit two or three estates in the West of Ireland &mdash;one in Donegal, one in Mayo and one in Galway&mdash;and see for himself the conditions.  He would then understand the problems which face the Land Commission and I think he would be fully satisfied that a certain amount of land resumption must go on.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the Minister for Health.  When he took over office he was confronted with the terrific tuberculosis problem in this country.  Well, I can assure the House that the problem which faced the Minister for Health is not half as serious and does not require half as much solving as some of the badly congested estates. To my knowledge there is one estate which will take at least £1,000,000 of the taxpayers' money in order to provide the 617 tenants living thereon with fairly decent holdings.  Each holding would be but a standard holding with one dwelling house and out office and so forth.  That, I think, should satisfy Deputy Cogan.  Neither he nor Deputy Fagan nor any other Deputy need worry about the question of fixity of tenure.  It is in safe hands in the hands of the present Government and in my own hands also.  I come from those who fought for fixity of tenure in the past and I know exactly what it means.  I come from a class who would be prepared to fight to preserve that fixity of tenure for the small farmer.  But, in the case of landowners, we must, in certain cases, disturb that fixity of tenure&mdash;but that will <Col N="115" /> happen in only the very smallest number of cases possible and it will be for the purpose of the relief of congestion. We must acquire land for that purpose, and I hope that a group of Deputies in this House will never propose to end compulsory acquisition or resumption of land until congestion is completely eradicated.</P>

I cannot say when it will be introduced but it is in course of preparation and I have asked the Parliamentary Draftsmen to speed it up.  As the Deputy, I am sure, is well aware, the preparation of land law is very troublesome and great care has to be taken to make the various sections foolproof.  The measure will be introduced as soon as possible.  &ldquo;Before the Estimates&rdquo; is a vague guess.  I do not want the House to take it as certain.</P>

      <P>They have full right to pay a fair price for any land they acquire&mdash;absolutely.  I am opposed to Deputy Cogan's Bill because I think it would be disastrous for this country if such a Bill were passed.  I am glad to see that it is not getting support from any part of the House or any individual in the House and I am sure Deputy Cogan will do the wise thing before this debate is over and withdraw the Bill, because it does not make sense. There is no doubt that, as the Minister said, there is a great deal of congestion to be relieved.  I am doubtful if there is land enough in the country to relieve all the congestion, to give every congested holder, every uneconomic holder, an economic holding.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether it is his opinion that there is sufficient land to render all the uneconomic holdings economics, even if you divide up every holding of over 100 or 70 acres or whatever you like.  It would be bad if such a section as Section 2 of Deputy Cogan's Bill were put into operation. It would be bad for the country, bad national policy, that no Dáil would ever subscribe to.  I rose to challenge the Minister on that statement of his about fixity of tenure.  We all know quite well that the fixity of tenure which farmers have is safe in the hands of any Government that will come in here. It is enshrined in legislation and cannot be altered except by an Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill we are now discussing would definitely prevent the land being <Col N="121" /> acquired which it is necessary to acquire for the relief of congestion. The Minister when he was in opposition was keen on the acquisition and division of land.  He made some wild and foolish statements in his time on the matter of land division.</P>

      <P>The Minister may feel assured that in his efforts to acquire and divide the land necessary for the relief of congestion in the West or in the North or the South or wherever it is, he will have the full co-operation and support of Deputies on this side of the House.  We trust that as a result of his close contact with the Land Commission the Minister will learn that it is not possible to acquire sufficient land to relieve all the congestion in this country within the short <Col N="122" /> period in which at one time he thought it could be done.  As time goes on, he will find that it will be a much more difficult problem to get all the land that is needed for the relief of congestion without hurting somebody.  If the Minister thinks he can carry out a hail-fellow-well-met policy and not injure any persons by taking land off them, he is looking for trouble.  He knows quite well, even by now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following on the lines of the Minister's speech.  My arguments are directed to the speech recently made by the Minister.  The Minister will not find the relief of congestion such an easy problem as he thought when he was in opposition. He will find that it will be much more difficult to acquire all the land he needs to relieve congestion without injuring some interest.  To try to persuade the House and the country that there are millions of acres of derelict land waiting to be acquired is only leading the House and the country astray.  I should like to know where these millions of acres of derelict land are which have not been in use.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not find it so easy to acquire all the land necessary to relieve congestion as he tried to lead the House to believe when he spoke about this pool of derelict land which no one knows anything about except himself.  I challenge him to say where it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose mainly to deal with Section 2 of this Bill.  I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw that section in this Bill.  If this Bill were passed, it would sanction <Col N="123" /> for ever the policy pursued in past generations which was summed up in the phrase, &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht.&rdquo; I do not believe for a moment that Deputy Cogan understands the position which obtains west of the Shannon. If he did, I am quite certain that such a Bill as this would never have been introduced in this House.  Section 2 of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Land Purchase Acts no holding shall be acquired or resumed by the Land Commission without the consent of the owner in any case where it is used as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, a man with a large farm who is using it properly, although there is congestion in the area and a large number of small farmers who would make equal use of it, must be asked: &ldquo;Please, sir, would you mind giving up your farm for the sake of those unfortunate men in the locality who have only five, ten or 15 acres, so as to make their holdings economic?&rdquo; What answer would that gentleman give if he were asked to give up his farm?  I think it is quite evident that we would never get one acre of land for the relief of congestion if any such policy were pursued, or if that section was passed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only speak more or less for the people west of the Shannon.  That is the portion of Ireland which has mainly filled the emigrant ships in the past.  Men who now fill high places in America went there from Mayo, Galway, Roscommon and other counties in the West.  Would it not be a good thing if we could at least reduce the numbers who are forced to flee year after year from the country?  Would it not be a terrible thing if we had to say that we can never hope to stem emigration if this Bill went through in its present form?  Suggestions have been made that the only hope for the West of Ireland is the provision of cottage industries such as the homespun industry. These will never remedy the problem of unemployment or prevent <Col N="124" /> emigration.  They are only a sop at the best.</P>
    <P>We will never have a decent or proper agricultural policy while we have the land question as it is to-day The division of land and a proper agricultural policy are bound up.  What I would suggest on this particular question is that Deputy Cogan should ask the House for powers to speed up the work of the Land Commission, as that is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past they have been very slow in this matter and under the present Government I have not seen it moved up even to a trot.  If this present Government is going to be serious about its job of land division, it must get into a gallop pretty soon. The Minister for Lands himself is one man who has favoured division of land and I am speaking on behalf of our Party when I say that we are totally opposed to anything in the nature of this Bill which has been introduced by Deputy Cogan, and we would ask the Minister for Lands not to stay in the same rut that his predecessor was in but to get ahead with this very necessary work of making our uneconomic holdings economic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen is worried as to whether we have enough land to relieve all the uneconomic holdings or enough to satisfy all the land-hungry men. Deputy Allen knows perfectly well that we have not, but that is not the question or should not be the question here in this House.  We should get ahead with the land we have and fix up the holdings which are uneconomic at present. Like the Minister himself, I could draw a very pitiful picture of conditions in certain congested areas in the West.  I live in a congested area.  I know a village not three miles from me where there are 18 small landholders with 65 acres of good land between them.  Say a man has seven acres, he has not even that seven acres together; he will have one acre here and his next-door neighbour will have two acres between that and the next acre.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I submit, has a lot to do with it because if the Bill went through in its present form, Section 2 would mean that the land would be the same in 40 years' time and that those holdings would never have an opportunity of being made economic.</P>
      <P>The question of fixity of tenure has been mixed.  It dates back to the old days of the penal laws when a man was thrown out on the side of the road by the landlord on the slightest excuse. I do not see why we should make permanent the evil work done in the past. At the same time nobody can disagree with giving a fair price to a man from whom land is being resumed.  If it is necessary, and it is necessary I submit, to resume land and acquire fresh land for the relief of congestion and to make uneconomic holdings economic, then consent or no consent that land should be taken over.  The question as set out in Section 2 here is covered very nicely of course by saying: &ldquo;If the farm is used in accordance with proper methods of husbandry&rdquo;; that particular section goes in to blind us to what is really going on.  To-morrow morning a man down in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath or anywhere else can produce evidence that his farm is being properly worked and just because he produces that evidence and shows he is a good farmer, the ten, 15 or 20 unfortunate men whose tongues have been hanging out for the land will be left in the lurch.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say any more except that our Party are completely opposed to this, and instead of this particular section, something should be introduced whereby the Land Commission would be speeded in their work of division and not retarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

      <P>I think that the best service Deputy Cogan could render to the House would be to withdraw this Bill and ensure that the national sentiments and the sacrifices made by men 20 or 25 years ago will not be in vain. I do not know whether Deputy Cogan took any part in those historic times, but I know that one of our objectives <Col N="126" /> was to get control of the country, get the land into the hands of Irishmen for the good of all, and place all on the land in reasonable comfort.  If this Bill of Deputy Cogan's were passed, it would undo all the work that we set out to do.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the short statement that he made here to-day.  He certainly cleared the air and made it clear that in the future a fair price would be paid for any land taken over.  That is something we can be proud of because up to this there has been public robbery of men in this country by Fianna Fáil over 16 years.  I brought up the question in this House eight or nine years ago of a widow, a struggling widow, who had 250 acres of good land taken from her and what did she get out of it?  What was offered to her?  A five-pound note!</P>

      <P>If this Bill were adopted, it would be the end of land division and we could not stand for that.  Deputy Cogan wants to stand on both sides of the fence.  He wants to be a Tory on one side and a patriot on the other but he cannot be both.  I come from a county in the centre of the land of the Pale where conquest was done with bloody work, where Irishmen were told to get out to Hell or to Connacht, where planters from the British Empire were planted and where many of them have a foothold to-day.  I do not stand for the confiscation of any man's property however he became its owner.  Whether he was a planter or not, he is entitled to its market value and I believe that the Government will give him that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that the Land Commission moved ahead.  In my county, vast tracts of land are herded by one man <Col N="127" /> and a dog, and some of the owners of them live in India, some live in London, and some in Dublin; but very few live in Royal Meath.

      <P>I say to Deputy Cogan as a man that he should withdraw this Bill.  The Minister made it clear to him and to the House that in future he would pay the fair market value, only take land that was not being worked in the national interest and that he would not touch any man who was living on his holding and working it properly.  That is a real Christian precept and a reason why Deputy Cogan should withdraw and see what the Minister is going to produce. Knowing the Minister, knowing the type of man he is and what he has sprung from, I am satisfied that he will give a fair, square deal to every man.  In all fairness to the Minister after the statement he made Deputy Cogan should withdraw.</P>
      <P>I have a lot to say, but as I cannot say it under the scope of this discussion, I think I will have to conclude.</P>

      <P>I would like, with Captain Giles, as a member of the Fine Gael Party, to welcome the assurance and statement of policy given by the Minister here to-day.  Our Party, while it was in opposition for a period of 16 years, has always advocated that while land acquisition and <Col N="128" /> division is necessary and very essential, it should be accompanied by a fair price being paid for land that is acquired.  Only four years ago, a Private Members' Bill to the same effect as this Bill was introduced by two members of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad and that Bill was defeated.</P>
      <P>Our Party has always been consistent in advocating a measure such as that promised by the Minister to-night. It was a pity that, after the Minister's speech, the House should be compelled to listen to a speech such as that which emanated from Deputy Allen.  I do not know whether the Deputy inintended to be serious or not, or whether his intervention was merely some effort at filling a gap from the benches opposite, because it is perfectly apparent that, whatever contribution Deputies on this side may have to make in this debate, there is very little of a constructive nature coming from the Deputies opposite. Deputy Allen went out of his way to say that the Minister had accepted Fianna Fáil legislation so far as the Land Acts are concerned, that he was happy and satisfied with the present position, and that under the existing law there was nothing at all to prevent the Land Commission from paying a fair or a market price for acquired land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might interest Deputy Allen to know&mdash;I do not see him in the House now&mdash;that under Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923, and under other sections in the land code, a very clear statutory standard is laid down for determining the price of land to be acquired.  As long as that standard is there it cannot be departed from.  That standard determines the price in accordance with certain rules laid down in the section and in the schedules to the 1923 Land Act.  But in Section 39 of the Land Act of 1939, a section which merely embodied the practice and the law prior to that, it is provided in sub-section (5) that the resumption price of a holding shall be the market value of that holding or part of a holding.  There we have the extraordinary difference referred to by <Col N="129" /> Deputy Fagan and other Deputies, that where land is resumed the market value must be paid by the Land Commission because the 1939 Land Act declares that such a price and such a value must be paid, but when land, whether vested or not, is acquired the purchase price or value is a mere notional value decided in accordance with the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>I was informed this evening of a case where the owner of 400 acres or so of land purchased originally under one of the earlier Acts was fortunate enough to have a bit of liquid cash in hands and decided to redeem his annuity.  He did so at a cost to him of in or around £10,000 or £11,000.  His land was acquired some years later when he did not even get back from the Land Commission the amount of the redemption that he had paid three years before.  Now, when you have results like that it is very hard to expect the people of this country&mdash;the ordinary farmers&mdash;either to understand or to be patient with the present position.  Driving through any part of the country you can see, side by side, a field of unvested land and a field of vested land, both of identical value and size, with quite different prices obtaining in the event of acquisition or resumption by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Now, I am glad for these reasons that the Minister should have made the statement that he did make to-night. I think it is only right to say that land and anything dealing with land affects not merely the owner of a particular holding or the person who might be fortunate enough to get a division of land in this country, but the credit of the nation.  If you lessen the people's confidence in either their holding of land or in their ability to sell and transfer land, you do, in a certain way, affect the credit of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fagan, or some other Deputy, mentioned the fact that in certain circumstances a farmer or a holder of land finds when he goes into a bank&mdash;this was so particularly during recent years&mdash;that his <Col N="130" /> land and his title deeds, even if he has clear title, are not going to bring him any credit from his bank manager.  The reason is that the notion, apparently, is accepted now under our existing land purchase code that the holding or the owning of land beyond a certain size raises the danger of acquisition. That is one end of the problem&mdash;that acquisition means purchasing that land out for a sum very much lower than its value.  The bank manager, facing a problem like that, just will not do any business with the landowner concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing Section 3 of the Bill which is before the House, a Bill which asks the House to approve of legislation designed to bring about a fair or market value for land acquired.  While I agree completely with that portion of the Bill which aims at that particular object, and endorse it as representing the consistent policy of my Party, I nevertheless join with Deputy Giles in suggesting that, in view of the statement made by the Minister to-night that he will accept the principle contained in Section 3 of the Bill and introduce proposals for legislation to cover that principle, the Bill has perhaps achieved its object.  I also endorse what has been said by Deputy MacQuillan and other Deputies concerning Section 2. Section 2 is a section which should never have been introduced by a Deputy such as Deputy Cogan.  It is a section which, if passed into law, would put back the hands of the clock in this country nearly 60 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senior counsel is not entering into this debate.  Section 2, if it became law, would fetter the Government, the Land Commission and the administration of that Department in attending to what is a very real problem&mdash;congestion and uneconomic holdings.  I cannot see that there is anything to be said for that section.  I think it is without justification and that once an assurance is <Col N="131" /> given of a fair price for land acquired, no conceivable argument could be advanced for Section 2.  Therefore I ask Deputy Cogan, in view of the assurance given by the Minister, to withdraw his Bill.</P>
      <P>But I will say this to the Minister. He is going to introduce proposals here dealing with this particular matter of a fair price for land acquired.  He must not forget that his Government has been 12 months in office and that during that period the close-down introduced by the last Government in certain areas, particularly in the Midlands, has been raised.  The process of acquiring land in my constituency and in other constituencies in the Midlands has gone ahead within the past 12 months.  Steps have been taken to acquire different estates and I assume that in the ordinary administrative way those steps will very shortly lead to the acquisition of these estates.  I cannot see any reason why the Bill to be introduced by the Minister should not be retrospective to February 18th of last year.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right and proper that the Minister should not for any period of his term in office stand over what is a considerable injustice to certain people.  The danger does exist that if legislation is introduced within three of four months, taking effect from the date on which it is introduced, there will be a most unenviable speedup in acquisition.  I would, therefore, urge upon the Minister to make his proposals, welcome as they will be, good and beneficial proposals, retrospective to the date on which he assumed office.  Then he will know that no injustice, such as is aimed at in this Bill, will have been allowed to exist.</P>

      <P>I look on the principle underlying this Bill as retrograde and reactionary.  I am not one of those who believe that property in land should be held in the same way as property in other things.  I believe the land in this country should be used in the interests of the community as a whole and that that should be the overriding factor to be considered.  If the principle enshrined in this Bill were to be adopted, there is no doubt whatsoever <Col N="132" /> that the land could not be used in the best interests of the community and that step by step individuals could acquire land until they became vast landholders and landowners such as we had 100 years ago.  If once the principles suggested by Deputy Cogan were adopted, then there would be nothing to prevent any individual acquiring a whole countryside, and just because he would use that in accordance with certain methods of husbandry, he could not be deprived of that land no matter what the community might want to do with it.  It must go clearly from this Dáil that a declaration of principle on those lines cannot be accepted in the 20th century.  We have, I hope, put an end to landlordism of that type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but the principle that is involved in this Bill is a dangerous one so far as the community are concerned and it is just as well that it should be exposed at this stage. Now, with regard to the price to be paid for large estates acquired by the Land Commission for sub-division, that again is a matter of principle.  We had the same trouble when the big landowners and landlords were bought out some years ago.  The tenantry and the ordinary people then were saddled with the payment of sums of money which should never have been paid. The Minister must seriously reconsider the principles suggested here this evening in regard to compensation.  We cannot permit the small landholder to <Col N="133" /> whom acquired land is handed over to be burdened with a huge millstone of debt simply because it is held that these landowners should be paid what is described as a fair market price for their lands.  Those are my views in regard to this matter.  Considering the history of our country in relation to land and land tenure, we ought never to have had a Bill of this type introduced here.  This is a retrograde and reactionary measure.  I support the suggestion made by Deputy Captain Giles and Deputy O'Higgins that Deputy Cogan should withdraw this Bill and let the Minister bring forward for the consideration of the House whatever proposals he has in mind in relation to these two big and burning questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been fairly widely debated.  To some extent the debate has caused me a certain amount of amusement.  It was certainly amusing to observe the lengths to which some Deputies went and the pains they took on both sides of the House in their efforts to find some reason for not voting for this Bill.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy must admit that the fundamental principles in this Bill are sound.  The first is that land should be taken from a farmer who is not using it properly.  Does anyone dispute the justice of that principle?  Secondly, the Bill provides that land that is acquired shall be paid for at a reasonable price. Those are the two underlying principles of this measure.  If there is any Deputy who thinks that a farmer who is working his lands properly ought not to have a reasonable measure of security of tenure, then let him vote against this Bill, and if there is any Deputy who thinks that land acquired by the State for the purpose of national development should not be paid for at a reasonable price, then, let him vote against this Bill.  But if there is any Deputy who accepts the well-established principles of Christian justice and fair play as between man and man, then he will have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a vague kind of way a case was made by a number of Deputies that Section 2 would completely hold up the work of the Land Commission.  Possibly <Col N="134" /> some Deputies have not taken the trouble to read the Bill or to give it any serious consideration.  I took this Bill to one of our ablest counsel and got his opinion on it.  In his opinion Section 2 would not in any way retard the operations of the Land Commission. There is nothing to prevent the Land Commission acquiring all the land that is either derelict or waste, or that is not properly used by its owner or neglected by its owner.  There is nothing to prevent the Land Commission from acquiring all the land that will be freely offered to them provided they pay a reasonable price for it.  Far from holding up the operations of the Land Commission in any way the effect of this Bill will be to speed up land acquisition and land division. More land will be offered to the Land Commission under this Bill than has ever been offered to them in the past. I have discussed land acquisition with various farmers in County Wicklow. Those farmers who have land of which they would like to dispose are only too anxious to sell it to the Land Commission in preference to any one else provided they are assured of a fair price. For some reason or another, there are Deputies who apparently think that farmers ought not to get a fair price for anything they have to sell, whether it be agricultural produce or land.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill is good and bad.  I would be interested to learn what the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is.  He acknowledges that that portion of it which is good is the portion which provides that farmers who sell vested land shall get as a good a price for it as farmers who sell unvested land.  The Minister accepts that principle.  The Minister denounces the prices that have been paid for land in the past and up to the present time.  He agrees that people who are selling their land to the Land Commission are being robbed.  Does the Minister seriously suggest that the Land Commission should be permitted to go on robbing the people?</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked the Minister if he would make compensation to the owners retrospective in the Bill which he is proposing to introduce.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not in <Col N="135" /> the House now to answer that question. I know that he has not the right to intervene in the debate, but I am sure the Chair would permit him to answer that straight question &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am asked to withdraw this Bill on the tenuous promise that another Bill will be introduced by the Minister. We have been given no definite date as to the introduction of any such Bill. We have been given no definite idea as to how long the passage of the Bill might take.  Having regard to the constitution of the House, we have no definite assurance as to whether or not the Bill will be passed.  It is probable that the majority of the House accepts the principle of a fair market price for land, but opposition has been expressed on both sides of the House to the payment of a fair price.  What guarantee can the Minister give that this Bill, if introduced, will be enacted?  The Minister has stated that the Bill will consist of some 20 sections.  Some of those sections may be objectionable.  Have we any assurance that Deputies will not pounce upon one particular section of the Bill and use it as an excuse for voting against the Bill.  Asking me to withdraw this Bill in favour of something which the Minister will introduce sometime in the future makes rather too great a demand on me.</P>
    <P>The Minister went out of his way to demonstrate that fixity of tenure exists under present legislation.  The Minister knows that the Land Commission can give no assurance to any farmer, no matter how well that farmer may husband his land, that the Land Commission will not acquire it.  There is, therefore, no real fixity of tenure. Some Deputies say that Section 2 is so drastic and far-reaching in its effects that it takes us back to the days of the landlords.  Others, including the Minister, have stated that security of tenure is as effectively protected under existing legislation as it is under Section 2 of this Bill.  So it is evident we have to decide as between those two points of view.  All that the Bill seeks to ensure is that a fair price will be paid for land, that land which is vested in the owner will be paid for at <Col N="136" /> the same price as land which is unvested.  Is there anything wrong with that?  We are told that Section 2 as at present worded may create difficulties. I am prepared on the Third Stage of the Bill, to consider amendments to Section 2.</P>

Deputy O'Rourke asked me&mdash; I do not know what it had to do with the Bill but I suppose it was relevant&mdash; what type of farmer I am.  I am a small farmer, a farmer of less than 40 acres of arable land and about the same amount of very poor bog.  I do not consider myself a landlord by any means.  I am raising this matter in the House and I am introducing this Bill in order to give an adequate safeguard to farmers, large and small, who are doing their duty to the State as citizens should; that is to say, who are using their land properly.  Somebody asked <Col N="137" /> how would we define the proper utilisation of land.  I would be inclined to accept the view of the arguments which have been used, and are being used at present, in regard to the value of grass as against tillage crops.  I would be inclined to define it as giving the maximum amount of employment. That is my view.  I strongly hold that it is the duty of the farmer to provide as much employment on his farm as he possibly can and at the same time get the maximum output.</P>

If the Minister is not satisfied on the exact wording of Section 2 I will have no hesitation in accepting any amendment which might be put down on the Third Stage of the Bill. All that we ask in this Bill is reasonable security for the man who has been working his land properly and a reasonable price for the land.  Give the Land Commission the power to pay a fair price.  They have not got that power at the present time.</P>

      <Col N="138" /> A case was put up by the Minister and by other Deputies about the amount of congestion that exists in various parts of the country.  We all know that that congestion exists.  We all know how urgent it is to relieve it. The purpose of the Bill, as I have said, will be to further the work of the Land Commission in relieving that congestion. It is no use drawing a red herring across the trail by suggesting that this Bill will hold up the Land Commission. It will not.  I hold that if this Bill becomes law more land can be acquired by the Land Commission than it has ever been possible to acquire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, in opposing this Bill, said that the principle of the Bill was all right but that the manner in which it had been presented was wrong.  If the principle of the Bill is all right let the House accept it.  No just court will throw out a case simply because it is not as ably presented as it should be.  If that were done it would mean that a court was either biased or prejudiced or stupid.  If a fair court would try this Bill and examine it objectively on its merits and on its merits alone this House would have to accept it.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is in the House I should like to repeat a question which I asked before he came in. In the Bill which he proposes to introduce is the Minister prepared to make the compensation payable to owners of land retrospective as from the 18th February last?  On the 18th February the Minister became responsible for land policy in this country.  He has acknowledged here to-day that the Land Commission have been robbing those people from whom they acquired land.</P>

How can he justify a refusal to pay an adequate and fair price for all land that was acquired since he took over?  I am not asking the Minister to make restitution for the sins of his predecessors. Let them account for what they did or did not do during their term.  If they acquired land at less than a fair and adequate price let them be responsible.  But let the Minister take full responsibility for all land that was acquired since he took office.  If the Minister is prepared to give a guarantee that this Bill will be introduced and that he will make it retrospective I am prepared to withdraw this.  He should not stand over the injustices, the glaring cases of injustice, that have been committed during the past year and which are being committed at present.  I have quoted in this House a number of cases of injustice to farmers.  I have, since I introduced the Bill, received information in regard to hundreds of other cases.  I ask the Minister is he going to stand over highway robbery of these unfortunate people?</P>

He must have gone asleep before the land of Ireland was purchased by the farmers of this country from the landlords and he is only wakening up now.  I am afraid Deputy Davin is in very close spiritual accord with Deputy Cowan, who lifted a little corner of the Iron Curtain to-night and showed his views in regard to property ownership in this country.  He made it clear that he would not agree even with the Minister's proposal that a fair price should be paid for the land acquired even if the Bill were not retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it a pity that Deputies should have gone so far out of their way in an endeavour to find some excuse for failing to accept the principle of this Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill except to endorse and emphasise what our fathers sought when they fought for the land for the farmers of the country, what every other Irishman <Col N="140" /> fought for&mdash;fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.  These principles are, as far as possible, embodied in this Bill.  The men who fought for the principles are dead but could they see these principles derided in an Irish Parliament they would turn in their graves.  Six feet of Irish earth would not be sufficient to keep them down if they thought that an Irish National Parliament was going to trample on the principles of fixity of tenure and free sale.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell a little longer on Deputy Davin's attitude.  Deputy Davin wants to class every farmer of this country, whether he owns five, 15, 20, 100 or 200 acres, as landlords and as enemies of the people, as people who should be wiped out.  He wants to have the land owned by the State and to have the administrative work done by civil servants.  I do not want that.  I believe in independence for the individual owner of the land.  I believe that the individual owner of the land should be secured in his ownership as long as he performs his social duties to the people.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Demands of Forestry Workers</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the departure from office of the previous Government there was a feeling amongst many classes of workers that there was then some hope of getting a readjustment of their wages and working conditions, and amongst that mass of working people were the labourers employed by the forestry section of the Department of Lands.  I recall that early last year I raised the question of the wages of these workers with the Minister.  I was then assured that he would give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that one of the chief obstacles, to my mind and to the minds of the forestry labourers generally throughout the country, in their road towards getting a decent wage was the policy of the previous Government of tying their wages down to the level of those of the agricultural labourer. That policy was unjust and unsound, and it could not be justified by any logical reasoning.  The minimum wage rates which are paid to agricultural labourers have been and are now, for the greater part of the country in areas where trade union organisation has not yet extended fully, determined by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Agricultural Wages Board, by reason of its composition, must necessarily fix wages which can be afforded by the farmer who is trying to live on the most uneconomic holding in the respective areas for which the Board is determining wages at any particular time. Any tying down of wages of any class of worker to the minimum wage rates laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board is an unjust thing.  I suggest that it puts that class of worker who is not an agricultural labourer in the same category as the agricultural labourer struggling for a living on a small farm and paid by a farmer who may, in some instances, himself be struggling for a living and the wages, therefore, are detemined by the economic condition of the farmer. Therefore, as I say, in a policy of putting <Col N="143" /> the wages of the forestry labourer on that level the forestry section was putting itself in the position of the poor farmer&mdash;and the Government of this country cannot be said, by any manner of means, to be a poor farmer so far as its economic condition is concerned. I recall fully a question I asked the Minister for Lands on the 9th March, 1948, whether he would consider altering the policy then in existence and if he would consider a departure from the policy of the former Government in tying down the rates of wages of forestry workers to those paid to agricultural labourers and the reply was: &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  Forestry workers throughout the country, many of whom are organised in the Federation of Rural Workers, felt that here was some hope that they were going to get away from the condition of the slave wage rate and from the bad conditions that have been obtaining, and that still obtain, in nurseries and forestry plantations up and down the country even to this very day.</P>
    <P>It took a considerable time until, in 1948, we got a differential of 5/- for the labourers over and above the minimum agricultural wage rates. That 5/- was in no way adequate to help these men to meet their responsibilities. Their responsibilities are not a bit less than those of higher paid workers or of the salaried classes or even of the members of this House. They may not be involved in expenditure to the same extent but a man working on forestry in Cork, Kerry, Wexford or any other part of the country has the same struggle to live as the person in a salaried position or the tradesman in a well paid occupation. He is asked to live on a wage which is unchristian and which does not afford him a dog's chance of existence. The differential of 5/- was introduced last year and late in the year, following a conference of forestry workers in Dublin, representing forestry workers in Counties Dublin, Mayo, Tipperary, Louth, Leix, Wicklow, Wexford, Kerry, Sligo, Galway and Carlow a letter was sent to the Minister setting out what could be regarded as minimum wages and conditions <Col N="144" /> that the State was asked to pay to this relatively small body of workers.  The forestry section was asked to pay a wage of £4 a week and to abandon the idea of relating the wages to the agricultural wage rates, They were asked that gangers or head labourers should receive 2/- per day or 12/- per week over the rate paid to ordinary labourers; that forestry workers be given Church holidays instead of bank holidays; that all Church holidays be given with pay; that the wages of carters be not less than £1 per day; that timber fellers, sawers, sawers' helpers and machine men at saw mills should have their wages increased in proportion; that protective clothing, rubber boots, etc., be supplied to each forestry worker.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person who knows what the rigours of manual employment are will agree that these demands could not be considered excessive or could not be considered to represent something which it is outside the scope of the Department to meet.  They were framed with the idea that the Minister has a knowledge of this class of work and must therefore have sympathy with the men concerned.  They were framed in the hope and expectancy that they would be met sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I have here a letter dated 14th February. It is impossible to decipher the signature.  It is not the signature of the Minister.  This letter indicates the sterile mind of the civil servant applied to the question of workers' wages and conditions.  The letter states that as from the 3rd January the wages of forestry labourers shall be the same as the wage rates paid to agricultural workers&mdash;the local minimum agricultural wage rates.  In respect of the substitution of Church holidays for bank holidays it is stated that this is governed by the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, and that, in any event, there can be no alteration in the number of holidays allowed to forestry workers.  It states that the Department does not undertake to supply protective clothing, other than rubber boots, to forestry workers.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly how far the Minister has gone into this question <Col N="145" /> but I can say definitely that the mentality of the man who framed that letter and the mentality of the officials dealing with the labourers in the Forestry Department is now and has been one of complete estrangement and complete carelessness as to whether these men live or die.  It is high time that something was done for men who are out in all weathers on the mountainsides carrying out work of great national importance.  This is unpleasant and arduous work and these men are exposed very often to the worst possible conditions, snow and everything else.  Some realisation must be driven home to the forestry section of the importance of these men and of the necessity of giving them a reasonable return.  There is one aspect of their employment which must give pause to anybody who considers working conditions as being of any importance, that is, the stopping of time for a Church holiday.  When a forestry labourer goes to Mass on a Church holiday, he loses a quarter of a day. Yet we talk about Christian ideals. When we get a chance of putting practical Christianity into effect, we cut the labourers a quarter of a day because they observe their religious duties.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must not be aware of that.  He was written to on the matter.  He may have overlooked it.  That is an injustice of the greatest magnitude.  Even the most despicable of our exploiting employers&mdash;and when I use that term I do realise that there is a section of employers who are more or less decent&mdash;would hesitate before they would cut their workers' wages because they went to Mass on a Church holiday.  Here, we have the Government of this great Catholic nation taking this mean, low, petty action.  It is high time that that was remedied and that the whole question of the conditions of employment and wages of forestry workers was remedied.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was a discussion in the House on the general question of afforestation.  Very many Deputies indicated that afforestation was of tremendous importance and that they had a vital interest in it.  We might as well be idle as to talk about reafforestation, we might as well be idle as to <Col N="146" /> talk about the rehabilitation or the establishment of industry, if we do not look first to the primary operatives, the people who carry the industry on their shoulders.  In this case the primary operatives are the labourers who, when all the office work is done, must go out and do the work on the mountain side. I feel that the Minister, being a practical man, and knowing the hardships that many of these labourers have to undergo, will not refuse to reconsider their case.  The total number of forestry labourers is not so large that, if they were to get a substantial increase in wages, the whole economy of the country would be unbalanced or the Budget upset or too great a burden imposed on the Exchequer.  I do not accept that.  Given determination on the part of the Minister to improve the lot of these unfortunate men, progress can be achieved.  Hardly a week goes by but you will read in the Sunday newspapers letters from forestry workers, and very often from the wives of forestry workers, outlining the hardships under which these men have to live, the distance they have to travel to work, etc.</P>
    <P>In raising this matter I feel that I am doing what should be done by a lot of other Deputies representing areas where there are many forestry workers. I feel that I am speaking their minds on the matter.  We have no forestry workers in my constituency, but in the trade union which I represent, the Federation of Rural Workers, there are very many men organised.  It is, I believe, a fundamental concept of justice that these men should be given a better opportunity of living and rearing their families in Christian comfort, as God ordained them to do.  I ask the Minister to indicate that he will give consideration to this matter again.  I am loathe to believe that the letter of the 14th February was dictated by the Minister.  I would prefer to believe that it represents the views of the officials of the Department of Lands, and I would appeal very strongly to the Minister, in the interests of these men throughout the country, to reconsider the whole question of their wages and working conditions and to do his utmost to make <Col N="147" /> their lives a little easier and better than they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that my colleague, Deputy Dunne, has pretty well covered the grievances of the forestry workers. I simply rise to give support to his arguments.  As a representative of the workers in County Waterford, I agree with him that the forestry workers are the Cinderellas of the workers of this country.  The point he made as to forestry workers having their wages cut for attending Divine Service on holidays is one which has been brought to my attention and to which I drew the Minister's attention.  Unfortunately, it still goes on.  There is a very strong opinion amongst forestry workers on this matter.  I add my voice to that of Deputy Dunne in asking the Minister to reconsider the question of the wages and conditions of the forestry workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Dunne in raising this matter, as forestry workers have many grievances.  In the diocese of Ferns, however, we do not work on Church holidays.  I do not know whether forestry workers are cut a day's wages for that.  I certainly say, however, that these men should be brought under the employment insurance scheme. They are really industrial workers within the meaning of the Act.  Their wages should not be kept down to the level of agricultural workers, because they are State employees.  Paying them the same wages as agricultural workers in the area in which they work is very unfair.  The Government should be able to do better for their employees than the ordinary farmer.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider the case of these workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to open my remarks by saying <Col N="148" /> that nobody in this House has a higher appreciation of the excellent work these men are doing for this country than I have.  The workers of all grades who are engaged in the work of reafforestation deserve the greatest credit and appreciation of their services by the State.  I should like to take this opportunity to say that because I had not an opportunity of seeing the full extent of their work before I spoke in the debate on forestry last May.  I deeply appreciate the excellent work they are doing and the valuable asset they are creating for this country.  I know that in the future they will continue to do excellent work in connection with afforestation.</P>
      <P>The four Deputies who spoke mentioned the question of Church holidays. No complaint has ever come to the Department from the forestry workers themselves of having their wages cut for attending Church on holidays.  Representations have been made on their behalf in regard to this matter but no serious complaint has been made by them personally.  I think it is true that they have been victimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>They have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell on that further than to say that, not alone would I not like to have our forestry workers cut in their wages for attending Divine Service, but I should not like to see them working on Church holidays at all.  I should like to see forestry work suspended altogether on Church holidays.  That is my own personal view.  All I can say on the matter is that I shall have it reexamined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of protective clothing mentioned in the letter, rubber boots are supplied, as Deputies are aware.  I have some experience of forestry work and I say that protective clothing is not needed for it.  I shall tell Deputies why I think so.  I think forestry workers should not continue at their work in wet weather when they would need protective clothing.  That may happen in certain places, but personally I think they should not continue working in such weather. They cannot put their heart into the <Col N="149" /> work in such conditions and they must feel very uncomfortable at it.  I am sure Deputy Dunne would bear me out in that &mdash; that they cannot work properly under such conditions, that they cannot put the right swing into their work when the weather is so bad that they need protective clothing. Rural workers have to have protective clothing and they continue working in wet weather.</P>
    <P>The forest worker is different.  He is perhaps out on a hillside planting or draining and, just like the farm worker, when the weather is wet or broken, protective clothing is not much good to him and he has not much time for it.  I would much rather see the men not work than work under such conditions even with waterproofs or oilskins.  The thing to do in that direction would be an allowance rather than for the Department to provide the clothing, but I do not hold out much hope for it except in the case of boots.</P>
    <P>Wages are not what we would like to see them.  I am not satisfied with them but they are the best we can do at the present time.  The Government cannot take up the attitude a poor farmer has to adopt when he is paying wages, but nevertheless, in time they will be better.  It is roughly 12 months to-day since the Government took office and no Deputy can say that we neglected the farm worker or the forestry worker.  Deputy Dunne has seen letters in the Sunday papers but many of them are not genuine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>An odd one.  But from the very ignorance and the very tone <Col N="150" /> of them you can tell that some are not. They may be signed by a forestry worker or a forestry worker's wife, but if such a man is a forestry worker he should not be one because he knows nothing about forestry.  By the letter you can see his ignorance which reveals that it is not genuine.  Some are genuine but some are not and I see them all.</P>
      <P>When Deputies are pressing me to be considerate to the forestry workers, or if I were Minister for Agriculture, if they were pressing me to be considerate to the farm workers, they are preaching to the converted and pushing an open door.  We are doing the very best we can and you cannot take more out of a vessel than what is in it. Deputies concerned know that is the case.  As time goes on, we will look for the opportunity to better conditions.</P>
      <P>Deputations have come to me, and Deputy Dunne is an ardent representative on behalf of the forestry workers I must say, but he is preaching to the converted when he is pressing me on their behalf.  I fully appreciate the magnificent work they have been doing and that they will do in future, and they will not be the losers.  What we can do for them we will do, and it is not for the purpose of keeping them down or pinning them down that we have to refuse Deputy Dunne's demands on their behalf.  Every Deputy, I am sure, will admit that during the last 12 months we have dealt with them more reasonably than they were dealt with during the previous 12 months or for many years before that.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, February 17th, 1949.</P>
