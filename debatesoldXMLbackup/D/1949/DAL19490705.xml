      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government has as yet reached any decision on the question of inviting the elected representatives of the people in the occupied portion of our country to take their seats in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given very full and careful consideration to this matter.  Having regard to the constitutional, legal and other difficulties involved, the Government do not intend to make any proposals for the admission to Dáil Éireann of the representatives referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The Government, however, have been considering whether Seanad Éireann should not be consulted with a view to making provision for giving them a right of audience in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that the Government have decided that they will not make any proposals for the amendment of the Constitution to enable those representatives to take their seats in this Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy must realise that there are other difficulties besides constitutional difficulties which would not be resolved, even if the people were to amend the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he was correctly reported in a daily newspaper of the 30th June as declaring at Nenagh that as a first instalment of our rights we demand the return of Tyrone and Fermanagh, those counties in which a majority of the people was severed against its will from this free and independent part of Ireland and is still coerced under the jurisdiction of the Stormont Parliament; if he realises that such a declaration may be interpreted as a demand for less than our rights; and, if so, whether he will now make it clear and specific that nothing less than our full claim to every inch of Irish soil will satisfy the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was accurately but not completely reported in the statement to which the Deputy's question refers, but I cannot agree that that <Col N="3" /> statement is capable of the interpretation he suggests.  The same newspaper report quoted me as saying, in reference to the Counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We demand the return of these counties, not merely as the first instalment of our rights, but as a demonstration of the facile sophistries by means of which the supporters of Partition attempt to justify their attitude on grounds of applying democratic principles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Another newspaper report of the same speech quoted me as adding:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No Irishman, no supporter of national self-determination admitted the right of any Irish minority to secede from Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Deputy well knows, a claim for a first instalment of a debt could not possibly be construed as acceptance in full discharge of the entire debt.  In fact, acceptance by instalments makes easier the discharge of the residue of the entire debt.</P>
      <P>While the newspaper reports generally of my speech made it abundantly clear that our claim extends to every inch of Irish soil and that nothing less will satisfy the Irish people, I suggest that my remarks also served to demonstrate that when apologists for the unnatural division of Ireland invoke, however speciously, democratic principles to support their spurious claim, they are obliged, by the valid application of the same principles, to admit the justice of our case for the immediate return of the counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh, the majority of the population in which were severed against their democratically-expressed wishes from the rest of Ireland and still remain coerced within the partitioned area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) (for Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that persons who applied for children's allowances in Irish are receiving their renewal application forms in English, as it has been the practice in my Department since the inception of the children's allowances scheme to have applications for such allowances which are made in the Irish language dealt with at all stages in Irish, and Irish versions of all the necessary forms are available. If the Deputy will furnish me with particulars of any such cases I shall have inquiries made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing instructions regarding the treatment of applications received in Irish are that all applications received in Irish must be dealt with in all their stages through that language, and particular care is taken that any correspondence received in Irish must also be answered in Irish. In practice it has been found that in many Gaeltacht areas where the application form is submitted by native speakers (particularly in the Donegal district) the details are filled in by the local school teacher and the applicant merely appends his mark.  It has subsequently been found necessary in order to bring the case to its final stages that English has had to to used at the request of the applicants.</P>
      <P>A sub-section in which the work is performed entirely through Irish exists in the children's allowances branch.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is correct that National Health Insurance cards for the coming year are to be printed in English only; and, if so, whether he will state the reason for this departure from previous practice and whether he is aware that this slight on the national language is resented by numbers of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that National Health Insurance cards for the coming year are to be printed in English only; these cards have already been printed in Irish and in English.  Any person who has been supplied with the English version and who desires the Irish version may exchange his card for the Irish version by applying to the head office of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte, 9/10 Upper O'Connell Street, Dublin, or to a local office or local agent of the society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what is the difficulty in acceding to the suggestion that was made here a few days ago of issuing the cards first in Irish and then telling anybody who wants to exchange them for English cards that they can so exchange?  Is the Minister further aware that Deputies on both sides of the House will resist any attempt at backsliding so far as the promulgation of the Irish language is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will indicate (a) the number of increased old age pensions paid to people in West Cork; (b) the number of new old age pensions paid in West Cork owing to the amelioration of the means test, and (c) the number of cases in which increases were granted by way of appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars asked for by the Deputy are not available, but the following information may meet his immediate requirements.  In the social welfare officers' districts covering approximately the West Cork area, the old age pensions of 6,581 persons were automatically increased on 7th January last by the coming into operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1948. By the 31st March (the latest date for <Col N="6" /> which figures are available) approximately 44 persons, who would not have qualified for pension prior to 7th January last owing to the means test, were in receipt of pension.  At that date the Deputy will realise that it was much too early for the full effects of the modification of the means test to appear in the statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware (i) that when a person in receipt of unemployment assistance is engaged for any period as a carter by a local authority his claim is subject to reinvestigation and his earnings as carter assessed against him, and (ii) that this may cause severe hardship; and, if so, whether he will have the matter remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the calculation of means under the Unemployment Assistance Acts all income which an applicant may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year, but excluding, amongst other things, all moneys earned by such applicant in respect of current personal employment under a contract of service, has to be taken into consideration.  Under this heading all income earned from any form of self-employment is assessed as means after due allowance has been made for the necessary expenses incurred in the earning of this income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a carter employed by a local authority, his earnings are not assessed if unemployment insurance contributions are paid in respect of the carting.  Where unemployment insurance contributions are not paid, each case is examined and a decision is given on its merits.  A small farmer who is a carter employed by a local authority for a short period or periods each year is not generally assessed with his earnings as carter if it is shown that the work is really in lieu of work on the roads which he would normally otherwise have been getting each year.  On the other hand, a small farmer or other person employed regularly as a carter by a local authority where unemployment insurance contributions are not paid, generally, has his <Col N="7" /> earnings, less deductions for the upkeep of horse and cart, assessed as means.  All such cases are determined by an unemployment assistance officer, subject to the usual rights of appeal by the applicant.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy will give me particulars of any case in which he considers that hardship has occurred, I shall have the matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that there is grave and growing concern amongst parents of children attending the primary schools regarding the frequency with which changes are made in the list of books required for each particular class, with the result that books cannot be passed down from older to younger children and parents are put to unduly excessive fresh expense each year; and, if so, whether he will state his proposals for remedial measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any grave concern amongst parents in regard to this matter in recent years.</P>
      <P>The unnecessary changing of books is discouraged by my Department. Some years ago a notice in the following terms was issued to managers and teachers for their guidance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In a separate class or standard in charge of one teacher, the readers and textbooks, when selected, are not to be changed, unless in exceptional circumstances, for a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In a division, consisting of two or more classes or standards combined, in charge of one teacher, a similar principle is to be adopted.  The readers and textbooks, when selected, should be changed in any year only to the extent which is absolutely necessary. In such cases, of course, pupils will require fresh reading matter, and possibly fresh textbooks, in their second year in the division, but the same readers and textbooks should be used in the division every third year at least.  The provision of fresh textbooks, as distinct from readers, by <Col N="8" /> pupils in their second year in a division should be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The notice continued: Under this arrangement it will be possible for books, kept clean and in good order, to be transmitted to brothers and sisters of pupils who have used them or to be acquired by other children who need them, and, as a consequence, the cost of book equipment to parents of pupils of national schools will be considerably reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>The terms of the circular are still in operation and, among other matters, a check is kept on these.  No representations of any kind have been made to me in the matter.  I shall see that some attention is given to it.  In the meantime, if there are any cases to which any Deputy thinks my attention should be called, I shall be glad to investigate the situation more fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the national school at Lettir, Glenbeigh, County Kerry, is in urgent need of re-roofing; and, if so, whether he is prepared to <Col N="9" /> provide a grant, at an early date, for the carrying through of this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the complete re-roofing of this school is not required, but that, in order to put the roof into a satisfactory condition, a number of new slates should be provided and the timber sheeting of the boys' entrance porch should be replaced.  These works are in the nature of maintenance, and are, therefore, entirely a local liability.</P>
      <P>If and when the necessary works mentioned have been carried out at local expense the Department would be in a position to allow a grant for the mastic pointing of the roof, with a view to preventing deterioration. This latter work being in the nature of an improvement would be eligible to rank for grant.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that since that report was received portion of the roof has deteriorated very much?  A grant, such as I have suggested, is necessary in the circumstances and, in view of the fact that this is a very poor district, it is very difficult to raise money by local contributions, as the Minister suggests. In view of these circumstances, would the Minister consider giving some portion of the cost?</P>

The Land Commission, whose function it is to allot land, decided to give the residue in this particular case to this man.  Whether I hold different views from them would not count a lot.  They inform me that they have gone over the full list of 30 persons in the immediate locality, apart from 11 others who were too far distant to be considered.  They consider that this person is the most suitable in their opinion and that is the end of the matter.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister's reply simply mean that the division of land is no concern of this House, that this House has no control over the activities of the Land Commission, that it is an autonomous body and that the Minister has no means of revising their decisions and that they are not in any way subject to this House?</P>

      <P>The activities of the Land Commission are not beyond the scope of this House, but the purchase of land, the fixation of price and the allotment of land are three of a few certain matters that are left to the entire discretion of the commissioners. I think the Deputy will agree that it would not be safe or prudent to interfere with these powers of the commissioners, though I agree with the Deputy in so far as he says that their decisions from time to time would appear to be not exactly the decisions that the Deputy or I would make if we had charge of these matters.  However, this House has handed complete power in these matters over to the <Col N="13" /> Land Commission and, while that power is in their hands, we must leave these functions to them, although we may not always agree with their decisions.  If, as I stated in reply to the debate on my Estimate, the House at any time considers that we should take back these powers, that is a matter for the House to decide.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands (i) if the scheme for the distribution of the Sampson estate at Whitegate, County Clare, is completed; (ii) if a holder of 100 acres of land in the district has been granted an allotment; (iii) if several small landholders have been passed over; and (iv) whether the general demand for a cowpark has been acceded to; and, if so, what is the area of ground allotted for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of this question is that this scheme has not been completed.</P>
      <P>In regard to part 2 of the question, I would point out that it is a common feature of Land Commission schemes to ask a farmer to surrender to the Land Commission an area required for Land Commission purposes on condition that the Land Commission compensate him perhaps on the other side of his farm for the land so surrendered. The scheme for the Sampson estate provided for such an arrangement with a local large holder who was allotted a small plot in exchange for an area surrendered by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards 3, the Land Commission have not found it possible to provide land in this area yet for several deserving applicants.  In the case of most land division schemes the number of deserving applicants exceeds the number of allotments available and the fact that some deserving applicants cannot be accommodated in a particular scheme does not say that the Land Commission have not their case at <Col N="14" /> heart with the intention of coming to their rescue at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>In connection with 4, it is proposed to allot a cowpark of some 35 acres in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the strict sense of the word, it would be correct to say that he did get an allotment, but it should be borne in mind that he was asked to surrender some land, in exchange for which he got the allotment, which was nearer to the congests apparently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for regret that the broadcast did not cover the end of the match but the blame for that does not rest with Radio Éireann.  The transmitters were made available from 2.55 p.m. to 5.45 p.m., that is for nearly three hours, although the net playing time was only 90 minutes.  The intervals were very long, and there had been so many stoppages that the announcer in charge at the studio had no means of knowing when exactly the match would finish.  If she had known at 5.45 p.m. that the match would end within one and a half minutes the commentary would not have been faded out to make way for the programme which was scheduled to start at that time.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to have a discussion with the G.A.A. authorities with a view to arranging that matches which are being broadcast will start punctually and will be run off expeditiously so as to ensure that listeners will have no reason for further complaints of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that the importation of fish from Scottish sources is creating difficulties for Irish inshore fishermen as a result of which three Kilkeel boats were recently forced to return home from Howth having been unable to obtain an economic price for their catches; and, if so, whether he will take such steps as are necessary to protect the interests of the inshore fishermen by the limitation of imports of Scottish sea food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that importation of fish from Scottish sources had any bearing on the incident in relation to three fishing boats from Kilkeel, County Down, to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>I understand that these boats arrived at an hour which was too late for that day's market, but that, nevertheless, the skippers were not prepared to accept at first the price offered by the buyers.  They agreed to do so later, by which time, however, owing to the probable effect of the hot weather on the condition of the fish, the buyers decided to withdraw their offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the 22nd June three Kilkeel <Col N="17" /> boats arrived at Howth?  They had with them roughly 130 cran of herrings. They were offered 45/- per cran although the price last year at this time was £4 per cran.  They felt it was not an economic price and they decided to hold out.  Eventually they found that they could not get a higher price and the buyers then refused to take the fish, with the result that they were forced to turn home with their catch.  Is the Minister aware that the fishermen feel that the cause of this is the importation of Scottish smoked fish under the 1938 agreement?  Will the Minister investigate the position with a view to seeing that the interests of the Irish fishermen are protected and that the interests of foreign fishermen are not considered of paramount importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would be good enough to invoke the assistance of these fishermen from County Down to persuade the Northern Ireland authorities to abandon the ludicrous pretence that the County Down fishermen are to be identified with Scottish fishermen rather than recognise that they are Irishmen, I would find it easier to provide for our own people, and if these fishermen are allowed to rejoin their own country it would afford me considerable pleasure to extend the same protection to their interests that I hope very shortly to be in a position to extend to the interests of the rest of the inshore fishermen of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Ad interim,</i> I should say that the facts are that on the 22nd June these fishermen from County Down came to Howth and they sold 15 cran of fish at £3 from the first boat, which had a small catch.  The remaining boats had between them over 100 cran for which they were offered £2 5s. Od.  They got in touch with their own port to see if they would get more at home.  When they got word from home that they could not get as much, they came back and said they would take the 45/-.  I think it is legitimate to presume that the fellows here put two and two together and thought that, as the fish were not worth 45/- in Kilkeel, they were not worth 45/- here; that they would not be able to sell them till the next day; that they would be just as <Col N="18" /> well off without them; and they exercised their discretion to withdraw the offer.  I think the Deputy would agree with me that we would be great fools if we got between the fishermen and the buyers and started making their bargains for them.  They were offered 45/- and they refused it, hoping to raise the price further, very naturally and commendably.  But, by the time they came back, the other boys had gone down and they missed the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the fishermen concerned should be left entirely at the mercy of the buyers and I think some arrangement should be made to protect the fishermen.  I am sure the Minister will agree that these County Down fishermen are our people equally with other fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the letter issued to him from my office on 30th April, 1948, stating that the provision of a breakwater at Schull could not be undertaken as a scheme for the relief of unemployment, and pointing out that the Cork County Council, who are responsible for the maintenance of the existing pier, should submit to the Department of Agriculture, for that Department's consideration, proposals for whatever improvements they, the council, may consider necessary.</P>

      <P>So far as transport requirements can at present be judged, there should be no further necessity for the importation of fully assembled buses, and the question of issuing further duty-free licences in respect of such buses should not therefore arise.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech on the Estimate for the <Col N="30" /> Department of Local Government in which I dealt with the question of the increase in local rates.  The total estimates adopted by county councils for the current year represent an average poundage of 23/3 as compared with 20/5 last year.  In my speech I referred to the general increase in rates and pointed out that the figures given for poundages, percentages and actual expenditure represented gross amounts and did not reflect the actual burden on the rural ratepayers.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that grants from central funds such as the agricultural grant and the road maintenance grant also increase with any rise in local expenditure and that the grant under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act largely indemnifies local authorities against increases in the cost of health services.</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed that the building of sanatoria, for which provision had been made under the previous Government, has been delayed.  While the Minister for Health has been trying to procure buildings to accommodate patients suffering from tuberculosis, I feel that <Col N="37" /> the urgent need for the building of up-to-date sanatoria to facilitate the treatment of tuberculosis generally should be considered.  The treatment of tubercular patients is better done in up-to-date hospitals and up-to-date sanatoria.  It is essential to remove tubercular patients from their homes as a precautionary measure against the spread of infection.  I am very disappointed with the Government's delay in building the up-to-date sanatoria for which provision was made by the Fianna Fáil Administration.  We heard very often about our delay in building hospitals.  In the Sanatoria Bill provision was made for three regional sanatoria.  We had advanced a good deal of the way in my constituency in County Dublin.</P>

      <P>A very fine site was acquired at Blanchardstown and we were told that the building would be expedited but nothing has been done about it and it is still at the stage of being under consideration and possibly will be carried out in the near future. I am greatly disappointed that this work has not been expedited.  There is a number of old buildings that have been acquired from time to time and a number of old hospitals that I would like to see razed to the ground and up-to-date hospitals built.  The Minister and a number of his colleagues, prior to their advent to this House, stressed the need for hospitalisation very strongly but they have failed to carry out the work.  They are in office in a most favourable period.  They have not been hampered, as we were hampered as a Government, with wars, economic wars and emergency circumstances. The Department of Health was established under the wise and judicious leadership of the Fianna Fáil Government and the machinery was all there.  Possibly, if the Minister could <Col N="38" /> get the money to go ahead with the building of these sanatoria, he would do it but the present position is most disappointing.  I hope the Minister will let us know how soon he will carry out that important work.</P>
      <P>One other point that I want to deal with is the after-care treatment of tubercular patients.  We are a bit in the air as to what type of after-care treatment is to be carried on.  We know that the local authorities allow so much money for the after-care treatment of tubercular patients and that there are some small subsidies.  However, I understand that, under the Public Health Bill, when it was initiated, it was decided that the Red Cross Society and organisations such as the St. John Ambulance and the Knights of Malta, probably, were to get a subsidy or a grant to help with the after-care treatment of patients.  I am dealing now with patients who have been sent to their homes and, in some cases, with patients before they are sent to their homes.  I was associated with the Post-Sanatoria League some years ago.  That league is still in operation but its functions are too narrow and they are not able to carry out the work which it is most desirable they should be able to carry out in helping these unfortunate tubercular patients.  I should like the Minister to make an announcement on that subject and, if possible, to encourage societies such as those which I have named, or people associated with charitable organisations, to assist a bit more in the after-care treatment of tubercular patients.  I know that the Minister is very sympathetic in that respect and that is why I ask him, if it is at all possible, to make a grant towards that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A disease which is responsible for the death of more people in this country year after year, possibly, than tuberculosis is cancer.  We are only tinkering with that problem.  We have two hospitals in the city known as cancer hospitals&mdash;Hume Street hospital and the cancer hospital in Northbrook Road&mdash;and, of course, cancer cases have been operated on in all our major hospitals.  However, we have not a <Col N="39" /> central cancer hospital in this country to deal exclusively with cancer, as such.  Cancer is one of the major diseases in this country and, to tackle the problem properly, there should be a central cancer hospital for the people of this country, be it in Dublin or some other place.  In that way the greatest specialists not alone in this country but in every other country in the world could be procured in an effort to reduce the number of deaths from that disease every year.  When Dr. Charles and others like him started in Hume Street Hospital it was thought that that disease was not curable, but very fine work has been carried out in that hospital and also in the general hospitals. Nevertheless, we have now reached the time when there is a definite public demand for a central cancer hospital. Only last week I was asked to go to see a man suffering from cancer and to try to get him into a hospital, but the bed position in the hospitals is bad and none was available for him although the treatment is most urgent.  I would ask the Minister for Health to ask the liberal-minded Minister for Finance if there is any possibility of getting money to build a central cancer hospital and thus deal adequately with this public necessity, as I hold it to be.  The Minister might also arrange for the provision of clinical treatment in the country in that connection and advise our people of the necessity for early diagnosis and early cure.  That, too, would, in its own way, be responsible for reducing the number of deaths.</P>
    <P>I am frequently asked to try to get people who are suffering from rheumatism into hospitals.  A number of very young people in this country are crippled with rheumatism and, if you try to get them into hospitals, you will be told that they are chronic cases, notwithstanding the fact that they are very young.  It should be possible for such people to get some treatment in an up-to-date hospital.  I am aware that we have a rheumatism clinic in Dublin and that certain treatments are given for rheumatism all over the country but, again, there is a necessity for looking after a disease of that kind &mdash;if we can call it a disease, as it is&mdash; in a general centralised way.  We have <Col N="40" /> only one or two clinics, which give short treatment, and, as I have said, when one tries to get such patients into hospitals one is told that such cases are chronic cases and that they have a number of acute cases.  That is definitely true and we must agree that they are telling the truth.  It is up to us in Dáil Éireann, as far as it is humanly possible to do so, to see that some definite step is taken to deal with this matter.  My information is that more than 300,000 people in this country are suffering from rheumatism of one form or another.  I am personally aware of some young people who are suffering from the disease and who cannot get the required treatment.  They are in bed, confirmed invalids.  Some of them are being treated by doctors and others by quack doctors.  Some of them, when they find they cannot get into a hospital, lose hope and become very despondent.  I am deeply concerned about this matter and I feel that I cannot impress on the House too much the urgent necessity there is for the Minister to take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I was asked by the Superior of the St. John of God Institution to visit their three institutions in this country.  I was informed some time ago that over 1,000 mental defectives are on the waiting lists of such institutions in this country.  Some days after, through the Government Information Bureau and the newspapers, the Minister for Health informed me that his Department was aware of the fact and that they were going to give a grant for the provision of more accommodation for children of that kind.  Adequate provision for children of low mentality or mental defectives has been made in England and in Scotland and, if there are 1,000 on the waiting lists of such institutions in this country, I hold that there is urgent need to expedite the matter.  The Order of St. John of God, which Order looks after such children, deserves the thanks of this House for their great work.</P>
    <P>I deplore the number of young children of three or four years of age who are patients in our public institutions and who mix with adults.  There is an <Col N="41" /> urgent need that such children should be kept to themselves.  They should be graded, as far as their mental disease is concerned, and looked after in a proper and humane way.  Other countries are able to do that and have grappled with the problem.  Now that we have a Department of Health, which was established for the sole purpose of looking after the health of our people in general, every help and encouragement should be given to voluntary organisations to grapple with the position and to try and segregate, as far as possible, the children from the other inmates in public institutions throughout the country and to try and bring them to some place or some home or some institution where they will be properly segregated and where occupational therapy and other treatment that will, perhaps, be responsible for an improvement can be carried out. As they are things are haphazard.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for Health to make a statement on the mother and child welfare scheme as cited in the Public Health Act passed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I want to go back on one point again and that is how very hard it is for certain individuals who have applied to build tuberculosis rooms on to their homes.  A lot of difficulty has been put in their way.  Sometimes the town planning authority will come along and say that the place is not suitable.  I wonder could the Minister take grievances of that kind into consideration, particularly where people go back to their homes where there are two or three rooms or two rooms and a small kitchen.  There is an urgent necessity, particularly in country districts, for the carrying out of the scheme initiated by Deputy Seán MacEntee as Minister for Local Government for building extra rooms.  I very much welcome the extension of the tuberculosis allowance as far as mothers are concerned and I think it is very welcome to us all.</P>
    <P>I have to deal with workers employed in certain hospitals and institutions throughout the country.  I have here a letter from some workers employed in Peamount Sanatorium and I am very sorry to say that they are <Col N="42" /> working for a mere pittance.  If we are to have an improvement in the health services in this country, I say definitely that we should see that workers in places of that kind get a reasonable remuneration to live on and not a mere pittance or existence.  As it is, their health breaks down and they are not able to look after their families if they are unfortunate enough to get married on that mere pittance. The hours of duty in these institutions are to be deplored and the conditions under which employees work. I take this opportunity of appealing to the authorities who carry on the old hateful system of driving young people who go into the nursing service.  I am surprised, even in these days when people have a more intelligent outlook, that this old system of shouting and roaring at young nurses before the patients goes on in many general hospitals I know, instead of taking the intelligent view and using discretion, which is often the better part of valour, and trying to inculcate into them the loyalty which is so essential in the nursing service rather than sending them out soured with their superiors.  I appeal to these authorities through the Dáil to change that outlook generally.  The same applies to certain nurses in private homes, and the hours there are abominable.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the public health dispensaries all over the country.  In County Dublin we have made an effort to improve our dispensary service and while I am dealing with the subject I would ask the Minister for Health to do everything possible to expedite them.  In the case of certain dispensaries I know in this country I would think it very hard to bring an animal into them not to mind a human being.  The people who go there have to line up outside in all weathers without shelter and when they go to a doctor to be treated you feel that there is a pauper air about it. Having had our freedom in this country for some time now, I feel that an honest to God effort should be made to get rid of that system.  We have small dispensaries where the doctor can hardly turn around.  The previous Minister for Local Government got a <Col N="43" /> number of dispensaries built in County Dublin and I want the present Minister for Health to see that the good work is carried on of building proper up-to-date clinics.  When a man, woman or child goes to a dispensary or clinic they should feel that they have the backing of the people of the country, not that they are paupers, and until these things are changed we are going to be in a very bad way.  While I am on that matter, I want to refer to St. Kevin's Hospital.  I made a statement about it already and I would like to see every stone of it taken down and a new hospital built with the resources of the nation if they could afford it, but when the resources of the nation cannot do everything we will have to deal with the situation as it is.  During the past five or six years there has been an improvement in St. Kevin's but I know that a number of people have an animosity towards it.  They will not go there as they feel it is the old union building when they see the same old black stones, the same old building and the same dismal outlook that were there during the centuries of oppression before we got our own Government.  It is a big national matter and I hope to live to see the day when it is taken down stone by stone and when we will have more up-to-date, cheery hospitals for the people.</P>
    <P>People who go into hospitals kept up by local authorities or Government grants have a feeling that they are friendless and homeless and the Minister for Health could appeal to the various charitable societies.  We have a number of charitable societies in our cities and counties which visit these friendless souls who feel that nobody minds whether they live or die, but I feel that a word from the Minister for Health in appealing to these charitable societies to pay these people an odd visit and if they are intelligent enough to read to bring them a book would be a great help.  I have long experience of these friendless souls; they are left there and nobody minds whether they live or die and I feel from a human point of view we should take it up and help them as it might be our own end yet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> If there was one system which I was delighted to see going it was the red ticket system.  I would like the Minister in replying to give us a better explanation of the red ticket system generally.  I did not catch fully his statement dealing with it.  I have received complaints generally.  I am not going to make a specific charge against anybody's house, but I have heard that when people of humble means, married men in receipt of small salaries with large families, go to the doctor they are refused without the red ticket.  The people in charge of the red ticket might be absent.  An urgent case has come to my notice and I spoke to the individuals concerned; the doctor did not want to treat these people unless they got the red ticket. Any system that is going to be brought in to get rid of that one will be welcome and I ask the Minister to make a further statement on that.</P>
    <P>Blood transfusion has been responsible for saving many lives in recent times.  I see that the Minister has established a company to deal with the whole question of national blood transfusion services and that step would be welcome.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my notice that certain minerals which have been made in this country are of inferior quality.  I think that the Minister should take cognisance of that fact and should establish some system of a test in these matters.  In saying that I do not suggest that there should be a certain grade in all minerals, but it has been brought to my notice that certain of them are of a very low standard.</P>

    <P>I wonder will the Minister for Health consider recommending that school managers provide a small room where examinations by dentists and nurses of pupils could be carried out.  The present system is not satisfactory.  I know it is going to be difficult to provide such accommodation in small <Col N="45" /> schools, but the matter could be more easily dealt with in the larger schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody who has listened to the mournful speech of Deputy Burke would enjoy good health.  He seems to attribute all the things which have been done in the last few months to the policy of Fianna Fáil over the last 16 years.</P>
      <P>In referring to some grievances in South Kerry in the matter of hospitalisation I am not inferring that these are the responsibility of the present Minister.  For many years attempts have been made to build a new hospital in Cahirciveen to replace the present institution, which is in such a deplorable state as to be almost primitive.  Efforts have been made for some time to find a suitable site and it was only quite recently that one was decided upon.  I understand that all the preliminary work has been done and that the plans have been sent by the architect to the Kerry County Council.  I would ask the Minister to urge on that body the great necessity for starting the work of building a new Cahirciveen hospital.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the mobile X-ray unit in Kerry is another matter of urgency.  Whilst there may be a possibility that the centre of such a unit would be in Tralee, I would suggest to the Minister the possibility of having it placed in the centre of the county and of making Killarney the centre.  In any case, I do hope that the unit will be established in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The question of dispensaries has been referred to by Deputy Burke.  I agree that in most cases they are in a very dilapidated condition and are the most dilapidated buildings in the areas in which they are situated.  They are certainly no incentive to good health or to the people to keep their homes and their surroundings clean.  It would be necessary, in my opinion, to erect new buildings in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of salaries and responsibility for jubilee nursing services is another matter calling for attention. In years gone by there were various societies in this country and outside of it, particularly in London, which gave <Col N="46" /> grants to help in the payment of the salaries of these nurses.  If the Minister has power he should see that these jubilee nurses, who are doing invaluable work in their areas, are taken over as a State responsibility and that the State shall be responsible for their salaries.</P>
    <P>Many years back the health authorities established a sanatorium in Kerry known as Edenburn and certainly whoever was responsible for that building will not be remembered with any gladness in Kerry.  Situated in the centre of a marsh, the main building was only useful as a nurses' home and two other buildings had to be put up for the patients.  It was certainly most unfair to the people of Kerry that patients should have to go to a place like that. It is in such a state that when tubercular patients hear that they are being sent to Edenburn they feel that they are being sentenced to death.  I think that if anybody was improvident enough to set blaze to the whole building, after, of course, the nurses and patients had been removed, it would be a blessing to the people of Kerry. The Minister should consider urging the responsible body to find a suitable site away from the marshes for the proper equipment of a building to deal with tubercular patients in Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like if the Minister for Health, when replying, would give the House some definite particulars as to the position he has reached with regard to the scheme for hospitalisation for the whole country, with particulars in relation to the capital moneys available to him under the Hospitals' Trust scheme and the extent to which he anticipates these moneys will build up in the years to come, together with the interest on invested moneys.  I would like the Minister to indicate these things so that those in the House and on local bodies interested in the matter will know whether we can give money to the different schemes for the advancement of hospitalisation and will know, in fact, whether there is available money to provide for these schemes.  The Minister, when replying to a question in that connection, was not quite clear. I quite understand that my supplementary <Col N="47" /> to him may not have been very clear, but I should like him to answer it in as detailed and specific a form as possible.</P>
      <P>He did mention that further schemes would have to be subsidised by the promoters and I am afraid that that would mean that further schemes of hospitalisation, schemes in addition to those already envisaged and sanctioned, would mean a very heavy additional burden on the already overburdened rates.  We need to know now, however, what the position is, and, if we find that there is likely to be difficulty in regard to the sanctioning of additional schemes, many of which are being considered, and if the only alternative is to have the cost put directly on the ratepayers, we shall have to approach the problem from another angle and see to what extent we can make the present hospitalisation do, with certain improvements.  I understand from the Minister that not only is the amount of money at present available already earmarked but that for some years to come&mdash;for seven years, I think&mdash;the anticipated income plus the interest has been, in a sense, used up.  The Minister will, I hope, give us some clear details on that matter, so that those people who are busy thinking out new schemes of hospitalisation will not be wasting his time, in view of the fact that they cannot be considered for another seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister prepared to consider assisting local authorities who have to provide housing in excess of the normal housing for what are called priority cases, that is, sufferers from tuberculosis? We can build houses only at a certain rate, depending upon the availability of materials and skilled labour, but we must also relate our plans to the income of the local authority and the possibility of its being able to carry further burdens.  I understand that, in the City of Dublin, there is a sum of approximately 3/- in the £ on the rates at the moment in respect of the corporation's subsidy for houses.  When the rate of building increases, as it is increasing, that 3/- will very rapidly double itself and people will not understand <Col N="48" /> that it is because of the urgent need for increased housing that the corporation subsidy is being used to such an extent as to impose this burden on the rates.</P>
    <P>On top of this, we have in Dublin over 1,000 cases of certified tubercular patients who are awaiting suitable accommodation, families where tuberculosis has been certified to exist, and we have to supply these people with houses, as distinct from ordinary family needs.  Up to recently, we had to try to provide houses in cases where there were as many as eight living in a single room.  We have got away from that now, thank goodness, and are down to a much lower figure, but the tubercular case has to be considered separately and specially, and I should like to know whether the Minister, in connection with his general policy of trying to alleviate the sufferings of these people and to eradicate the disease, would consider giving additional assistance to local authorities in the shape of a subsidy by the State in respect of houses specially set aside for certified tubercular cases.  It is a very big and a very serious problem and I should like the House to understand the great difficulties which have to be overcome by a local authority, such as the Dublin Corporation.  I am sure that the Cork Corporation has similar problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Bigger problems but a similar situation.  As a local authority, we want to try to house our people as best we can.  We want to provide reasonably decent houses for ordinary sized families.  At present we are trying to deal with the larger families, but, in addition, we have these tubercular cases which it is imperative should be dealt with on a priority basis, and, in view of the approach by the Minister and the Government to the problem, would the Minister be prepared to consider taking over, as a national charge, the subsidy payable by the local authority in respect of such houses as are allocated to certified tubercular cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently announced that he considered part of the treatment of <Col N="49" /> these cases in institutions the visits paid to patients by members of their families.  I think he indicated that he regarded these visits as something desirable and as part of the treatment. I wonder if he is aware that some institutions make it very difficult for patients to have frequent visits by members of their families.  In the case of Rialto Hospital, there is only one visiting day per week, and, in Crooksling Sanatorium, visiting days are also limited.  I understand that the people running these institutions say that visitors coming there create difficulties for them, but, nevertheless, I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of drawing up regulations with regard to the method to be adopted universally by institutions in connection with the patients there.  It is very unfair that each institution should make its own rules and regulations in regard to visits to suit its own convenience and not the convenience of the patients or their relatives.</P>
    <P>Under the Health Act, the State gives very valuable assistance to families in the shape of allowances where working members of the family have to go into an institution and families are given the means of sustenance to a great extent, if not altogether, while that member of the family is in the institution, but I feel that tubercular patients and their relatives have very serious grievances in the matter of visits, and I ask the Minister to consider drawing up regulations for institutions of this kind, as has been done in the case of mental hospitals. In the management of mental hospitals, every member of the board and every patient, if he is capable of understanding, knows the rights he has and what the position is with regard to visits, but the position is quite different in these institutions for tubercular patients.  As we are all anxious to deal with this scourge in a way which will enable us to make some progress towards eliminating it, the Minister ought to consider drawing up these regulations and saying that these institutions must conform to them, as drawn up on the basis of his own opinion and the advice of those concerned as to the best thing to do.  I would also suggest to the Minister that, in connection <Col N="50" /> with these institutions, he should have the diet that is provided in them examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Hickey agrees with me because I imagine that he also has some knowledge of the complaints that I have had.  In view of the difficulty of keeping within certain allowances and so on I do not believe that the food position is properly considered at all in the case of some of these institutions. I think that the Minister should get his Department to lay down regulations as to what the diet provided should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have a dietician?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, through his Department, should lay down the class of diet which he would regard as the minimum for the patients in these institutions.  From my knowledge of Crooksling, and other institutions, I am not satisfied that the diet is satisfactory, particularly where you are dealing with the types of patients to be found in them.  I am not competent to say what is the best thing to be done.  We are all in agreement that bad housing is one of the things which retards the cure of tuberculosis. Another is under-nourishment.  Where you are trying to restore the health of tubercular patients, the two things which I have mentioned are of great importance.  These are points that should get the Minister's attention without delay.  If there is a diet laid down by the Minister, it should apply universally, because, even at the present time, you will find that the food provided is not the same in any two institutions.  I think, too, that the method of preparing and serving the food could, in many cases, be improved.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate that he is prepared to give this matter consideration.  I do not expect him to be able to do that to-day or to-morrow.  It will satisfy me if he indicates to the House that this matter has been brought to his attention, and that he is prepared to give it consideration.  I think he will <Col N="51" /> find, if he does that, that something will have to be done.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I want to bring to the Minister's attention, and it is that there seems to be a great need for the co-ordination of all the services which are concerned with this particular idea of general welfare and general health.  I hope the Minister will be able to find means of bringing about that co-ordination.  Take a tubercular case in a family.  In a case of that sort, various benefits are available, but, in my opinion, there should be a co-ordination of them.  There should not be overlapping or a shortage of one thing or another.  Housing, treatment and nourishment should be examined together.  You very often find a case like this.  There is a member of a family suffering from tuberculosis and a house is made available for it, but when you visit that family in the new house you often find that they have not enough food.  When you make an inquiry you are told that some other organisation deals with that aspect of the case.  That sort of thing could not happen if there was a proper co-ordination of all the services which are available for the treatment of tubercular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to know what position is likely to be reached with regard to Dublin within the next five or ten years, particularly in the matter of general hospitalisation.  We know that, at one time, a scheme was envisaged for the amalgamation of all the hospitals, and for the building of new big hospitals in certain centres, and that all the requirements that could be normally considered were brought into consideration.  We know now that the scheme of amalgamation for the Dublin hospitals has been abandoned, and that we have to carry on with the existing hospitals in which certain alterations and improvements are to be carried out.  I should like to hear from the Minister what, he thinks, the final position will be in, say, five years from now.  Take the new, built-up areas in places like Crumlin and Drimnagh which have no hospital in their immediate vicinity.  In these areas, when a woman has to go to the Rotunda, <Col N="52" /> Holles Street or the Coombe for the birth of a child she has to be brought in a taxi.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that if she were going to hospital by ordinary transport and were to take ill on the way, transport would be provided for her without any charge to the family. If, however, her husband were to ring up for a conveyance to take her, he would have to pay for it, irrespective of whether he could afford to do so or not.  I think that, in places like Crumlin and Drimnagh, centres should be set up as soon as possible for treatment before and after birth.  People should be able to get immediate attention, and should not be left to feel that the nearest hospital was so many miles away from them.  Even in the City of Dublin, three or four miles can sometimes be a long distance when a patient is in urgent need of attention.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to relate what I am now saying to my opening remarks.  The Minister knows to what extent commitments have been made with regard to the money that is available, or that is likely to be available, for hospitals all over the country.  He must know what the possibilities are likely to be in Dublin over the next five or six years.  If he relates the matters that I have just been dealing with to what I said at the outset, he will, I think, understand the point I am stressing.  If the general hospitals in Dublin could know what is likely to happen to them they could reconsider their position.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Minister has been quite reasonable in connection with Baggot Street Hospital. I happen to be a member of the board there.  When we discovered that this amalgamation scheme was abandoned we had to point out that our out-patients section was not up to date. The Minister has agreed, having come there himself and examined the matter, to allow us to make certain alterations and undertake certain expenditure so that we may be able to cater more adequately for the patients who come to the clinics attached to the hospital.  There are, however, other hospitals that need to be brought <Col N="53" /> up to date if there is not going to be, what was originally envisaged, the demolition of the existing voluntary hospitals and the creation of a scheme for the building of big new hospitals to cater for the requirements of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister is prepared to take away from some of the general hospitals the care of fever cases.  If, in a general hospital, you have a fever ward with only one patient in it that whole section of the hospital has, so to speak, to be isolated from the remainder of the hospital, so that on many occasions you find that, while there are beds available in the hospital, with many applicants for them, they cannot be availed of.  I suggest that there should be a large central hospital for the treatment of fever cases and that the general hospitals should be reserved for the treatment of ordinary cases of illness.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has received any report, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, dealing with the question of finding beds for urgent cases.  I know from the few hospitals, in connection with which I have the honour to represent the Dublin Corporation, that the question of beds being utilised to the fullest capacity is kept very much under observation and every month the boards of the hospitals know to what extent beds have been idle&mdash;in other words, on how many bed days a bed has been idle.  We all have had complaints by doctors pointing out the difficulty of getting patients into hospitals for treatment at short notice.  I should like to know if the Minister has received any report as to the inadequacy of beds in our hospitals and to what extent additional beds are necessary, particularly in the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the time of the House with criticisms of the Minister or the Department.  Anybody charged with the responsibility of looking after the health of our people has an onerous task.  The main reason why I have brought those matters to the attention of the House is because they are causing us some thought on the various public boards to which we <Col N="54" /> belong, and I should like the Minister to give them his serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I listened to some Deputies speaking about our dispensaries. So far as County Kerry is concerned, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the dispensary accommodation there.  The dispensaries in Kerry are not up to standard. They require immediate attention from the Department, in co-operation with the local authorities, or else there should be some scheme which would provide adequate grants to enable the dispensaries to deal more adequately with the requirements of the people.</P>
      <P>I will instance one case in an isolated rural district where there is not an adequate supply of medicine in the local dispensary and the poor people have to purchase the medicines they require in Killarney or Killorglin.  To do so some of them have to travel a distance of 20 miles.  The fact is that those people are entitled to get their medicine from the local medical officer. All he does now is to prescribe and direct them to obtain it in some other district.  That practice has been going on for some time.  Whether it is the fault of the local authority or not, I do not know.  I will name the district for the Minister later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important point I would like to mention has reference to the administration of the Infectious Diseases Act.  I had occasion to mention this to the Minister last year.  I will instance two cases to indicate how the Act works in our county.  There is a sanatorium down there.  It was described by Deputy Palmer as unsuitable but, nevertheless, we have to utilise it.  A man whose wife is detained there is unemployed and he has to look after their four children.  Under the Act as it stands that man cannot get assistance.  If the position were reversed and if he were in the sanatorium, his wife would get an allowance. Under the relevant section the only provision that is made is 15/- per week for the employment of a maid to nurse the children.  This man has done everything in his power to provide this assistance.  He has tried to find a girl to work for the 15/- a week and take care of the four children.  He cannot <Col N="55" /> get anybody to do it.  The section provides for a person other than a relative to act as maid.  I understand the Minister altered that recently so that a relative could be employed, but, even so, what could any poor man in any part of the country do with 15/- a week?</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I am going too far, but this matter is so urgent and important that I find it necessary to make the best case I can.  Deputy Palmer referred to the Cahirciveen hospital.  I paid a tribute last year to the Minister in this connection and I will pay him another tribute now.  We have been agitating for that hospital for 25 years.  Various efforts were made until April of last year, when the <Col N="56" /> Minister gave his sanction.  We appreciate what he has done for the people of South Kerry: they will appreciate his action for the rest of their lives. I heard Deputy Briscoe taking about the Dublin hospitals and the conveyance of patients two or three miles. When you compare that with what we have to contend with&mdash;when patients are conveyed a distance of 52 miles over mountain roads to hospitals in Tralee or Killarney&mdash;you will visualise what it means to us to have this splendid hospital at Cahirciveen. Deputy Palmer mentioned about the Kerry County Council being urged to expedite their end of the job.  At our last meeting we dealt with that matter and the suggestions submitted by Mr. Tyndall, the architect, have been attended to and this matter has been referred to the Department for a final survey.  Last year I asked the Minister about the provision of a mobile X-ray unit.  The Minister informed me then that such a service would be provided with headquarters in Cork.  I regret to say that nothing has so far been done with regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>Another point to which I would draw the Minister's attention is to the fact that we always have occasion to send patients to the Dublin hospitals.  We find great difficulty in finding accommodation for them.  It is practically impossible to get beds.  Deputy Briscoe referred to the distance travelled by some people here in Dublin.  I suppose he was making the best case he could but, after all, there are alternative hospitals here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>Unfortunately they cannot get into those either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of specialists here and there is alternative accommodation.  If we have a patient who requires specialist treatment we have no alternative but to try to get that patient into some Dublin hospital. There is a waiting list for these hospitals in Dublin and our patient may be held up for weeks or months.  Sometimes the patient dies before hospital accommodation can be obtained.  We are up against that every second day. I am sure every Deputy in my constituency <Col N="57" /> has had the experience of being asked to approach the matron, the medical officer or the directors in order to try to get beds made available.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would repeat that I appreciate everything the Minister has done for us during the past year.  I merely comment on the Infectious Diseases Act in a spirit of helpful criticism.  As a local authority we have certain difficulties and the only thing we can do is to make representations to the Minister and his Department. In general, it is our intention to be as helpful as possible both here and on the local authority to assist in the good work the Minister is carrying out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that sufficient thought has not been given in the Health Bill to what is, after all, the corner-stone of the entire scheme. I refer to the nursing personnel.  I am informed on very reliable authority that there is a grave scarcity of nurses in the country at the moment.  Unless conditions are improved and unless salaries are made attractive far more of our nurses will leave the country to seek better and more remunerative employment elsewhere.  The salaries offered to nurses in sanatoria are completely inadequate.  I understand that, with general training followed by specialised tuberculosis training, it takes about six years to train a girl for sanatoria nursing.  I have been told that the salary offered to such a nurse is only £20 more than that given to a cook in the same institution.  I am not casting any reflection on cooks but it must be remembered that a cook does not spend the same amount of time and money on her training as a nurse does.  I do not think such conditions could be conducive to either the contentment or happiness of nursing personnel.  The former Minister recommended an increase in nurses' salaries. Some institutions made that increase effective but, on the other hand, they cut down travelling expenses.  Such petty economies should not be indulged in where nursing staff are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that nurses have been too long neglected.  Anyone who has any experience of nursing knows what a trying occupation it is.  Even the best of us <Col N="58" /> who may have to nurse a patient in our own homes will get irritable at times. People have often complained about nurses in hospitals, forgetting that those who nurse a patient in their own homes often get just as irritable as nurses do.  Sick people very often are unreasonable, but they must be tolerated. Such criticism of nurses should not be made.  They do their best for everybody.  They are as kind as they can possibly be to the patients.  They have a certain amount of work to do and that work must be done within a certain limit of time.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I might mention that in very few institutions is the regulation governing the 96-hour fortnight carried out.  Most nurses have to work a 56-hour week.  That is most unreasonable.  One can well understand why girls will not take up nursing at home and why they are going to England in such numbers.  Most of them would prefer to remain at home working under congenial conditions even at a lower rate of salary than they are paid abroad.  I would appeal to the Minister to do anything within his power to remedy the present situation.</P>
    <P>Most employed people at the present time are entitled to 14 days' annual leave with pay.  Nurses do not obtain the same treatment.  In regard to temporarily employed nurses the system is to take them on for three months, dismiss them at the end of that period and re-employ them for another three months.  In that way they can never qualify for 14 days' annual leave.  That is taking a rather mean advantage of the members of this very important and noble profession. They have never been given the cost-of-living bonus which was permitted during the emergency; at least, they have never reached the highest point that was permitted where increases were granted in other cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Health Bill will ever be a workable proposition unless conditions are improved where nurses are concerned.  I suggest that a commission of inquiry should be set up to investigate the conditions of employment, salaries and holidays.  A pension <Col N="59" /> scheme should also be brought into operation.  I cannot understand why nurses should not enjoy the same facilities as do other workers.  Nurses should be a contented body of women carrying out the work entrusted to them under proper conditions of employment and with appropriate remuneration.  If no improvement is made the present scarcity will continue and our young girls will seek employment elsewhere.  It is not to-day or yesterday that this position has arisen. All down the years nurses have suffered.  I think they are the worst treated people in the State and I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to my remarks.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister made a tour of the county homes.  I visited county homes in Donegal, Clare, Mayo and Galway.  The type of institution is the same in every county.  It is a legacy from the British Government.  Why human beings were ever housed in these buildings I cannot understand. They are more like fortresses.  Certainly they never could have been intended for occupation by people with souls.  They have not changed.  They are not prefabricated buildings.  They are strong stone buildings and a lot could be done to improve them.  They could be distempered in bright colours instead of having these dreadful whitewashed walls and flagged floors.  The surroundings are certainly not pleasant for those who have to occupy them. Some of the inmates have never known any other kind of home.  Something should be done to make them more pleasant for the inmates, the nurses and the religious sisters who run them. It is a sad reflection on our civilisation that our aged people should have to live in such homes.  I know it is difficult for the Minister to carry out all the building that is necessary.  A great deal of building has been done in the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The problem of building proper homes for the aged and the poor is, I admit, a big one but I think a lot could be done by distempering the walls of the present buildings with pleasing colours and covering the old flagged <Col N="60" /> floors with linoleum or even matting. Anyone who has visited a county home in winter time or even in summer time knows that the conditions are appalling. The people there have nothing to look at but grey bare walls and it must be a dreadful ordeal for the Sisters and nurses who have to attend these old people.  These are a few of the matters which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister.  I hope he will be successful in his endeavours to improve the health of the people generally.  He certainly will be entitled to the congratulations of members of every Party if he carries out the great work which he is undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the remarks of previous speakers in regard to the necessity for improving conditions under which nurses are employed. I think that it is too bad that we have so long ignored the privations of the nurses in the various hospitals. With a view to doing something practical towards the amelioration of their conditions, I would suggest that the Minister should introduce a Bill under which he would make it compulsory on everybody employing nurses to observe certain working conditions as well as wages.  While the hours of present work by nurses, 96 per fortnight, are entirely too long, there is nobody but must admit that a large number of nurses work more than 96 hours per fortnight.  When I suggest that legislation should be introduced to regulate these matters, I have in mind the number of nurses employed in private nursing homes, and many important nursing homes, where they are very much exploited so far as wages and hours are concerned.  Unless legislation is brought in to cover these nurses, they will continue to be exploited as most of them have been in these places in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his efforts to improve the health of our people.  I am sure that he will agree with me when I say that the problem of public ill-health is largely an economic one.  If the rate of progress in the improvement of the health <Col N="61" /> of the people is slow&mdash;and I think it is &mdash;I think the explanation for that can be found in the conditions in which our people have had to live for the past 20 years or more.  When one reads the reports of the different county and city medical officers of health, one gets an idea immediately of how little progress has been made as regards health matters.  I shall first deal with the area with which I am most familiar, namely, Cork City.  In 1928 the infant mortality rate in Cork City was 76 per 1,000&mdash;that is 20 years ago&mdash;while in 1947 it was 87 per 1,000.  Surely there is evidence that we are making no progress, notwithstanding all that has been said.  The number of deaths of infants under one month in 1931 was 41; in 1941 it was 52, and in 1947 it was 87.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from tuberculosis of all forms in 1936 in Cork was 1.29; in 1946 it was 1.34 and in 1947 it was 1.95, which figure the Cork Medical Officer of Health stated was depressing. Of the 4,478 children inspected by the school medical officer in Cork for the year ending the 31st December, 1947, 9.7 per cent. suffered from malnutrition. Of the 112,284 children examined in 1947 in the school medical services of the State, 2,919 were suffering from malnutrition.  Apart from the number so classed, small numbers were classed as being under-nourished or of poor nutrition, fair nutrition, sub-nutrition, defective nutrition or below average nutrition.  Malnutrition is a fashionable word but to me it is a 12-letter word for starvation.  Malnutrition, to me, is a social evil that can only be eradicated by a bold social policy.  Any policy that may be devised to deal with it must be based on the inalienable right of every person in the community to an adequate supply of food.  I think the Minister will admit from the figures I have given that they show little or no progress during the past 20 years, that improvement in the health of the people is no longer possible in terms of medical attention and care, and that the way to public health is along the road to improved social and economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should appoint a committee of medical <Col N="62" /> men and experts with the necessary knowledge with a view to determining the weekly expenditure which must be incurred by families of varying sizes, if health and working capacity are to be maintained.  No doubt we shall be told that to provide every man, woman and child with a sufficiency of food of a proper standard would cost a large sum of money.  I admit that that is so but it would be well-spent money because it would enable the people to maintain their health and to preserve their working capacity.  It would save the State a very big financial burden in the way of providing social services and trying to cure ill-health amongst our people.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to mention is the question of our food supplies, particularly our supplies of milk.  With a view to bringing the matter more forcibly home to the Minister, I should like to give a quotation from the report of the medical officer of health for Cork City for 1947.  He stated that as a result of bacteriological tests, 5.2 of the milk supplies examined contained tubercle bacilli.  It was also stated that 22.2 per cent. of the samples of milk examined in 1947 were classified as dirty.  I think it is an appalling state of affairs that milk is allowed to be sold at the present time in our cities in that condition.  The Cork District Milk Board, who are responsible for the price of milk, should also be made in some way responsible for the quality of the milk.  One of the difficulties encountered in that direction is that the veterinary officers who discover dirty milk or milk which is below standard, and which is being supplied to the people, cannot carry out investigations where the producer of the milk lives outside the Cork City boundary, whereas the area covered by the Milk Board extends for five miles outside the city.  These are matters that should be dealt with very quickly because the supply of milk to Cork is in a very bad state.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said by other Deputies about dispensaries.  That is a matter which, I am sure, will have the very sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  I <Col N="63" /> do not expect that the Minister can, within a very short time, do all the things that are calling for attention over such a long lapse of years, but there is no doubt that there are dispensaries in Cork City and surrounding districts that are a very bad blot on our medical services.  So far as county homes are concerned, at the moment we have a number of old age pensioners and semi-invalid people in the county home.  We feel that that is not the place for them.  If they could be taken out of these institutions and put into homes like the Nazareth home in Mallow or the home of the Sisters of the Poor in Cork it would be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Briscoe dealing with the question of food in hospitals. I would appeal to the Minister to have that most necessary official, a dietician, appointed for the different hospitals.  Instead of trying to provide certain food for people by injections, it should be done in the natural way by having due regard to the class of food that should be given to them.  I think it is very necessary that there should be regulations about the food supplied in hospitals and that these should come from the Minister or any medical men who are in charge.</P>
    <P>As to hospitalisation for the City of Cork, I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister if he is still dealing with the matter by means of the same machine, as I call it, that I happened to know between 1932 and 1943.  If that machine is still operating in his Department I do not see much hope of hospitalisation in the City of Cork or indeed anywhere else.  A site was provided for a regional hospital in Cork, architects were appointed, and a building was to be erected at a cost of £300,000.  We asked the architects to proceed with the building of a hospital according to the amount of money available and we got plans for a hospital which was to cost £451,000. That hospital, I am informed, is now going to cost over £1,000,000.  When I hear of these figures I am at a loss as to where the Minister is ultimately going to find the money for building these huge hospitals and the cost of <Col N="64" /> maintaining them when they are built. I saw recently where the money of the Hospitals' Trust was invested.  I do not want to discourage anybody, but I hope it will be realisable.  The money is invested everywhere from Ceylon to Newfoundland.  From 1932 to 1939, if blame could be placed on anybody, it could be placed on the people in charge of the building of hospitals in those years.</P>
    <P>We were to have a regional hospital, a maternity hospital and a fever hospital in the City of Cork.  They were supposed to be under way since 1932 but a sod has not yet been turned in connection with them.  I am quite sure that it is not necessary to plead with the Minister in connection with these matters.  I feel that there should be architects under the control of the Minister who would be told to build hospitals according to the amount of money available, rather than depending on architects who will probably design hospitals costing £1,500,000 or £1,750,000.  I understand that architects are paid a percentage on the outlay on the hospitals.  As I say, there has not been a stone put upon a stone during all these years for the hospitals required in Cork.</P>
    <P>We worry about the effects rather than the causes of tuberculosis and other diseases of our people.  I remember seeing a quotation from a paper read by the chief medical officer of the Minister's Department, Dr. Deeney, in Dublin in 1940, in which he stated that the medical profession had been concerned with disease far too much and had neglected the social and economic causes of ill-health.  I am quite satisfied that much of the disease which we are trying to deal with now is due to housing conditions and the lack of nourishing food.  If we do not deal with the ground work of health by seeing that there is a sufficiency of nourishing food provided, we will be building hospitals without bringing about any improvement in the health of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main criticisms I have to make with regard to the administration of the Minister over the last 16 months is that he does <Col N="65" /> not appear to have done anything in a fundamental way with regard to what you might call the prevention of disease.  Deputy Hickey spoke about housing and nourishment, but they are not within the province of the Minister for Health.  I take it that the Minister for Local Government will be responsible for the housing.  What I am referring to is the building up of the health of the mother and the child. We brought in a Bill in 1947 which was put through the Oireachtas.  The central part of that Bill was the part which dealt with mother and child welfare. It was claimed by me at the time that it would take a few months to prepare the regulations under which the scheme could be operated for dealing with mother and child welfare, but I do not think any Minister could claim that the delay which has taken place since that is in any way justified. Everybody will admit that you cannot expect to have a healthy people unless you make sure, first of all, that you have healthy mothers.  The mother should be looked after in the pre-natal period and during confinement and the child should be looked after in infancy and all through the school period.  That Bill was brought in to enable local authorities to set up the machinery for the provision of clinics for mothers and also for the free treatment of infants and then for a more thorough and frequent examination of school children from the point of view of health, but nothing, so far as I know, has been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is hard to keep men like him quiet.  There is no justification for the long delay in taking the first step in connection with that&mdash;the issuing of model regulations to enable local authorities to draw up their own regulations with these model regulations <Col N="66" /> as a guide.  I do not think there would be any difficulty in getting local authorities to act under the Bill, as it was provided by a sub-section of a Bill introduced in January, 1948, that the central authority would pay all the increased expenses.  There was no disputing the fact that the Bill was necessary. When I brought it before the Dáil, no member of the Opposition or the Government Party at the time argued that it was unnecessary.  Any speeches that were made were to the effect that the scheme should be put into operation as soon as possible.  It was pointed out at that time that the school medical inspection was entirely inadequate.  As we all know, with the very small personnel looking after public health in the counties under the local authorities, the medical officer or his assistant would not have time to visit the schools and examine the children more than once, in the average county, in every two or three years. In fact, in some cases, it is longer than that.  It was pointed out also that in some of these inspections&mdash;in all of them, I suppose&mdash;there would be some children absent, so that some children would miss being examined for six or seven years.  Irreparable damage might be done in the meantime.  If a child develops an infection of the eyes or bad teeth, or tonsils or adenoids, damage may be done that it would be impossible to repair as time goes on. There may also be slight deformity which would develop and become established if the child was not seen in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other things discussed very fully at that time, such as immunisation against diphtheria.  I do not know what progress has been made in regard to that, but I think the figures had shown up to 1947 that immunisation had remarkably good results and if it could have been extended to the whole country so that every child would be immunised, we would probably reach the time when diphtheria would be practically unknown here.  These are facts known not only to medical men but to laymen, and the only reason I raise them is to say that I see very little justification for the delay in putting the mother and child welfare scheme into operation.  It is an important <Col N="67" /> question, as if the health of mothers and of children is looked after, our young people would be facing the world in a healthy condition and it would be easier to maintain the general level of health through the country from that on.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that we have a very good organisation to work on. I do not think that, in any country, there is such a good scheme as we have here in the dispensary doctor.  In the rural areas and small towns, the dispensary doctor knows his area very well, he knows practically everybody in the area and they know him.  As a general rule, they respect him and would be inclined to do anything he would ask them to do in regard to the preservation of health.  I do not know what the Minister intends to do, but if he does intend to follow roughly on the lines that I had believed in when I was there, of making the dispensary doctor responsible for both prevention and treatment of disease, it should not take a great deal of organisation to get it going.  It would undoubtedly require revision of areas, where a doctor has a big area which it takes him all his time to cover at present in his ordinary dispensary duties.  When the prevention of disease is thrown on to him as well, including the care of expectant mothers, looking after infants, school inspection, immunisation, and so on, he would not be able to do as big an area. It may be necessary to have the areas reconstructed so as to give the doctor an area he could look after, or it may be better in some cases to give him an assistant where he has a very big area, but even that would not take an awful lot of time.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in 1947, when I was in the Department of Health, a survey was taking place of some of the counties to see what changes would be necessary in the dispensary areas, in order to apply this system we had in mind of making the dispensary doctor responsible for prevention as well as treatment, renaming him the district medical officer.  I do not know whether that survey of the various counties has been completed, but it probably has been before now, so it would not take <Col N="68" /> so very long to put the scheme into operation.  We have all over a very good foundation to build upon.  There may be some dispensary doctors, as you find in every other class, who are not as good as we would like to have them, but the great majority would be capable of carrying on the new duties as well as the old, provided they got the necessary assistance.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been mentioned here by a number of speakers is dispensaries. Everyone is inclined to call them clinics, but what we call them does not matter a lot.  We should try to improve these buildings and have a comfortable room, which could be heated in the winter time, where patients can be examined and also some sheltered place for people to wait, which they have not got at the moment in many cases.  The local authorities should be helped at that stage in the provision of clinics.  They find it difficult to carry on, with the very heavy burden of rates, especially as they have been increased in the last year or two, and they will not be inclined to undertake any more expenditure if they can avoid it.  They should be encouraged with some financial help to provide these improved clinics.</P>
    <P>It also goes without saying that the doctor must get proper medical equipment and drugs, and equipment for minor surgical operations.  It was contemplated also in 1947&mdash;I do not know what the present Minister's view may be&mdash;that each district medical officer would have a nurse and a maternity nurse to help him in his duties.  Because of the increased duties, especially looking after the mothers and infants, a maternity nurse would be necessary; and for the school inspection, immunisation and so on, a general nurse would be necessary.</P>
    <P>When I met the doctors in 1947 we had a talk about these various schemes we had in mind and I hoped at that time that these new schemes would be coming into operation, say, early in 1948.  We discussed the position and it was agreed that the county managers of county boroughs would be authorised to give the doctors as increase in remuneration&mdash;which, I think, <Col N="69" /> worked out at about 40 per cent.  It was regarded by these men themselves, and also by me, as a temporary settlement until we would meet again to discuss the larger duties that they might have to take on.  It was understood, of course, that when these larger duties would be given to them their remuneration would have to be reconsidered with a view to increasing it.</P>

      <P>The central authority.  The local authorities were not to pay any more for all these things.  I do not know whether the medical officers at the time would have been perfectly content to carry on were it not that they expected that conversations would take place again, within 12 months at any rate, for a further review of their remuneration.  Time has gone on and I think it is up to the Minister to meet them and to discuss whatever new scheme he has in mind and also their remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to pay, which is usually the first point raised by men in the public service, they spoke of their conditions of employment.  They are on duty for 24 hours&mdash;not only theoretically but really on duty because, if they are not there when a call comes, they get into trouble.  It is true, of course, that they may be many a night at home sitting at the fire and going to bed and sleeping like anybody else without being disturbed but they are always liable to be disturbed and, if they are, they must go and attend the call.  Some of these men said it was unfair that they could not feel that they would get at least, let us say, an evening a week to go some place where they felt they were free to go and were not subject to any censure or penalty if it was found that they had been away from their home.  I must say that I agreed that there was a good deal in that point and I did promise at that stage that we should investigate the possibility at least of getting men to relieve one another for, let us say, two evenings a week and perhaps every second Sunday so that one was free to leave the area and go off to the nearest town or seaside or wherever he liked to go, <Col N="70" /> from, say, 3 in the evening until 9 the next morning or whatever hour might be decided upon.  That is a thing that certainly should be done and the question should be discussed again with these men whenever it is possible to take it up with them.</P>
    <P>It will be quite easy, of course, in the towns, even small towns, when the new scheme comes in because I take it that even in small towns there will be either two men with two separate districts or there will be one man with an assistant, so that time off or a few half-days off or every second Sunday off will be easy to arrange.  The more difficult problem will arise in the case of the medical officer of a rural district, but even there, if two men living side by side can arrange between them for one to take the responsibility for the other man's area for a couple of evenings a week, it should be possible to work out some scheme of that kind.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to mention is that, apart from the Bill, there was a White Paper issued by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947 and some of the matters which were dealt with in the Bill were discussed in the White Paper. The White Paper gave an outline of the policy which the Fianna Fáil Government intended to pursue.  One thing that was in that White Paper, to which I attach a great deal of importance, was the laying down of the limits of means inside which a person is entitled to free treatment.  I do not claim that everybody in this House would agree with the limits that were laid down.  There may be very serious difference of opinion about that but, unless we adopt State medicine altogether, where everybody gets free treatment&mdash;a thing, I must say, I do not approve of at all and, as far as I know, the Minister does not approve of it either&mdash;then we have to make some sort of regulation with regard to the people who are entitled to free treatment.  The present system is not good.  As far as I know, the definition at the moment under which a person can claim free treatment is that, if he says that he cannot keep himself and his wife and his family in comfort and at the same time pay for a doctor, then he is entitled to free treatment. <Col N="71" /> Any of us might claim that.  It is a very poor definition, in my opinion, and as a matter of fact, people who are not very well off are sometimes too proud to claim that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be much better, in my opinion, to lay down a definite limit of means and then the person is not asked to rely on his own conscience as to whether he is able to pay the doctor or not.  We did lay down the limit there in that White Paper that a person who was earning less than £5 a week or, in a rural area, a person with less than £25 valuation, was entitled to free treatment in every way&mdash; free treatment at the district clinic, free medicine, free institutional treatment and everything else and then there was a class between £5 a week and £10 a week in earnings and between £25 and £50 valuation who would be entitled to free institutional treatment.</P>
    <P>Within the last four or five years I knew of two distinct cases of comparatively small farmers, whose valuations were about £30, who found it impossible to get free treatment for an operation that was necessary, not an immediate operation, of course, but an operation that would have made a great difference to the health of the person concerned.  They knew that they were unable to pay the fee that was necessary and they just felt that they had to carry on under the circumstances. I quite admit, of course, that if these two men had gone to the county manager or the county medical officer of health or somebody like that, the thing could have been fixed up but they thought under existing conditions that they could not get free hospital and surgical treatment and they just went on without the operation.</P>
    <P>People should be put in a position to know exactly how they stand and if they know that, if they have certain means, they are entitled to free treatment they can go and get it.  That particular question should be decided. The Minister should come to some decision upon it and make it known as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I spoke here last year about the <Col N="72" /> hospital policy.  I do not want to go into it fully again but I would like to ask the Minister whether he has come to any decision or made up his mind what policy should be pursued.  I said that personally I was in favour of district hospitals.  My predecessor was not very much in favour of district hospitals.  He was more in favour of the bigger unit where I suppose his view was you could have more expert opinion and more expert surgeons, and so on, to look after the patient.  That is a very good view in itself but, on the other hand, people will get on all right in a district hospital in certain cases and they would much rather be in a district hospital.  In other words, they would rather be nearer home.  My experience is&mdash;I do not know whether other Deputies agree or not&mdash;that more and more women are going to institutions for confinement.  They find it difficult, I presume, to get help at home during that particular time and they are worried about the children in the house and so on and they have come to the conclusion and their people have come to the conclusion that they would be better in an institution and let the house look after itself somehow or other.  There were a good many new hospitals built, although one would imagine from listening to Deputies like Deputy Hickey that there were no hospitals built in this country for the last 20 years, and in these new hospitals that were built the experience has been that the maternity wing has been too small every time.</P>
    <P>In some of the county hospitals I visited as Minister for Health they were proposing certain changes which would give them more beds for maternity. They could be treated practically as well, I would say, in district hospitals, and the ladies themselves would rather be in the district hospital which would not be so far from their homes. I think, therefore, that the district hospital is useful first for maternity and, secondly, for minor accidents.  A young person, for instance, breaks his leg.  He may not have anybody that is capable of looking after him in his own home.  It may be a small home where it is not easy to give him sufficient space, a good bed, and so forth, to <Col N="73" /> himself.  Such cases would be all right in a district hospital.  It is the type of hospital that could be looked after by a well-qualified medical practitioner. I think we should go in more for the district hospitals.  That would relieve, to a great extent, the pressure on the county hospitals and the bigger hospitals, as we go up the scale.  In particular it would relieve the congestion taking place now in respect of maternity cases.  I should like to know if the Minister has made up his mind on this policy with regard to hospitalisation or not and, if he has, whether he is going to encourage or, if not encourage at least sanction as far as practicable, the building of district hospitals in various parts of the country where they are not to be found at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak on the subject of the county hospital because every county has one of some kind or another.  I think that, on the whole, they are very successful and that they are doing very good work.  It entails the employment of a general surgeon, a physician, and perhaps, in some of the bigger ones, someone to look after gynaecology as well.  But I think that the idea of giving a county hospital to every county has been put into effect. The only thing that remains is to build proper county hospitals in some counties. A number of counties have got very nice ones and a number of counties have not, yet.</P>
    <P>I do not know what progress has been made with regard to regional hospitals. When I toured the country in 1947 there was, for instance, a site in Limerick which had been purchased by the local authority for the construction of a regional hospital.  I think that they were anxious to push on with the work there as quickly as they could. We had also some consultations with the authorities in Galway with regard to the building of practically a whole new hospital and the and the reconstruction of some of the Central Hospital.  I do not know whether any progress has been made or whether any start was made on that scheme.  However, I take it that these regional hospitals will be provided.  Beyond that, of course, there are the specialities&mdash;thoracic <Col N="74" /> surgery, orthopaedic surgery, genito-urinary, cancer, and so forth.</P>
    <P>When we were visiting the various centres with regard to these hospitals &mdash;I think I mentioned this matter last year&mdash;I saw more than the foundations of a fever hospital laid in Cork.  The county manager was with us then and I said that I did not see why he could not go ahead with the work then.  That was started, I believe, early during the war.  All the development work was done underground; all the passages underground were ready to put in the sewerage, water, light and heating installations, and so forth. The foundation walls were built &mdash;some of them running up to a height of three or four feet. When the war came it appears that the work stopped.  In 1947 I said to the county manager that I could not see why he could not proceed at that stage. I do not know whether any progress has been made since then.  I must say, of course, that the incidence of fever is much less now than it was in 1938 or 1939.  There has been an improvement in the preventive measures that can be taken against fever and great improvements have been made in the treatment of fever so that it does not spread, and we have not, therefore, got so many cases for the fever hospitals. But surely, if the building was not necessary as a fever hospital, it could have been proceeded with and used as a very suitable hospital for some of the other purposes for which they are crying out for facilities in Cork.</P>

      <P>I will look after it, too, for a few minutes.  There is no reason why the Cork Fever Hospital could not, I think, probably be converted into a hospital which would be useful, perhaps, as a maternity hospital&mdash;I do not know.  The matter would require to be examined by experts to see if it could be done.  Perhaps it could be used even as a sanatorium.  However, it appears to be a great pity to leave so much work, which cost a great deal of money, at that stage without going ahead and doing something with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be useful. Talking of Cork, we also, in my time, purchased an estate&mdash;I forget the name &mdash;for a regional sanatorium.  I remember that the Minister, when he came into power, criticised me&mdash;as he did in many things, I must say&mdash;very severely because we had let it for grazing.  The Minister will learn sense; I hope he will though I do not know whether he will or not.  He has since then, I believe, authorised the letting <Col N="76" /> of the lands for grazing twice, once about six months ago and again a few days ago, so he should be a bit more careful about criticising his predecessor in matters of that kind because, when he comes in himself, he forgets his criticism and authorises the letting of the land for grazing himself.</P>
      <P>I presume that these regional hospitals are going to go ahead in Galway, Limerick and Cork.  There were suggestions about them last year, but I do not think there was anything further than suggestions.  The site was got in Limerick.  I think there was no doubt that a regional hospital, that is, a general hospital, should be provided in Cork and also in Galway.  I just want to know what progress had been made. Generally speaking, I think these hospitals, either regional, county or district, must be provided and I do not think we should stop for want of money or finance.  It is sometimes pointed out, for instance, that there is only so much in the Hospitals' Sweep Fund and that, therefore, we cannot go any further at the moment.  I think if there never had been a Hospitals' Sweep these hospitals would have to be provided.  The attitude we should adopt is that we are thankful to have money handed over to the State by the Hospitals' Sweep, but if the money does not come from that source, then it must come from the Exchequer&mdash;by way of loan, I take it.  As a matter of fact, it would not in that case be a loan.  The greater part would have to be by way of grant, because the local authorities could never finance a loan of anything like £500,000 or £1,000,000 for a county or regional hospital.  In any case, it should come; it could be borrowed money as far as the Government is concerned.  We should not, therefore, adopt the attitude that we must wait for the Hospitals' Sweep Fund to increase before we can proceed with the sanctioning of further buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned other buildings here last year.  Unfortunately, I had not the advantage the Minister has of having documents from which to speak, and I could only speak largely from memory, but to a great extent from statements I had made from time to time when I was Minister myself. <Col N="77" /> Looking back over these statements, I was able to check up say, on the number of beds provided in certain sanatoria and so on.</P>
    <P>I spoke here last year about Newcastle. At that time there was a rumour &mdash;but not more than a rumour&mdash;that they had taken a nurses' home.  During the time I was Minister for Health I got a report on more than one occasion that the sanatorium committee in Newcastle required more room for expansion to build a nurses' home and to enlarge the hospital.  There was a certain field. I do not know where the field is but I know it adjoins the hospital grounds and it was a large field of, as far as my recollection goes, perhaps ten or 11 acres and maybe more.  The committee thought that the farmer who owned this field was trying to mulct them by asking too high a price.  He was asking £1,600 I think and therefore they did not take it and nothing was done about it.  It was at least very convenient to the hospital and it would have been convenient to take it and have a nurses' home beside the hospital. Last year there was a rumour that the hospital committee had taken a farm something like a mile and a half away and that turned out to be true.  The Minister had, of course, to sanction the grant for the purpose of that farm from the Hospitals' Trust Fund and I do not know that he was justified in sanctioning the purchase of this particular farm because it is entirely inconvenient, a mile and a half away and, as far as one can find out, it cost as much per acre, practically, as the field adjoining.  We do know, of course, that this farm was owned by a defeated Clann na Poblachta candidate and whether that had some influence on the Minister or not we can only judge for ourselves.  I was told &mdash;I do not know whether it is true or not&mdash;that the nursing council had objected to this as a centre for nursing as it was too far away and they would not be inclined to regard it as a suitable place for the training of nurses. I do not know whether that is true or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy from Cork can give an explanation of those two instances.  He says he is going to reply.  Has he noted them before I go on to something else?</P>
      <P>We go on to county homes.  County homes were commented upon very adversely by the Minister during one of his tours around the country shortly after he took over.  He spoke of very antiquated methods.  In fact, he said no change had been made in these county homes since they were first built and, as far as I know, no change has been made since. The difficulty in dealing with these various people in county homes was the number of classes that there were. I think they could be divided roughly into three classes: that is the mental defectives or imbeciles, unmarried mothers, and old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think anybody who is going to tackle this question of improving the system of county homes will have to deal with each of these three classes separately.  There is very little provision in this country for the mental defectives.  I think so far as I remember it is estimated that there would <Col N="80" /> be about 6,000 of these imbeciles in this country, and, except in a few special homes with accommodation for about 500 and certainly less than 1,000, there is no accommodation for them. That leaves us with a very big problem.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with these imbeciles properly, apart from the mere epileptics, they must be divided into at least three groups.  You have those who are not very bad and who, with education, might be trained to make a living for themselves.  Then there is the middle class&mdash;those who are worse than the first class but who when trained could look after and care for themselves even though perhaps they might not be able to earn a living for themselves.  The third class of mental defectives who are particularly hopeless would have to be cared for.  With all these difficulties you would have the further question of the various ages and of course the different sexes.  Anybody can therefore see you would require a very large number of units to look after these mental defectives because they must be segregated firstly according to sex and again as to age and to the degree of their trouble and mental capacity.  It does not mean, however, that you must have separate institutions for all these classes but you must have separate units for the various sections.</P>
    <P>We were, for a short time while I was in the Department of Health, discussing and had made some progress at least in enlarging one of the small institutions for these mental defectives and we were discussing the possibility of having some special institutions set up to take on the case of these people. Whether that will take some considerable time to effect I am not sure, but I take it that whatever Minister for Health is in office he will aim at that and get it done as soon as it can be done.</P>
    <P>The second class we have to consider are the unmarried mothers.  There are some institutions in the country, at least three or four, where these girls are taken in by religious orders and looked after and where they remain for perhaps 12 months or so after the birth of their babies.  They then go out to <Col N="81" /> work and the baby is kept in the house and trained or is boarded out, sometimes when the mother leaves.  In this case it would again require more accommodation, though it is not as big a question as that of the mental defectives. You would, however, require more homes of that kind for housing the unmarried mothers, who at the present time have to go into the local county homes or the local authority homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>Is it reasonable to keep them for 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  I was talking to some of the Sisters who are concerned in these matters and have experience of them in this and other countries.  Some of them are of the opinion that these unmarried mothers should be kept for 12 months, but others think that three months are sufficient.  They all have their own views on these things and it is hard to dispute the point with them. Whether it is three or 12 months, more accommodation would be necessary if these people were to be properly looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old people would be dealt with in a variety of ways.  When I was in the Department of Health for a short time many people suggested to me various ways of dealing with them.  I think myself the best suggestion is that they should be taken back by their own people and their own people should be encouraged to take them back by giving them more than the allowance which they can get at the moment.  At the present time, if an old person is in a house and the people claim home assistance they only get a matter of 5/- or 6/- a week. In these circumstances they cannot afford to give their time to look after the old people who then drift into the county homes.  If that amount was enlarged so that a person could afford to keep the old people the latter would then be probably very much happier and the local authority would not have to pay so much in the maintenance of these old people, the cost of which is very heavy on an institution to-day.  That should, I believe, be the first approach to this question <Col N="82" /> of what is best to do with the old people now in our county homes.</P>
    <P>There was a further suggestion that these people should be housed in a colony of cottages built in an area, similar to the labourers' cottages but of the bungalow type and that two, three or four of them should live together and that there should be a common hall or room where all the inhabitants of the colony would have their principal meal and could congregate for reading.  I do not know whether that would be an acceptable scheme or not but it would provide these old people with a much more congenial atmosphere than they enjoy at the moment in the county homes.  The other alternative is to try and split them up and put them in smaller numbers into large houses or cottages and make the whole thing a little bit more homely than the conditions in the county homes at present where you have large numbers together with very little interests.</P>
    <P>We had also some discussion last year on the beds provided for tubercular patients.  I then gave some figures which, as I have mentioned already, were to some extent from memory and to some extent taken from answers to questions and mentioned in speeches in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I was able to ask about the proposals with regard to certain of the institutions which were expected to provide extra beds for tubercular patients.  From some of these sources I found that in 1947 the local authority sanatoria had 1,529 beds, the local authority and voluntary hospitals, 500 beds, and the private committee sanatoria, 1,115 beds. There had been a fair increase in the number of beds for seven or eight years, up to 1947, and, in fact, in the case of the local authority sanatoria, there was a 45 per cent. increase.  I have not got the information with regard to the others.  There was, at any rate, a substantial increase and, at that stage, we had discussions with various of the sanatoria authorities, local authorities and so on as to the possibility of providing more beds.  I mentioned already that there were three large houses or <Col N="83" /> buildings in which I was interested&mdash; the High School in Sligo, Ardkeen House, Waterford, and Kilereene House, Kilkenny.  I asked last year on this Estimate whether any progress had been made with regard to the conversion of these buildings into sanatoria and what progress had been made since the Minister took office in February, 1948, and I should like now to hear from the Minister what the position is with regard to them.</P>
    <P>I think it was in 1946 that the then Minister for Local Government provided a grant of £100 for an extra room for a person suffering from tuberculosis, where it was advisable that that person should be isolated, so as to give him a clean and airy room to himself.  This grant was provided to build the extra room or a chalet for the purpose.  I do not know how that scheme has progressed in the past 18 months.  It was estimated at the time the scheme was inaugurated that about £280,000 would be spent under this heading and in the following year the Department earmarked £55,000 for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many were provided or how many people availed of that scheme and whether they have availed of it in the past year or so to any extent.  I asked last year also whether any progress had been made in the provision of X-ray facilities to enable people to be X-rayed easily and cheaply or free, because it would be possible in that way to detect the early incidence of tuberculosis.  In Dublin, a mass radiography centre was provided by the corporation some few years ago and it has done very good work indeed, but I should like to know if it has been extended to centres outside Dublin, and, if not, if it is intended in the very near future to extend the system to the other big centres.</P>
    <P>One thing I am personally fairly sure of is that contacts are not being dealt with as effectively as they should be. I have seen cases of people being taken to the sanatorium and there did not appear to be anything particular done with regard to other people in the house.  That is very wrong because we know that tuberculosis is very infectious <Col N="84" /> and it is wrong not to take every possible precaution, where there is a tubercular case in a house, to see that all contacts, especially those living and sleeping in the same house, are examined at intervals by radiography to see if they are developing tuberculosis in the early stages.  If we can get them in the early stages, the chances are that they can be cured.  I do not think this matter of contacts is being tackled as vigorously as it should be, even in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I find also from looking up some of the records that, in 1947 when I was Minister, I authorised an increased grant to the Medical Research Council for special research into the chemotherapy of tuberculosis.  That grant was brought up to £6,000 and I have no doubt the Medical Research Council spent that money to the very best advantage.  I should like to know whether there is any report with regard to any research carried out and what the result is.  There was also a scheme for B.C.G. vaccination against tuberculosis organised by the Dublin Corporation and a grant was given for the purpose.  I think I saw a reference in the papers recently to some progress being made in St. Ultan's in connection with it and I should like to know something more&mdash;it is perhaps too soon to expect a result&mdash;about whether the work is proceeding satisfactorily and when we may expect a result.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department we had inaugurated a scheme of sending some of the medical officers of health or their assistants&mdash;those dealing with tuberculosis&mdash;to foreign countries to study tuberculosis.  Some were sent to Scandinavia, and it had been arranged at the time that some would go to the United States and to Canada.  I should like to know what progress has been made under that scheme of sending our men to those foreign countries to see how things are being done there. When they come back they will have the opportunity of discussing their experiences with those who have been in other countries and in that way we could eventually evolve here the best scheme on the basis of what is being done in these various countries. There was also a committee on occupational therapy for tuberculosis, <Col N="85" /> which I have not heard of for some time.</P>
    <P>A Bill was passed late in 1947, and regulations were issued under it, dealing with the costs, and so on, of all these various public health schemes. The big provision in that Bill was that which put all the additional expenditure on the central authority.  It provided that the local authorities would not be required to spend more on health than they were spending at the moment until the central authority was contributing an equal amount.  It was estimated at the time that about seven years would elapse before that point was reached.  As soon as the central authority was contributing as much as the local authority was spending, then it would be possible to let them march <i>pari passu</i> or, if you like, to reconsider the whole matter.  That was the big idea of that Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another thing in it which is usually referred to as the maintenance allowance for those suffering from infectious diseases.  That is a scheme that had been advocated for some time. We were very anxious to bring it into operation as soon as we could.  It is a type of scheme which it would be necessary to examine from time to time&mdash;to revise and to review its operation&mdash;because, I believe, it has been found from experience that it is not working satisfactorily in some individual instances, though generally speaking, I think it is working very satisfactorily. It is a great thing to have it for those who are suffering from tuberculosis.  There are individual cases where it is not working as well as one would expect and, as I say, it would be necessary to review and to revise it in cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>Now, I spoke about the hospitals.  I want, if possible, to get more up-to-date information with regard to the beds that were being provided in these various sanatoria, and in these local authority and general hospitals.  I think I mentioned last year that, when I was responsible for the Department, we had discussions with the authorities of St. Laurence's Hospital on more than one occasion.  My recollection is that our final agreement with that hospital was <Col N="86" /> that they would give us 60 beds for tuberculosis, and also a thoracic unit. I do not think it would have taken them very long to provide the beds, though it might have taken them longer to provide the thoracic unit.  I would like very much to know how these two proposals have proceeded, whether the beds are now available and whether the thoracic unit is now available, or when they may be expected.</P>
    <P>With regard to Peamount and Newcastle, I mentioned last year that Peamount was to provide three of these 40 bed units, and that Newcastle was to provide two 40 bed units.  I pass Newcastle very often on my way down to the County Wexford, and, as far as I can see, they are not yet ready, so that they are a good while in process of construction.  But they have not been completed.  Now I am sure that if I had said to the Minister in February 1948 that I intended to provide two of these 40 bed units in Newcastle and did not, and had to admit that I would not have them ready for 18 months, he would have been appalled at the delay and probably would make the charge, that he made before, that we were criminally neglectful of these people and were responsible for their deaths by not making quicker provision for them.</P>

With regard to Castlerea, the Minister is probably including Castlerea in the 1,200 beds that he speaks of.

As I say, if the Minister had troubled to ask the secretary to the Department I am sure he would have told him that he had talked to me about the possibility of getting Castlerea.  He then came to me and said that there was some difficulty about the mental hospital attendants in Castlerea.  The question arose as to what could be done with them if it was taken over.  Deputies, of course, will understand that Castlerea is a branch of Ballinasloe Mental Hospital.  I suggested to the secretary, if that difficulty arose, why not take over a wing of Ballinasloe, in which case there could be no difficulty with regard to the mental hospital attendants in either place.  He came back to me a few days later and said that the difficulty was over and that we could take Castlerea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his speeches&mdash;with all the various things he is doing&mdash;finds it convenient to say that certain things were done, let us say, 12 months ago. It amuses him to say things like that. However, we will let him have his little amusement in claiming these things, if he likes it that way.  One matter that has arisen in the Minister's time relates to mixed nursing.  What I mean by that is whether it is advisable to have religious orders and lay nurses in the same hospital.  There are various objections to it and they have been stated over and over again.  The lay nurses complain that they have not the same opportunity for promotion and they claim that they are made do more than their share of night nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> I do not think the thing was altogether satisfactory when I was in the Department of Health.  I did authorise an official of the Department, when we were discussing the building of the regional sanatorium in Cork, to ask a religious order if they would take over the nursing of the sanatorium. It was a very big job and it would mean the employment of 400 nurses.  They felt they could not undertake it.  I thought it would be better to have all religious or all lay.  I knew they did not mix very well and you did not get satisfaction.  I believe that the sisters are very good nurses, in fact, some of the religious orders here are tip-top nurses and I would not stand for any of my friends&mdash;I do not know whether the person I refer to is a friend of the Minister or not&mdash;criticising the sisters at a local authority meeting that they had not carried out their duties as efficiently as they should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you mean to say that the lay nurses are inefficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both quite efficient, but sometimes they do not get on well together.  It was stated at a local authority meeting that the religious orders had not done their duties as they should.  I do not agree with that.  I think they make very good nurses.  In the case where this controversy arose the Minister was good enough to say that I also favoured that system of either religious or lay and that he was not averse to taking company with me in a case where there might be a little bit of difficulty or unpopularity. It is quite easy to make your attitude clear in finding fault with the religious orders as good nurses, but it leads to dissatisfaction in many cases when you have both in the same institution. That does not mean that the lay or the religious nurses are inefficient; they may both be very good, but together they do not work as they should.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  My criticism of the Minister is that he is not doing the solid work of preventing disease and building up a healthy population as he <Col N="91" /> should do it.  I think he should have gone to greater pains and given more time to pushing forward the mother and child welfare scheme.  For the short time that I was in the Department of Health I felt that whatever else we might do we should as quickly as possible build on a solid foundation in our efforts to secure a healthy population. I do not think it would prevent the ordinary work of the Department going ahead if we were to attend also to that aspect.  The regulations necessary to deal with the mother and child welfare scheme could have been prepared and submitted to the local authorities, who could then amend and adopt them and proceed with the necessary clinics and medical staff and nurses.</P>
      <P>Last year the Minister made the plea that he wanted to deal urgently with tuberculosis and other matters.  There is no reason why he should not do so, while at the same time getting the mother and child welfare scheme going. He could also deal with immunisation and free treatment for certain classes. In that way we would be building on a foundation that would give good results over many years.  I admit it is the kind of work that perhaps has not the same publicity value as the Minister might get out of opening tuberculosis wards.</P>
      <P>Even if a great deal of work is put into the building up of this mother and child welfare scheme the ordinary person knows practically nothing about what is being done.  Nevertheless, it is something which should be done.  When the Bill was introduced in 1947 that was really the pivotal point of the Bill. The idea was to build on a solid foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other points in that particular Act&mdash;they may not be so important&mdash;upon which I would like to know what the Minister's intentions are. One part of that particular Act dealt with infectious diseases.  There was a good deal of controversy about the removal of a person suffering from an infectious disease, even when such removal might entail a certain amount of force.  There was also a certain amount of controversy with regard to <Col N="92" /> the medical examination of school children.  Some of the present Ministers, who were in opposition at that time, took very grave exception to those particular provisions in that Act. One threatened, as a matter of fact, that if he ever became a member of a Government he would immediately have those provisions repealed.  In the meantime, he threatened to bring an action in the Supreme Court to contest their constitutionality.  I would like to know what the Minister's intentions are with regard to these particular clauses.  Does he intend to remove them from the Act and, if so, when does he intend to deal with them?</P>

      <P>Whatever enthusiasm I had for speaking in this Estimate has been considerably damped, not because there was not a great deal of information in what Deputy Dr. Ryan has said, but because in this hot weather even a speech lasting an hour and a half becomes somewhat boring.  I agree with what Deputy Dr. Ryan said, to some extent, with regard to the fundamental concept of the provisions in this Health Estimate.  While all of us must pay tribute to the Minister for the energetic way in which he has dealt with the provision of beds for tuberculosis sufferers, I think more comes within the scope of the Department of Health than just tuberculosis.  For a considerable period now the tendency has been to devote attention almost entirely or mainly to tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>There is a very important problem which affects every person of moderate means.  I refer to the provision of medical facilities.  I would like to see an effort made to provide free medical facilities for persons who are unable to pay for treatment.  A man of moderate means with a wife and family is unable to meet very high medical charges that a serious illness to himself or to a member of his family may entail.  In the coming year I would like to see the Minister devote his attention, now that he has made such substantial progress in regard to the provision of beds for tuberculosis patients, to dealing with that particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> In addition to tuberculosis there is a very serious problem with regard to cancer.  That, as we all know, is a very dangerous disease.  I understand that it is every bit as serious as tuberculosis in its effects.  A committee was set up by the Minister to investigate the problem of cancer.  I am sure that committee has been working but I do not know what it has actually done.  I do not know whether it has submitted any report.  Perhaps when the Minister is concluding he would inform us on the points I have raised.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare I tried to raise the case of people who are suffering from some form of paralysis which prevents them from earning a livelihood.  I was in some doubt at the time as to whether it was a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare or for the Minister for Health.  I am not altogether sure which Department should deal with it. Since the sufferers of this disease are incurable, probably it is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare; but I would appeal to the Minister for Health to discuss with his colleague in Social Welfare the problem with which these unfortunate people are faced.  Some of them are in their 40's and 50's; some of them are in their 30's and some of them are in their early 20's.  All of them are unable to earn a livelihood and they are dependent upon their parents or upon relatives.  I would like to see something practical done for the people affected by this disease.</P>
    <P>I was very glad this afternoon to hear the plea made by Deputy Mrs. Rice in regard to nurses.  Everyone must agree that the conditions under which our nurses are working at the moment and have been compelled to work for a long number of years are brutal.  In this enlightened age such conditions ought not to obtain.  I think the Minister has a sympathetic interest in the problem.  I know he is aware that it exists and I know that he is anxious to deal with it.  If we are to have nurses the conditions of apprenticeship and the conditions under which they work when qualified must be radically changed.  It is regrettable to see some of our finest young girls leaving the country to be trained in <Col N="94" /> British hospitals, because they think they get a better training there and because they know they will serve under better conditions there when they ultimately qualify.</P>
    <P>With regard to food hygiene, I would urge upon the Minister that he should examine the problem of meat killed outside the city and brought into the city for consumption.  I understand this matter is dealt with by the Department of Agriculture in the public abattoirs in the city.  I know that outside the city there is no regular inspection and there is a danger for those who consume meat killed under unsatisfactory conditions outside the city.</P>

    <Title>Land Reclamation Bill, 1949&mdash;Report (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1. In page 3, to add at the end of Section 2 the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>( )  The works referred to in sub-section (4) shall not be deemed to have been completed if the occupier within one month from the date upon which the Minister notifies him that the works have been completed appeals to the District Court and proves to the satisfaction of the district justice that the works have not been satisfactorily carried out in accordance with the Minister's proposals under sub-section (2).&mdash; (Deputy Smith.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the arguments advanced against this amendment by the Minister, when we were last discussing this Bill, was that in the event of a situation arising such as I describe, a Deputy of this House would be available to the person who was dissatisfied with the work done on his holding.  I do not think that anybody could seriously regard that as a legitimate argument against this amendment.  Most of us know very well what will happen should a farmer apply under this measure to have three, four, five, six or any number of <Col N="95" /> acres on his holding reclaimed.  The procedure will be that the application will reach the Department of Agriculture; the Department will forward it to the local inspector; the local inspector will prepare an estimate in consultation with the farmer; the farmer will express a desire that the work, because of his inability to undertake it himself, should be carried out by the Department; the Department will, when it finds it possible, carry out the work and when the work is completed the officer to the Department will certify that the work has been completed and all is at an end except that, as the Minister has stated, the owner or the occupier of the land, as the case may be, can go to the local Deputy and the Deputy can raise the matter here in the House.</P>
      <P>Of course, we know the procedure that will follow his raising that matter. The Minister will call for a report from the officer immediately concerned with the matter.  A Parliamentary question will appear and, after obtaining a report from the local officer, the Minister will come in here armed to the teeth with all the official reasons to show that the work has been satisfactorily done.  An opportunity may then be provided between 10 and 10.30 to have the matter thrashed out, giving ten or 15 minutes to the Deputy who raised it and the remainder of the time to the Minister.  We shall hear the case from the farmer's side, as stated by the Deputy, and from the official's side as stated by the Minister.  There is no kind of examination of the complaint in that procedure that would satisfy an aggrieved person.</P>
      <P>There is this possibility, too.  We all know that works, whether carried out by local bodies or by a Department of State, are undertaken under a system &mdash;we may call it direct labour or whatever term you like to give it&mdash;under which much dissatisfaction can result because of the amount of work done with the money expended or because of the manner in which the work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is no limit fixed in this Bill nor is there any limit in the scheme announced, on the amount that <Col N="96" /> may be expended on the reclamation of an acre of land.  But I take it that in the Department, and in the Minister's mind, there must be some rough idea of the amount that would be expended on the reclamation of an acre &mdash;say £20, £25 or £30.  It is reasonable to assume that there is in the minds of the officials some particular sum to which they will adhere as near as possible. I think there should be, and, because of that, I say that if an estimate is prepared, and if the work is undertaken in the manner I have described and if as a result, perhaps, of bad supervision or poor output on the part of those employed, the amount expended is close to the amount that is regarded as the maximum that should be expended on reclamation of one acre, then the official immediately in charge would naturally proceed to cover up.  Not only that, but the official who will be reporting on the work executed will naturally cover up, as I think is the case in most of these matters, the man who was immediately in charge of the work.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that I think it is unreasonable that in this matter the Department should have the responsibility for the preparation of the estimate, the responsibility at the request of the occupier of the land for the execution of the work, and the responsibility for deciding that the work is completed according to the estimate. The only redress the applicant appears to have is that he can go to the Circuit Court if he thinks his grievance is sufficient to warrant that course or he can come to the House here.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of the discussion, said that any man who would have six or seven acres of land to be reclaimed, could be regarded as a man of considerable substance, in so far as the six or seven acres might represent only a small proporation of the land held by him.  But if we take the man who has a small holding, who has only one or two acres to be reclaimed, if the work is unsatisfactorily carried out, it is not fair, I suggest, to compel him to go to the Circuit Court because the amount involved will be far less than the cost of taking such a step.  Therefore, I am proposing <Col N="97" /> this amendment because I believe that owing to the peculiar circumstances I have described, an individual, if he is dissatisfied, should have recourse to some simple machinery or some simple authority which would be created. There should be some inexpensive means by which a person could go before that authority and produce technical evidence.  Make him responsible for the production of that evidence and, in the event of his failing to sustain his case, he will have to meet whatever costs are incurred.  I am, as I say, pressing this amendment because the arguments that have been advanced against it and the reasons given by the Minister for its rejection do not appear to be convincing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reassure Deputy Smith that I entirely share his firm resolve that, no matter how excellent the intention may be of any Minister for the time being, access to the courts should not be denied by any Act of this Oireachtas to the humblest citizen in the State who feels that he wants the court to determine his rights as opposed to those claimed by the State.  I agree with Deputy Smith that, no matter how small the departure may be from that fundamental principle, it should not be made.  If I believed for a moment that the Bill, as amended in Committee, operated to prevent access to the court, I would feel it my duty to offer the House an amendment at this stage which would restore the citizen's right to that access.  But there is no question of the right of any citizen in this State, who believes that the Minister for Agriculture is acting unjustly under the powers of this Bill, to go to court and ask the court to restrain the Minister and get the court to insist on justice being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Solicitous as we may be for that principle, rightly solicitous as we are, we should not allow devotion to it to create a situation in which urgent and essential public work is to be held up indefinitely by frivolous litigation.  If this House were to provide that a farmer who got the kind of work envisaged by Deputy Smith done upon his land had a right to go before a district justice and ask the district <Col N="98" /> justice to delcare that, although work had been done, 100 per cent. of the work undertaken had not been done, I put it to Deputy Smith: what farmer in Ireland would forbear to go before the District Court?  He could not lose because there would be no expense. Who could speak better than himself about his own land before the district justice in the relatively familiar atmosphere of the District Court?  All he has to do is to appear before the district justice and ask that he should arbitrate in this matter between him and the Department of Agriculture and then proceed to describe precisely what happened.  If the district justice said: &ldquo;Well, now, you are treated fairly on the whole and I see no reason to intervene,&rdquo; that would end the proceedings and he would have done himself no harm.  But there is always the chance that the district justice would be in a paternal mood and say: &ldquo;I think a fair settlement of this would be to say that 80 per cent. of the agreed charge would be levied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Picture what is going to happen if every scheme that is undertaken is to become the subject of proceedings in the local District Court.  With the second half of the reclamation project not in force, we are already handling between 4,000 and 5,000 cases in eight counties.  Consider the situation with both parts of the scheme in operation in 26 counties every one of which can be the subject of reference by the farmer to the District Court for arbitration. I would require a larger staff for attending the District Court than I would for carrying out the project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith has envisaged, not the case of a sophisticated landowner who is probably well able to look after himself, but of the small man who has only a couple of acres to do and who may not be as capable of defending his interests as the more experienced property owner.  To begin with, I think the majority of small owners employing no labour other than their sons or members of their families will ordinarily choose to do the work themselves and take a grant.  In that case, the work will be done by themselves and they will have no business to repair to the court.  If a man petitions the Department to do it, it is not a <Col N="99" /> question of the Department's presenting him with some mysterious schedule which he may understand or not.  The procedure is that an officer of my Department walks the land with the farmer and that no work is undertaken which the farmer has not approved.  It is only when they are agreed upon what is to be done that the map is prepared. The farmer is not asked to commit to memory what he understood the Department's representatives to say. Before a sod is turned or a 1d. committed on either side, the farmer is presented with a precise map of his holding with every drain, every hollow to be filled, every fence to be moved, every single item of work indicated clearly on the map.  He is told what his liabilities would be if that programme of work were done.  It is only on his indicating his acceptance of that that the Department of Agriculture is authorised to proceed.  When the work is done to the satisfaction of the Minister for Agriculture, a certificate would ordinarily issue, by the man charged with the particular district in which the work is done.</P>
    <P>Suppose the farmer says: &ldquo;I do not think the work was done at all&rdquo;, the first duty of the man will be to come to the officer of my Department who will be in charge of what will correspond roughly to a diocese, and it will be his duty to go and survey the thing, to look at the map that was prepared of the work to be done, go over the work and see if the drains are functioning, if the fences are properly constructed and if everything is done as he believes it should have been done.  Suppose he says: &ldquo;I think that the work is all right and that you ought to pay.&rdquo;  The farmer still has a right to say: &ldquo;I do not think so and I think your boss ought to come and have a look at it.&rdquo; There will be a responsible officer of my Department in charge of a province &mdash;one-quarter of the country&mdash;and he must then go and inspect the work.</P>
    <P>If these three officers of my Department, by their agreement, fail to convince the farmer, the duty of the provincial director would be to refer him to the assistant director of the Department; and the assistant director and the director himself will have to <Col N="100" /> satisfy themselves that that work was carried out with propriety.  If the farmer is still unsatisfied, although he has now on his land five senior officers of my Department, he can appeal to the Minister.  I quite agree with Deputy Smith that, in the vast majority of cases of that kind, the Minister would be well advised to look to the responsible officers of his Department for guidance and must be expected, in the vast majority of cases, to accept their view.  But if anyone should imagine that, in accepting their view, the Minister has perhaps had withheld from him the other side of the story, the aggrieved farmer can ask any Deputy of this House to tell his story in public in this House and challenge the Minister to tell his side of the story and justify his insistence on making the charge.</P>
    <P>Now, the farmer has the whole of Oireachtas Éireann to appeal to, but that is not all.  Should all those devices leave him under a sense of grievance, he can instruct his solicitor to go to the Circuit Court, to restrain the Minister from making the charge which it is proposed to make upon his property, on the grounds that the consideration in respect of which it is lawful to make such a charge has never been performed.  From the local man who brought the plan to the farmer, up to the Minister for Agriculture, the reputation of every single one of those persons depends on the measure of success which attends their efforts to satisfy the individuals they purport to serve.  What political head of a Department of State, in any democratic country in the world, desires to be known as a Minister who always dissatisfies, who always fails to please, who makes a hames of everything he puts his hand to?  Is it not the duty of a Minister to do all that requires to be done within the law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The case being made here is that no right of appeal is provided under this Bill, as it left the Committee Stage, to safeguard the legitimate interest of the farmers.  The case I make in reply is that in the Departmental sphere there is an ample right, in the political sphere there is an ample right, and that, in reserve, in the legal sphere there is an ample right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last consideration I wish to put before the Deputy is this.  He felt there must be some limit beyond which the Department would not feel itself justified in going in its effort to reclaim a given acre of land.  I want the House to know most explicitly what my view is upon that.  The responsibility devolves on me to determine whether the land to be reclaimed is arable or potentially arable.  If it is neither of these things, I should not seek to work on it for reclamation purposes at all; but if it is either arable or potentially arable and I undertake to restore its fertility, I interpret my duty as meaning that, while exercising all due economy and care to spare the public purse, I cannot leave that acre until I can say that what was potentially arable is now arable.  If, in the course <Col N="102" /> of effecting that purpose, I come across unforeseen obstacles which in isolated cases may involve me in quite exceptional expense, I understand that the view of the House would be that I should proceed, exercising all prudence and proper economy, but resolutely, to the realisation of what I have undertaken to do, that is, to make arable that which was not arable when I went upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Side by side with that picture or that practice, would the Minister not have lurking somewhere in his mind a figure beyond which he would not like to go unless the circumstances were very exceptional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be present to my mind always and that figure would be the lowest possible figure at which the work could be done efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>But would the Minister ever actually mention a figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Once I have decided that an acre of land is potentially arable and once I have undertaken, under such an agreement as we are now considering, to make it arable, I conceive my duty to be to go upon it and as economically as possible to achieve that end; but if in the course of work, it emerges that the expense is going to be exceptional in respect of that individual acre, I must not falter or turn back.  I must go on to the completion of my task, so long as I remain clear that the land can be made arable. If I were so mad as to undertake to make arable the top of a mountain 3,000 feet high, the sooner I made up my mind that that never was potentially arable and should never have been entered upon, the better; but, if I know that a certain acre of land can be made arable and that the limit beyond which I may not charge the land is £12 an acre, still I must lay out whatever may be reasonable to achieve the undertaking to make that acre arable.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is to be judge of what is arable or potentially arable and if at no time is he likely to mention a figure&mdash;not a binding figure that will serve as a guide&mdash;as a result of his failure to mention that figure, is the Minister placing himself in the position of relieving the officials who will not be in a position to know when they should cross this land or that land?  Would not it simplify the Minister's responsibility and add to the rate of progress if a figure were mentioned beyond which, without Ministerial approval, officials could not go?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy at all.  If I felt that the officers of the Department responsible for the prosecution of this project were men who might not be trusted to approach the task in the spirit which I would expect to activate the Deputy and myself, that is to do the greatest work for the least money that could be expended, I would second them to other work.  I am convinced that those responsible for the prosecution of these works are not only desirous of achieving the object mentioned by the Deputy but are eminently capable to have this responsibility.  I could imagine nothing more destructive of expedition in this work than to appoint officers to do it and to start distrusting them from the first day of their operation.  They know our purpose.  They know the purpose of the Oireachtas and the officers charged with the responsibility have a very good idea of what the average cost per acre is likely to be.  But, I want them to know and I want this House to know that I want them to know that once, after due deliberation, it has been determined that the land is potentially arable, albeit that only £12 can be charged upon it, they shall proceed until we have done what we undertook to do when we went in upon it.  Therefore, because I believe that every essential right is most amply protected by the Bill as it at present is, I regret I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>I think the case just made by the Minister against this amendment was a weak one.  His arguments were not such as to convince anyone that the amendment was not necessary. The principle in this section is to charge a man's land in future with an almost permanent annuity.  Sixty years, probably, is the average life of the ordinary person who will occupy the land.  He would need to occupy it at a very young age to live on it for 60 years.  The principle is an important one and the farmer should have every possible safeguard that the particular acre of land has been fully drained or fully developed before that land is charged.</P>
      <P>I suggested on a previous stage of this Bill that the Minister should consider the question of having an arbitrator or referee.  I had in mind the Live Stock Breeding Act where you have referees that determine problems that arise and who have over the last 20 years given great satisfaction. I consider that Deputy Smith's amendment is a very reasonable and reasoned amendment that could have been accepted without injuring the Bill in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, a few moments ago, gave the House some rather startling information.  I do not know whether we can discuss the statement made by the Minister now or have to wait for a later stage.  The Minister has given startling information as to what may happen under this Bill.  It is startling that the Minister is going to advise his officers to proceed to rehabilitate any particular acre of land irrespective of what it may cost the State or the taxpayers. If the Minister enters on an acre of land to drain it or rehabilitate it, it does not matter if the original estimate of his officers must be exceeded.  There is no limit.  The Minister has just told us that there is no limit whatever to the extent that he may go.  Before the Bill finally passes <Col N="105" /> through this House, I hope the Minister will take occasion to correct that statement.  It is a dangerous doctrine and a very dangerous statement for a Minister of State to make. It is a serious thing.</P>

Nobody objects to the principle of draining land and improving it but I am sure that the officers of the Land Commission and the Land Commissioners will tell the Minister what they are prepared to pay per acre for arable land in any district in Ireland.  I would suggest that the Minister should not spend an unlimited amount of money in draining potentially arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this amendment I would say that it is one that could reasonably be accepted. <Col N="106" /> It gives the smaller farmer, as Deputy Smith has pointed out, an opportunity, if he has a grievance, of having that grievance resolved without much cost to himself.  It is true, as the Minister has said, that he can go into the Circuit Court and apply for an order to restrain the Minister, but that procedure would cost a substantial amount of money.  I am sure that such a farmer would need a junior counsel and a senior counsel.  He would want, too, engineers and expert advice and expert evidence before he could come into the Circuit Court.  If the Circuit Court gives him that order to restrain the Minister it must come up for hearing again, I understand, at a later date&mdash;so the District Court and the district justice act as an arbitrator or as a semi-arbitrator.  After having heard evidence on both sides, a district justice would be acting as arbitrator to a certain extent.  It is a reasonable suggestion and one which, I hope, the Minister will see his way to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about essential public work.  I wonder, where work is done on a private owner's land, to what extent would the public interest be affected.  Under this section the Minister is the judge, jury, executioner and everything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No person outside the officers of his Department has any right to determine any matter arising under this section.  The proposal of Deputy Smith brings in the District Court.  It enables a person who has a grievance, and who believes that the work undertaken by the Minister is not complete, to get another opinion on the matter. That is all Deputy Smith asks.  It is a reasonable amendment and it is one that we ask the Minister to consider accepting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Allen, I am not in the least bit scared lest the Minister, in his zeal to reclaim land, should drain the Exchequer completely. I do not think that that is likely to <Col N="107" /> happen.  I think the officials of the Minister's Department will not undertake drainage work unless they are reasonably satisfied that it can be brought to a successful conclusion.  I have not sufficient legal or administrative knowledge to be able to decide whether this amendment is practicable or not.  However, on the face of it, it seems to me that the appeal provided in this amendment would be too easy. In any question of dispute there is always a danger that you may make the matter of appeal for the ordinary citizen too expensive or too difficult.  On the other hand you can make it too easy, and one is as great an evil as the other. In every sporting event there is provision for appeal but I think that there is always some penalty for frivolous and unnecessary appeal.  I feel that while this amendment may not be workable it might be desirable to have some form of appeal.  There is in this Bill a definite assertion that it is the Minister who will definitely certify that the work has been completed&mdash;and against that certificate of the Minister there is no appeal.</P>
      <P>In every Bill that has gone through this House there has always been a demand, particularly from farmer Deputies, for some form of independent tribunal to decide between the ordinary farmer and the officials of whatever Department is dealing with the matter for the time being.  Therefore, if it is possible at a later stage or in the other House to make provision for such appeal tribunal which will not impede the work of the Department or the carrying out of the scheme, and which will not be abused, I think it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to prolong this discussion much further. When I was putting down this amendment I genuinely felt, as the last speaker has stated, that whilst the Minister might not accept it in the form in which it appears he would at least have produced something the equivalent of it.  Having listened to his arguments this evening against this amendment I feel more satisfied than ever that he himself sees quite clearly that there is reason in the appeal I am <Col N="108" /> making to him in this regard.  I do not feel in any way peeved if the conclusion I have arrived at is accurate that the Minister has decided to reject this amendment.  I suspect, somehow, that he does not want to meet me in this matter.  The amendment itself is so obviously designed to sort of run along the lines that we would expect the Minister himself to follow that his resistance of it here is incomprehensible. As, I suppose, I might be expected to say, I am not convinced by what I heard from the Minister.  I can genuinely say that I am not convinced, from anything I have heard from him, that, as Deputy Cogan has said, there is no need for some simple machinery. I do not want it to be as simple as the Minister or as Deputy Cogan would want the House to believe.  I have not in mind the sort of idea that the occupier or the owner of land could simply say: &ldquo;I am not satisfied and I will tell the district justice.  I will not have any trouble and, if I do not get a sympathetic hearing it will not cost me anything,&rdquo; and so forth.  That is not my idea at all.  I am not familiar with the procedure in the District Court or in any other court but, from what I do know of the procedure it is not possible to go before a District Court in a matter such as I have outlined and get away with that sort of reasoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some simple machinery of this sort is devised, the onus will be on me, as a landowner, to prove my case&mdash;as thousands of cases of this kind are disposed of in the District Courts every day and every week and every month of the year.  It is all very well to tell us about the elaborate maps which will be prepared by the officials of the Department, and of the magnificent understanding as between the owner of the land and the people who prepare the maps.  How often, however, have we seen people go to court in regard to matters in which the most elaborate preparations had been made? With the most exacting rules and regulations in so far as the procedure to be followed in the execution of the proposed work is concerned, how often have we seen such a position in spite of that litigation?  I am not asking this to encourage every Tom, Dick and <Col N="109" /> Harry to run to the District Court and I do not think it would have that result at all.  If I, as a landowner, invite the Department of Agriculture to look at three or four acres on my land which need to be reclaimed; they may be in the closest consultation with me and the closer the consultation the more necessary is what I ask; if I ask them to supply me with an estimate, which they do, and I approve of it and ask them to carry out the work with their own organisation, and if they certify it as being completed, I am asking <Col N="110" /> that there should be some reasonably simple, inexpensive machinery, be it court or anything else, before which I, as a person who feels aggrieved, can go.  If I cannot satisfy the tribunal or whatever it is that I have a grievance I should pay the costs of whatever witnesses, technical or otherwise, are called, not alone in support of my own case but in support of the State's case.  That is reasonable, I know, and I press it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Any person who suffers damage by reason of any interference, caused by the execution of works pursuant to this Act, with any land owned or occupied by him or any easement, profit-a-prendre or other right belonging to him shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be entitled to be paid compensation in respect of such damage by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2) Every claim for compensation made under this section shall be made in writing to the Minister before the expiration of the period beginning on the commencement of the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates and ending either two years thereafter or one year after the completion of such works (whichever is the later).</P>
      <P>(3) In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by the Minister under this section shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed £20, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, he determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired and the court or the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have jurisdiction to determine whether compensation is, in the circumstances, payable at all.</P>
      <P>(4) In determining compensation under this section, regard shall be had to any protection or benefit enuring to the claimant by reason of the execution of the works to which the claim relates.</P>
      <P>(5) A justice of the District Court when making an order under this section may at his discretion order the costs, to an amount not exceeding three guineas, incurred in relation to the proceedings by any party thereto (together with such witnesses' expenses as the justice considers reasonable) to be paid by any other party thereto.</P>
      <P>(6) Where, in the case of an application to the District Court to determine the compensation to be paid under this section by the Minister, the compensation determined by the court does not exceed that offered unconditionally by the Minister before the application was made, the court may order that such costs and witnesses' expenses of the Minister as the court considers reasonable shall be deducted from the compensation determined by the court.</P>
      <P>(7) The jurisdiction conferred by this section on the District Court shall be exercised, at the election of the claimant, by the justice within whose district the works or any part thereof were executed or by the justice within whose district the interference or any part thereof occurred.</P>

    <P>Deputies will recall that amendment A1 which I asked the House to incorporate in the Bill before we adjourned on a previous occasion aroused a certain amount of discussion on the grounds that I had not adequately explained it to the House. I trust that my further efforts to do so will clarify the position and I recommend this amendment on the same <Col N="113" /> grounds.  The purpose of the amendment is the same and is, consequently, related to the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied to take a decision regarding No. 4 on amendment No. 2 provided we are permitted to cover both in the discussion.  I move amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Aiken:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to add at the end of Section 5 the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Before commencing to clear a watercourse under this section the Minister shall give 14 days' notice to the Commissioners of Public Works of his intention to do so and if, before the expiry of the 14 days, the commissioners notify him that in their opinion the river or stream into which the watercourse drains is not capable of carrying extra water the Minister shall not proceed to clear the watercourse until the Commissioners of Public Works certify that the river has been made capable of carrying the extra water.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House unduly in the arguments I will advance in its favour.  This amendment as Deputies will realise on reading it is designed to protect certain landowners in certain districts from hardships which might result from the indiscriminate use of the machinery of this measure.  We had a great deal of discussion on this matter last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies seemed to think that this is a sort of delaying action and that the insertion of amendments of this nature is designed for the purpose of obstructing the carrying out of the work which they may consider to be very useful work but I sincerely think there is not a Deputy in this House who has not met a number of farmers in one district or another who will not be able to make a most convincing case to have some drainage work undertaken that will undoubtedly give relief to people in <Col N="114" /> their districts and these farmers are not called upon to ask themselves or to investigate in any way what the effect of carrying out such work will be on their immediate neighbours or at least their neighbours somewhat removed from them.  I have some personal experience of the harm that can result from the execution of works of that nature.  It is because of that personal experience that I am moving this amendment in the name of my colleague.  I do not believe that we have got from the Minister in the course of this discussion or from any Deputy supporting the Government any indication that they appreciate the harm that could result.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that we are only going to do the works we envisage in this measure which are not works likely to add considerably to the volume of water that will flow into the major stream but after all every little counts and water has a breaking point.</P>
    <P>In every catchment area&mdash;no matter where you start&mdash;the further out you start the longer will be the delay in the damage making itself apparent.  There is no doubt about it, when you start even in a little stream it is ultimately going to affect the larger river.  If the river is not able to take the volume of water then you are going to create a problem for those whose lands adjoin that river bank.  These amendments were designed to bring to the attention of the Minister, to the Department, the House and those responsible for the administration of the measure an appreciation of the resultant damage and to make an appeal to the Minister to devise some machinery whereby the dangers we envisage will be investigated.</P>

      <P>I reassure Deputies at once that the closest consultation is maintained, and will be maintained, both with the Board of Works and the Department of Local Government in all the works contemplated by my Department in this Bill.  I would like the House to be perfectly clear that there can be no question of one Department going berserk without regard to the experience and wisdom of other Departments and acting recklessly and improvidently.  I apprehend that a <Col N="115" /> chasm is widening as between myself on one side and Deputies Smith and Aiken on the other.  It has been said that every man of generous heart is a socialist when he is 21 and a conservative from 50 onwards.</P>

That is a perfectly legitimate point of view&mdash; one strongly held by the Commissioners of Public Works.  I recently had to consider an application from Valentia Island and I turned up the relevant papers and discovered that contingencies and possibilities had been under consideration since 1902.  Whereas the future had not yet clarified itself, it was thought wiser not to enter into any commitments in respect of Valentia Island.  I am credibly advised that the arterial drainage programme looks forward 35 years in its first stage and that 2010 is not too remote a date to fix for the completion of its modest programme.  I will not be alive in 2010, unless I live to be a very old man indeed, and I am not in the least interested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in what they are going to do in 2010.  I refuse to allow so modest a contribution as I can make to be conditioned by the obligation to make provision against what the Board of Works may be doing in 2010.  I am informed by competent authority on arterial drainage that it is a reasonable precaution, once you <Col N="116" /> bend your mind to a particular catchment area, to resolve not to stir a stone or cut a sod until you have made ten years' measurement of the metric volume of water passing through the catchment area.  If I am under a statutory obligation to drain no field in Ireland until I can persuade the Board of Works to certify to me that no danger of any kind of flooding in the arterial river serving the catchment area where that field is situated can conceivably arise, I must wait ten years in most catchment areas before I cut a sod.</P>
      <P>I salute the conservative approach of Deputy Smith.  Doubtless that circumspection would leave this country on the Day of Judgment in a more liquid financial position than it otherwise might be, but, in the meantime, a great many of our people will have lived waiting for the flood to come in through their back door and to go out through their front door and in the meantime a great many of our people will have asked themselves: &ldquo;Should we plant potatoes or make mud turf in this field?&rdquo;  I opt quite deliberately for the traditional radical method of abating an evil.  The evil is that our people are getting their living out of working on land which makes no proportionate return for the work put into it.  I am going to do what I know how to do, by authority of this Oireachtas, to make of that land, land which will give a fair return for the work put into it.</P>
      <P>There may be other evils which will manifest themselves as a result of abating the one which engages my attention at present.  I have not the slightest apprehension that, when these evils manifest themselves, we shall be as well able to master them as we are to master this one; but if we suffer our minds to be haunted by all the appalling possibilities which the experts in drainage and everything else can think up before we put our hands to this work, neither the Deputy's children nor his childrens' childrens' children will see the land of this country in the condition in which he and I would wish to see it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who went before us may have had that admirable burning faith which enables men to make great sacrifices <Col N="117" /> so that their children will enjoy amenities which their eyes are never fated to see.  I cannot claim such exaltation.  I want to see my neighbours enjoying some of the benefits which I believe this project can confer upon them.  I do not want to wait until 2,010 to do the job.  By leave of this Oireachtas, we propose to do it now, in the full confidence that, if that should give rise to any other problems, they can be grappled with and overcome just as effectively as the immediate problem is going to be dealt with under this Bill.</P>

I do not mind, either, being described as a person who would be influenced entirely in his own judgment by officialdom or by expert opinion.  I suspect the Minister has formed an opinion long ago on whether I am such a person and, if he has not, there are many who know that, on the matters we are now discussing and many others I, too, could have my own view and that, when I held a particular view, expert opinion would find it very hard to shake me of my notions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite wrong to make the case here, as the Minister has made the case, not only on these amendments but on the previous occasion, that there are two viewpoints on this matter of drainage.  I think it was the Minister who said that there were two schools of thought as to the manner in which this should be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister has a view of his own qualifications&mdash;it is a view that is not accepted by very many people&mdash;that he is a judge of all things and has an understanding of all things. <Col N="118" /> When he comes to the House and asks us to believe that there are two schools of thought as to the way in which drainage should be approached and as to the resulting damage from proceeding to drain land in a certain way, I want to tell him there are no two schools of thought on that at all.  I say that because, about 12 months ago the Minister himself employed a foreign expert from New Zealand to tell us the way in which we should reclaim our land and how we should go about that work.  I do not accept the Minister's viewpoint on the matter now before the House.  His is not the only viewpoint on this matter that is to be found on the records.  Commission after commission has reported on it. These commissions, composed of technical men and practical men, knew the problems that result from the flooding of land just as intimately as either the Minister or myself knows them.</P>
    <P>I am not making some novel case on behalf of the Deputy who put down those amendments or on behalf of our Party.  I do say that we are not accepting the recommendation of the expert that the Minister brought from New Zealand to tell us the way we should go about this matter of drainage.  I do not want to say that we should, in all cases, accept the recommendation of the expert, but in this matter the expert is supported by a whole chain of experts and by the practical experience of those who have watched the activities of both local authorities and State Departments which have attempted to tamper with drainage problems.  I knew the arguments which the Minister would make before these amendments were moved at all.  It is a grand thing, of course, to create a sort of atmosphere that, in a machinery measure of this kind, you are trying to insert some particular section that will hold up progress.  That argument will always make an immediate appeal to people.  It will enable those who make it to present themselves to the outside public as men with advanced ideas thinking in a spacious kind of way, as men who absolutely reject the suggestion that experts should be listened to at all, and who want to create the impression that they are not going to be tied up in red tape or brown tape <Col N="119" /> as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would have us believe when speaking here recently. That is all very well for the purpose of creating the proper kind of atmosphere amongst those who will not think of the harm that can result from their operations.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to describe those who make the case that I am making as conservatives.  I do not mind the accusation of being a conservative. The district in which I live is one that is in as great a need of drainage as, I think, any other part of the country. I see the ill-effects of some of the minor works that were carried out in that district in the past few years under the minor employment schemes, the bog development schemes and the rural improvements schemes.  There is an additional weakness that I see here.  The schemes that I have referred to were administered by the Office of Public Works.  I think the practice still exists that the county surveyor is, in his own territory, the agent for the execution of these works. Under that system there was at least this advantage&mdash;there may have been some disadvantages as well&mdash;that when the officer of the special employment schemes branch went down the country&mdash;he might not be a skilled, trained, technical person&mdash;he made a report on some small drainage work costing, say, £300, £400 or £500.  He might not have the sort of training that would enable him to decide whether, if the work were carried out, it might not cause damage further down.  Where the county surveyor did the work, there was this advantage, that when a work was sent to him for execution he would point out, and in many cases did point out to the responsible State Department, that damage might result from its execution.  That was the viewpoint of an expert whose only interest was to ensure that harm would not result to people whose interests might be adversely affected by the expenditure of public money.</P>
    <P>Under this measure that practice will not prevail.  Here the estimate will be prepared by the Department of Agriculture, and whether the work is carried out by the farmer concerned or <Col N="120" /> by the Department, it will be all carried out under the direction of the Department that prepared the estimate.  You will, therefore, not have the same sort of outside check as to whether or not damage may result as you had in the case that I have just given.</P>

      <P>Let us take the case of a farmer who is living along such a river.  Suppose the river is in a bad condition, and that it is one of those arteries that will be treated, if we are to believe the Minister, by that slow and more or less despicable institution, the Board of Works.  Let us suppose that it is now in a bad condition, what is going to happen if, under this measure, coupled with the Works Bill, it and a large number of similar streams are cleaned up?  The Minister, surely, must admit that, as a result of such operations, the water will flow more quickly, if there is a sudden rainfall, into that semi-main artery than it did heretofore.  I have seen several such farmers living along that type of water highway.  Let us suppose that your yard, stables, byres and piggeries are affected as a result of the neglect of the additional growth, and that the change in the circumstances of that river bed has made it more difficult for water to pass there, and suppose as a result of the execution of these works under this Bill when it becomes an Act and under the Works Bill, more water is allowed to flow over there and this man's yard and piggeries are flooded three or four times every winter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I reject entirely the case made by the Minister for the purpose of colour and of flare.  He suggests that there are two schools of thought in regard to this matter.  I do <Col N="122" /> not regard as right his school of thought, in which there is only one person, and that is the Minister himself. There is only one school of thought about drainage.  I repudiate also the suggestion that there is anything conservative in my approach to this matter.  I should be the last person to be conservative about it, because every day in the week I see the enormity of the problems with which we are confronted as regards drainage. There is no hope of solving this problem if we are simply trying to picture somebody else who draws attention to its enormity as the type of person who wants us to hang on with this matter for 2,000 years.  We will not succeed in solving this very intricate, difficult and costly problem by making light of those who express an opinion showing that they are approaching an understanding of the difficulties in a serious fashion.  That is the only contribution the Minister has made on these amendments. It is not the type of contribution that should come from any Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Any persons who suffers damage by reason of any interference, caused by the execution of works pursuant to this Act, with any land owned or occupied by him or any easement, profit-a-prendre or other right belonging to him shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be entitled to be paid compensation in respect of such damage by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Every claim for compensation made under this section shall be made in writing to the Minister before the expiration of the period beginning on the commencement of <Col N="123" /> the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates and ending either two years thereafter or one year after the completion of such works (whichever is the later).</P>
    <P>(3) In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by the Minister under this section shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed £20, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired and the court or the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have jurisdiction to determine whether compensation is, in the circumstances, payable at all.</P>
    <P>(4) In determining compensation under this section, regard shall be had to any protection or benefit enuring to the claimant by reason of the execution of the works to which the claim relates.</P>
    <P>(5)  A justice of the District Court when making an order under this section may at his discretion order the costs, to an amount not exceeding three guineas, incurred in relation to the proceedings by any party thereto (together with such witnesses' expenses as the justice considers reasonable) to be paid by any other party thereto.</P>
    <P>(6) Where, in the case of an application to the District Court to determine the compensation to be paid under this section by the Minister, the compensation determined by the court does not exceed that offered unconditionally by the Minister before the application was made, the court may order that such costs and witnesses' expenses of the Minister as the court considers reasonable shall be deducted from the compensation determined by the court.</P>
    <P>(7) The jurisdiction conferred by this section on the District Court shall be exercised, at the election of the claimant, by the justice within whose district the works or any part <Col N="124" /> thereof were executed or by the justice within whose district the interference or any part thereof occurred.</P>
    <P>With regard to this amendment, I hope Deputy Smith will recognise the rebuttal of his suggestion that any proposal emanating from the Opposition was rejected for no better reason than that it was proposed by the Opposition, Amendment No. 3 is an amendment offered by me to meet a point raised in an amendment put down by one of the Deputies in opposition on Committee and subsequently withdrawn to permit this being drafted.  It is substantially the same as the compensation proposal incorporated in the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I believe it meets the various suggestions put forward by Deputy Smith and Deputy Aiken and other Opposition Deputies on the Committee Stage.  I want to say quite clearly that I did not think it was necessary, and I do not now think it is necessary, but where it is possible, without creating insuperable difficulties, to incorporate into any Act something that the Opposition earnestly desire, I think it is right for the Government to go as far as they possibly can to meet their wishes.  I do not think this proposal places upon the Government any obligation that they would not have felt themselves bound by had this amendment not been here, but, of course, Deputy Smith and Deputy Aiken are perfectly right in saying that the average individual is entitled to have a more than a pious expression of intention by a Minister. He is entitled to have a legal right and the means to enforce it and in their judgment it was desirable that that should be placed in the Bill.  It affords me satisfaction to recognise the position of the Opposition in this House and, inasmuch as the general plan of the Bill is not interfered with by meeting their wishes in that matter, I trust they find this amendment substantially what they would wish it to be.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) is the only part to which I can take exception.  In the main the amendment is satisfactory; but the time limit of two years after the date of the commencement of the work or 12 months after the <Col N="125" /> date of the completion of the work is not satisfactory in the circumstances that I envisage could arise.  It is, however, an amendment designed to meet some of the criticism levelled against this measure in its earlier stages.  To that extent it is, of course, welcome.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two on the Fifth Stage.  As in the case of the Works Bill, there is in the Bill now before the House in its present form considerable justification for the line we adopted during the Second Reading and on Committee. This measure now contains two very vital provisions which it did not contain when it was presented for Second Reading.  One is the provision that in the event of the Minister and his officials entering upon land to do a certain type of work, the owner of that land shall get notification of the Minister's intention.  The second is the amendment we have been discussing this evening to the effect that if damage results to any landower he is provided with a means of seeking compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that I may not express any opinion on the provisions I think should be in this Bill; but I think it would have considerably improved this Bill from our point of view if the Minister had conceded the amendment on which we divided a short time ago. I cannot understand why the Minister introduced this Bill in the bald way in which it appeared in the House in the first instance.  Neither do I understand how the Minister succeeded in obtaining the approval of the Government to <Col N="126" /> this Bill.  I understand that before any measure is introduced the Government must approve of it.  I could find no reason on the Second Reading why the two matters that are now covered as a result of the amendment introduced by the Minister because of the pleas advanced by the Opposition were not covered in the measure in the first instance.  Perhaps it was a tactical move on the part of the Minister.  Perhaps he said to himself: &ldquo;The chances are that I shall be pressed by the Opposition to accept amendments of one kind or another and it would be a bit awkward for me if, with all legal aid at my disposal, I endeavoured to make the measure too perfect; therefore, to the extent that I believe it is perfect I shall have to resist amendments, and I may be accused by the Opposition of being unreasonable in not meeting them in some respect.&rdquo;  I thought of that as a possible explanation. But I do not think it can be the explanation because the provisions that were omitted are far too important. I was amazed when I looked at the measure on the Second Reading and discovered that the Minister responsible for it, holding the views he so often expressed here in the past, had come forward to the House with proposals which, if implemented without amendment, would run counter to the rights of private persons upon which the Minister so emphatically expressed himself in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is largely administrative. Even in our discussions to-day the Minister has told us that Part I of this scheme is being operated in eight counties.  I still cannot understand why it is necessary to limit the operations of Part I of this project to eight counties.  As I see it, Part I is an <Col N="127" /> enlargement of the farm improvement scheme.  I am not advancing this in any spirit of criticism, but merely in the hope that I shall ultimately induce the Minister to change his mind.  Part I is an enlargement of a scheme that is already in existence.  The personnel is available in relation to that scheme. I can see a considerable amount of injustice being done to farmers who were in a position to avail of the farm improvements scheme in the years gone by and who must now wait at least six months, and possibly longer, before they may apply under Part I of this scheme.  Meanwhile they will be deprived of the right of availing of any other scheme until such time as the Minister and his Department are in a position to operate Part I over the entire Twenty-Six Counties.  The trained personnel is already available in every town and district of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>Part I of the scheme is by far the most important.  It will represent about 75 to 80 per cent. of the work that will be done when both parts are operated. Even at this stage I see no reason why the Minister would not reconsider his whole approach to this matter and extend the operation of Part I to the entire Twenty-Six Counties.  I have no special district in mind.  Many farmers who in the past availed of the farm improvements scheme will now have to wait.  I know that the plea I am making is one which will commend itself to the approval of those who will suffer loss because they can no longer avail of existing schemes.  This may be a more attractive proposition but the others represent, as the old adage has it, &ldquo;a bird in the hand.&rdquo;  I do not think it is fair that they should have to wait.  Neither do I believe that it is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been somewhat unfortunate in the type of weather with which he has been blessed while piloting this measure through the House.  In normal times&mdash; that is, in wet weather&mdash;we would all be wildly enthusiastic about field drainage.  But at a time when dry land is being completely burned up, when we see cows making for wet, waterlogged <Col N="128" /> land for sustenance, one is inclined to feel not so enthusiastic as in normal times, but I suppose normal times will come again.  I think that at this stage of the Bill it is desirable that the House should get a clear indication of what is in the Bill.  The Bill provides for the carrying out of a certain amount of work by the Department. It includes field drainage, land reclamation and a number of other types of work.  I want to ask the Minister at this stage what is meant by the words &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo;.  At other stages of the Bill this question was raised.  I had an amendment down to the Bill which, unfortunately, was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It did seek to get a definition of &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo; but I feel that my amendment does not really matter very much because I believe that the purpose which I sought to achieve by my amendment is achieved by this term &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo;. What I sought to achieve by my amendment was that land which does not require drainage, which does not require the removal of scrub, furze, rocks or stones, land which has been, perhaps, cultivated in the past but is still impoverished, would be dealt with and reclaimed under this Bill.  Now I am satisfied that this Bill does provide for the reclamation of such land.  I am satisfied that there is nothing in this Bill to prevent the Minister from going ahead, applying lime, phosphates and other manures to impoverished land which requires to be reclaimed.  If there is any doubt in the Minister's mind as to what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo; I would advise him to follow a distinguished precedent and go to the dictionaries. I went to a number of dictionaries to find out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to the Oxford dictionary, to Webster's dictionary and even to Woolworth's dictionary.  The Oxford dictionary gives a fairly clear definition of what is meant by reclamaction <Col N="129" /> of land.  &ldquo;Reclamation&rdquo; means &ldquo;to bring waste land or land formerly covered by water under, or into, a fit state for cultivation.&rdquo;  The Oxford dictionary goes further and it quotes J. Walker in his <i>History of the Hebrides</i> as saying: &ldquo;There has been more wild land reclaimed in Scotland by the use of lime than by any other manure.&rdquo;  I do not know who this gentleman J. Walker is, but he is quoted by the Oxford dictionary as an authority and he states that land can be reclaimed by the use of lime.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister definitely to say that there is anything in this Bill as it is now before the House to prevent him from applying to impoverished land the necessary manures and fertilisers that will bring it into a fit and proper state for cultivation.  I go further and say that the Minister will fail in achieving the high purpose he has set for himself in this whole land rehabilitation project, if he does not apply the scheme to poor land that does not require drainage or clearance.  I would estimate that there are 3,000,000 acres of such land in this country.  The Minister appears to be under an impression that that is an exaggerated estimate.  On the other hand, I believe that his estimate of 4,000,000 acres of wet land or coarse, hilly land is entirely exaggerated.  I do not believe the Minister will be able to find 4,000,000 acres of land which is potentially arable but which requires drainage or other improvement.  On the other hand, if he turns his attention to the type of land I have suggested, he will find ample scope for his energy and the ability of his Department.  If the Minister states that he is not prepared to extend this land rehabilitation project to such type of work, there is nothing we can do at the moment but there are always opportunities for the Dáil to decide the question.</P>

      <P>Either the application of fertilisers or hard work to the land of this country will produce profit.  The man who uses fertilisers and puts forth hard work should make farming pay. I am utterly at a loss to see why any man's neighbours should go in and provide profit for the man who owns land and will not cultivate it while <Col N="130" /> that man sits upon his sash and collects the boodle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the House will go so far as to say that land the rehabilitation of which requires capital equipment far in excess of what any farmer in this country can ever hope to have, must for ever remain fallow because the community will not do it or because they do not want to.  I have asked Oireachtas Éireann to take the middle path and to authorise me on behalf of the community, to do that which cannot be done even if the community does not do it, but not to charge me with doing the work of every farmer in the country while the farmer is content to sit on his sash and collect the boodle.</P>
      <P>This scheme in Part I applies to eight counties because it is radically different from anything Deputy Smith has ever dreamed of.  When Deputy Smith speaks of it in the same context as that most admirable scheme, the farm improvements scheme, he reveals at once that he just does not appreciate at all the nature of the work that we intend to undertake.  I do not want to asperse in any degree the farm improvements scheme.  I think it was a most excellent scheme, but how does the Deputy imagine that in the prosecution of the scheme some £40,000,000 sterling could ever be spent?  It simply does not belong to that scale or concept at all, and I should be long sorry if anything I said or did left the Opposition under the impression that my purpose had any relation at all to the kind of work that was provided for under the farm improvements scheme. Were I to get the assent of the Opposition to this legislation on that representation it would be a false pretence for which I would be gravely culpable. The scale of work contemplated under this project is quite out of that category altogether and no Deputy who contemplates a mere extension of the farm improvement scheme should dream of assenting to the proposal which the passage of this Bill into law will suggest the Oireachtas approves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason why our operations <Col N="131" /> are confined to eight counties is because I could not assemble the trained staff to do the kind of work we have to do in lesser time.  Without apology, I tell the House that it is our purpose to have in those eight counties a very excessive staff, because we wish to make of the surplus a nucleus rapidly to train staff for a rapid expansion over the country.  But we are quite resolved, bearing in mind the very large sums of public money that it is intended to lay out, that the work should not be committed to the hands of men who are not relatively highly trained and that it would be wrong to put on untrained men the kind of burden that the administrators of this project will have to bear in the field.</P>

      <P>I take it as <i>bona fide.</i> The work includes the erection and rearrangement of fences, the making of drains, the removal of rock, tree stumps and other obstructions which will involve heavy and expensive machinery.  Perhaps the Deputy has overlooked the fact that under this scheme we hope that many of those who undertake to do it themselves and accept a grant will employ contractors to do that kind of work which could be <Col N="132" /> done by lowly paid manual labour, but which we hope to see done by skilled workers operating modern machinery and remunerated at a rate appropriate to the skilled employment.  I do not think the Deputy has fully grasped the different approach to this matter.  For that I may be in part to blame.  I may not have explained it sufficiently.  But, when explaining it to the House, I said that I did not want the House to look upon it as an employment scheme or as a project primarily founded on the employment of great masses of lowly-paid manual workers; that our aim was to use the most modern machinery to carry out the work with the maximum expendition and to facilitate those working upon it by equipping them to earn, not the traditional minimum agricultural wage, but the wage of skilled workers appropriate to the volume of work that they would be equipped to do.  I venture to prophesy that when the Deputy sees the work in progress he will realise that it does not partake of the picture that he has in mind.</P>
      <P>The last thing which the Deputy wished me to explain was how it came about that the Government consented to the incorporation of an amendment to meet a matter which the Deputy felt might appropriately have been met when the Bill was being drafted.</P>

      <P>It is because I regard this House as having privileges and prerogatives and because I believe the House to be a deliberative assembly in which representations of the Opposition are entitled to deference and respect, inasmuch as they are made by virtue of the fact that members of the Opposition represent our people, that when they ask for certain alterations to be made I conceive it to be my duty to examine the Bill carefully with a view to seeing whether it is possible, without rendering the whole plan inoperative, to meet their wishes.  I will ask them to bear that in mind, when they make proposals for the alteration of measures submitted to this House, <Col N="134" /> since it would be a pity if they were made without the realisation that they would be considered on their merits and every trouble taken to meet them if it were possible to do so.  I hope Deputy Smith will agree with me that that is the proper approach on the part of a democratic Government.  I think he would make it easier to maintain that proper approach if he would recognise it for what it is and not allow himself the very understandable indulgence of saying that the willingness on the Government's part to meet the Opposition feelings is evidence that the Government has ill-considered the legislation before they submitted it to the House.  Not one of the amendments here inserted at the instance of the Opposition, in my judgment is necessary.  It is none the less a pleasure to me to accept them, or to introduce others, in so far as they meet the Opposition's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, when this Bill passes into law, it will be more truly judged in operation than it can be in anticipation.  I believe that it provides for a Minister for Agriculture an opportunity no other Minister in this country has ever had.  If it fails of its purpose, the Minister who fails to make it a success must bear the blame.  This Bill, Sir, should not pass from this House without a note being taken of one very relevant matter.  It envisages the expenditure of a very great sum of money.  Ultimately, in this State and in this Government, the Minister for Finance is the Minister responsible for the control of the public purse.  Without his sanction no expense can be recommended by a Government to the Oireachtas.  It takes a man of vision and a man who has great confidence in the agricultural community to stake his reputation as Finance Minister on the use they will make of the unexampled resources which his financial genius has provided for the purposes of this project. Without the financial wisdom and guidance, this Bill would never have seen the light of day.  Without the knowledge that his unexampled financial skill approved these measures, the Government to which I belong would never have brought them before Oireachtas Éireann.  A very <Col N="135" /> important part of whatever benefit accrues to our community, as the result of the improvement in agriculture which I believe this project will produce, is due to the Minister for Finance who made it possible.  Much of the kudos of performance will inevitably attach to the Minister for Agriculture and the House need have no apprehension I will claim my share.  But what is important is that Deputies on all sides of the House should know that one Minister, perhaps least associated in the public mind with matters of this kind, is the Minister to whom we should be most indebted for that we can now embark on the task of completing the work begun just 70 years ago when the land war was declared. Our fathers had a part in that: we and our children shall have a part in finishing it.  I hope that when our work is done our children will have as good a reason to be proud of their fathers as we have of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to continue in operation the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act, 1942, for the period from 1st August, 1947 to 31st July, 1949.  The 1942 Act applied to the period from 1st August, 1941, to 31st July, 1942, and short continuing Acts have since extended this period to 31st July, 1947.  The Bill thus continues <Col N="136" /> to a current date the powers conferred on county councils by the Act of 1942, to adopt schemes for the provision of seeds and fertilisers for farmers on credit terms.  This involves the validation of schemes which have already been put into operation by county councils in anticipation of this legislation and the Bill contains provision for this purpose.</P>
      <P>It is not the purpose of the Bill to provide agricultural credit in the broad general sense of that term.  It is merely designed to permit county counsils to provide credit for those small cultivators who might not be able to obtain it in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>County councils may operate two types of scheme under the Bill.  The usual type of scheme is where the council pays the merchant the cost of seeds supplied to an applicant and recovers the cost from the applicant.  The other type is a guarantee scheme under which the applicant obtains the seed from the merchant and the council guarantees the merchant the cost in the event of failure to recover from the applicant.  Only one county council (Louth) adopted such a scheme last season and there were no applicants.</P>
      <P>All county councils, with the exception of Kerry, have adopted schemes for the two seasons in question.  The total number of loans last year was 4,356 and the total cost was £50,738; the average loan thus being £11 7s. 0d. The number of recipients in 1944-45 was 5,036; in 1945-46 it was 4,804, and in 1946-47 it was 4,807.</P>
      <P>The number for the present season is not yet available.  The Bill is for the purpose of continuing what has been done since 1942 and in previous years, to enable the county councils to adopt schemes for helping these people to get seeds and fertilisers who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In order to explain the general purpose of this Bill it is necessary to outline the circumstances which have led to its introduction. My Department has had associations for the past 12 years with a British firm named Alginate Industries Limited.  This firm has been engaged in the extraction of Alginates from seaweeds since 1936, and all this time has been a buyer of Irish seaweeds, the gathering and transport being organised by Gaeltacht Services and the material being shipped in the air-dried state to Scotland for processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early in 1946, the company decided to form an associate Irish company the better to ensure their supplies of these vital raw materials.  It was considered essential for that purpose that the new company should have strong Irish representation.  Plans were made for the Irish company to engage in the purchase, sale and shipment to the British company of air-dried sea-rods. Later in the year 1946, the English company became interested in Ascophyllum (rock-weed) as a supplementary raw material for the production of a kind of alginate which would cater for certain markets which could not be satisfied out of the limited annual production from sea-rods in Ireland and Scotland, and it was decided to set up a plant in Connemara to dry and mill the weed instead of shipping it unprocessed from this country.  The Irish company was incorporated in February, 1947, with a capital of £6,000, of which 51 per cent. was subscribed by an Irish interest.  A site for the drying and milling plant was acquired at Kilkerrin, near Carna, and close to the <Col N="139" /> largest Ascophyllum belt in Europe.  An agreement was concluded between the Irish and English companies for the sale and purchase of seaweeds whether in their air-dried or milled states and provision was made for the supply of machinery and technical assistance by the English company.  The milling factory was completed in February, 1948.</P>
    <P>While the factory was in course of erection the position developed that certain chemicals required for the processing of Ascophyllum weed were no longer available to the English company and that, therefore, milled Ascophyllum weed would not be required for the time being.  The Irish company was, therefore, asked to substitute for the agreement to supply milled Ascophyllum weed one for the supply of milled sea-rods for the production of which the milling plant was also suitable. At the same time, it was found that the capital of the Irish company was insufficient and would have to be increased to £10,000, in which increase it would be necessary that the Irish partners should participate so as to keep their share up to 51 per cent. While these matters were awaiting settlement a change occurred in the ownership of the Irish interest, and in March, 1948, the Irish partners asked to be released from participation in the Irish company.</P>
    <P>My Department suggested to the English company that a new manufacture licence under the Control of Manufactures Act should be applied for to enable the English company to get complete control of the Irish company subject to its subscribing for the majority of the shares.  The English company, while being of opinion that such a course might be feasible and to some extent advantageous in the case of the milling of the Ascophyllum weed which is found in close proximity to the factory, could not agree that there would be any advantage in the case of the milling of sea-rods.  Having regard to the cost of transport of sea-rods from far and near points of the coast to the factory such milling could, it asserts, be done as cheaply and more conveniently after direct transport to <Col N="140" /> Scotland at its plant there.  It should be remembered that the milling of sea-rods here had been proposed only to replace the milling of Ascophyllum weed until its use could be resumed.</P>
    <P>We decided to take up the interest in this project and ask for 51 per cent. of the share capital by this Bill.</P>
    <P>On close examination of this proposal I recommend it to the Dáil for acceptance, for the following reasons:</P>
    <P>(a) Unless it were adopted, it seemed certain that the rod-milling industry would be lost to the Gaeltacht. Recent indications show that the Ascophyllum scheme may be revived in two or three years' time. Failing participation in the Irish company by the Department, the obvious and most economical course for the English company would be to close the Kilkerrin factory and revert to the direct shipment of sea-rods to Scotland.  The factory could be reopened on the revival of the Ascophyllum scheme.</P>
    <P>(b) The sea-rod industry is regarded as the one showing the best prospects of the Marine Products Industries. The uses to which the products of the sea-rods are put are such that it appears that the demand for these will be lasting, will steadily increase and will be a valuable source of income to the men engaged in the industry on the western seaboard. The collection of sea-rods has been increased and approximately £12,000 will have been paid to the gatherers for the past season's harvest.</P>
    <P>(c) It is estimated that the working of the factory will mean the distribution of an additional £9,000 in respect of wages, turf, and services rendered locally.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House accordingly asks for authority to expend a sum not exceeding £5,100 in the acquisition of shares of £1 each in the Irish company.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of this Bill is self-explanatory. With regard to Section 2, the capital of the company, at present £6,000, is to be increased to £10,000 as already stated, and this section provides for the acquisition of 51 per cent. of the increased capital <Col N="141" /> of £10,000, so that the majority holding will be in the name of the Minister for Lands.  Section 3 deals with the powers of the Minister in respect of his shares.  With regard to Section 4, it will be necessary that the Minister should be represented on the board of the company, and this section accordingly provides for the nomination of nominees and their powers and functions.  Section 5 is required because a Minister of State as a corporation sole is not a qualified person under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934.  Sections 6, 7 and 8 are self-explanatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no previous information in regard to the circumstances which have given rise to this proposal.  The Minister has referred to the Control of Manufactures Act. As the Minister knows, the object of that Act was to preserve the majority ownership of concerns in which foreign capital participated in the possession and under the control of Irish nationals.  In the alternative situation of a monopoly being created which it was impossible to arrange for except by special arrangements with a foreign company the general procedure was to arrange for the setting up of the industry in question by means of the usual negotiations and the exchange of correspondence&mdash;and the agreement generally arose out of this correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues that arose was, generally, whether the industry should remain permanently in the control of the originating syndicate or company or whether provision should not be made that it would ultimately pass into the hands of the Government here, if they considered it necessary to acquire it&mdash;either to run it directly by the State, which was not generally the object sought after but, if necessary, if it was considered desirable in the national interest that it should be acquired, to set up perhaps a semi-State company to take it over.  In this case the original Irish subscribers have dropped out, leaving the Minister in the position in which he thinks the only solution is that he should come in directly and replace them to the extent of 51 per cent, of the capital. <Col N="142" /> If that is the best arrangement that can be made the Minister should perhaps take steps to ensure that since the fact that he is now to participate in the business must necessarily mean, if the circumstances are as propitious as he states, that it is going to have a prosperous future and, with the State behind it&mdash;unless the market for these materials collapses in some way or unless there is some extraordinary change in the position&mdash;it stands to reason that the industry should be fairly prosperous.  I see no reason why the State should not take it over altogether, if necessary.  The Minister should at least have it within his discretion to say to the English company that at the end of a certain period&mdash; let it be five years or ten years&mdash;he should have the option, should he consider it fit, to take over the industry.  That is the broad general line, I think, in which the Opposition would approach the matter, though we have not had an opportunity of discussing it as it was only circularised last Thursday, I think.  Nevertheless I think that that is the general line in which we would approach this question.</P>
    <P>This is rather a new position.  We have heard a great deal about State and semi-State Companies.  Whatever the case might be for the Gaeltacht industries branch taking over this industry altogether or setting up a company&mdash;such as, apparently, is being done under the Newagency Bill&mdash;for the specific purpose of taking it over, for a Minister to go into a company which has hitherto been run as a private concern, and to act as partner with a company from outside, is rather a new departure.  The moneys to be raised shall be advanced out of the Central Fund.  I take it that the control which the Minister will exercise under this company, through his nominees on the board, will mean that the operations of the company will come up here on the annual Estimate for discussion.  Will they come up?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, if the operations of the company do not come up, it means that once this legislation is passed the House has really very little <Col N="143" /> control.  I can understand the position in the case of the Electricity Supply Board where the Oireachtas, having given the Minister certain powers and having given the corporation which it has set up power to raise capital, does not propose to interfere in any way or, in the case of the Minister who has been responsible for a certain overall supervision, to have the work of the corporation brought in here under review.  That was the object in keeping these semi-State corporations in the particular category in which they are. However, this is not quite in that category, because it is not being run by an independent board outside.  The Minister is definitely appointing nominees on this board.  Presumably these nominees will represent the Minister and the Minister's point of view on the board and in the company. If they do not do that, of course, this has no meaning.  To that extent I think it is legitimate criticism of the proposal if the intention is that the operations of the company or the actions of the Minister in regard to it should not come before the House for review, to say that that seems to be not in line with the policy of having a direct nominee of the Minister on the board, the Minister being directly responsible really for the majority control and management of it.  Apart from the fact that that is so, it is an industry, apparently, of importance.  I do not know whether it is going to be of benefit to other areas as well as Connemara.  I presume that all maritime areas where these algæ are available may benefit.  According to the figures the Minister has given, the industry must be of very considerable value at present&mdash;the sea-rods part of it, at any rate&mdash;to the district where it is established.  If these figures are any indication, and if it can expand from the present figures, it should be a very important matter for the Gaeltacht and the Western seaboard areas generally. The only possible control the House will have if it is not entitled to discuss the operation of the company or the actions of the Minister regarding it on his annual Estimate would be under sections 6, where the Minister undertakes to lay the balance sheet and <Col N="144" /> profit and loss account before each House of the Oireachtas.  These documents mean very little sometimes as a balance sheet and a profit and loss account give only the bare figures and the House would be entitled to more information by way of a report, say, of the operation of the company during the year in question.</P>
      <P>A balance sheet and profit and loss account does not give any information beyond what actually happened during the year, the receipts, expenditure, profits, the amount paid in wages and so on, but no information, for example, as to the future prospects of the company or any plans the Minister might have in mind for its expansion.  In fact, we get very little information through this device&mdash;we may call it a device&mdash;for advancing money for the shares of the company out of the Central Fund.  It means that the House will have no control if what the Minister said is correct that it will not be in the position to ask questions on the annual Estimate.  I agree that it is not necessary to go into details.  I do not think that anybody on this side of the House&mdash;although again I want to say that we have not discussed the matter&mdash;would think it desirable that we should go into details of administration, but there is a principle involved.  As the Minister is governing it as being the major shareholder in the company and as we are asked to pass legislation to devote money to the purpose, I think we should be entitled on some occasion or other to information. If the Estimate is not considered appropriate because of an entirely new departure, I think that an opportunity for discussion should be given on some other understanding.  I wonder could the Minister state definitely whether the seaweed meal has anything to do with this project or whether it is simply confined to the two species to which he has referred, the sea-rods and the other.</P>

The whole thing goes back to an accidental <Col N="145" /> discovery, I think about seven or eight years ago, when a perfectly new series of by-products was discovered&mdash;and it is still a closely guarded secret&mdash;by one or two persons in England who were fortunate enough to make the discovery. In order to find the most suitable raw material for this substance alginic acid, they tried several raw materials and after long and careful searching, they found that sea-rods were in most plentiful supply and gave the best quality finished product. It is right also, I think, to inform the House that, as far as our information goes, the greatest field for sea-rods exists off the west coast of Ireland. Next to it, there are only two other fields in Europe, one off the coast of Norway and one, which is not as good as the one on the Irish coast, off the west coast of Scotland.  These sea-rods as distinct from the Ascophyllum or ordinary bladder weed, with which anybody who has ever gone along the seashore is quite familiar, have promised to provide the best raw material for the industry.  These people came over here and formed a little company about two or three years ago.  They set up a little factory in Kilkerrin in Connemara, for the kiln drying of the rods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea-rods, I might explain, come up from the sea after a period of storm.  They grow at a depth of about six fathoms out from the shore.  They are torn loose by the storm and they are heaped up along the whole coast from Kerry to Donegal, but particularly in Connemara, where the nature of the seabed, apparently, is particularly favourable for their growth.  They are pitched up by the waves and lie in piles on the beach.  They went to loss since the kelp industry faded out.  The people along the seashore gather them and place them out on walls or other suitable drying-places.  They are purchased by Gaeltacht Services in an air-dried state, that is, when they are fairly dry and have lost a great deal of weight but are still flexible and cannot be used for meal in the factory to produce alginic acid in England.  The searod industry has taken the place of the general seaweed industry, but one should not lose sight of the fact that experiments are being carried out as to <Col N="146" /> how to utilise the bladder weed or Ascophyllum, which is more plentiful along the coast as the sea-rods can only grow in certain depths, 18 feet, while the bladder weed, Ascophyllum, grows every place along the coast where the tide rises and falls and could be gathered in enormous quantities.  So far the experiments have not been very successful in finding a good raw material to replace the sea-rods, but it is hoped that some method will be found of utilising the bladder weed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig asked whether the industry is likely to succeed or whether there are any snags ahead.  Of course, nobody can dip into the future but, as far as we can see, there is every prospect that the industry will grow and flourish.  Three thousand tons were sold at £4 per ton by the people along the coast who, unfortunately, have small holdings and are not well-equipped to go to sea to fish and supplement their income in that way.  I think I am not exaggerating when I say that not a third or a quarter of the total harvest of sea-rods has been gathered at the present time because the thing is only in its infancy.  At least 10,000 or 12,000 tons of sea-rods are available on our west coast.  I do not know about the south, but Deputies in the House can take it that everywhere on the bed of the ocean between Kerry and Donegal where there is the suitable depth of six fathoms, sea-rods are thrown up on the shore.  Sometimes, however, the vagaries of the current bring as much out to sea, causing their irretrievable loss, as is cast up on the shore and which can then be dried and stacked.</P>
    <P>A nice income, something like £12,000, was distributed last year as the price of the air-dried rods.  It is not a very big sum, I admit, but seeing that the industry is only in its infancy and shows every sign of growth rather than of diminishing, it is a useful sideline for many of our people along the sea coast who have not a very good means of livelihood without it.  On the question of control the Minister will appoint nominees to control the company and as usual will take a controlling interest.  We are taking 51 percent. of the capital which assures us the necessary control we want under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Section 6 will ensure that the accounts and balance sheet of the company will be laid on the Table of the House each year as is usual in such cases as these.  Also I cannot see any reason why any matter connected with this company or industry should be concealed by the Minister.  There is not a great deal to it.  The factory will be one to kiln dry sea-rods into suitably fine meal and to ship it as fine meal across to the factory in England.  There will be a certain number of workers employed&mdash;we anticipate anything from 12 to 20&mdash;and a certain amount of turf will be used as the most suitable type of fuel and which has produced good results so far.  The turf will run easily into 1,000 tons a year and will give a certain amount of employment to those with suitable bogs in the locality as has happened in the last year or two. I cannot visualise any Minister refusing information even if in the course of debate Deputies stray from the point. I cannot conceive any Minister refusing information about this company, but if a Minister should do that the Deputies will have the all-powerful weapon of Parliamentary Question in getting the information desired.</P>

It will provide a valuable industry for the western seaboard and if the supply of rock weed can be treated so as to yield the necessary raw material for this industry quite a big expansion is ahead.  I hope it will not fall on evil days as did the kelp industry for the production of potash because of reasons outside our control. I think kelp is coming into its own and cannot be replaced for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an appeal to the Minister to extend the school medical services as much as possible and as soon as possible.  I ask this because I am aware of the splendid results which have already accrued from the totally inadequate medical services we have now got in the schools. As it operates at the moment examinations are carried out within the first or second year of a child's entry into school and then there is usually only one other examination which occurs approaching the time when the child is about to leave school.  That is a very great advance of course on the position operating 15 years ago when we were working in the schools without any kind of medical services whatever.  But in the light of the good results that are now being achieved through these medical services I urge on the Minister to expand these services as soon as possible.  The ideal thing would be to have a complete examination of every child in every school once a year.  That may be too much to expect, but there should be a pretty complete examination of every child once in two years, which would mean that a child would be fairly thoroughly examined at least four times during his school life.  I have seen a medical officer discover defects of vision, even defects of hearing, and chest and other defects in children which were quite unsuspected by parents, teachers or anyone else <Col N="150" /> until the examination was made in the school, and I have seen children having their eyes attended to and other things done for them which would not have been done if this service were not in operation.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion I would make is that, when the medical officer carries out his examination and inspection, a report should be furnished to the manager of the school as well as to the local authority, and it would be a good thing if these reports were retained in the school amongst the permanent records, so that, when the ordinary inspector comes in, he can query if the points referred to by the medical officer have been attended to, and, if they have not, will have an opportunity to consult the manager and ask him to have the points attended to.  I am afraid that very often the first thing the manager knows about the opinion of the medical officer is when he sees some scare report in the public Press.  That is the least helpful way of dealing with the matter.  A report might be furnished to the manager of every school immediately after the medical examination has been carried out, and, in saying that, I have particularly in mind the condition of the lavatories and of the school yard and of the other matters which impinge so much on the health of the children. Another service which I think is completely inadequate is the dental service for school children.  A great part of what is done is merely extraction of teeth and I do not think that that is enough.  The service should be such that remedial measures, short of extraction, could be carried out, and that cannot be done without a very great extension of the existing facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of food in hospitals and institutions came up for discussion today. I have fairly considerable experience in this matter and I am satisfied that, in nearly all cases, the quality and quantity of food are quite good, but I am not at all satisfied that the preparation and presentation of the food are all that might be desired, or that it is always suited to the patients in these public institutions. A dietician should be appointed to every hospital of any size.  We have here in Dublin an institution in Cathal <Col N="151" /> Brugha Street where a very excellent course in dietetics is given.  Students qualify in that subject and most of those who qualify have to leave the country and find employment in Britain or elsewhere, and it looked as if that very excellent course would have to be discontinued.  It would give a great fillip to this training and great encouragement to that institution if those who qualified in dietetics there could obtain employment in our hospitals and public institutions and I should like the Minister to encourage in every possible way the appointment of a qualified dietician in our institutions.</P>
    <P>It is not at all an easy matter for hospitals, sanatoria and institutions of that sort to keep an adequate domestic staff and this, too, has a good deal to do with food not being cooked and presented in the way it should be.  It is extremely hard to keep the domestic staff in these institutions and very hard indeed to keep the nursing staff, because conditions are not good or tempting enough to hold them in the steady employment of these institutions.  This applies particularly to the domestic staff.  In one or two hospitals with which I am connected, we find it very difficult to retain our staff and we have constantly to chop and change. Although we do everything in our power to make the conditions as satisfactory as possible for these people, we cannot compete with conditions over in Britain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan urged the Minister to proceed with the implementation of the mother and child service provided for in the 1947 Act and he described it as the kernel of that Act.  I quite agree with that.  The mother and child service is, or should be, the foundation of any public health effort made in this or in any other country.  The 1947 Act was a very admirable over-all plan for the betterment of health in this country and, whether we liked the Minister who put forward that plan or not, we must all admit that it was a very detailed and very excellent plan in almost every respect.  It made the mother and child service the real foundation and I, too, urge the Minister to attack the <Col N="152" /> whole problem of public health from that angle.  To take full advantage of the legislation we have, it is possible to proceed in several ways, and I think the most logical thing to do would be to ensure that the mother and child service would be made as perfect as possible and then to take particular care of the health of our children in our schools, and especially in our primary schools.  If we make sure of that foundation we can then go on to deal with all the other problems in their order of merit and of urgency.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that very good progress is being made in the city of Dublin in the matter of the provision of beds for tuberculous patients.  It is one of the things on which we can congratulate the Minister and the corporation authorities.  It is now becoming possible to obtain equipment, so that we can get ahead very much more quickly than it was possible to do up to this year.  I hope that progress will be continued until the terrible want that existed with regard to the hospitalisation of tubercular patients is fully met.</P>
    <P>Another thing on which we have to congratulate ourselves is the virtual wiping out of diphtheria fatalities in the city of Dublin anyhow.  The Dublin Fever Hospital Board Report for 1947, which is the latest one available, states that the fatality percentage for 1948 was nil.  It might be said that one could not draw a legitimate general conclusion from the results for one year, but may I point out that there has been a steady decline from 1936 down to this year.  That, I think, should be of great satisfaction to the members of this House.  In 1936 the percentage was 12.5; in 1937, 9.1; 1938, 8.9; 1939, 7 per cent.; 1940, 5 per cent.; 1941, there was a rise to 8.9, but it fell again to 5.4 in 1942; in 1943 it was 5.1; 1944, 2.4; 1945, 2.4; 1946, 3 per cent.; 1947, 1.1, while in 1948, the year just concluded, the fatality was nil.  Now that is a very wonderful result, and it really strengthens my plea that the mother and child services should now be attacked with at least as much energy and enthusiasm as have been devoted in the last year to the provision of beds for patients suffering from tuberculosis. Dr. Russell, who was the Chief <Col N="153" /> Medical Officer for the city of Dublin, attacked this diphtheria problem with very great results.  The children throughout the city have been immunised over the years that I have mentioned, and so Deputies can see the results of that care in a reduction of the fatality rate from 12.5 in 1936 to nil in 1948.</P>
    <P>The Corporation of Dublin also launched a great attack on gastroenteritis with almost equally gratifying results.  All that goes to show that if our various problems are attacked with resolution and determination, and particularly if we start with the mother and child, and in the primary schools, that most wonderful results are possible.  I hope that, no matter what the financial stringency may be, the Minister for Health will insist that these services be extended and improved, and that when the various hospitals and institutions make little demands on his Department, that they will be met as generously as possible by the Department.  I am sure, in so far as the Minister's own inclination goes, that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I might give another instance of the value of these services which, I know, cost a little money.  I might mention the results of the use of streptomycin in cases of tubercular meningitis. Previously this disease was absolutely fatal, and there was no hope at all for the patient.  It is still a bit early to draw a general, final conclusion as to what will eventuate from the continued use of streptomycin, but we have found that it prolongs life to a marvellous extent.  So far, in the case of a disease that previously was absolutely fatal, since we introduced streptomycin we have found that we have been able to save from 30 to 50 per cent of the cases. Of course, that can only be done if we are prepared to undergo the expense, to provide the money and equipment necessary.  I hope the Department will show itself to be sympathetic and helpful and, above all, that it will not hold up the local authorities unnecessarily when requests of one sort or another come up for consideration.</P>
    <P>I have said that we found it difficult to keep the nursing staffs attached to our hospitals.  That will remain the <Col N="154" /> case until we give them as good treatment in our hospitals as they can get elsewhere.  There, again, I know the Minister is in full sympathy, but I will urge him to do everything possible to make life as pleasant as possible for the nurses in our institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate it is necessary for me, as a member of a local authority in Cork County, to bring to the Minister's notice how we have been affected, so far as a certain portion of that county is concerned, due to the fact that we have had to hand over our hospital at Mallow some 12 months ago for the care and treatment of tuberculosis.  At that time the Minister for Health gave the local authority a guarantee that he would do everything possible to meet their requirements so far as hospital accommodation is concerned.  Quite recently the Department of Health made known to the local authority that it was prepared to sanction the erection of one cottage hospital in North Cork.  We believed, at the time we handed over Mallow hospital, that we would be entitled to get two cottage hospitals in North Cork.  We discovered that during the past month the committee decided upon the erection of one hospital in order to comply with the Minister's demand and, apparently, that hospital is going to be erected in a certain area, which will leave the greater portion of the northern health area of Cork County without any hospital.</P>
      <P>I should like to impress on the Minister that, so far as the erection of one cottage hospital in North Cork is concerned, he should give very careful consideration to the demand put forward for the erection of two cottage hospitals, and, before he makes any decision, he should give particular consideration as to where these hospitals will be erected.  I believe the Minister has certain powers under the Public Health Act.  He can, I believe, order an inquiry to be held before any hospital is erected and I urge him to carry out such an inquiry, because I believe it is very necessary that one of the cottage hospitals should be erected in Charleville town, in North Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters I wish to bring to the notice of the House.  I wish, first of all, to protest against the attitude adopted by the Minister for Health, in company with the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Social Services, towards local authorities.  An official of a local authority is an official either of that authority or of the Local Government Department.  At practically every meeting of our local authority we have been inundated with circulars&mdash;they are tripping over one another&mdash;from the Minister's Department.  We are told in these circulars that the Minister has been requested by some local authorities to suggest that there would be no difficulty in getting sanction for an increase in salaries, or something else, every week.  I consider that attitude is the attitude of a dictator, and it is removing from local authorities any semblance of power left to them.</P>
      <P>If an official of a local authority has any complaint to make about his salary or anything else, let him make it to the local authority and look for whatever increase he wishes.  It should not come down from Dublin to the local authority. To my mind, it is completely ignoring the local authority concerned. My sole object in bringing that matter up here is to endeavour to end it by some means other than kicking up a row over it.  I had to make the same complaint in regard to the Department of Social Services last week.  It seems a set policy between all three Departments.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to deal with runs along different lines.  I wish to thank the Minister for the courteous manner in which he has received deputations from Cork during the past 12 months and I also wish to thank him for the decent manner in which he has treated us in regard to any grants or anything else we require.  I must say the Minister's attitude in these matters was most fair and courteous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McAuliffe alluded to Mallow Hospital, and I must say I am very much disappointed over the position as regards Mallow Hospital.  It was taken over by the Minister some 14 months ago.  At that time 20 of the beds in that hospital had to be occupied by <Col N="156" /> some of the nursing staff and arrangements were immediately made for the erection of a couple of military huts that would afford accommodation for the nursing staff and leave the beds available for patients.  To my amazement, at the meeting last week we found that that was the subject of a wrangle between the contractors and some officials of the Minister's Department. I am sure the Minister is interested enough in this matter to be anxious that the erection of a couple of military huts, in order to give accommodation to 20 patients in the hospital, should not be hanging fire for so long.</P>
    <P>Another thing I wish to deal with is that the Minister wrote to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance looking for any available accommodation that might be suitable for tubercular patients.  That was about 14 or 15 months ago.  He was then offered some buildings, one being the Macroom Fever Hospital.  That was then turned down, but now he has accepted, after the lapse of 14 months.  To my mind things like that should not occur.  I would appeal to the Minister to hand back the hospitals.  I would appeal to him to cut out the red tape.  I am sure he will admit that he has received every co-operation both from the board of assistance and from the county council in Cork.  I would urge him to let no red tape stand in the way of having these hospitals prepared as quickly as possible.  In Cork at the present moment we have between 70 and 80 tuberculous patients on a waiting list.  Having them on that list is practically condemning them to death. That is one reason why I am anxious these matters should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a rather free tongue as regards complaints of the previous Administration and the manner in which they operated.  On the 8th April, 1948, he said, in connection with the sanatorium at Sarsfield Court: &ldquo;I was asked shortly after my coming into office to sign a document relating to a letting to enable cattle and sheep to be grazed on the site.  That is an example of the rate of progress of the last Government.&rdquo;  That was a complaint made on the 8th April, 1948.  I <Col N="157" /> happened to pass by Sarsfield Court about a month ago and I saw there big hairy bullocks with long horns which would gladden the heart of the Minister for Agriculture.  This morning, having nothing else to do, I was looking over the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  I found the following advertisement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cork County Council.  Tenders for grazing.  Tenders are invited for the grazing of 59 acres, more or less, of the lands of Sarsfield Court, Glanmire, for a period of six months from 1st August, 1949 subject to termination by the Minister for Health on one month's notice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are back in the same position as we were in April, 1948.  The only difference is that the previous Administration certainly knew when to let.  They would not let land for grazing in the month of August.  That is the condition of affairs at the moment as regards Sarsfield Court.  When we gave the hospital over to the Minister on a five year letting we believed that he would do everything in his power to speed up the building of sanatoria at Sarsfield Court and elsewhere.  This delayed action on the part of the Minister and his Department is wrong. If it was wrong for the previous Administration it is equally wrong for the present Administration.  The previous Administration suffered under the disability that building materials were not available.  There is no excuse now for not going ahead with building. I appeal to the Minister to put an end to whatever wrangling is impending the erection of the huts at Mallow. Surely they should not be left hang fire for 14 months.  At least 20 patients out of the 76 on the waiting list could be provided with beds if these huts were erected.  Possibly their lives might be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the agreement about Mount Desert?  Did you not block the whole thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My job as a representative of the ratepayers in Cork is to protect the interests of the ratepayers by every means in my power. Since Deputy Keane has mentioned this matter, some years ago we made an agreement with the authorities of <Col N="158" /> Mount Desert under which we paid a sum of about £10,000 of the ratepayers money for a certain number of beds. The Minister was anxious to take it over.  He said he wanted it for children.  We offered nine beds for children.  Surely, that would not interfere with the scheme.  Apparently the Minister wanted to get the authorities in Mount Desert out of the financial bargain they had made with the ratepayers. As a representative of the ratepayers, it was my duty to protect their interests.  I have no apology to make for anything I did.  Deputy Keane will have an opportunity of explaining his side of the story.  That is the position as regards Mount Desert as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers that any action of ours is wrong, here and now is the time to bring us to heel.  It is my duty to protect the ratepayers, and I did that.  I object strenuously to the Minister saying that his predecessor did nothing and that he neglected this, that and the other, particularly when he, in turn, follows in the same beaten track without the justification that his predecessor had.  The emergency is finished now and opportunities for building are there.  It was impossible for the Minister's predecessor to carry on any building during the emergency. I expect the Minister to speed things up now.  I expect him to hand back those hospitals to the local authority as soon as he conveniently can.  We cannot afford delays at the present time.  There was a hold-up of practically six months in regard to the regional hospital and the maternity hospital in Cork.  The Minister was only a short time in office when he sent for the county manager and myself to discuss this matter with him.  We came up and discussed it with him and we were informed then that particulars in regard to the maternity hospital would be sent down the next week, but the whole matter was held up for six months.  We did not discover until after six months had passed that the Minister was negotiating with two bodies at the same time.  He was negotiating with Dr. O'Rahilly in University College, Cork, for some kind of hospital, and negotiating with us. Nobody knows who was responsible for <Col N="159" /> the hold-up but I think that responsibility for the delay in the provision of plans and specifications must be laid at the door of either Dr. O'Rahilly or the Minister&mdash;I do not know which. These are matters with which I should like the Minister to deal as quickly as possible so that there may be no further delay.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that after listening to Deputy Dr. Ryan this evening I must have developed a very bad complex.  I heard a most amazing account of a service that should be given but was not given and perhaps that will now be given.  I am not too sure whether I saw it in its proper perspective or not.  As chairman of the health committee for County Cork, which nobody will gainsay is one of the largest counties in the Republic of Ireland, I can state that from the time the present Minister took over the Department, he has speeded up everything appertaining to health by 100 per cent in my estimation.  I am not, nor do I think I should be expected to be, in a position to give statistics.  All I can give are approximate figures, but I can say that so far as tuberculosis is concerned in County Cork, we have increased the number of beds by 100 per cent.  I am sure Deputy Dr. Ryan will not contradict me when I say that when this Estimate was before the House last year we had a certain number of beds, and this year we have 100 per cent more and within one month, we shall have approximately 200 per cent more beds in Cork County. This is all due to the efforts of our young, energetic Minister, who handled the question as it should be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to enter into recriminations with regard to Deputy Dr. Ryan's statement.  I believe that Deputy Dr. Ryan did good work for the short time he was Minister for Health.  That is only what I would expect from Deputy Ryan, but unfortunately I am afraid that he never did handle the position as he should have handled it.  I am afraid that Deputy Dr. Ryan was a little too &ldquo;flaithiúilach.&rdquo;  I do not blame him; perhaps more blame should be attached to the brass hats of his Department <Col N="160" /> at that time.  Deputy Hickey has asked me are they there still.  I shall be charitable and say that the only way I can explain the matter is that a rose by any other name smells the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I should like to say a word in regard to the health regulations.  I am sure these regulations were drawn up with a view to a certain political idea.  I am afraid they were drawn up in the vortex of the general election campaign of 1947-48. However, it must be said for these regulations that there are some good points in them and also some very bad ones.  From time to time we have had occasion to send memos, to the present Minister with regard to these regulations and I must say that on every occasion he gave the matter brought to his attention his careful consideration. In 90 per cent. of the cases he gave us the interpretation we desired, namely, to benefit the individual without any consideration of saving to the State.  There were times when we had to send peculiar cases to him, cases that were not provided for in the hurriedly conceived regulations.  There was one particular case where a wife, who was the breadwinner of a family, developed tuberculosis.  An allowance, however, could not be made to her that could be made to her husband if he were the breadwinner.  In this case the husband was in receipt of workmen's compensation of 16/- per week and the wife was the breadwinner of the family.  Just because the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; was used instead of &ldquo;she&rdquo;, that woman could not get the allowance under the regulations of the Public Health Act.  I should like to bring that case to the notice of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to bring before <Col N="161" /> him the case of the district hospital in Mitchelstown.  This hospital was decided on at a recent meeting of the Northern Committee of the Cork Board of Health and Assistance.  There was a hospital there under the old British régime.  As a matter of fact, at that time there were a workhouse, a hospital and a fever hospital there. But, under the amalgamation scheme, these institutions were done away with and it was decided to build a hospital for Mitchelstown under the 1923 Local Government Act.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dr. Ryan speaking this evening about county hospitals and I think he was absolutely correct in what he said.  Whatever we may think of the old British régime, we must agree with the way in which they allocated their district hospitals.  The border hospitals established at that time were very convenient for the people.  I am sure the Minister, when considering the allocation of hospitals during the coming year, will give sympathetic consideration to the border hospitals for Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have listened from time to time here to references to the proposed regional hospital in Sarsfield Court, Cork.  I am sorry Deputy Corry is not here.  He is the man who prevented the hospital from being built there.  He came in here to-night and spoke with another voice.  But at a meeting of the health committee of Cork County Council, when the Minister asked us if we would agree to abrogate an agreement by which we would benefit to the extent of about £15,000, Deputy Corry, the full-back of the Fianna Fáil Party, the obstructionist in word and in deed, was there to stop it.  I am afraid that the Minister, in starting off in his campaign, will be beset by a lot of traps. The people who prepare the traps are the people on the Opposition side of the House.  I make that statement and have no apology to give for making it, and if any of them like to contradict me let them do so.  I can start from the Chest Hospital in Mallow to St. Colman's Hospital in Macroom at the moment.  All those who were so solicitous about the health of the people put traps and snares in front of the <Col N="162" /> Minister and put every obstacle in his way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, the &ldquo;bulavauny&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Party is the gentleman who thinks at all times that he can attack everybody.  I wonder if he remembers what happened at Cork County Council last April 12 months? If he does I am sure he will be the very last man to talk about the efforts of the Minister in trying to do his best to improve the health of the people.  Last week in Cork, Deputy Corry, fortified with the knowledge of the Managerial Act, attacked the county manager for making a special order to provide alternative medical services for Cork County Home when the resident medical surgeon was absent or on holidays.  Incidentally, he claimed that he was perfectly right in doing that because Mr. Joseph Wrenn, before he made his order, did not consult with the mental hospital committee.  I wonder if Deputy Corry took into consideration what would happen the 1,500 lunatics if this order had not been implemented and if the doctors concerned did not take up their jobs.  I am sure he is so solicitous regarding the ratepayers of Cork County that he gave every consideration to that before he made his famous speech, where he proved that there was about one-sixteenth of a farthing in the £ difference between what the medical officer should get and what Deputy Corry would give him.  I am very sorry he has gone to-night out of this House.  He never listened to the truth and never will listen to it.  He always ran away from it and will always run away from it.  I make that statement here to-night and he can contradict it any time he likes.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to give every consideration to the district hospital for Mitchelstown which will provide for the needs of the old No. 2 district rural area, with which I am sure the Minister is conversant, that is, on the Limerick side of it.  I would ask him also to give his attention to the memos. sent up to him by the Cork Health Committee regarding the health regulations. Whilst he has given every consideration and has removed some anomalies, I would ask him to review the matter and make an effort to help <Col N="163" /> the recipients to get what they should get.</P>
    <P>In regard to Mallow Chest Hospital, I would suggest to the Minister to give every consideration to the recommendation of the sanatorium committee of Cork County in awarding Dr. O'Leary and Dr. Condron £200 extra.  Those two men have done more for the prevention and cure of tuberculosis in Cork County than any other two men in the Republic of Ireland at the moment.  I am sure also the Minister will look after the salaries of the lowerlevel officials under his control.  I refer to attendants and nurses.  Undoubtedly, he has made amazing improvements in their salaries, but I firmly believe there is still a lot to be done to give them the remuneration to which they are justly entitled.  I am sure that the Minister, irrespective of the opinion of certain bodies, irrespective of the statements that were made here with regard to dictatorship, will give every consideration to the salaries of those people and will step them up proportionately and make them attractive so that in future we will not have to look for attendants or nurses.  I will conclude by saying that I hope, if I should be here in 1950, that I will be in a position to pay the same credit to the Minister for Health as I have paid to him this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  The first is in regard to the most inadequate accommodation that is provided in dispensaries in rural districts.  Patients who are compelled to attend the dispensary have in some cases to remain outside what is called a dispensary, perhaps in rain and certainly in the cold.  To my mind that is nothing short of a disgrace. People who are compelled to attend dispensaries once a week, people suffering from ill-health in some form or another, people who have to attend there in order to qualify for certain moneys to which they are entitled at least expect to have a waiting-room with proper seating accommodation and heating.  I would ask the Minister to facilitate local authorities in every way he can, by financial support and otherwise, <Col N="164" /> to ensure that proper accommodation will be provided in dispensaries in all areas even to the extent of providing new dispensaries where the present dispensaries are unsuitable or are incapable of reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of hospitalisation generally, we in the County Wicklow have been looking for a county hospital for quite a number of years.  For certain reasons, when the going was good, pre-war, I suppose those responsible were not quick enough off their mark and other counties got in before them but, at last, we have reached a stage where a county hospital for Wicklow has been decided upon and a site has been acquired.  Fourteen months ago the Minister paid a visit to the Wicklow County Council to discuss hospitalisation and other matters connected with his Department and heard the question of the county hospital discussed.  He was well received by all Parties and I think he was convinced that the council, as a council, irrespective of Party, wanted to give every help they could to the Minister in order to provide the necessary hospitalisation for the county.  At that conference, if I may so describe it, during the discussion on the county hospital and the proposed fever hospital, reference was made to the Baltinglass Hospital which serves the western and southern portion of the county.  While, as I have said, the county hospital had been agreed upon and a site acquired, nevertheless the project is still in abeyance and will remain in that condition until such time as a proper water supply is provided for the area in which it is proposed to erect the hospital.  In the case of the Baltinglass Hospital a scheme had been planned and four or five years ago, when the matter was discussed with him, the proposed scheme was agreed upon by the then Parliamentary Secretary.  Plans were prepared by the county engineer. When the plans were prepared the council were informed by the Department that the proper person to prepare drawings, and so forth, for the particular work concerned was an architect &mdash;a statement and a ruling with which I perfectly agree.  Since then, drawings have been in course of preparation. <Col N="165" /> From time to time individuals from that portion of the county interested in the Baltinglass hospital&mdash;as I am very much interested in it myself&mdash; raised questions about the work that was proposed to be carried out there &mdash;when would the plans be ready and when was the work going to start, and questions of a similar nature.  But changes in plans and delays of one kind or another delayed the whole matter until about seven or eight months ago.</P>
    <P>About seven or eight months ago I, as one member of a sub-committee appointed by the Wicklow County Council, met the architects' representatives at Baltinglass hospital to inspect the drawings and plans in general of the proposed works.  Certain modifications were suggested and the plans were brought back but, apparently, the modifications suggested had not the sanction of the architects of the Department.  That was eight months ago and even up to the present time we are still waiting for whatever revision the architects of the Department insist on having in those plans. We are still waiting to hear that the plans have been sanctioned by the Department so that the work can go ahead.  I maintain that it is absolutely essential that if there is any dilly-dallying&mdash;and I can assure the Minister that those of us who are members of that council have definitely come to the conclusion that there is some ulterior motive for holding up the sanction of the plans and thus enable this work to be proceeded with&mdash;that dilly-dallying should end.  To my mind, anyhow, if, after eight months, there are still no definite plans for this job&mdash;or at least plans that will receive the definite sanction of the Minister or the O.K. of the senior officer in the architectural world, so far as the Department is concerned&mdash;it is a strange state of affairs.  I do not believe for one moment that in respect of the period that has elapsed since the meeting of that sub-committee with the architects' representatives to discuss the drawings and plans prepared at the time, whatever little revision was needed by the Department should have taken eight months to put on paper.  This hospital is looked upon by the people of West <Col N="166" /> and South Wicklow as an outstanding institution.  The medical officer in charge of that hospital is looked upon by these people as an outstanding medical man.  He is a man who devotes his whole time to his work.  He is a man who is prepared to take on a certain type of work that is really not his job, I understand, as medical officer at Baltinglass hospital.  Because he is a man who has a love for his work and because he is a man who has proved himself a success in his work, the Minister should bring pressure to bear upon those responsible for withholding the sanction, if it is so, in respect of the drawings and plans necessary for the carrying out of this essential work.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bring pressure to bear on those people in order that the community as a whole in the area covered by this hospital shall reap the benefit of the facilities to be given under these proposed annexes and so forth, that the nursing staff will get the accommodation that they need and, in particular, that that medical officer, Dr. Lyons, be placed in a position whereby he can carry out his work with complete satisfaction to himself and with complete satisfaction to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in this House to-night to Newcastle Sanatorium and to works that are being executed there in order to provide a certain number of beds.  I am not going to discuss the general work in the sanatorium in regard to the provision of beds but I should like to mention a point in regard to the nurses' home which it was proposed to build on the site in order to provide proper housing accommodation for the nursing staff.  By way of temporary accommodation a particular property was acquired, the house of this property being a distance of approximately one and a half miles from the sanatorium buildings.  A sum of money to the extent of £10,000 was paid for this property and, towards that £10,000, a grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund to the extent of £7,500 was given&mdash; which, of course, the Minister sanctioned. What I would like to know from the Minister is whether this home which at present houses the nursing staff of Newcastle Sanatorium is only a temporary accommodation and, if so, <Col N="167" /> when the nurses' home that is to be erected has been completed and occupied, what does the Minister or the people concerned with this property, acquired for the abnormal sum of £10,000, of which £7,500 came as a free grant, intend to do.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to answer that question because it seems to me that the outlay of £10,000 for temporary accommodation is abnormal and I think some explanation is due to the general public when such a sum is spent and a grant towards it of £7,500 is sanctioned by the Minister which, to my mind, could be diverted to some other area or towards some more deserving object in County Wicklow.  Of course the general public have their own view about that expenditure and I can assure the Minister that their comments are of anything but a complimentary nature to all parties concerned who were prepared to spend £10,000 on the acquisition of that property.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I would like to refer, the question of religious orders in charge of institutions.  There seems to be of late a tendency to decry and belittle the work carried out by religious communities. The religious communities who carry out nursing work deserve, I think, more from the public than that individuals or groups of individuals should strive to belittle them.  I know that even in my own county when in preparation of the potential staff for the county hospital a suggestion was thrown out&mdash;no doubt both sides of the question were put to us for our view &mdash;by an irresponsible officer that that institution whenever it is erected should be staffed by lay nurses.  While I am a member of that council I will certainly oppose that suggestion as far as I possibly can.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to say except to ask the Minister to give us the information when he is replying.  It may not come to the Minister's ears but it is information in which the general public in the area have an interest.  The information I want is whether the present property <Col N="168" /> acquired for that abnormal sum is to be of only a temporary nature and if so what is the intention of the Minister or of those who can claim control over the property as to its disposal or use when the nursing home is completed and occupied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his outline here last Friday gave some particulars of the proposals for the coming seven years for building hospitals.  He told us in January this year that hospital building to the extent of £500,000 or £600,000 annually was in progress and he hoped to step that up before the end of the present year.  It is now July and the Minister might well tell us what progress has been made in commencing works which were not commenced in January.  The rate of building, from information I got in respect of a couple of those institutions, is very slow and I am afraid that the progress and output of beds per annum in any foreseeable time is going to be very slow.  In spite of anything the Minister can do to push on matters, he is not going to get a big lot of new beds in a short period. Assuming the beds will cost about £3,000 per bed, the Minister can estimate that £500,000 will not get him very far and that it will take him three or four years to build the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> Unless you can get the £2,000,000 programme into operation immediately the output of beds in the next few years is going to be very low.  I understand that materials are now in good supply for hospitals, in most respects, and the Minister should press on much faster with the work. Even with a £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 scheme in operation the Minister's output of beds would not be very appreciable in the next five or six years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be afraid to start on his schemes because it will take him a long time to finish the work. No matter how many units are started over the country they could not ensure the building of the hospitals by local authorities.  If, however, a number of units were started simultaneously spread over the whole country from Donegal to Cork and from Kerry to the East coast the Minister would have some chance of getting the bulk of what he must do done within a certain period of years.  Certainly if he cannot get a greater bulk than the £500,000 a year started this year in the matter of hospitals he is going to have a very small output.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Minister stated that an additional 1,200 beds had been provided this year for the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis.  He did not, however, tell the House how many of these beds were provided in new hospitals.  I doubt if any of them were provided in new buildings at all, but believe that they were put into existing buildings which were reconditioned or refurnished. So far as I can see I do not think that he told the House that work had been started on any of the new sanatoria. The foundations have been put in in connection with the one in Galway, but, apart from this, little else appears to have been started.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that it will be quite a long time before we see these three regional sanatoria completed, as it will take a minimum of five years from the time they are started until they are completed.  I wonder if I am right in that calculation?  We can, of course, all see the difficulties the Minister is up against at the present time in <Col N="170" /> getting very large buildings like these sanatoria started.  The Minister must admit, however, that quite a considerable time has been devoted to the question of building these sanatoria and they have been a live issue in the country for a number of years now. Everybody would like to see progress being made in getting them under way.</P>
    <P>Local authorities throughout the country seem to think that they have serious cause for complaint against the Department in one particular direction. In the provision of the 1,200 additional beds, to which the Minister referred, the Minister insisted on the local authority in Wexford using the recreation rooms, in the small sanatorium there for the provision of extra beds. While these extra beds are undoubtedly of importance I question whether the taking away of the recreation facilities from the patients, who have to stay in the sanatorium, is the best means of providing the accommodation.  A further cause of complaint is that no additional capital expenditure is allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am trying to explain that I disagree with the Minister's policy of taking away these recreation facilities for the provision of these beds.  It should not be done in that way.  The Wexford County Council have no objection to providing the beds, and are willing to do it, but they do not like to see the patients' amenities taken away in doing that work.</P>
      <P>According to my information the local authorities can get no grants from the Hospitals' Trust Fund for the provision of these beds.  If it is the policy of the Department to increase the bed accommodation for tuberculous patients that should be a first call on the Hospitals' Trust Fund, and the capital expenditure which local authorities will undertake.  I do not see anything wrong about that.  Local authorities have in the past been providing these institutions and getting a full grant for tuberculosis and 75 per cent. grants for medical health institutions.  I think the Minister would be wrong in refusing to give grants to local authorities who are prepared to undertake capital expenditure in the matter of extra accommodation for tuberculosis purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Additional expenditure of a capital nature, of whatever type it might be, should be provided <Col N="172" /> in full, I suggest, and should rank as as a first charge on those funds.</P>
      <P>With regard to the operation of the Health Act, only portion of the Act is in operation yet and, generally speaking, it has operated pretty smoothly. There were difficulties about the allowances to patients suffering from contagious diseases, but on the whole things worked reasonably smoothly, notwithstanding the fact&mdash;and this should be appreciated in the Department as in other Government Departments&mdash;that local authorities and their staffs are now working under three Ministries.  Up to a year or two ago, there was only one Minister, but now they have to contend with three, each pressing to have his own particular branch of the work given first preference and the full attention of these staffs.  There is the Minister for Health, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Social Welfare, each pressing to have his own particular work in a local authority area looked after and given the attention of the staffs.  That is unfair and has created any difficulties which local authorities have had in the past year.</P>
      <P>The fact that they have to work under three separate Ministries has created problems for the local authorities. It means increasing their clerical staffs and creates other difficulties also and I hope the Minister will keep that in mind.  The Minister's work is all important and needs looking after, I agree, but the work of the Minister for Local Government, especially in the matter of the provision of houses, making roads and similar services, needs looking after also.  Local authorities are limited in the numbers of their staffs.  The tendency has been to increase them down the years, and, if there is very heavy pressure from any of these Ministries, it means a further increase in staffs and a further increase in rates.  The grants under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act will very soon run out and local authorities are going to find, in the course of a few years, that they are footing the bill again.</P>

      <P>The margin will be eaten up before the local authorities know where they are, and, with the increasing demands on the rates in other directions, the Minister will find that local authorities, when they have to pay their portion again in the very near future, will be very slow to increase these services.  The matter needs great care from both the angle of the Minister's Department and of the local authorities to see that the burden on the ratepayers is not made greater than they can bear.  That is the general fear amongst most local authorities, that, within a very short period, they will reach a stage at which a burden will be imposed on them which they may be unable to bear. That is the difficulty which local authorities are facing at present.</P>
      <P>I cannot see in the Minister's statement any reference to rheumatism and to the provision of treatment for rheumatism and rheumatic diseases.  I saw returns quite recently in respect of national health insurance and I found that the number of days lost by people suffering from different rheumatic complaints was very high. The incidence of rheumatism in this country, due to the damp climate, is, unfortunately, higher than in most other countries, and the Minister might tell the House how the rheumatism clinic in Mount street is progressing and whether it is intended, as I believe it was intended by the Minister's predecessor, to have similar clinics in Cork, Galway and other centres.  Is it the intention to open similar clinics in these centres; and, if so, will they be opened in the near future?  There is a growing demand all through the country for treatment for rheumatic complaints, and, but for the fact that the past 12 months have been so dry and fine, the demand would be even greater.  I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for getting something done in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time during the past year I <Col N="174" /> had occasion to complain that the Minister's Department had adopted a very undesirable policy of according prior sanction and notifying local authorities of prior sanction to increases in salaries and wages.  We hear a lot about democracy and democratic institutions in this House and from platforms down the country, but the Minister will agree that that is anything but a democratic way of doing business.  As I said before, there may be a reason and these increases in salaries and wages to staffs of local authorities may be necessary and desirable, but often the first a local authority hears of them is when a letter is received from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Health informing them that, if they provide the money, they may pay increased salaries or wages to certain members of their staffs.  That is putting the cart before the horse.  It is time enough for the Minister to sanction them when the proposals are put up by the county manager or county council or other local authority concerned.</P>
