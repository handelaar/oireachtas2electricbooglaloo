      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state how persons registered at an employment exchange are selected for notification for attendance for work under minor relief schemes and if in such selection there is any priority given to married as against single men and to landless men as against men with land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, point out, in the first instance, that my Department's functions in connection with the provision of workers for minor employment schemes are limited to the submission by its local officers of names of apparently suitable men.  The names are listed in the order of the men's rates of unemployment assistance, and the selection from these lists of the workers to be employed is a matter for the employing authority.</P>
      <P>The order in which names appear in the lists submitted by my Department is not directly based on whether or not a man is married or is the owner or occupier of land, but an applicant's means and the number of his dependents affect the rate of unemployment assistance payable, and to that extent the factors mentioned reflect the circumstances of the applicants on the lists submitted.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the text books in Irish, English, Latin and French prescribed for the Intermediate Certificate course and for the <Col N="167" /> Leaving Certificate course vary from year to year and that the purchase of the different series of books is a serious burden on many parents; and, if so, whether he will have the position examined with a view to arranging that standard books shall be prescribed in the several language courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In selecting texts for the secondary school language courses my Department has borne in mind the question of keeping the costs to parents of the purchase of these texts as low as possible.  From the educational point of view, however, it is not desirable to prescribe the same texts from year to year.  Having regard to these two factors, the Department has for the most part prescribed a three year rotation of standard text books for the different languages.  In the case of Latin, however, the rotation is a four year one but, on the other hand, in the case of English and French poetry and English prose the rotation is such as to permit of the same text books being used year after year.  As regards Irish, while there is not a prescribed rotation of prose texts, the same texts have, in fact, been repeated several times.  The effect of this system of rotations is that the same texts are repeated at regular intervals and that the expenditure on books, particularly for different members of the same family, is kept at a minimum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that national teachers find it impossible to procure the services of junior assistant mistresses in backward areas; and that the principal reason for this state of affairs is the low remuneration of junior assistant mistresses and the increased cost of board and lodging in these areas; and, if so, whether he will take immediate remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, owing to the shortage of qualified persons, managers of schools have, in a number of cases, found difficulty in obtaining the services of qualified <Col N="168" /> junior assistant mistresses for vacancies in schools under their management. The situation in this respect is under constant review in the Department and it is expected that the position will improve when the results of this year's competition for junior assistant mistresses, based on oral and practical tests already held in Easter week and on the Leaving Certificate examination to be held in June, come to hand. Meanwhile, the Department is willing to consider favourably proposals from managers for the temporary appointment, until such time as qualified persons become available, of girls who have passed the Leaving Certificate examination within the last few years. I do not know if it is generally understood that trained teachers are eligible for recognition as junior assistant mistresses and that they receive the full-trained teacher's salary therefor up to the sixth increment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Attention is already paid in national schools to the instruction of the pupils in road safety and circulars have been issued by the Department from time to time emphasising the necessity of training the pupils to realise the dangers arising, <i>inter alia</i>, from road traffic.  I have, however, at present under consideration the question of whether suitable steps cannot be taken to make more adequate provision for such training. I have recently discussed the matter with representatives of the Safety First Association in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Moral training, which is the foundation of civics, is adequately provided for in the schools and is regarded as fundamental to the whole course of instruction there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that a farm <Col N="169" /> of land the property of Mr. Stenson, comprising approximately 100 acres, including turbary, and situate at Cloonfaulis, Kilkelly, County Mayo (Lord Dillon's estate), is advertised for sale; that the owner of these lands has been in England for a number of years, and that there is acute congestion in the area; and, if so, whether he will arrange for the Land Commission to acquire these lands forthwith for the relief of the local congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that a large farm the property of Mrs. Winters, Dooeighney, Castleconner, Ballina, County Mayo, was sold recently; and, if so, whether he will state if the Land Commission will proceed to have it acquired for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 7 and 14 together.  These two questions suggest that the mere fact that a holding is offered for sale is a sufficient reason for the Land Commission to start proceedings for acquisition.  If the Land Commission took such action it would be a definite interference with free sale.</P>
      <P>Such action, while coming to the assistance of a few, would imperil the many.  It would endanger, if not actually destroy, the splendid title&mdash;the best in the world&mdash;which is conferred on each tenant on the vesting in him of his lands and for which the tenant farmers of this country have been struggling for hundreds of years.  I have asked the Land Commission to take immediate steps to relieve the congestion in the areas mentioned in these two questions, and the Deputies can rest assured that neither time nor opportunity will be lost in coming to the relief of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that of late years a widespread demand has arisen desiring the Land Commission to buy holdings and farms when offered for sale or about to be offered for sale, particularly in congested areas.  The present land law does not permit the Land Commission to do so.  I hope that a certain <Col N="170" /> section of the new Land Bill, which is being drafted at the moment, will meet the wishes of the House on this subject, and I will be glad of that opportunity for a free open discussion on this question of an owner's fundamental right to sell his property to whomsoever he wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not a rule of the Land Commission to acquire lands for the relief of congestion where the owners had them sublet and were living away from these lands for a number of years?  That being the position in the case indicated in Question No. 7, why will not the Land Commission acquire those lands?  They have been sublet for a number of years and left derelict by the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not state whether the Land Commission would or would not acquire the farms mentioned in Deputy Moran's or Deputy Commons' questions.  I take this opportunity to make clear to the House and to the country generally a position which has arisen, or which has been taking place for quite a number of years past and which definitely needs clarification.  I have stated in the reply that the question of relieving congestion is one which devolves on the Land Commission. It is quite all right for a Deputy to bring to the notice of the Land Commission a question of congestion in a particular area, but it would be very wrong for any Deputy to dictate to the Land Commission how that particular question may be solved.  That must be left at the discretion of the Land Commission in each particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that in the case mentioned in Question 14 the Land Commission first inspected this farm, or were supposed to have inspected this farm, some 12 years ago.  If the Land Commission was doing its duty there would be no need to raise those questions now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that a holding of land the property of Michael Ginnelly, Glenisland, Castlebar, has been vacant for a great number of <Col N="171" /> years; and, if so, whether he will take steps to have it acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The question would appear to refer to the holding of Michael Ginnelly in the townland of Lenasillagh.  The Land Commission have no proceedings for the acquisition of these lands but the matter is noted for inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that these lands will be taken by the Land Commission and that he will not allow them to be sold by public auction perhaps to somebody in England, as in a former case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give such an assurance because it would be interfering with the independence of the commissioners.  If I could give such an assurance there would be no need for the commissioners because then the determination of a farm would devolve on the Minister.</P>

      <P>The preparation of a special return of this nature would involve an unjustifiable expenditure of time and labour.

      <P>The Land Commission report for the previous 12 months has been circulated already in accordance with the custom.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the number of labourers employed by the Land Commission in January, 1948, and January, 1949, respectively, in (a) County Mayo, and (b) the rest of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars required by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash; January, 1948: 146 labourers were employed in County Mayo and 1,260 in the remainder of the State.  January, 1949: 41 labourers were employed in County Mayo and 529 in the remainder of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the numbers employed in the month of January in any year are not a fair index of employment throughout the year.  In actual fact, as I stated in reply to a recent question by Deputy Beegan, the average number of labourers employed during the year ended 31st December, 1948, was 1,593, compared with 1,055 during the year ended 31st December, 1947.  Weather conditions naturally affect the number employed at any particular time, and for that reason the month of January <Col N="173" /> is perhaps the worst month to take as an index to the trend of employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that for 1947, the last year for which figures are available, the estimated income of each person gainfully occupied in agriculture was £165; and, if so, whether he will state what steps he has taken to increase that low annual income.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the average income per person gainfully occupied in agriculture in 1947 has been estimated at approximately £165.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I would mention the following in particular: Last year's Trade Agreement with Great Britain; the recent Egg Agreement with Great Britain; the arrangements made for the import of greatly increased supplies of fertilisers and feeding stuffs; and the recently announced land reclamation scheme.  Some of these measures <Col N="176" /> have already brought about substantial increases in production and exports.</P>
    <P>This country's long term programme, in connection with the European Recovery Programme, envisages an increase of 22 per cent. in the volume of agricultural production in 1952/53 compared with 1947.  Our export programme for the year 1952/53 represents an increase in the volume of agricultural exports of over 100 per cent. compared with 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the House last night I was speaking on the question of the acquisition of land for forestry being the greatest difficulty. I am aware of the difficulty in <Col N="192" /> the fulfilment of the programme, of which the House and the country are already aware, of planting 25,000 acres at least.  Many Deputies seem to fear the provision of the 1946 Act, which allows the Department of Forestry to use compulsory powers for the acquisition of land.  They pressed on me the need that I should step carefully and warily in acquisition.  They were really pushing an open door, because I consider that in most cases the finding of suitable land for forestry acquisition will be dependent on the small farmer rather than the big farmer.</P>
      <P>When I say small farmers, I mean farmers with a low valuation who have land in mountainous areas.  While their acreage might be fairly large, and in some cases extremely large, the quality of the land is poor and the poor law valuation, as I am sure most Deputies familiar with these districts know, is small.  For that reason I do not propose to use compulsion except in extreme cases or in cases, for instance, where a number of tenants&mdash;eight, ten or 15 tenants&mdash;have a right of commonage and where the vast majority of them are anxious to sell their interests in that commonage.  If I find in a case like that that one or two are objecting, just through peevishness or for some other cause, we would have to consider using compulsion on the one or two objectors.  Even in such cases as that, there is provision for striping the commonage, so to speak, leaving the one or two objectors their share of the commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens in a great many cases is that one or two landowners living near the commonage enjoy the full benefit of it to the exclusion of their neighbours living further away who have equal rights to that commonage. At least, that occurs in many cases in the West.  To meet such a situation where you might have 12 to 15 small farmers having a right of commonage and where, say, 14 of them were willing to sell while one of them is objecting to sell, it might be necessary to use compulsory methods, but even in that case I would be very slow to use compulsion. It may be necessary to cut off one-fifteenth part of the commonage and leave it in enjoyment of the person <Col N="193" /> who does not wish to sell, and take over the remainder of the commonage. Taking it by and large, I am opposed to compulsion although some Deputies seem to think that compulsion should be used for the purpose of getting our programme fulfilled.  I think that would be very dangerous because we have a peculiar system of land tenure in this country.  To establish that system much blood was spilt.  The fight for the establishment of that system brought to the forefront men such as Davitt, Dillon and Parnell, who devoted their whole lives to the struggle to secure peasant proprietorship.  I do not think any Irish Government would seek to undo or to endanger that right which the tenants now have.</P>
    <P>I do not want Deputies, however, to get it into their heads that we are going to stand back in any way in our efforts to get suitable land for forestry. We are going to offer every inducement to people who have suitable forestry land, particularly in mountainous areas, to sell us that land.  I have no doubt that the people living in those areas will be prepared to make us offers of suitable land even though agricultural prices are higher than they were ever offered before.  For that reason it is hard to expect people to part with their land easily.  Nevertheless, I want to say that there is a keen desire amongst people in all parts of the country to make such land available for forestry purposes.  As a matter of fact, offers are starting to come in from many parts of the country.  Since I announced the 25,000-acre programme some months ago, offers are pouring in, so much so that at the moment we find that our inspectorial staff is insufficient to deal with all these offers.  Some Deputies mentioned that we were taking offers rather carelessly and that we were not sending out inspectors to investigate them.  The real truth of the matter is that we have not a sufficient staff to deal with the number of offers coming in at the moment.</P>
    <P>I might point out at this stage that up to the time of the change of Government there was a great deal of talk about forestry and about the area available for forestry.  Some mentioned 1,000,000 acres, others said there <Col N="194" /> were 3,000,000, while more said there were 7,000,000, and men who had given a good deal of thought to the problem and who had read a lot about it could only make just a vague guess.  Just shortly after I came into office I asked the Forestry Department to set about making a survey of land suitable and available for forestry all over the country.  When I say &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; land I want Deputies to realise that all suitable land may not come into our hands or may not be offered to us. There are many landowners who may not be willing to sell suitable land, but the survey is fairly well advanced and I hope to have it completed by September or October.  While it may not be extremely accurate, nevertheless it will be able to give us once and for all an idea of how much land is suitable for forestry.  After that, when we see what offers are made, we can approach the owners and ask them to sell the land to us.</P>

It will be on view in the offices of the Forestry Department or else I might make it available here in the House, in the Library or elsewhere, for Deputies together with such detailed information as Deputies who are keenly interested in forestry may wish to have.  When that survey is completed it will give us a fairly good idea of the acreage we have.  I should like to say, even though Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy propose that even arable land should be put under forestry, that I hold that food production should take first place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>By all means.  As a matter of fact, I am looking forward to, though I may not see the day, when <Col N="195" /> the State will have a pretty large area of forests situated in the right places so as to give employment and so as to provide, if possible, the full needs of the home market with home-grown timber, properly seasoned, cut and prepared by experts.  Forests so situated are of material assistance to arterial drainage.  These mountain sides and mountain slopes are at present nothing but receptacles for heavy rainfall, causing flooding and damage in the lowlands.  The areas which have been denuded of forests in the past have left us with a problem of drainage which is costing many thousands of pounds to solve at the moment.  I take pride in the fact that I am as bad a fanatic for forestry as anyone in this House, if not the worst fanatic.  I am anxious to see the full programme of 25,000 acres per year completed.  At the same time, we must bear in mind that most of the landowners who have suitable forest land own it as of right and while I should like to see afforestation going ahead and intend to use every means to further it, I should not like to see the desire to acquire land for forestry being used as the thin end of the wedge to interfere with the good solid title and tenure of the tenant farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this clear.  If the Forestry Department once gives an inkling to the people, or if the people who own forest land once get it into their heads that the Minister is going to deprive them of that land whether they like it or not, it may have the effect of stiffening their resistance to such a point that it would kill the work of reafforestation on any large scale. In other words, this problem has to be handled very carefully.  Several Deputies mentioned that a better price should be paid for the land.  I have made it known that I intend to pay a better price as an inducement to get land.  I hope, and I have not any doubt, that we shall be able to get sufficient land to enable us to carry out the 25,000-acre programme although it is a pretty stiff one.  In order to plant 25,000 acres per year, about 30,000 acres or 33,000 acres will have <Col N="196" /> to be purchased, because all land that is purchased is not plantable.  Take a mountain-top with a certain contour. Just to give the House an idea of the total acreage which must be purchased, I might point out that up to the present 150,000 acres have been purchased for the purpose of forestry.  One hundred and twenty thousand acres have been planted and slightly more than 30,000 acres are unplanted or, at least, have been deemed unplantable up to now. With our increasing knowledge of forestry, we might be able to steal 2,000 or 10,000 acres out of that block of 30,000 unplantable acres, according as experience shows that certain species will develop on land which was hitherto reckoned as a dead loss.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan seemed to be in doubt last night as to the future programme. I may not have been sufficiently clear in my opening statement last night.  We have the land to plant 25,000 acres next year, if we had the plants.  Even if we had the plants, it would not be desirable to plant all the land.  In the last three or four months, since the Government definitely decided on a 25,000-acre programme, an all-out drive has been carried on to get in land.  It is always wise to have at least double the amount of land in hand, so as to provide for the amount to be selected.  The land has to be spied out and it takes a good deal of time and experience to determine the best type of timber to grow on it.  One has to be very careful in these matters, so that the failures may form only a very small percentage.  The officials deserve a good deal of credit up to this, as the percentage failure has been very small.  It shows they gave great attention to the selection of the trees for each particular kind of land and that, in spending the taxpayers' money in the creation of forest they were not prodigal or spending money heedlessly. The programme next year will be for about 10,000 acres.</P>

      <P>What I describe as the 1949-50 season.  Planting for some species may begin in October and we <Col N="197" /> can plant other species up to the last day of May.  Severe frost&mdash;such as we had two years ago and which occurs practically every winter&mdash;destroys many of the young transplants.  We may start at the nurseries in October with sufficient for 10,000 acres and may find a terrific frost kills many of less vigorous plants, just as if stock broke in and destroyed them.</P>
      <P>The obtaining of land is a slow process and has to be dealt with carefully. Those with legal knowledge realise that the getting of good sound title is not as easy or as quick as we would like it to be.  On many occasions, we may be very keen on a particular 500 acres or a larger area and when we go to take it over we find there are impediments and burdens, old wills and titles never properly cleared up.  We must do that or insist on the owner doing it.  Sometimes the owner puts his foot down and tells us to take the land as it is or do without it.  We are not like private individuals who might burn their fingers if they wish, as they are spending their own money; we are using the taxpayers' money and must be sure of a sound title.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are methods of short-circuiting, but I do not know if they are desirable.  This holds up the Land Commission to a great extent and the Forestry Department as well.  The Land Commission have to be still more careful; the Forestry Department takes land and holds it for the State, but the Land Commission must hand it over with a completely free and clean title to the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year some 4,000 lbs. of seeds were put down.  The seeds do not always come up to the germination tests or produce the number of plants anticipated. In some areas only half the seeds may produce transplants, while in other areas there may be only one out of ten.  The conifer variety produces 190,000 seeds to the lb., but the number that can be produced from that may be only 10,000 or 12,000.  Some years you get good returns and other years you do not.  It is in a very fluid <Col N="198" /> state and you cannot be sure of it.  We find there are frost, bad germination, delay in land acquisition and weather conditions to contend with.  When I set a target of 25,000 acres I am not setting that goal for the purpose of falling short of it: I have every hope that it will be reached and some anticipation that it may be passed in some years.  However, I hope it will be maintained steadily.  If we do that for 12 years it will make a terrific change in the country and all its benefits, including employment, will be seen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen and Deputy Kennedy surprised me last night.  Since they, went to the other side of the House I have not known more liberal-handed men than they.  They want to pour out money and spend at a terrific rate. There is no need to impress on this Government the need to pour money out in the proper directions.  As a matter of fact, it was not through pressure from the other side of the House that the forestry programme was started.  Deputy Allen is particularly keen on growing hardwoods and he says there is a scarcity of them. The truth is that 90 to 95 per cent. of the timber demands of this country is for softwood.  That disposes of the idea that there is not sufficient hardwood. The Forestry Department do not say: &ldquo;We will sow in this year 2,000 acres of hardwood and so many acres of softwood&rdquo;.  Whatever land is available is used according to their skill and judgment for the species of timber that will grow best on it.  If they do not get land suitable for hardwood, they do not plant hardwood, and it would be wrong for them to do so. Nevertheless, there is a good percentage of hardwood up and down the country.  I have not the exact figures, but I believe there is no danger of a shortage of hardwood.  A good deal was cut down for firewood during the emergency, but not in sufficient quantity to endanger the supply of hardwood for ordinary usage at present.  I hear no complaints about that point.</P>
    <P>A good deal of confusion seems to have arisen about the supposed clash between the interests of forestry and <Col N="199" /> the new land reclamation scheme outlined by the Minister for Agriculture. In case I did not explain it last night, may I say now that there is no need for a clash there?  The policy of the present Government is that land reclamation uses up arable and semi-arable land up to a certain point and from that point the forestry scheme comes in.  There is no need for me to encroach on the work of the Minister for Agriculture, or for him to encroach on mine.  It would scarcely be profitable, in my opinion, to use public money in trying to reclaim a particular type of land which will grow excellent timber forest.  Nature dominates most areas and shows her hand plainly in most areas.  While it can be said that land could be reclaimed at very high or prohibitive cost, it would not be profitable while we could grow a good crop of timber on the same land with little or no trouble.  If there is a fight or a battle with Mother Nature in one area, let us use one of Mother Nature's forces, timber, to reclaim that land and make a profit out of it.  That is a fairly sound national policy with which no Deputy will find fault.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about the advertising of forestry.  I think that since 1943 and again, some two years ago, when Clann na Poblachta first appeared on the scene, forestry has got plenty of advertising.  The people are very forest conscious.  We have put it before them in a way in which it was never put before them, and the people have risen to the occasion very well and, for the first time, I believe, have now begun to realise that forestry is something which the country ought to have, something which ought to be provided in order to give the young people employment and something which future generations will have as a very valuable asset.  It is an asset the full benefits of which I would not attempt to calculate.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of talk by some unthinking Deputies with regard to soft woods and they have suggested that there is too much softwood in the country.  Perhaps there is a good acreage of <i>pinus contortus</i>, that is, softwood, which may not be <Col N="200" /> a first-class commercial timber, but I have another thing altogether in my mind.  One way of disposing of timber is to dispose of it in the form of planks for ordinary carpentry or joinery purposes and I should be very glad to see the home needs satisfied from our own timber, but I have something else in mind.  In the past 15 or 20 years, huge advances have been made in other uses of timber and I hope to see the day when we will have forests large enough and developed enough to enable big pulp mills to be established for turning out the hundred-and-one valuable by-products of forests which we use to-day.</P>
    <P>In England, they have a mill in a certain area using something like 300 tons of stuff as thin as a man's finger for pulp purposes, turning it into paper and wallboard and so on.  It is a very valuable industry giving good employment to young men, and I want to throw out this hint that if I am Minister in charge of the Forestry Department for the next two, three or four years, we might perhaps, if we can possibly manage it and if transport costs are not prohibitive, be establishing a pulp mill, the first of its kind in the country in the Wicklow area or perhaps the Tipperary area, where the forests are big, to utilise the thinnings which at present are being sold for one purpose or another but which could be turned to much better use in a pulp mill.  These are things I envisage.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Commons who suggested the great help which forestry would be to the Land Commission in relieving the poverty and uneconomic and unhealthy conditions in many of the congested areas.  I am afraid he must have been standing by when I was talking in my sleep, because I had the very same idea.  Forestry brought into these congested areas will give employment. At present, many farmers I know have vast stretches of mountain land which is absolutely useless.  They were described by Deputy Kennedy as snipe walks, but in the cases I have in mind no decent, self-respecting snipe would be seen in them.  If these people will sell us this land&mdash;and I intend to offer every inducement to them&mdash;we can bring employment into these areas and <Col N="201" /> it is from these areas that emigration is worst, due to the fact that the young men have no future.  There is no local work and although the Office of Public Works may make available a few grants for roads in the winter, that is not employment. It is merely stopgap work. We intend to put an end to it, if we can, and give them something decent, something in the nature of whole-time employment of a nice nature, and for that reason I should like to bring forestry into these areas so as to give the young men a chance and hold them at home in the decent employment to which they are entitled.  Apart from that, it will have the effect of beautifying the countryside and bringing wealth into what are now known as the backward parts in a way which has to be seen to be believed.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about the fact that I did not make provision in the Estimate for the full programme this year.  It is never done, and Deputy Little was a Minister for long enough to know exactly what Cabinet procedure and finance procedure is&mdash; I do not blame other Deputies on this side or the other who may not be aware of it&mdash;and if he were Minister for Finance I will guarantee he would be the last Minister to allow another Minister to estimate for something which was purely nebulous, something which could not be exactly calculated. Is that not the very purpose for which Supplementary Estimates are allowable and are allowed?</P>
    <P>I intend to purchase, if I can, 30,000 acres of land this year; that is, from 1st April to 31st March, 1950.  I do not know what the price of that land will be, but I think it should be quite sufficient for the House to know that any time I want a Supplementary Estimate I can come to the House for it.  I was gratified to learn that I would have the support of all sides of the House in so doing, but I do not intend to play fast and loose and pile up moneys in the Estimate when I know that the House is available to give me at short notice whatever I have to ask for.  The same point arose in connection with another Estimate on which I spoke, the Gaeltacht Services Estimate.  Certain <Col N="202" /> Deputies said that we were in a great hurry to pass the Gaeltacht Housing Bill without providing any money for it, but it would be putting the cart before the horse if we were to provide moneys in respect of a Bill which the House had not passed, and would be assuming that the House would have to pass it, whether it liked it or not.  The cash side of the matter is not going to hinder the programme in any way.</P>

      <P>That is cheap talk. Some Deputy asked what acreage of nurseries we have at present.  We have about 320 acres of nurseries and by the time the full programme is in operation we will need approximately 740 acres of fairly first-class land for nurseries. I might say in relation to this matter that I should like to see the nurseries, because of their high labour content, established in areas in which there is congestion or a big number of unemployed without any hope of getting useful or gainful employment in the area.  We will establish them, if at all possible, and provided (1) we get the land suitable for them, and (2) the labour and so on will be available and the costs of transport from the nursery to the nearest forest area are not so high as to be prohibitive.  I should like to establish 20, 30 and 40-acre nurseries in areas where they would be a help.  They may not soak up all the unemployment in a particular area, but they will help in the way of giving relief to a number of families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with those when I come on to refer to the £10 grant payable to private producers. The private nurserymen and the £10 grant are fairly closely linked.  Some Deputy spoke of an experimental plantation in a high, exposed place.  In actual fact, the foresters and forest foremen do make little experiments on their own.  In the case, say,  <Col N="203" /> mountainside where the nature of the land changes from the bottom up to the top edge of the planting line, they put little squares of different species down and watch for the results.  In that way, a vast amount of useful information is gathered about soil, exposure and so on.  Exposure is one of our biggest troubles.  Some Deputy spoke about the magnificent work done in a big sand-dune area in France, off the Bay of Biscay, 100 years ago by Napoleon.  Planting near the sea has to be done very carefully and the greatest caution has to be exercised. There is a type of maritime pine that will flourish there and give good results, but most trees get withered up if salt spray is blown in and descends on the foliage.  It burns it up.  Every Deputy has witnessed the effect of spraying a patch of grass with salt and water.  Salt spray has the very same effect on forest trees.  There is only one variety, that which I have mentioned, that we can be sure will stand up to salt water spray.  For that reason, we cannot go too near the sea with ordinary varieties until we learn a little more.  It should be borne in mind that forestry is in its infancy in this country as yet, and while our experts and foremen have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge about soils, trees and all the rest of it, I feel certain that there is a good deal yet to be learned on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies pressed the desirability of private individuals planting trees.  I would like to see everybody who has a patch of waste land planting it.  I do not know that there is one holding out of the 300,000 holdings in the Twenty-Six Counties that has not such a patch of waste land that could be planted.  I regret to say that Mayo is particularly barren of trees as far as private planting is concerned.  The grant of £10 an acre has outlived its usefulness and is no longer sufficient inducement to the private individual to plant, but I cannot increase it this year or next year for the reason that the difficulty affecting the Forestry Department also hits the private nurseryman, namely, the shortage of seeds.  We <Col N="204" /> must remember that England has launched a tremendous forestry policy. France is aiming at 10,000,000 acres within a period of 20 to 25 years. Poland proposes to plant 2,500,000 acres.  The United States and Canada, two vast territories that had always plenty of timber, are for the first time paying attention to their timber resources.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, from a survey of the timber resources of the world, that if another world war breaks loose every country will feel the shortage of timber.  In other words, we have been cutting down woods much faster than we have been replanting, and at a greater rate than was wise.  There is a serious shortage of mature timber here, and I know of no country that at the present time has a sufficient quantity of mature timber to feel easy about the future.  The result is that every country is planting, planting, planting.  When we tried to buy seeds this year and last year we found that we were very lucky in getting half of what we needed.  I mentioned the fact that the Minister for External Affairs succeeded in getting a God-send of extra seed.  How he did that I do not know.  He succeeded in getting between 1,200 and 1,600 lbs. of extra seed, for which I was very thankful and which will help us to complete our first 25,000-acre programme when they come to the transplant stage in three years' time. That difficulty has also affected the private nurserymen.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, of course, that we should collect our own seeds. Every effort is being made to do so but it is only from the seed of trees nearing maturity or that have attained very full size that the best results are obtained.  Sometimes trees bear seed at a very young age.  This seed does not produce good transplants or healthy trees.  We have too few mature trees to give us the type of seed we would like.  The gathering of seed is a very peculiar business.  Trees 60, 70 and 80 feet high bear seed at the top and the seed is so formed as to be easily taken away by the wind.  If the seeds are gathered before they are ripe many of them will not germinate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I want to say a word of thanks to certain people who have private woods or forests of their own and who have allowed foresters to collect all the seed possible.  We are collecting all we can. We have a kiln in Avondale for opening the cones of the conifer trees in much the same way as nature would by sunlight and heat.  We are collecting a fair amount of seeds and the home collected seeds have been giving excellent results in the nurseries for the last few years.  I hope to see the day when we will be collecting all our own seeds and will not have to seek any abroad.</P>
    <P>If we increase the grant of £10 an acre now, we will be deluged with applications by people who, when they receive sanction, will find that they cannot get plants from the nurseries. We cannot sell them the plants as we have little enough for our own needs and, in any case, we would not dream of going into competition with private nurserymen.  It would be scarcely fair. It would not be playing the game.  The nurserymen have told me that they would not have sufficient plants.  I gave them an idea of the number of trees we expect to be planted by those who got felling licences in the past and who are still waiting to fulfil the replanting condition.  The private nurserymen cannot supply all of them and will not be able to do so for three years.  I regret to say that there is no use in increasing the grant for two or three years until private nurserymen are in a position to meet the increased demands.  The war is responsible for that position.  It is no use blaming the last Government or this Government It is something beyond our control. The shortage of seeds and the felling of forests all over the world has produced the situation and we simply have to take our time, whether we like it or not.  We cannot plant unless we have transplants and we cannot have transplants unless we have seeds.  When the Private Nurserymen's Association inform me that they are in a position to meet the demand, I intend to ask every farmer in the country to plant a small plantation of his own of one acre per year.  There are 383,000 homesteads and if each planted an acre or, if one out of three planted an acre, <Col N="206" /> they would put the Forestry Department, with all its machinery, to shame. One-third of the farmers, planting one acre per year, would plant well over 100,000 acres in a year while we would be struggling and straining with 25,000. I do not think there is much else to deal with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I took over last year, forest labourers have got two increases in their wages and, while they are getting a middling wage at present, I admit that it is a wage with which I am not satisfied.  There has been a good deal of talk about tying them with agricultural labourers.  Some Deputies took the note that forest workers were superior to agricultural labourers. Others took the note that agricultural labourers were superior to forest workers.  The truth is that each of them has to be expert in his own particular kind of work.  By and large, a-farm labourer's work and a forestry labourer's work are pretty nearly the same thing.  Perhaps the forest labourer has not to be familiar with such a diversity of jobs as the farm labourer, but each has to be skilled and expert in his own work.  It is not every labourer who can be entrusted with actual planting of the young transplants. I am anxious to see something <Col N="207" /> done, but, at the same time, as the ex-Ministers will realise, we must be careful that in being kind to them we are not eventually cruel to them.  We must take into account that an increase in wages is always very welcome, but if that entails further increase in the cost of living not alone for those who receive the increased wages but for the people generally, it would be a good day's work for a short time and a very bad day's work in the long run.</P>
      <P>We are trying to balance things and make conditions as easy as possible for all concerned.  I want to say here and now that I would like to see forestry labourers and other foresters getting better wages than they are getting, but I can assure you that the Minister for Finance has his hands pretty well filled in trying to balance things. There is no use in bringing about a steep increase in the cost of living or feeding a dog on his own tail by giving an increase in wages to-day, bringing an increase in the cost of living to-morrow, with a demand for a still greater increase in wages, with a still greater increase in the cost of living. The Government is engaged at the present time in trying to bring about a system whereby wages will purchase all the necessities of life for the workers who receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said about Church holydays.  Deputy Little and some other Deputies raised the question. What happens regarding the time spent in going to Mass on the seven Church holyday mornings? Different things happen in different areas and they are confined to three things.  In some cases the forestry labourers go to Mass and come to work and get paid a full day's wages, or so I understand; in some cases they do not go to work at all&mdash;which I would like to see; in other cases they go to Mass and the time is taken off their pay sheet.  Forestry is not like a furnace that cannot be let out night or day; it is not like the case of the sugar beet workers where the machinery cannot be allowed to stop night or day, and in this country, particularly in rural areas, I would like to see forest workers not going to work <Col N="208" /> at all on Church holydays.  The question of whether they would be paid or whether they would not be paid would not cause any terrible friction either between them and myself or between me and the Minister for Finance.  There are only seven Church holydays and they would work on bank holidays.  I have always worked on bank holidays and so does everybody else in the country.  It is just a custom in the country and there is no more to be said about it than that.  I would not, however, like to lay down a hard and fast rule that foresters shall not work on Church holydays, but I would not like to see them working.  I would like to see them giving notice to the-foreman that they are not coming to work to-morrow because it is a Church holyday and that is all.  In regard to the question of whether they should be paid or not, they would not find a very stern antagonist in me when the question would arise.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of protective clothing and shelter out in the grounds where they work.  Personally, I would not like to see workers working out in protective clothing.  I had to do it myself and I know it is cold comfort, as they say in the country, to have to work in protective clothing or covered up with waterproofs because you cannot work and you cannot even walk.  We do provide them with wellingtons, but I would like to see work stopping as it would definitely entail a hardship if they had to work. I would not like to think that any workman under my control, either in the Department of Lands or the Department of Forestry, would have to-injure his health or lay the foundations of tuberculosis by working out in the open in cold places.  That question is being examined at the present time and my sympathy goes to the workers. Furthermore, I know myself from experience and practice exactly what they have to put up with.  I have experienced the same conditions and I know what I would like myself.</P>

Those workers will get every concession we can give them.  I think that that covers all the ground.</P>

      <P>I am fighting on their behalf at the present time and for some months past.  I received a deputation of these men themselves and I was very impressed by the case they put up. They put up their case in a very decent, gentlemanly way and showed a wide knowledge of financial conditions and of all the implications of their establishment if it took place.  They compelled me to be on their side.  I have nothing to say on the subject at the moment because nothing has transpired so far. I am fully on their side and I fully realise the difficult nature of their work.  Many of them have to handle; not hundreds, but thousands of pounds of State money each year and I want to pay them this compliment whether they are established or not and whether they get their demands from the Minister for Finance or not.  Many of them are married and I am sure some have not a whole lot to spare, but a mistake of 1d. has never been found.  They discharge their duty and love the work they do.  One man said to me that if he was kicked out he would work for nothing if money were scarce.  &ldquo;I love the forest,&rdquo; he said.  This shows the interest they take in their work, more than any other officials in the State.  I admit that forestry lends itself to that; you get to love your work, to love the improvements you have brought about in the countryside although it is a question <Col N="210" /> of State money.  These men care for the young trees as though they were human beings.  Their outlook impressed me very much and I want to pay them a high compliment.  Many of them cycle six or seven miles to pay their gangs of workers on a Saturday night and they are scrupulously exact. Many have to work to keep their accounts in their own houses after hours and burn their own oil but they do not get any overtime.  I appreciate every single thing they do and I hope that it will be in my power very soon to show some little appreciation of their work.</P>

The kind that is utilised is thinnings which would go to waste otherwise or be sold for a trifle as firewood without being appreciated by those who buy it.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £30,707 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants and the purchase and sale of Homespuns.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Gaeltacht Services this year has been prepared without provision for expenditure which will arise consequent on the legislation enacted by the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1949. It should be appreciated, therefore, that the provision in the main Estimate will be increased by the amount being provided in that respect in a Supplementary Estimate.  The main Estimate at £110,707 shows a decrease of £20,023, £2,760 of which relates to the insertion for comparison purposes in last year's figures of a sum in respect of &ldquo;Increases in Remuneration&rdquo; which was not, in fact, required.  If this £2,760 be ignored the decrease in the Estimate would appear as £17,263 and all but £1,963 of that amount would be offset by the amount being provided in a Supplementary Estimate.  Except where otherwise indicated, my remarks from now on will deal with the main Estimate.</P>
      <P>The total amount estimated for expenditure is £93,327 less than the comparative figure for last year, while the estimated receipts are £73,304 less.  If payments made directly out of receipts from the sales of rural industry products are taken into account it will be seen that a total expenditure of £410,718 is provided for and that gross receipts amounting to £330,011 are hoped for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activities of the Gaeltacht Services Division cover rural industries, marine industries and Gaeltacht housing as well as certain miscellaneous services.  The Gaeltacht Services Vote provides for the maintenance of these activities&mdash;the D sub-heads of the Vote <Col N="212" /> providing for the rural industries, the E sub-heads for the marine industries, the H sub-heads for Gaeltacht housing and the G sub-head for the miscellaneous services.  Of the other sub-heads of the Vote, sub-heads A, B and C provide for the expenses of administration and sub-head F for the expenses of Gaeltarra Éireann&mdash;the Central Marketing Depot.  Receipts which in the main represent the proceeds of the sale of the products of the various industries are dealt with under sub-head I.</P>
    <P>The rural industries include spinning and dyeing of woollen yarns, hand-weaving of millspun yarns, the purchase and sale of homespuns, the manufacture of knitwear, rugs, embroidery, leather gloves and toys.</P>
    <P>The spinning and dyeing industry is carried on at Kilcar, County Donegal. where a factory has been established and is being equipped with various carding, spinning, dyeing and finishing machinery.  Expediture on this machinery is provided for under sub-head D (5), which also covers requirements for the knitwear industry.  The estimate for expenditure at £13,300 is £8,700 less than the provision last year and this decrease is largely due to the fact that it is now necessary to provide only for the balance of the machinery to be installed and current requirements.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing materials, mainly wool and yarns, necessary for the carrying-on of the spinning and knitting industries and for the manufacture of rugs, gloves and embroidery are purchased with money provided under sub-heads D (6) and D (9) of the Vote.  The amounts estimated for expenditure during the current year are: D (6), £70,886, and D (9) (1), £25,625, as against £93,450 and £41,325, respectively, provided for expenditure last year&mdash;a total reduction of £38,264.  Considerable stocks of both wool and yarns are on hands and accordingly it will not be necessary to purchase as heavily this year.  Yarns previously purchased are now being provided by the Department from wool purchased, and this factor also has the effect of reducing requirements for materials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> Sub-head D (10) provides for the purchase and sale of homespuns.  The amount provided for expenditure this year is £11,500 as compared with £49,600 for last year, but it must be understood that last year's provision was practically untouched.  The market here for homespuns has virtually disappeared of late but every effort is being made to develop new markets. The Department now has very large stocks on hands and further large-scale purchases cannot be undertaken while these stocks remain unsold.  A limited provision for purchases has, however, been made and, if the Department succeeds in making substantial sales out of present stocks, the proceeds will facilitate the making of further purchases if such course is considered advisable.</P>
    <P>The toy-making industry is carried on in four centres&mdash;in Crolly, County Donegal, and Elly Bay, County Mayo, where dolls and soft toys are manufactured; in Spiddal, County Galway, where leaden models are manufactured; and in Casla, County Galway, where a factory has recently been equipped for the manufacture of composition articles, such as dolls' heads and hard body parts for supplying the toy factories in Crolly and Elly Bay.  The factories at Crolly, Elly Bay and Casla are maintained by money provided under sub-head D (8) of the Vote. The amount estimated for expenditure this year is £40,830 as against £50,620 for last year&mdash;a reduction of £9,790&mdash;which is largely due to the fact that we shall now be manufacturing our own composition articles from raw materials instead of importing them&mdash;as we had to before the establishment of the Casla factory last February.  The reduction is also partly due to a reduction in our requirements of toy-making machinery on which we propose to expend £1,450 this year as against the £4,040 provided last year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that the position of this toy-making industry continues to be satisfactory in spite of difficult trading conditions.</P>
    <P>The factory in Spiddal, County Galway, where the leaden models are being manufactured, is maintained by <Col N="214" /> money provided under sub-head D (12). The amount estimated for expenditure during the current year under this sub-head is £9,900 as against £15,100 last year&mdash;a reduction of £5,200.  This industry is going through a difficult period and provision for expenditure has been made on the basis of last year's transactions.</P>
    <P>Certain general expenses&mdash;mainly transport and fuel&mdash;proper to all the rural industries are paid for out of sub-head D (7) of the Vote.  This year's Estimate shows an increase of £695 over the amount provided last year due mainly to increased provision for freight and packing materials.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (1) provides for payment of the wages of the technical staffs of the various rural industries, such as the skilled tradesmen in the factories and the manageresses of the various knitting and embroidery centres.  These wages have almost all been substantially increased last year and the current year's Estimate shows an increase of £1,051.  Certain wages in connection with the rural industries are also paid out of sub-head D (2), which shows an increase of £40; D (3), which shows an increase of £28; D (9) (5) (spinning industry), which shows an increase of £505; D (10) (4) (homespuns), which shows a decrease of £400; D (11) (2) (dyeing industry), which shows an increase of £492; and D (12) (2) (leaden models), which shows no change from last year's figure.</P>
    <P>However, by far the greater number of the workers employed in the rural industries are paid directly out of receipts and it will be seen from sub-head I (1) (a) that the amount estimated for payment of workers wages in this way during the current year is £94,850.  This is £9,650 less than the amount estimated last year, but events proved that last year's Estimate was too great.</P>
    <P>The marine products industries are at present confined to the purchase and sale of seaweeds.  The participation of the Department in the food carrageen industry, which is carried on by some private firms, has been discontinued and the relevant sub-head E (4) has been omitted from this year's Estimate. <Col N="215" /> Last year a sum of £620 was provided but no expenditure was incurred.</P>
    <P>Money for the purchase of seaweeds is provided under sub-head E (3) of the Vote.  The total provision for the current year is £34,350, as against a sum of £36,500 provided last year&mdash;a reduction of £2,150.  The decrease in the provision under E (3) (1) is due to a much more conservative estimate from one of our customers as to requirements. The kelp industry is virtually finished and only a token sum of £50 has been provided for its purchase.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (2) provides for advertising and publicity and it will be observed that it is proposed to increase expenditure on this activity from £2,000, as provided last year, to £7,000 as estimated for the current year.  Marketing conditions are extremely difficult at present and efforts to improve sales will be made by intensifying publicity at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The I sub-head provides for gross receipts during the year of £330,011, as compared with last year's estimate of £414,165.  The decrease relates in the main to receipts from sales of products of the rural industries, but trading conditions last year being far from favourable the receipts, which had been estimated for at £375,400, were not realised.  A more conservative estimate of receipts from the rural industries has therefore been adopted for the current year in the sum of £293,700.  It is estimated that £104,850 will fall to be met out of these receipts for workers' wages and agents' commission and on that basis the net receipts would amount to £188,850.  The net receipts to be accounted for, however, are shown as £150,850 due to an arrangement by which net receipts over and above that sum would be accounted for as Exchequer Extra Receipts rather than as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The receipts provided for from the sale of seaweeds are £1,513 less than those provided for in last year's Estimate, but in this respect it will be observed that the provision under sub-head E (3) for expenditure shows a <Col N="216" /> somewhat similar decrease.  The other headings under which receipts will be accounted for require no special explanation.</P>
    <P>The H sub-heads of the Vote provide for expenditure in respect of the salaries and travelling and other expenses of the outdoor staff engaged on Gaeltacht housing sub-heads H (1) and H (2); the payment of grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts (sub-head H (3)); and the maintenance and repair of certain teachers' residences in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht (sub-head H (4)).  The main Estimate shows a decrease in the provision in these respects of £2,750 the whole of which may be stated to relate to the provision for housing grants under sub-head H (3).  Last year the provision made was £4,000 but the actual expenditure was far less than that.  The provision now made in the main Estimate is lower than the amount spent last year but, for all practical purposes, it may be regarded as provision for only a small portion of the current year pending the enactment of amending legislation to increase the amount of the grants and the adoption of a Supplementary Estimate for expenditure under the amending legislation.  The amending legislation has now been enacted and as stated in my opening remarks a Supplementary Estimate is being prepared which will increase the amount required by Gaeltacht Services by £15,300.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will provide for an additional £600 under sub-head A of the Vote for salaries and wages of the administrative staff; an additional £3,260 under sub-head H (1) for the salaries and wages of the outdoor housing staff; an additional £1,840 under sub-head H (2) for travelling and miscellaneous expenses of that outdoor staff; and an additional £9,600, making £10,850 in all, under sub-head H (3) in respect of the payment of grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929 to 1949.  In all the circumstances it is thought that the provision of £10,850 under sub-head H (3) will be sufficient to meet claims falling to be made under the amended Acts during the first year of operation.</P>
    <P>The year just finished has been the <Col N="217" /> most difficult trading year experienced during the post-war period but strenuous and sustained efforts are being made to develop new markets for the Gaeltacht Services products and there are indications that these efforts will meet with success in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates now before the Dáil there are very many cuts but, in my opinion, the reduction of £20,000 in the Vote for Gaeltacht Services is certainly the most unkindest cut of all. The Estimate deals with a very poor, uneconomic area, an area which, in the opinion of anyone who has regard for the language and the ancient culture of our people, should deserve a lot more from the Government.  The Minister is aware that he has been placed in charge of an area where our native language is still the every-day speech of the people and where the ancient <Col N="218" /> culture and habits of our people still survive under very uneconomic circumstances and in spite of great odds. Life in the Gaeltacht and in the congested areas generally is a very hard, grim struggle for the people, and unless the Government come to their assistance by way of employment schemes, grants towards the small native industries, and the securing of markets for the industries that have grown up in these areas, life will continue to be very hard, if not impossible for the people.  The small holdings of the Gaeltacht and congested areas, with a poor law valuation of around 30/-, cannot, even under the most favourable conditions, provide a livelihood for the people and it would be very difficult for them to survive without the assistance which I have mentioned.  I move that the Vote be referred back for reconsideration.  It must be evident to people from the cities and towns who have visited the Gaeltacht areas of Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and Galway from time to time that the people living on the poor patches of land that pass for farms in those areas cannot hope to benefit from the larger schemes of development promoted in this State.  The Minister for Lands should take that important point into consideration when presenting his Estimate to the Dáil.  Now, without trying to score any political points, I would like to point out to the Minister that in Donegal, which is one of the largest Gaeltachts in Ireland, we have the largest figure of unemployment of any county in Ireland. With that we have, unfortunately, the biggest exodus of emigrants that we have had in County Donegal for the last 100 years.  If that exodus is allowed to continue, then, unless the Government step in and do something for the people, it means the end for the Gaeltacht and for the people of the Gaeltacht as we know them.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that the Minister's task is not an easy one.  Those of us who know the difficulties that confront him in dealing with this age-old legacy of misrule, will agree that he has a very hard task in front of him. <Col N="219" /> He has the sympathy of all the people who hold the Gaeltacht very dear.  I would point out to him that his administration will be judged by what he is doing, and by what he has done, for the people of those uneconomic areas. The large reduction of £20,000 in this Vote is a severe blow to a helpless area. The small native industries have not escaped the axe.  They have been cut. For instance, the toy industry is cut by almost £10,000, the spinning industry is down by £15,000; the homespun industry, one of the basic industries in the Gaeltacht and congested areas, is cut by £38,000, and the Gaeltacht Housing Vote by £2,750.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, realises that as regards the homespun industry we have a huge pile of homespuns which we have failed to dispose of.  That goes back to the days before this Government took office.</P>

      <P>As far as Donegal is concerned, I would point out to the Minister that we have already suffered very severely as far as these cuts are concerned.  The road grant, which meant a lot to Donegal, was, as we pointed out some weeks ago, cut by £71,000.  The Minister for Agriculture informed us some time ago that he was cutting the tomato glass-house scheme by £64,000.  These are not all the cuts, but each one of them has had a very severe effect on helpless, uneconomic areas.  All these reductions add up to one thing&mdash;more unemployment and more emigration.  As far as the seaboard areas of this country are concerned the position is very acute and <Col N="220" /> the people are going with a vengeance. Unless something can be done, and done quickly, it will mean the end of the Gaeltacht, and the end of life in the Gaeltacht as we in this House know it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should ask the Commission on Emigration which has been sitting in this city for a considerable time to examine the problem, and examine it very quickly, and further, to issue a report as to what should be done with regard to the special problems that obtain in the Gaeltacht areas.  We realise that the problems and difficulties of the Gaeltacht are totally different from those that obtain in the cities and the towns.  The Gaeltacht areas, which have been called &ldquo;the wards of the Irish nation,&rdquo; certainly deserve some consideration from a native Government.  I would strongly urge on the Minister the necessity of throwing the economy axe overboard when he comes to deal with the special problems of the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  Of all the victims selected by the Minister for Finance, when he was wielding the economy axe, I think that none has been dealt a deeper blow than the people of these helpless areas. The total savings made represent a small item in the expenditure of the State, but small as they may look in that way, they mean a big thing as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  They are a matter of life and death.  The cuts that I have mentioned&mdash;and I have not mentioned them all&mdash;spell the difference between hope and despair, and between the prospect of a frugal living at home and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the small amount in this Vote does not give any hope whatever to the people in the Gaeltacht areas. The outflow of these young people that I have mentioned is continuing day after day and week after week.  At the moment, we in Donegal have very few young people at home.  Donegal to-day, at least the Gaeltacht and congested part of it, is populated by old people and school-children who cannot get away.  The position is a grim one and a very serious one.  I would ask the Minister, who should have a full knowledge of the life and of the way of <Col N="221" /> living in the Gaeltacht area, to come to the assistance of the people there with something better than this Estimate which he is now presenting to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé seal maith anois&mdash;níos mó ná fiche bliain&mdash;ó cuireadh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ar bun agus ó foilsíodh moltaí an Choimisiún sin.  Is iomaí focal a canadh ar an Ghaeltacht ó shoin agus is iomaí aiste a scríobhadh air.  Gan aon amhras rinne obair an Choimisíun sin an cás a chur roimh an tír ar chaoi go mb'éigin do gach Rialtas ó shoin tárrtháil a thabhairt ar an Ghaeltacht.  Acht i ndiaidh a gcuid oibre go léir, agus is iomaí punt a caitheadh sa Ghaeltacht, ní thig linn a rá go bhfuil biseach mór air i dtaca le hollmhaitheas nó saibhreas an tsaoil seo.  Is cinnte go bhfuil saol níos fearr ag na daoine, saol níos sócúlaí acu ná bhí ag a sinsear.  Gidh go bhfuil líon na ndaoine níos lú, tá slí bheatha níos fearr acu.  Sé an chéad bhiseach a tháinig orthu: tithe úra a thógáil dóibh.  Roimhe seo bhí na daoine bochta seo ina gcónaí i dtithe beaga mí-fholláine, fuar, tais, gan díon, gan téagar agus ar bheagán solais. Níorbh ionadh aicídeacha, an eithinn agus an fiabhras, a bheith coiteann agus tinneas i ngach muirín.  D'athraigh na tithe úra an scéal sin uilig.  Thug siad saol úr agus sláinte do na daoine agus croí agus misneach le slí bheatha a bhaint amach.  Tá fhios agam gurb iad na sean-tithe gránna seo a thamhnaigh mórán den aos óg imeacht as an Ghaeltacht.  Is maith liom go bhfuil an tAire ag dul ar aghaidh leis an obair seo&mdash;tógáil tuilleadh tithe ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá an tAire fial mór-chroíoch agus níos fiúntaí ná na hAirí a chuaigh roimhe mar chímid go bhfuil deontaisí ó chéad go leith go trí chead leagtha amach aige do dhuine ar bith a thógas teach cónaí dó féin sa <Col N="222" /> Ghaeltacht.

Ar feadh cúig mblian an chogaidh dheireannaigh tugadh isteach i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill amháin, ar son báinín baile, £100,000, in aghaidh na bliana.  Ach dá bhliain ó shoin (1947) thit an tóin as an mhargadh agus stad an ceannach ar an bháinín baile.  Ní sé mhí ó shoin mar dúirt an Teachta Ó Breisleáin goill an meath seo ar cheannach an bháinín ar dhá mhíle muirín agus ní thig a mheas cad é atá caillte acu dá bharr.  Go dearfa ní bheifeá ag éagaoin orthu dá mbeadh siad ag guidhe an Rí cogadh beag eile a chur chugainn.</P>
    <P>Ar aon chaoi go dtí go mbeidh an domhan go léir ar staid síochána agus tráchtáil agus airgead ag siúl go réidh i measc na náisiúin ní thig linn a bheith <Col N="223" /> ag dréim le luach seasmhach ar earraí ar bith.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann agus oifigigh an Aire ar a ndícheall ag iarraidh margadh d'fháil do na tionscail baile&mdash;go háithrid an báinín&mdash;agus go bhfuil súil in airde acu i ngach tír ar féidir díolaíocht a dhéanamh ann.  Beimid ag dréim le cuidiú dúthrachtach fosta ón Roinn Tionscail agus Tráchtála san obair seo. Ní fáth neamairt é.</P>
    <P>Go dtig éileamh agus ceannach ar an bháinín ar ais mholfainn do mhuintir na Gaeltachta cromadh ar thionscal eile atá faoi réim cheart anois&mdash;sin tionscal na n-éanlaithe tí agus uibheacha. Ar ndóigh is fíor an sean-fhocal: &ldquo;Nár dhruid Dia doras ariamh nár fhoscail Sé ceann eile.&rdquo;  Tá margadh maith agus margadh seasmhach againn ar uibheacha agus an té a rachas i gcionn an tionscail seo i ndáiríre is é mo bharúil go ndéanfaidh sé níos mó air ná rinne sé ariamh ar an bháinín. Tá deontais le fáil as tithe cearc a thógáil&mdash;deontais fiúntacha&mdash;agus ní leithscéal ag feirmeoir beag ar bith gan teach cearc a bheith aige.  Gidh nach bhfuil an tionscal seo faoi chúram an Aire, tá fhios agam go bhfuil suim mhór aige ann mar tá sé chun leasa mhuintire na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Dúradh mórán faoin imirce sa díospóireacht seo ach is beag a thuigeas an scéal i gceart.  Tá an imirce san fhuil ag an Ghael.  Síleann cuid de na daoine nach bhfuil aon leigheas ar an scéal ach saothrú agus saibhreas agus soilse geala na gcathrach a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní chuirfeadh sin féin stad ar an imirce.  Tá intinn mhíshuaimhneach ag an aos óg agus níl siad sásta le saol na tuaithe; caithfidh siad an domhan mór a fheiceál.  Tá an craolachán, na scannáin, an páipéar nuaíochta anois ar fud na Gaeltachta ag cur ár ndaoine óga faoi dhraíocht agus á mealladh ar shiúl i gcéin uainn. Is doiligh leigheas a fháil ar an aicíd sin.  Chím féin fir agus cailiní óga ag imeacht a bhfuil caoi mhaith saothruithe acu sa bhaile, a muintir ina suí go te, ach buaileann an steall iad agus caithfidh siad imeacht go bfheicfidh siad saol na gcathrach agus iontais an domhain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> Is é mo bharúil nár chóir duinn bheith ag éagaoin ar na cailiní atá ag imeacht uainn ón Ghaeltacht.  I gcroi an uile chailín tá mian pósta agus ós rud annamh pósadh sa Ghaeltacht, bheadh eagla uirthi go bhfaigheadh an aois greim uirthi sul a bhfaigheadh sí fear céile.  Agus cé bheadh ina dhiaidh uirthi imeacht leis an intinn sin; ní bheadh saoirse ar bith againn da gcuirtí bac uirthi.  Go cinnte dá mbeadh monarchain mar seo againn amuigh faoin tuaith d'fhéadfaí fir óga a choinneáil le hobair iontu agus bhéarfadh sé caoi dhóibh cailíní as an tuaith a phósadh.  Ach tá na monarchain seo plodaithe istigh sna cathracha in áit iad a bheith scaptha ó cheann go ceann na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tá monarchain amháin againn i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill&mdash;monarchain olla&mdash;agus tá ag éirí go tairbheach léi. Tá seó ag tabhairt saothrú maith do na céadta fear agus bean óg sa cheantar sin.  Bheireann saothrú seasmhach mar seo caoi do na fir óga pósadh sa bhaile. Dá mbeadh níos mó monarchain den chinéal seo againn ar fud na Gaeltachta ní bheadh an t-aos óg ag imeacht uainn. Ní fheicim leigheas ar bith eile ar an imirce ach é.  Sin agus na tionscail eile: iascaireacht, foraoiseacht a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire claonadh níos mó leis na tionscail a oireas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tuilleadh cumhacht a thabhairt do Ghaeltarra Eireann i ngnótha tráchtála agus gan moill a chur orthu ag fanacht le údarás ón Roinn seo agus ón Roinn eile nuair atá gnótha práinneach idir lámha acu.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh mé chun labhairt ar an Meastachán seo, ach ós rud é gur dúradh rudaí mar gheall ar thionscail, ba mhaith liom focal nó dhó a rá in a thaobh.  Tá trácht ar cheist na Gaeilge is cultúr, agus is ceist mhór í sin agus d'fhéadfadh Teachtaí eile trácht air sin.  Ach ar thaobh eile leis sin, tá ceist na ndaoine féin ann.  Seo mar chímse an scéal.  Baineann an Meastachán seo le dream daoine faoi leith atá ag iarraidh maireachtáil i gcuid den tír atá bocht agus níl an seans céanna acu atá ag daoine eile in áiteacha eile ar fud na hÉireann.  Dá bhrí sin, measaim, gur chóir dúinn aire <Col N="225" /> speisialta a thabhairt don cheist agus cúnamh speisialta a thabhairt do na daoine sin.  Isé an trioblóid go bhfuil an chuid is mó den Ghaeltacht an-bhocht agus go bhfuil sé an-deacair ar fad ag na daoine sin maireachtáil.  Ar an ábhar sin, mura féidir leis an Rialtas cúnamh a thabhairt dóibh, caithfidh siad imeacht, agus beidh na daoine sin caillte againn idir chailíní agus buachaillí, agus beídh an chuid sin den tír lom aice.</P>
      <P>Anois sé an chéad trioblóid in a thaobh sin, mar fheicimse é, ná an rud a rinne an Rialtas i dtaobh na móna. Bhí tionscail ansin ag na daoine. Fuaireadar cuid mhaith cúnamh le maireachtáil ann.  Anois tá an tionscail sin marbh orthu agus, dá bhrí sin, bhí ar a lán acu imeacht as an tír.  Ar an taobh eile, bhí tionscal eile acu, an bréidín.  Ós rud é nach raibh na hAirí agus an Rialtas ag smaoineamh orthu, rinneadar connartha le na Sasanaigh a mharaigh an tionscal sin.  Agus da bharr sin anois, tagann an tAire isteach anseo agus deireann sé go bhfuil sé chun a thuille airgid a bhaint díobh ins an Meastachán seo.  Measaim nach ceart é sin.</P>
      <P>Ar thaobh amháin, mar a dúirt mé, tá ceist na Gaeilge fhéin.  Tá an cheist seo, an cheist i dtaobh na ndaoine féin, ann; agus ba mhaith liom an cheist sín a phlé anois agus a iarraidh ar an Aire an Meastachán so a chur ar ais chuig an Rialtas agus níos mó airgid d'fháil ionas gur féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta maireachtáil in a ndúthaigh féin.  Measaim gur féidir leo é sin a dhéanamh.  Níl an cheist go dona maidir leis an Roinn Airgeadais agus ní bheidh orthu an oiread sin airgid a thabhairt amach i gcóir bídh agus rudaí den tsaghas sin i mbliana.  Fuaireadar bronntanas mór ó mhuintir Guinness agus tá an t-airgead sin ann.  Cén fáth nach féidir leo beagáinín a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Dá bhrí sin, ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire an Meastachán seo a chur ar ais chuig an Rialtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not intended actively intervening in this debate, though it is a matter of considerable importance to this country.  It is important in two respects.  It is important, firstly, by <Col N="226" /> virtue of the fact that the people involved are the people through whom has been preserved our native language, and, therefore, they have an important cultural value.  As I said already, that in itself is a very important question, but it is one into which I do not intend to go any further now, as I know that other Deputies more competent than I will deal with it adequately.  But, side by side with that important aspect, that very important national aspect, there is the economic aspect from the point of view of those people living in the Gaeltacht areas.  We must not forget that, quite apart from the preservation of the language, and quite apart from the fact that in these areas survives that part of our race which has preserved the language and which was driven across the Shannon by Cromwell&mdash;quite apart from that important aspect, an aspect which I do not minimise in any way, there is a very definite economic aspect both for them and for the country.</P>
    <P>You have, due to history and Cromwell, I suppose, in particular, the fact that a large part of our people was driven and compressed into relatively infertile and relatively unproductive portions of our country.  Their descendants are now living in these relatively barren areas, areas which, even if populated at an equivalent density to other areas of the country, would still be poor, but which, in actual fact, are congested, having regard to the density of population in other areas.  That being so, it is apparent that the difficulties which these people have had in living are not artificial or in no way attributable to themselves, but are due to the lack of amenities and resources in the areas in which they live and into which they have been compressed.</P>
    <P>In that situation, it is obvious that the State must do something for them, seeing that they are actually denied, by virtue of the areas in which they live, the density of the population and by force of physical circumstances, a chance of fighting an equal struggle for existence with people in other parts of the country.  That fact makes it incumbent <Col N="227" /> on the rest of the community, in the interests of the whole, to come to their aid.  That can only be done by State intervention which, I understand, is the purpose of this Vote.  The success of that intervention in the past is, I think, a complete justification for the plea that we are making now, that that intervention should be continued. Such intervention is more than ever necessary at the present moment.  I do not propose to enter into the merits or demerits of the discontinuance of hand-won turf production at the present moment.  Whatever the merits or demerits may be, the hard fact remains that because of that discontinuance great hardship has been inflicted on the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  Because of its discontinuance, too, a certain impetus has been given to emigration from these areas.  I assert that as a fact.  It is a fact which neither this House nor the country can afford to ignore.  Added to that there is the decline in industry.  The Minister referred to that himself.  It seems to me that we all too easily accept the statement that economic conditions generally have brought about a declining trend.  But there is much in the will to achieve and much can be achieved if the will is there.  Many people are not satisfied that some of these industries cannot be developed to the benefit of the community as a whole.  In answer to a specific point raised by the Minister, the fact is that the tweeds situation has worsened because of the voluntary agreement entered into by the Government&mdash;the trade agreement to which the Deputy who moved that this Estimate be referred back adverted.  It may be, as the Minister said, that at a later stage the other market might be closed.  But the fact is that we actually agreed to that and precipitated that situation.  If such an essential commodity as cloth is being produced in the Gaeltacht areas, surely it should be possible to organise a market for that cloth.  Of necessity there must be a large consumption of cloth even at home.  During the past 12 months there has been a deterioration in the situation.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we have here <Col N="228" /> favourable financial circumstances as a whole.  The Minister for Finance is in the fortunate position of being able to effect substantial economies because he will not have to spend the same amount on wheat.  Wheat subsidies will cost less.  He has had a windfall amounting to roughly £1,000,000 in the matter of estate duties.  He is more favourably placed than any Minister for Finance since the outbreak of war in 1939.  He is in a position to do things. Yet, from the economic point of view, we have a group of people living in the most infertile part of the country with a greater density of population and in urgent need of assistance.  We know from past experience that that assistance can be beneficial to them. But here we cut the Estimate.  We talk about keeping the people on the land. We complain about the drift to the city.  Here where we could do something concrete we are asked to cut the Estimate.  I support those who asked to have this Estimate referred back.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it in the light of the more favourable financial circumstances now developing.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tús a chur ar mo chuid cainte le ceist a chur ar an Aire cén fáth ar laghdaíodh an Meastachán i gcóir Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta cúig is fiche faoin gcéad agus nach bhfuil de laghdú ar na meastacháin ar fad ach sé nó seacht faoin gcéad.  Tá buille trom buailte ar an nGaeltacht ar go leor slite ó thainig an Rialtas seo in oifig. Tá siad i ndon rud ar bith a chur trasna ar aon amadán a chreideas iad. Nuair a bhreathnaíos tú ar an liosta de na seirbhísí atá faoi chúram an Aire sa Meastachán seo, chíonn tú go bhfuil chuile cheann acu dá laghdú, dá gearradh anuas.  Tóg, mar shampla, an Meastachán in aghaidh na dtithe. Rinneamar gearán leis an Aire nuair a bhí Acht Tithe na Gaeltachta ag duI tríd an Teach seo, gur dearnadh moill bliana leis an mBille a thabhairt isteach agus nach raibh údar ar bith leis an moill sin.  Tá an bhliain sin imithe agus níl soláthar sa Meastachán seo i gcóir na dtithe ach an oiread airgid agus a dhéanfadh 30 tithe don Ghaeltacht. Sin a bhfuil soláthraithe sa Meastachán, tar éis a bhfuil maíte agus ráite agus <Col N="229" /> de ghaisceadh déanta mar gheall air, agus tar éis moill bhliana a bheith déanta sa rud.</P>
      <P>An rud is mó a bhfuil laghdú air is é an soláthar le haghaidh tionscail an bhréidín, an ceannasna, agus an tsníomhacháin is na figheadóireachta. Tá laghdú níos mó ná leith-chéad míle £53,000.  Tá aithne agam ar shiopadóir amháin i mo dháilcheantar agus bhí sé ag díol luach £300 sa tseachtain den bhréidín agus tá sé sin sciobtha le haon bhuille amháin de bharr an aontais a rinneadh go hamaideach&mdash; sin é mo thuairim faoi&mdash;le Sasana. Dubhairt an Teachta Lemass nuair a bhí sé ag caint ar an aontas sin, go mb'fhearr i bhfad don tír seo deireadh a chur leis an aontas mar a bhí beartaithe ag an sean-Rialtas i dtaobh an chinn a bhí ann, an ceann a rinneadar féin roimh an gcogadh, b'fhearr i bhfad gan aon cheann nua a dhéanamh, agus an scéal a fhágáil go fánach gan aontas ar bith idir an tír seo agus na Sasanaigh i dtaoibh tráchtála agus go mór mór rudaí a bhaineas le tionscail na Gaeltachta.  Dá ndéantaí ar an gcaoi sin, ní bheadh an scéal pioc níos measa&mdash;tá mise ag ceapadh go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr&mdash;don Ghaeltacht maidir leis an tionscal seo.</P>
      <P>Tóg, ansin, na tionscail tuaithe.  Tá tuarastal na n-oibrithe, na daoine atá ag saothrú sna tionscail sin gearrtha £10,000.  Tá an rud céanna ann i dtaoibh tionscal na mara.  Ós rud é go bhfuil mé ag tagairt do na tionscail mhara sin, bhí mé ag súil le ráiteas éigin ón Aire i dtaobh an Bhille nua atá tagtha isteach&mdash;ach b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé sáthach luath nuair a bheas an Bille sin ag dul tríd an Dáil, an Alginate Industries Bill.</P>
      <P>Níl muintir na Gaeltachta sásta go bhfuil Cothrom na Féinne dá thabhairt dóibh i dtaobh tionscal na mara, nó marine industries go mór mór i dtaobh ceannach na feamainne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá clamhsán ar fud na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil ceannach ceart féireálta le fáil acu anois go mór mór na slata mara&mdash;ní dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ag ceannach aon chineál eile agus go bhfuil siad á, bhfágáil ar a lámha, ar bheagán údair.  Má tá locht dá laghad orthu, ní ceannófar uathu iad. <Col N="230" /> Rinneadh tagairt anseo do scéim na móna.  Níl mise ag dul ag déanamh rud mór den cheist sin anseo, ach ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an gcaint faoi agus a chur in iúl don Aire&mdash;cé nach bhfuil pinginn ar bith sa Meastachán seo in a thaobh&mdash;go raibh muintir na Gaeltachta ag súil, nuair a stopfadh tionscal na móna go mbeadh meadú mór ar na scéimeanna fostaíochta ach céard a tharla?  Tar éis tionscal na móna a bheith stoptha sa Samhraidh tháinig an Geimhreadh, agus nuair a tháinig na scéimeanna fostaíochta speisialta atá ceaptha go speisialta don Ghaeltacht, laghdaíodh go dtí a leath iad.  Agus bhí an scéal céanna le haithris i dtaobh scéim na dtithe gloine.  Gach rud a bhaineas leis an nGaeltacht, tháinig an tAire Airgeadais agus sciob sé iad, an méid d'fhéad sé a sciobadh eis.  Is iad an dream is lú aire leis an Rialtas seo, ar chuma ar bith, muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá scéal nua ag na daoine atá ag cosaint an Rialtais, agus sin é, go bhfuil an Gael siúlach, go mbíonn fonn spaisteoireachta air, agus nár cheart aon bhac a chur leis nuair a bhuaileas an fonn é.</P>
    <P>Thosnaigh an tAire Talmhaíochta ar an bport sin agus lean go leor daoine eile é agus bhí daoine ag iarraidh a chur in a luí orrainn go bhfuil dream nua sa tír, dream nach bhfuil gá ar bith dhóibh imeacht as an tír ag tóraíocht oibre ach go bhfuil siad chomh deisiúl sa sao agus chomh maith sin as, go raibh ar a gcumas imeacht leo as an tír le tiortha eile a fheiceál.</P>

      <P>An bhfuil sé ag séanadh gur stopadh beagnach leath de na tithe gloine thiar i gConamara, an scéim is breátha dá dtáinig fós.  Tá mise ag rá leis anois go bhfuil imirce nua ann agus ní hé an cineál a bhíodh ann.  Tá imirce nua ann agus sin é go bhfuil teaghlaigh iomlána ag imeacht as an tír.  Tá siad ag díol a gcuid talúna agus ag bailiú leo as an tír go America.  Sin rud nár tharla le fada an lá agus tá ag tarló anois.</P>
      <P>Tá an Rialtas seo den tuairim go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht sásta le rud ar bith a caitear leo.  Is cuimhin liom duine a bhí in aghaidh Fianna Fáil fadó&mdash;níl a fhios agam bhfuil sé páirteach i bpolaitíocht anois&mdash;ag rá, nach raibh iontú ach &ldquo;a weak and vespertine people.&rdquo;  Is cosúil go bhfuil an Rialtas seo den tuairim chéanna, mar ceapann siad go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta sásta le cúnamh dífhostaíochta agus rudaí den tsórt sin, agus má fhaigheann siad beagáinín beag sa mbreis thar a raibh le fáil acu go dtí seo, go mbeidh siad sásta na tionscail a soláthraíodh dóibh a fheiceáil ag imeacht uathu agus á scuabadh uathu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl mise sásta leis an Meastachán seo, agus má ta aon laghdú le déanamh ar na Meastacháin le haghaidh seirbhísí poiblí, tá muintir na Gaeltachta sásta a gcuid féin den laghdú sin a bheith orthu féin.  Ach seo í an cheist atá á cur ar an Rialtas acu&mdash;cad chuige a bhfuil siad ag tromaíocht ar fad orthu ag gearradh anuas Meastach in na Gaeltachta, na seirbhísí a bhain as leis an nGaeltacht an ceathrú cuid, agus sásta gan na Meastacháin don tír ar fad a laghdú ach an ceathrú cuid déag? Cad chuige a bhfuil an difir sin ann? Cad chuige a bhfuil an Rialtas ag brú chomh trom sin ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta? Tá freagra dá iarraidh ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar an gceist  <Col N="232" /> agus mura bhfaighfear freagra sásúil uirthi, ní bheidh mé féin sásta leis an Meastachán seo.</P>

      <P>Le breathnú ar an Meastachán cheapfadh duine go raibh sé íslithe go mór ach nuair a breathnaítear níos géire air níl sé chomh híslithe sin mar sé déantús an éadaigh is mó a thug anuas é.  Tá luach na mílte den éadach seo déanta faoi láthair agus é ina luí sa stór i nDún na nGall.  Dúirt Teachta éigin gur le sé mhí a thosaigh sé seo.  Seasann an fhírinne nuair imíos an bhréag.  Nach bhfnil a fhios ag chuile dhuine a bhfuil rian aige gur i 1947 a thosaigh sé seo, nuair a lig an tAire a bhí ann an tam sin éadach shoddy genteel isteach! Chuir sé sin stad le déantus an éadaigh sa nGaeltacht.  Cén mhaith leanacht den éadach seo a dhéanamh go mbeidh an chuid is mó dá bhfuil ar láimh curtha as an mbealach.  Le cúnamh Dé, is gearr é sin, agus tá súil agamsa ansin go dtosófar dáiríre air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois, faoi Acht na dTithe.  Dúirt Teachta áirithe nach bhfuil ach an oiread airgid ann is a dhéanfadh deich dteach fhichead.  Cén mhaith a bheith ag fiodmhagadh mar seo?  Mar tá a fhios againn nach fíor é.  Is eol dom féin níos mó ná dhá chéad iarratas a bheith istigh faoi láthair agus dá mbeadh na foirmeacha againn bheadh a oiread eile againn.  Nár dhúirt an tAire go raibh sé le Meastachán breise faoin gceist seo a thabhairt isteach gan mhoill?  Ní hé amháin gurb iad na tithe atá le tógáil a gheofas an deontas, ach na tithe a rinneadh le dhá bhliain, ardófar an deontas na leith.  Feicfimid go mbeidh a chomhartha lena chois roimh dhá bhliain ó inniu.  Mura mbeidh agus má fhágann Dia mo shláinte agamsa níl duine ar bith is dána a labhrós amach ina aghaidh ná mé.  Nuair a bheas na hiarratais uilig scrúdaithe feicfidh sibh féin go mbeidh an t-airgead ann lena n-aghaidh. Labhair an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin faoi na slata mara&mdash;slata mara ar bith a feistíodh le bliain, táim cinnte gur ceannaíodh iad.  Tá Meastachán faoi leith á thabhairt isteach faoin monarcha i gCill Chiaráin.  Cuirfear é seo ar a bhonna i gceart agus, le cúnamh Dé, coinneofar ar a chosa é.

Is eagla liom go ndéarfaidh sé leis féin nach bhfuil teanga ar bith sa tír seo ach teanga an tSasanaigh.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate as presented this year holds out very little hope of any future whatever for the homespun industry.  Last year, when the Minister was speaking on the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services, in reply to criticism he referred to the hopes that he had placed in the agreement that had then recently been made with France.  He informed the House that he had high hopes as a result of that agreement that something would be done to procure markets for Donegal homespuns.  In his statement this year the Minister has repeated the platitudes of last year that it was hoped in the near future to get markets for homespun, but nothing has materialised <Col N="234" /> in the meantime.  There was a pretty lucrative market in Donegal for the manufacturers of homespun who disposed of their materials in Britain through the parcels post, but, as a result of the agreement made last year, that market has been taken from the producers.  The result is that, instead of an effort being made to expand and to develop this industry, as was promised here last year, the Minister and his Department, by revoking the Order that was made in 1943 by the Minister for Industry and Commerce whereby the purchase of homespun was the complete monopoly of the Gaeltacht Services Department, have indicated that so far as they are concerned they are not prepared to give any assistance whatever to the Donegal homespun industry.  Before adopting that attitude, the Minister and his Department at least should have provided a market by purchasing through Gaeltarra Éireann.  There is scarcely a house in the parishes of Glencolmcille, Ardara and possibly, to a lesser extent, Kilcar, in which there are not two webs of homespun which have been left on the people's hands.  They produced homespuns for Gaeltarra Éireann when they were the only purchasers.  Gaeltarra Éireann have washed their hands of it now and they have left this material in the homes of the producers, who can very ill afford the loss entailed.</P>
      <P>I would appeal again, as I appealed last year, to the Minister and to the Department that before the swan song of the Donegal homespun industry is sung they should make arrangements through their buyers to purchase the homespun that they have left on the hands of these people who manufactured it for Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Round Tower industry, which I always regard as separate and distinct from the homespun industry, the Estimates this year reveal that there is no great enthusiasm, no great drive or initiative in the Department in trying to develop it.  There is a considerable reduction in the amount of money made available this year for the rural industries and marine industries generally.  I think the reduction is nearly £100,000 on last <Col N="235" /> year's Estimate.  Yet, if we go into the figures of the Estimate we discover that, despite the huge reduction in the amount allowed for the various industries for the purchase of material, general expenses and upkeep, the cost of the Central Marketing Board in Dublin, who market the products of these industries, is up by almost £11,000 on the Estimate for last year.  Although we are spending £100,000 less on materials, it takes £11,000 more in salaries, wages and travelling expenses to administer the lesser sum.  There is something seriously wrong in a Department where that state of affairs is allowed to exist.</P>
    <P>There is an increase in sub-head D (9).  There is an increase of over £2,000 in sub-head D (11) for fuel, etc., despite the fact that there is a decrease in the materials to be processed&mdash;a reduction of from £41,000 last year to £25,000 this year, a reduction of about 40 per cent.  Under sub-head D (10) there is a reduction from £21,000 odd to £6,000 odd in regard to materials. Despite that reduction of roughly two-thirds, there is an increase of £160 in the cost of power and maintenance. Apparently, although reducing the amount of money allowed for the provision of materials and work, the expenses in connection with that particular item are increased by £160 and they are increased under sub-head D (11) by £2,000.</P>
    <P>Taking these figures, we would be entitled to have got from the Minister in his opening statement some more lucid explanation than we got from him.  If the homespun industry is finished, as there is every indication here as far as I can see, the Minister should take the House and the people who are engaged in that industry into his confidence and tell them frankly that he can see no hope for the future of homespuns and that they should divert their attention to some other means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, during the past 12 months a number of people who had been engaged in the spinning and weaving of homespun have left home and have left the country.  There are still some weavers and spinners left <Col N="236" /> who would be interested to know what is the future for this product and, if there is no future for it, as is indicated by the provision being made for it in this Estimate, the Minister and the Department should tell the people that. They should, at the same time, purchase from them the homespun already manufactured.  These people in all good faith manufactured this cloth in the hope that there would be a market for it under the instructions of, and in some cases with the material provided by, the Department and they are entitled to be paid for the material so manufactured and to have it taken off their hands.</P>
    <P>If we cannot run this Department more economically, if we cannot get a better return from the money expended on it, this House should seriously consider whether Gaeltarra Éireann as at present constituted should be scrapped and something substituted for it, something less costly and something that will have a personnel having more drive and initiative than appears to be the case in this particular Department.</P>
    <P>The fuel charges for this year seem to be on the whole greater than last year.  Last year and the previous years during the emergency, practically since the machinery was installed in the factory at Kilcar, turf had to be purchased in order to keep the plant going. Considering the methods by which turf was purchased and brought there, one would imagine that the fuel costs should not be any higher than the fuel costs in the years 1945, 1946 and 1947, to keep the plant in existence.  Despite the fact that petrol and transport in the way of lorries are more freely available than in previous years, we have the cost of fuel, which, I take it, arises principally in connection with the factory at Kilcar, increased this year by £2,000.  I should like to know if that is the result of the change-over from turf to oil burning machinery, whether it is oil burning machinery that will be used in Kilcar factory in future or whether a percentage of turf will be used.  What is the explanation for the increase?  Is it that turf is dearer or that the oil fuel is dearer?  What <Col N="237" /> is the reason for an increase in fuel costs of something in the region of £2,000?</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister on behalf of a number of instructresses engaged in the Rural Industries Branch of Gaeltacht Services.  These girls have worked for many years on a temporary basis and something should be done to put them on a permanent and pensionable basis.  I heard the Minister refer earlier to the case of officials in another Department whose claim for similar consideration was under examination.  Many of these girls have been with the Department since it was set up over 20 years ago. I think that they are entitled to some consideration and that they should be made permanent and pensionable so that when the time comes when they will have to retire they will have some provision to fall back upon after their years of service with this Department. I would appeal to the Minister to consider the question of making provision by way of pensions for these instructresses.</P>

Ní fheadar an dtuigeann sé an scéal ar aon chor nó an dtuigeann sé cad a thárla.  An rud a loit agus a chuir críoch le tionscal an bhréidín ná an rud a rinne Fianna Fáil sa bhliain 1947 nuair a ligeadar isteach sa tír seo gach aon tsaghas éadaigh agus gach aon tsaghas déantúis idir éadaigh, gúnaí, léinteacha agus gach aon tsaghas déantúis olla ligeadar isteach iad i ndeireadh na bliana 1947.</P>

      <P>There is a reduction in practically each and every sub-head. There is a reduction of £8,700, machines and plant, under D (5). There is a reduction of £22,564, materials, under D (6).  Under D (8), toy industry, there is a reduction of £9,790.  Spinning is reduced by £15,335.  Homespuns are down by £38,100.  The leaden models industry is down by £5,200.  There is not much sign of hope in any of these sub-heads of any expansion of the industries concerned.  The Minister finished up by telling us, with regard to kelp and seaweed, that that industry is finished. If I heard the Minister correctly he used these words.  He did not give us any explanation as to why that industry is finished.  It is the one industry that affects the small portion of the Gaeltacht in my constituency.  There is no other industry there and, for that reason, I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to explain why he thinks that industry is finished.  The kelp industry has been carried on along the western seaboard for a long number of years.  During the war years we were very glad to have it.  The time may come again when we will be very pleased to have some such source of potash for fertilising.</P>
      <P>Workers' wages in 1948 were £104,500.  In 1949 they were down to £94,850.  That represents a reduction of almost £10,000 in the earnings of these workers.  That does not show any great hope of an expansion during the next 12 months.</P>

      <P>Not all of the Minister's colleagues sitting behind him agree with that point of view.  On one occasion one of them, sitting on the <Col N="241" /> benches over here, took out a sample of the tweed and, to show what rotten stuff it was, started tearing it like a monkey.  Action of that kind is scarcely a good advertisement for the sale of our tweeds.  That Deputy knew well that he was misleading the public and that he was doing serious injury to that industry.  His action has now had the effect of a boomerang so far as the present Minister is concerned. It was most unfair and uncalled for. If the criticism were justified, well and good, but, in my opinion and in the opinion of those who know, Round Tower tweeds and Round Tower products generally can compare with any of their kind in the world.  Therefore, I think it is a question of salesmanship. I know of no reason why, if there is a proper drive to sell these goods, they could not be sold.  I know of one firm in New York which, I understand, would be prepared to take the entire output.  Now that the war is over, that market should be looked into.  I would advise the Minister to do all he possibly can in regard to that market in America.  Here at home a great deal could be done by propaganda. Incidentally, I am glad to notice that there is an increase of £5,000 this year in the amount provided for advertisements.</P>

      <P>At any rate, there has been an increase and I am glad of it.  I hope that that money will be put to good use with a view to providing markets for these products.  There was considerable hope some years ago <Col N="242" /> for these industries and there is hope for these industries established at Killybegs.  Incidentally, I think the American market should be explored. If we can sell these goods in the United States we will be able to secure dollars which, I think, the Minister for Finance would be very glad to get, as well as providing useful employment for the workers in the Gaeltacht.  I regret very much that interest has not been maintained to foster these industries. If this matter is not tackled seriously we shall have a continuation of emigration from these areas.  The people cannot possibly live on the small patches of land where there is such a dense population at the present time. They cannot live on a few acres of poor soil, and if employment cannot be provided for them the obvious thing for them to do is to emigrate.  If there is mass emigration from the Gaeltacht I am afraid it will not only kill the Gaeltacht industries, but the Gaeltacht will also be finished.  It is not a pleasant matter for any Party in the House to contemplate.  This is a matter, as I have frequently stated on which all Parties should agree.  We should all put our best effort forward to find a solution of the employment problem in the Gaeltacht areas generally.  It is on these areas we have to look in the future for the livelihood of the country.</P>
      <P>I would particularly request the Minister, when he is concluding, to deal with the oldest industry of them all&mdash; the kelp industry&mdash;and to give an explanation to the people concerned why it is considered that that industry is finished.  I am afraid that the Minister and his Department are not giving as much attention to that particular industry as it deserves.</P>

Deireann an tAire go bhfuil críoch leis an gceilp freisin agus níor chuir sé aon phlean ina ionad os comhair na Dála.</P>
    <P>Ins an bPáipéar Bán a bhaineas le Plean Marshall tá sé ráite faoin gceist a bhí ar siúl againn sa Dáil in dé, ceist na foraiseachta go mba chóir &ldquo;dynamic approach&rdquo; a dhéanamh agus gan amhras má tá an Rialtas chun an plean sin a chur i bhfeidhm caithfidh an &ldquo;dynamic approach&rdquo; a bheith acu, ach cá bhfuil an &ldquo;dynamic approach&rdquo; in obair atá níos tábhachtaí fós?  Mar adúirt mo chomh-Theachta, an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin, baineann an cheist le muintir na Gaeltachta agus ceist na Gaeilge.  Ní amháin go gcuireann sí droch-mhisneach ar mhuintir na Gaeilge féin ó thaobh na Gaeilge dhe agus ó thaobh cúrsaí an tsaoil agus an tslí mhaireachtála atá acu, ach cuireann sí díomá agus déistean ar lucht leanúna na Gaeilge agus ar dhaoine a chreideas sa nGaeilge ins gach áit sa tír.</P>
    <P>Bhí comóradh mór againn le gairid faoi Phoblacht na hÉireann ag teacht i bhfeidhm agus an íobairt a rinneadh Seachtain na Cásca.  Is dóigh liom, dá gcuirfí ceist ar aoinne a bhí páirteach sa gcomóradh sin, go glacfadh sé móid go ndéanfadh sé gach rud abfhéidir leis a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeilge. Ach, cá bhfuil an cruthúnas?  Mar dúirt an Teachta Ó Mongáin&mdash;agus tháinig an smaoineah céanna chugam féin, le linn Príomh-Aire na hIndia a bheith i láthair anseo, cén saghas tuairim a bheadh aige faoi shean-sibhialtacht na hÉireann agus cultúr na hÉireann, go raibh sé anseo i bParlaimint na hÉireann agus, taobh amuigh den phaidir adúirt an Ceann Comhairle agus cúpla focal eile, Béarla ar fad a chuala sé&mdash;an teanga iasachta &mdash;teanga na daoine a bhí dár gcoinneál <Col N="245" /> faoi chois le 750 blian.  Is é an Béarla an teanga a chuala Pandit Nehru sa Teach seo inniu, ar an ócáid stairiúl seo.  B'shin an saghas rud a tharla anseo.  Tá daoine on tír seo amuigh in India, i Ceylon, i Burma, san Éigipt, ag múineadh agus tá na Rialtais nua sna tíortha sin ag tabhairt orthu na teangacha dúchasacha ansin a mhúineadh sna scoileanna agus gan aon rud eile a mhúineadh sna scoileanna nó imeacht as an tír ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tá siad sin sásta, tá an méid sin foghlamtha acu, ó pholaitíocht na hEorpa agus stair na hEorpa, mura raibh sé acu féin ar dtús, an cultúr agus an teanga náisiúnta a chur sa gcéad áit.  Tá mé cinnte, chomh maith leis sin a dhéanamh i gcúrsaí oideachais na dtíortha sin go gcuirfidh siad chun cinn iad sa bParlaimint agus ins gach áit éile.  Táimíd dáíríre faoin nGaeilge nó táimíd ag cur dallamullóg orainn féin.  Cibé slí a bhreathnaímid ar an Meastachán seo, tá sé an-mhí-shásúil.  Tá sé mí-shásúil ó thaobh saol na ndaoine sa nGaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Tá sé as an tslí, más comhartha é den chuspóir agus den sprid atá taobh thiar den Rialtas. Is droch-chomhartha ar fad é.  Ach an comhartha is measa, go bhfuil Rialtas nua againn agus, le linn an toghcháin, sul a dtáinig an Rialtas isteach chualamar a lán cainte faoin imirce, faoin nGaeilge, agus mar sin, go mbeadh ar an Rialtas bheith níos Gaelaí agus níos dáiríre faoi chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, agus go mór mór faoi shlí bheatha na ndaoine sna ceantair bhochta mar an Ghaeltacht, d'fheabhsú. Cá bhfuil an toradh, fiú amháin ceist na dtithe?  Tugann an tAire an leithscéal céanna a thug sé inné, agus b'fhéidir go raibh cúis éigin aige inné.  Do ghlac mise leis, ar aon chuma, mar leithscéal &mdash;go dtiocfadh sé than n-ais le Meastachán <Col N="246" /> sa mbreis don chlár oibre atá leagtha amach aige i gcóir foraoiseachta ach nuair a thagas sé isteach anseo inniu le Meastachán go bhfuil gearradh mór de na milte púnt&mdash;an ceathrú cuid ar fad den Mheastachán, mar adúirt an Teachta Mac Phartaláin, gearrtha&mdash;agus nuair nach bhfuil aon scéal aige faoi cheist na dtithe fiú amháin, agus chomh deacair agus tá sé mórán a dhéanamh an chéad bhliain.  Bhíomar ag fanacht bliain ar an mBille agus anois tá an tAire ag súil go bhfanfaimid bliain eile go dtí go mbeidh toradh éigin ar an Acht sin agus déanann sé iarracht an cheist ar fad do chur ar leataoibh, ag insint dúinn go bhfuil sé chun Meastachán sa mbreis a thabhairt isteach.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil an Roinn Airgeadais ag cur dallamullóg ar an Aire. Dúirt sé féin go raibh a fhios aige go mbeadh fíor-chaoin fáilte ag an Dáil roimh Mheastachán sa mbreis.  Bheadh, i gcónaí, gan amhras, mar is cuma le aon Teachta, ba mhaith leo airgead a chaitheamh ar gach rud is mian leo féin.</P>
      <P>Gan amhras, beidh fíor-chaoin fáilte roimh an Aire má thagann sé thar n-ais le Meastachán sa mbreis.  Ach tá an tAire Airgeadais ann agus an Rialtas agus mura bhfuil an tAire i ndon ar an gcéad dul síos, a bPríomh-Mheastacháin na bliana cé ar bith airgead a theastaíons uaidh a fháil i gcóir tithe nó déantús nó aon rud eile, sílim nach mbeidh an cás chomh láidir aige dul thar n-ais, nuair a bheas an Príomh-Mheastachtán ídithe, ag iarraidh a thuilleadh airgid a fháil i rith na bliana.  D'fhéadfadh an tAire Airgeadais a rá leis: &ldquo;Tá an méid sin faighte agat agus sin an méid atá le fáil agat; ní féidir leat teacht ar ais agus carn mór airgid d'fháil, mar ní raibh sé sna cúnntaisí.&rdquo;  Sin é an rud a tharlaíos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cuid de na háiteanna is measa, ó thaobh tithe, sa nGaeltacht.  Tá áiteanna i dTír Chonaill, tá eastát ansin sna Ros, agus tá an scéal chomh dona gur cheap Coimisiún na Talún nárbh fhiú airgead a chaitheamh ar thithe nua, mar ní raibh de luachail ag an bpaiste talún ach 10/- go dtí 30/-. Tá na céadta&mdash;agus béidir go bhful na mílte&mdash;tithe mar sin ann, gidh go <Col N="247" /> bhfuil Airí eile ag dul thart ar fud na tíre ag caint faoi &ldquo;direct labour&rdquo; agus scéimeanna anseo agus ansúd, ar siúl acu sa gcontae seo, go bhfuil na daoine níos díograsaí, níos neamhspleái, agus b'fhéidir níos sásta a gcion féin a dhéanamh má gheibheann siad cúnamh réasúnta ón Rialtas, Táimid chomh mór chun deiridh anois agus bhíomar le linn an chogaidh.  Níl faic nua dá dhéanamh agua níl coiscéim ar aghaidh déanta againn.  Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil an scéal go han-dona ar fad.  Tá an duine atá i mbun an Marshall Plan sa tír seo ag moladh dúinn uisce beatha agus Belleek ware agus rudaí eile a chur go dtí Meiricá. Ag an am céanna, níl oiread muiníne againn as déantús an bhréidín agus, déantúis eile sa leabhar seo faoi Bhrainse na Gaeltachta, go bhfuilimid sásta an méid airgid a theastaíos a chaitheamh chun athchóir, más gá, a chur ar an scéim ar fad, ionas go bhféadfaidh na déantúis bheith páirteach i cibé plean a bheas ar siúl.  Tá na Meireacánaigh lán-tsásta cúnamh a thabhairt, agus tá na daóine i Meiricá a tháinig on tír seo ar dtús, nó a síol, níos tábhachtaí, níos líonmhaire agus níos fearr ná mar bhí riamh.  Tá na milliúin dollaeraí le caitheamh, deireann an Taidhleoir Meireacánach, nó a fhear ionaid, sa tír seo, má thugaimid faoi chuairteoirí a mhealladh chugainn.</P>
    <P>Má tá suim againn sa nGaeltacht, agus má táimíd ag iarraidh an scéim seo na Gaeltachta a bhí i bhfeidhm ag sean-Rialtas Shasana caithfimid teacht i gcabhair orthu.  Isé sean-Rialtas Shasana agus Arthur James Balfour agus a leithéid, a chur na ranganna sin ar bun ar dtús, faoi Bhord na gCeantar Cúng.  Sa gcéad Chogadh Mór do thit na déantúis sin ar lár agus cuireadh cosc an-mhór leis an obair, mar gheall ar dheactrachtaí iar-chogaidh.  Nuair a tháinig an Rialtas Gaelach isteach, tóg siad an rud idir lámha arís, faoi Choimisiún na Gaeltachta, agus rinne siad a lán, mar chuir an Teachta Mac Phaídín i gcuimhne dúinn, agus tá súil agam nuair a bheas sé ag freagairt go mbeidh an tAire i ndon níos mó dochais a thabhairt dúinn ná mar thug sé ar dtús mar gan amhras cuirfidh an <Col N="248" /> Meastachán seo droch-mhisneach ar éinne a bhfuil suim aige sa scéim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by most of the speeches made, I think there must be a good deal of misunderstanding in the House as to the real nature of the Gaeltacht Services; what they do, how they benefit the people, and how they work.  The Gaeltacht Services division is unlike any other Government Department in the kind of work that it does. It is a section established a considerable number of years ago for the purpose of trying to assist the people in the Gaeltacht areas who, as some Deputy described it, are definitely overcrowded and for whom it was deemed necessary to establish small industries, cottage industries in most cases, if I may say so, so as to give them a chance to supplement their meagre earnings from the little bits of poor-quality land they own in most cases and also to develop from time to time if possible, and if a market could be found for them, new industries.</P>
      <P>This Estimate is down by some £20,000.  Let me say at the outset that that is not a reduction in the true sense of the word.  I am sure Deputy Derrig and Deputy O'Grady realise exactly where the truth lies.  There is only a small provision made for housing for this reason: that the Gaeltacht Housing Bill, which was recently passed by the House, was just being enacted at the time the Estimates were being prepared.  The Supplementary Estimate of between £15,000 and £16,000, which I shall be bringing in in a very short time to meet the expenses arising out of the Bill for housing purposes, will bring this Estimate up to what it was last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deliberately painted a rather gloomy picture in my opening speech. I believe in telling the truth, whether it is for me or against me, and letting the House know exactly how things stand.  Perhaps I may be able to dwell on the brighter side of the situation now after I have heard the speeches made by Deputies.  Deputy Breslin made a very helpful speech, or at least a moderate speech.  Like Deputy MacFadden, Deputy Mongan, <Col N="249" /> and others, who come from the Gaeltacht, he probably knows the difficulties of the situation.</P>
    <P>The biggest industry which the Gaeltacht Services deal with and the one which was the greatest boon to the people of the Gaeltacht areas is the homespun industry.  Next to that comes the millspun tweed industry. Both of these industries have fallen on very evil days.  The slump which has existed now for some 18 to 20 months was in full force at the time I took over the Department of Lands 14 or 15 months ago.  As a matter of fact, in the previous September or October all sales of homespun fell through.  There was an absolute slump.  The result is that to-day we have something like 120,000 yards of good quality homespun on hands.  I think it was Deputy O'Grady who commented on the fact that another Deputy some years back tried to belittle the quality of our homespun.  As I say, we have 120,000 yards of very good quality homespun at present and that has been there since about six or eight months before I took office.  Although the whole energy of the Department has been directed towards trying to find a market or sale for it in practically every country in the world, they have failed completely.  It is left on our hands and we cannot sell it.</P>
    <P>Deputies have called attention to the fact that the Estimate is down by £20,000.  I could have brought in a very misleading Estimate if I wanted to.  As Deputy Derrig knows, under the various sub-heads I could have asked the House for money that I knew in my heart would not be spent and which would be merely a sop to Deputies and to people in the country. What those engaged in this industry want is work and sale for their products. We cannot get a sale for their products.  There is no market for homespun in the world.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that the stopping of the parcel post trade to England is the cause of the trouble. It contributed somewhat to it.  But let no one think that the whole output of the homespun industry in the Gaeltacht could be absorbed by the parcel post trade to England.  We would have to <Col N="250" /> establish a separate Post Office staff to deal with it if that were the case. When I tell the House that we have some 120,000 yards of homespun on hands which we cannot sell, that will show that anyone who thinks that the output of that industry can be disposed of by a parcel post trade is very foolish. I admit that the stoppage of the postal trade to England contributed somewhat towards the slump.  But that was not due to the trade agreement.  England is free and so are we free to stop any particular kind of parcel from going through postal channels.  England was determined to stop that postal trade and the reason is not far to seek. Messrs.  Harris, of Scotland, who are our most serious competitors in this line, went into action immediately after the European war ceased and simply flooded the whole English market with a better quality of homespun than we had on hands at that time; not a better quality than we can turn out, but a better quality than we had on hands at that time and had to offer for sale.  Thereupon, the sale of our homespun ceased.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltarra Éireann agents have tried every possible market in Europe. They are exploring the United States at the present time.  I do not want to mislead anyone.  I do not think that there is any hope in the near future or even in the distant future of disposing of the 120,000 yards of excellent homespun which we have there in the Gaeltarra Éireann depot.  There are four floors in that building and it is crammed from cellar to roof with the best quality of material which we cannot sell.  The same thing applies to the millspun tweed.  I would have liked some Deputies to put forward suggestions which would help me in regard to that matter.  I would not ask them to find a market for the material; as the experts have already failed to find one. France does not want it, Italy does not want it, Belgium does not want it, and England does not want it because, as I said, England is flooded out with Harris tweed of a better quality than this homespun.  There may be some opening&mdash;I do not want anyone to pin their hopes on this&mdash;in the United States; I hope there is.  So far we have met with rebuff after rebuff to <Col N="251" /> such an extent that I am loath even to hope for a market in the United States for the vast quantity of material we have on hands.</P>
    <P>Not alone for the homespun and millspun industries, but for the toy industry and various other branches of industry in the Gaeltacht we have £94,000 worth of raw material on hands to put the workers at work if there is a market for the products which they produce out of that material.  It is like the turf problem last year when there were large dumps of turf in the Phoenix Park and coal was coming in. Did anyone suggest last year that we should keep on producing turf for which there was no market?  I am in the same position in connection with the homespun tweed industry.  Am I to ask the weavers in Donegal, Clare, Connemara and Kerry to produce homespun tweed and ask the taxpayers to pay for it when there is no market for the 120,000 yards which we have? If somebody puts down a motion that, regardless of what it costs taxpayers, I should instruct the homespun weavers to go ahead producing material even though there is no market and no likelihood of a market for what they produce, that would be all right.  But I could not take the responsibility of doing that.  If the House takes the responsibility, well and good.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the millspun tweed industry.  There may be some hope for that industry by turning out a better quality material than we could turn out during the war.  We can turn out first-class quality material. We shall try to do that and we are working very carefully along these lines to develop it.</P>
    <P>Someone said that those engaged in these industries are emigrating.  No one regrets more than I do the fact that anyone would leave the country, especially skilled workers.  These are people who possess a degree of skill that it takes years to acquire.  Their skill and their expert handling of material is something that has come down to them through their families for generations.  I do not want to see one of them leaving the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady mentioned the kelp industry.  It was revived temporarily <Col N="252" /> during the war as a source of supply of potash.  The kelp that was available 15 or 18 years ago was a very valuable source of iodine, but when somebody discovered huge deposits of material in the form of Chilean nitrates, at a cheaper price, that finished the kelp industry.  As I have said, it was revived temporarily during the war.  The moment potash came on the market after the war there was no further demand for the kelp.  That represents the gloomy side of the picture.  I am glad to say, however, that a new and unexpected market has now come along for another type of seaweed.  I refer to searods.  I hope that, during the coming season, the people along our coasts will gather every ounce of searods they can.  Yesterday, I introduced the Alginate Industries Bill.  It will put this industry in Connemara on a firm and sound footing.  The drying and the grinding of these searods for the production of alginate acid will provide a better industry for the people than ever the kelp did.  The kelp industry was killed the moment potash became available.  This new industry will provide an outlet for the people along the coasts who heretofore made a living from gathering kelp.  The searods industry is going to be something bigger and better.  There is no use in asking the people along the coast to gather kelp because there is no market for it.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  It has been said that no provision is made for Gaeltacht houses.  I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate in connection with that.  I regret that some Deputies should have chosen to mislead their own people, the very people whom the Act was intended to benefit. I regret that they should have chosen deliberately to mislead those people and to create doubts in their minds as to the wisdom of accepting a grant or of applying for a grant.  A few days after the Bill was signed by the President and became law a Galway Deputy wrote to a newspaper along these lines. He said it was stated at an interview that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;houses built under the proposed new Act will be free of rates for 20 years.  This is not so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> That is so.  The house will carry whatever rate was on the old house which the new one is intended to replace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <P>Deputy Bartley should try and find other people to make ducks and drakes of than the poor people the Act is intended to benefit. I said that I wanted to have that Act as free as possible from red tape and trappings.  The Deputy wrote a letter to the <i>Connacht Tríbune</i> on the 5th March that was deliberately intended to convey the impression to the people of the Gaeltacht that the Act was not a good one.  I am giving £25 of a grant more than they got from the Department of Local Government, and the very same conditions apply as have applied under previous Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  These houses will only carry whatever rate the old houses they are intended to replace carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say this: that the Department of Lands is peculiarly suited for the relief of these people.  We have, first of all, the Land Commission; secondly, the Forestry Department, and, thirdly, the Gaeltacht Services.  I am anxious to develop all these industries and provide a livelihood for the people in spinning, making toys, in weaving and all the rest of it. When the bottom falls out of a market for the materials we are producing we have to try and find an alternative.  I can say that we are straining every possible nerve to provide alternative industries.  You may have the sudden over-night collapse of some particular market.  That occurred when the last European war came to an end.  When a market collapses suddenly like that you cannot provide an alternative industry over-night.  It takes time.  In the case of knitting machines, for example, women and girls have to adapt themselves to their use.  That takes time.  The garments or articles they turn out at first may not be perfect. No one could expect that.  A man, for example, who had been trained to some other form of employment and had to turn to do the work of a blacksmith or to work on land in which he had no experience could not be expected to prove expert at the start.  No one would expect good results from him.</P>
      <P>We are making experiments with carpet making.  We are feeling our way.  When the homespun tweed industry failed we tried every possible means of finding an alternative market.  Deputy Brady finds fault with us because we are spending £7,000 on advertising as against £2,000 previously.  The object of that is to try to get a market for the £101,000 of stuff we have on hands.  We want to see if we can sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy grumbled about the cost of the depôt.  We have <Col N="255" /> that amount of finished material on hands.  It is of first-class quality, but we have failed to sell it.  There is a little glimmer of hope at the present time.</P>
      <P>Since I introduced the Gaeltacht Estimate last year, I have been hoping that every time one of our agents explored a new market he would have good news for me, but in every instance it was a case of &ldquo;No, we do not want it.&rdquo;  We have offered the material at a ridiculously low price, a price even less than what it cost to produce, but even then we could not sell it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Con Lehane felt dissatisfied with the whole situation.  He cannot be more dissatisfied than I am.  He asked if a Supplementary Estimate was needed would it be forthcoming.  Any Supplementary Estimate that I may need for that purpose will be forthcoming. It has been sniggered and sneered at that the Minister for Lands wants to save on the Gaeltacht.  Deputy Derrig was the Minister for Lands for a period.  He knows that the Department of Finance in the Cumann na hGaedheal, the Fianna Fáil and the present days has not made the slightest effort to save on the Gaeltacht Services.  We have no intention of trying to save on the very poorest of our people, people for whom a special service was established in order to come to their rescue.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the dropping of the turf industry.  The dropping of the turf industry was a fearful blow in some areas&mdash;in Donegal, Mayo and Galway.  It was a fearful blow to those areas when the coal came in.  Whatever little upset was caused by the stoppage of the turf industry, it is somewhat akin to this.  There was no market for turf, and why should we go ahead producing something for which there was no market?  I cannot ask the weavers in Donegal, because it is there the largest number are, to produce a material for which there is no market, and no hope of a market.</P>

    <P>I realise that I have painted a gloomy picture.  I want to inform the House that any Supplementary Estimate I may need will be forthcoming in the shortest possible time.  I have <Col N="256" /> that assurance from the Minister for Finance.  I hope the occasion will arise soon when I shall have to come here for a big Supplementary Estimate.  I know the people who are affected quite well&mdash;they are within eight or ten miles from my own place.  We are endeavouring to start new industries.  We are trying to get one going at Tourmakeady. We have plenty of machinery. Indeed, there is some of it idle.  We do not need to purchase new machinery.</P>
    <P>We have been asked about the materials in our possession.  We have about £93,000 worth on hands and there is no hope of getting rid of the finished articles.  I could have asked for money for machinery, but that would be rather misleading the House.  If I asked for more money Deputies would imagine everything was all right, but Deputies must remember that I would have to come here next year and say: &ldquo;I asked you for £100,000 but I could spend only £10,000.&rdquo;  I do not believe in that nonsense.  I believe that Deputies who are most critical of myself and of the Department, when they know the truth, will be prepared to help me, and I shall be thankful if they do.</P>

      <P>Can I take it from what the Minister says that shortage of money, or any money difficulty, will not prevent the Minister coming to the House and asking it to vote moneys in order to provide for development in the Gaeltacht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely not.  Money is no trouble in this case.  The trouble is that we have certain little industries going and, if we except the knitwear and toys, there is not a good market for what is produced.  These two branches are going well; there is a first-class market for them.  There are plenty of girls in various centres making a nice living out of these industries. These two things are going well because there is a demand for them. As regards the homespuns and mill-spuns, the bottom has completely fallen out of the market for them.  We have offered them at a price that I would be ashamed to mention, but still we cannot get them taken.  I believe if we offered them for nothing they would not be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> It is a strange situation.  I cannot understand why, immediately after a world shortage of clothing material, some country does not want our products, even at the ridiculously low prices we are asking.  We have tried to drive trade bargains with other countries. We have even tried to get them to take our stuff in exchange for materials that we would purchase from them, but they will not have it.  They will even forgo selling their own material rather than enter into such a bargain.  That has happened in one instance.</P>
    <P>There have been quite a lot of points raised, but I do not intend to follow them all up.  Deputy Brady asked that we should continue to purchase certain millspun material under some Emergency Powers Order.  Any contract that Gaeltarra Éireann enters into with a particular factory will be honoured. Where we give a contract we will take the responsibility.  We will purchase whether there is a sale for it or not; we will honour our bond and purchase from them.  Deputy Brady's mind can rest assured in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is not a pleasing outlook, but I thought it best to let the House and the country know how things stand rather than polish or paint it up and present a false picture.  There is not a market for our stuff and I do not see much hope for a market.  Perhaps the sun may burst through the clouds sooner than we expect; perhaps our agents will be able to find a market.  If they do, no one will be as proud as I will be.</P>
    <P>As regards the cutting down of the Estimate, the intention was merely to give the House a true picture of the situation.  I could have presented an Estimate for £100,000 more, but that would be merely putting figures on paper to deceive the House.  I would have to come here next year and Deputies would probably ask me &ldquo;You sought £50,000 on one sub-head last year and you spent only £10,000 and we would like to know the cause.&rdquo;  I do not believe in adopting underhand tactics or any subterfuge of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have not cut down the Estimate for reasons of economy.  We have in our possession machinery that is not being worked.  We have at least 16 <Col N="258" /> knitting machines on hands.  We hppe to have some of them operating in Tourmakeady one of these days.  We also hope to have some operating in the vocational schools that the Minister has offered me in Achill.  I hope to have them operating on some material for which we will find a market.  There is a lump of unsold stuff there but nothing can be done about it until the whole market position changes.  I hope that will be soon.  During the year Deputy MacFadden and Deputy Mongan were after me frequently asking was there any hope, but I could only answer &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a high compliment to our agents, who have left no stone unturned.  They have travelled by air to every country in Europe and they have gone even to the United States trying to get a market.  On every possible occasion that we could push our wares we did so.  The whole thing can be summed up in this sentence: &ldquo;Our goods are not wanted at the moment.&rdquo;  I hope, before we find it necessary to come here with a Supplementary Estimate, that the scene will be brighter for homespuns and mill-spuns.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned that there was an increase in one sub-head for fuel. That is because we have to provide a turf reserve.  We burn turf in every instance to provide power and heat. Largely because of the vagaries of the weather, we also have to keep a reserve of crude oil on hands so that if a bad summer comes we will not be caught without proper fuel.  That is the reason for the increase with regard to fuel.</P>

      <P>A certain amount is being allocated for the Gaeltacht. Only a small fraction of the total amount is appropriated for different Government services and the Minister has not indicated what <i>quid pro quo</i> the Gaeltacht is likely to get in exchange for this saving or economy, or whatever he may wish to call it. The fact is that this service is being cut down and in all future years it will be cut down just the same, in my opinion.  The tendency will be to look upon this, if it is carried through the House now, as a year in which a saving or an economy was effected and that will be taken as the basis for all future years.  The Minister asked me as a former Minister did I not agree that the Minister for Finance did not interfere.  I could not say that the Minister for Finance did not interfere. I take the Minister for Finance to be the guardian, as has been stated before from these benches, of the taxpayer. It is his duty to see that the money is expended properly.  I can have no quarrel with the Minister for Finance in carrying out his duty as he thinks right and proper.  But the point is&mdash;and I tried to explain it earlier when, I was speaking &mdash; that this rural industry service is not independent. It is not like the Electricity Supply Board, which can raise money in its own particular way.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has nothing helpful to put forward I do not see where this is leading.  I have given a frank and candid explanation of the entire situation.  I have painted the picture.  Perhaps the picture is not too bright, but it was no pleasure to me to come in here and paint a gloomy picture because there was no market for our stuff.  I could have made much more capital out of the fact that we have £93,000 worth of raw material on hands which is not accounted for at all in the Vote.  Yet the Deputy endeavours to show that there has been an economy in this Department.  There has been no economy.  I have a perfectly free hand.  I shall have a free hand in the future.  Does that reassure the Deputy?  As an ex-Minister and as one who was himself in charge of this particular Department on one occasion I do not think it is fitting that he should mislead the.  House or misrepresent the facts.  That is not worthy of the Deputy and it certainly does not reflect any great credit upon him as an erstwhile Minister.</P>

If he does that I can assure him that I shall come into the House very quickly with a Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Infanticide Bill, 1949&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Justice (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may be said to have had its origin in the report of a committee of judges which, some years ago, at the request of one of my predecessors, considered and reported on the law and practice relating to capital punishment.  The committee consisted of the then Chief Justice (the late Hon. Timothy O'Sullivan), the present Chief Justice who was at the time President of the High Court, Mr. Justice O'Byrne and the late Mr. Justice Hanna.  The committee, in their report which they presented in 1941, recommended, amongst other things, that the crime of infanticide should be dealt with by legislation in similar terms to the Infanticide Act which was passed by the British Parliament in 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government have accepted the judges' recommendation in principle, they have not, in the Bill to which I now ask the House to give a Second Reading, followed exactly the lines of the British legislation.  Before <Col N="265" /> I explain the reasons for this departure from the literal recommendation of the Judges, it may be useful to say a word about the present law and practice in this matter.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law an unmarried mother, to take the most usual type of case, who wilfully kills her child is guilty of murder and liable to be sentenced to death, unless she establishes a defence on the ground of insanity. Modern medical opinion strongly favours the view, however, that a woman, although not insane in the sense that would enable her to establish a defence on that ground to a charge of murder, might suffer from such disturbance of the mind in the circumstances attendant or following on the birth of the child that she would not be fully responsible for her actions. In practice, for many years no woman has been hanged for the murder of her infant child.  I understand that in the majority of the cases the charge of murder is reduced to one of concealment of birth and in a few cases in recent years in which women have been convicted of the murder of their infants the sentence of death has been commuted.</P>
    <P>Now, it will, I think, be agreed on all sides that it is desirable that the law should be altered so as to eliminate, in appropriate cases, the pronouncement of the death sentence in these cases in which everybody knows that the sentence will not be carried out.  But, in framing our legislative proposals to deal with the situation, we must, I submit, be careful to avoid any suggestion that the Legislature of this country has become less conscious of, or less concerned about, the sanctity of human life.  Accordingly, the wilful killing of a human being, whether that human being be a newly-born infant or a man or woman in the prime of life, must remain an offence that will, <i>prima facie</i>, constitute murder and will be capable of being punished as such by the infliction of the death penalty, so long as that penalty remains the punishment for the crime of murder under the laws of this State.  I think that, in the Bill before the House, we have succeeded in achieving this object while at the same <Col N="266" /> time achieving a position in which, in appropriate cases, it will no longer be necessary to subject unfortunate girls to the strain of undergoing a trial for murder and of being sentenced to death.</P>
    <P>The British Act contented itself with creating and defining the crime of infanticide and then making the necessary consequential provisions.  The Bill, on the other hand, clearly implies, though it does not expressly say so, that the charge initially against a woman who wilfully causes the death of her infant child will be a charge of murder.  It will be for the District Court in the first instance, on the preliminary investigation of the charge, after having heard the evidence including the evidence as to the mental state of the woman at the time of the offence, to decide whether or not the accused shall be sent forward for trial on a charge of murder or on a charge of infanticide.  This is provided for in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 1 provides a safeguard for the case in which the justice may decide to return the accused on the major charge of murder by enabling the jury, at the trial, to return a verdict of infanticide if they are satisfied on the evidence that she is guilty of that offence and not of murder.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 1 defines the crime of infanticide and provides that it shall be an offence which may be tried and punished in the same way as manslaughter.  This, in practice, will mean that when a district justice, in pursuance of his powers under sub-section (1) of Section 1, alters a charge of murder to one of infanticide, he may return the accused for trial by the Circuit Criminal Court and not by the Central Criminal Court.  I do not think that I need dwell at this stage on the definition of infanticide contained in the Bill.  The definition is, I think self-explanatory and, if Deputies think it necessary that it should be considered in detail, that can, I suggest, be more appropriately done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, it only remains for me to say a word in explanation of sub-section <Col N="267" /> (4) of Section 1.  This sub-section, in effect, provides for a necessary and obviously desirable consequential amendment of Section 60 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which at present enables a jury to return a verdict of concealment of birth in the case of a woman charged with the murder of her infant child. Sub-section (4) of Section 1 proposes to empower the jury similarly to return a verdict of concealment of birth when the charge is one of infanticide.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this Bill.  As the Minister has stated, it was as a result of an inquiry into the whole question of capital punishment, apart from the question of infanticide, that this recommendation from the judges was made.  So far as I can recollect, the judges did not give any advice whatever on the major question of capital punishment but they did recommend that the question of infanticide should be dealt with by this Bill. It was drafted, if I am not mistaken, before we left office and the reason for the delay in producing it was that we thought that Bills of this nature, which are of a fairly technical character, would benefit by their being first looked over by a law reform committee which we were in process of establishing before we left office.  We were on the point of doing that before the election took place.  There were other Bills also of a rather technical nature on the stocks at the time.  There was one introduced by the present Taoiseach, when he was in opposition, and it was of such a nature that in the opinion of my advisers it would be well to have it submitted for consideration by a law reform committee such as we were setting up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has brought in this Bill, I take it that this committee has not been set up and that he has not had the advantage of its advice.  I think he would be wise, for the sake of the Government and of the help it would be to the House, if he fortified himself with the opinions of a law reform committee with regard to Bills <Col N="268" /> of this type.  I admit that this Bill is overdue and that it is only right that it should be in the power of a district justice to reduce a charge from the major one of murder in certain cases.</P>
    <P>There may be people who will think that this Bill will be a lesser deterrent to those who might be inclined to kill their children, but I do not think so. When such things happen you will find that the woman was in a frenzy or that her mind was disturbed.  That goes without saying and I do not think the Bill will have any such effect.  Legal members will agree with me that it would be a great benefit to have the advice of such a committee as has been mentioned before a Bill of this kind is drafted.  Naturally the Minister need not take all the advice he gets, but he would have the advantage of it and we would all appreciate it.  Questions have been put down by members of the Government Parties as to what has been the fate of that committee.  I put down a couple and I am not going to put down any more, but the Minister for his own sake would be well advised to go ahead with the idea.  I think I had succeeded after a long fight in getting Finance to agree to whatever expense would be involved in setting up that committee and that part being got over the Minister ought not let it go.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I welcome this Bill and that I am very pleased that the Minister has brought it in.  I am also glad that the Bill has been received by Deputy Boland on behalf of the Opposition in the House in the way he has done so here this evening.  Undoubtedly the Bill is long overdue.  Any person who has had the unfortunate experience of being in court and seeing one of these charges of murder dealt with, the whole procedure gone through, the whole panoply of the law utilised right down to the final sentence of death, was harrowed by the experience.  I think that the Minister for Justice has done a great day's work in introducing a Bill that will end that unfortunate position.  For many years this reform has been recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the broader aspect touched on by Deputy Boland. <Col N="269" /> I do not think it would be taken as being in order on the Bill, but I do agree that some form of committee ought to be established to revise the laws generally, particularly&mdash;and I think it would be appropriate to mention it here&mdash;the Criminal Law; to revise it, codify it, bring it up to date and make it readily accessible to everybody. I think that suggestion will be welcomed by the Minister.  It is a good thing to know that a humanitarian measure of this kind can be introduced in this House in the way it has been introduced and that it can be received and accepted by the House in the way this Bill has been accepted.  It may be that on the Committee Stage some members may suggest amendments.  I cannot say that for myself at the moment, but if there are any amendments that will improve the Bill I am quite sure that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to them. With those words I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the principle of this Bill but it just occurs to me that there appears to be some inconsistencies in it. Section I reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the preliminary investigation by the District Court of a charge against a woman for the murder of her child, being a child under the age of 12 months, the justice may, if he thinks proper, alter the charge to one of infanticide and send her forward for trial on that charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a contradiction in terms. Murder is murder and the offence of infanticide as created by this Bill is another matter altogether.  This Bill proceeds to empower a district justice to decide whether it is in fact murder or whether it is infanticide and these are two different matters.  If Section 1 instead of the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; read &ldquo;killing of her child&rdquo; it would be another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3) three conditions are laid down.  The district justice must be satisfied of a combination of these three conditions before he can find that the accused should be returned on a charge of infanticide. <Col N="270" /> With regard particularly to (c), if a justice finds that the act or commission on the part of the accused was due to mental disturbance and that she was not mentally capable, then it could not be found that the accused was guilty of the crime of murder.  According to the machinery of the law the accused is sent forward to the Central Criminal Court on a charge of murder, but in actual practice it is reduced to something like concealment of birth and if the accused is in the position described in (c) the only punishment meted out by the court is to send her to some suitable home or to impose a suspensory sentence.  I would like to point out to the Minister that if we are to empower the district justice to determine, sitting as judge and jury himself in the District Court, whether the charge should be one of murder or of infanticide and if we are enabling him to find that the charge is not in fact one of murder but of infanticide according to the provisions of this Bill, then I think the Minister should go a step further and authorise the district justice to deal with the matter.  If you are enabling the district justice to find, according to the circumstances, whether the charge amounts to murder or to something less than murder, infanticide according to this Bill, I do not think public time and the machinery of the courts should be taken up in sending the unfortunate accused forward if she has been found by the district justice to be guilty of the offence of infanticide.</P>
    <P>We all know what happens in these cases.  As a matter of practice, I do not know that any useful purpose is served by sending forward people guilty of infanticide, as it is described in this Bill, and arraigning them before a jury, having the judge to make an order sending these people to some suitable home or binding them over for a period of 12 months as usually occurs. Once the district court has decided that it is in fact infanticide I do not see why a District Court should not be empowered to deal suitably with such people.  I think that in other cases where something more than infanticide is concerned or in any case where there might be some doubt there should by all means be some form of a <Col N="271" /> trial.  However, where it is found as a fact that it is infanticide I think they should not be sent further and that we should empower the district justices to deal with these unfortunate people. They have to be sent off to prison to await their trial, if they cannot get bail, and be arraigned before judge and jury.  The only effect of that is to prolong the agony in their cases.  I do not think there is any useful purpose to be served by that.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that particular aspect of the problem between now and the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and the principle embodied in it.  Anybody connected with either branch of the legal profession recognises and realises that the present state of the law is an anachronism and in so far as this Bill alters that position it should be welcomed.  Deputy Moran carried me quite a considerable distance of the way with him in the arguments he advanced for the insertion in the Bill of a section giving power to the district justice to deal finally with the charge.  But perhaps, on more mature consideration, it might be wiser to pass the Bill in its present form rather than to take too big a step and to make too sudden an alteration in the state of the law.  Certainly cogent arguments could be advanced for giving that power to the district justice but I think that we should, perhaps, at this stage content ourselves with the advance that is envisaged in the terms of the Bill and for the present, at any rate, leave it at that.</P>
      <P>There is just one other matter that could be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  Section I begins as follows: &ldquo;On the preliminary investigation by the District Court on a charge against a woman for the murder of her child....&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage those words should be amended to read: &ldquo;On the preliminary investigation by the District Court of a charge against a woman for the unlawful killing of her child....&rdquo;  I welcome the Bill and the principle embodied in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been generally agreed that the principle embodied in this Bill has been long overdue.  I do not think it can be said that it will probably tend to make the crime of infanticide more general.  As Deputy Boland has said, it probably very seldom arises in the mind of the unfortunate woman or girl whether the crime she is about to commit is murder or infanticide.  The mere fact that Section 1 has created some little controversy seems to add to Deputy Boland's argument that this is a Bill that would probably be better dealt with by a committee on law reform. However, be that as it may.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to Section 1 and to the responsibility it throws on a district justice.  The district justice, in most criminal offences in which depositions are taken, has before him simply evidence of fact.  The State is morally bound to produce all the known facts surrounding the circumstances of the alleged crime and put them before the district justice in the first instance and, if the accused is returned for trial, before a judge and jury.  As I see it, this section does not provide for any assistance for the justice by which he can make up his mind as to the mental state of the accused person.  I think at present that if the authorities bring a charge for murder, which they expect to be commuted to infanticide, before a justice, they are simply bringing evidence of fact, police witnesses and so on, and there is no obligation on them to bring medical evidence as to the mental state of the accused.  Without that, I think the responsibility imposed on the justice is far too onerous.  If the practice will then be not to bring forward medical evidence, the onus will be on the accused.  That, I think, will lead to what is considered an undesirable practice so far as the accused is concerned, namely, disclosing her hand.  In other words, she will have to bring forward evidence on preliminary investigation before a justice.  It will probably mean bringing in her own doctor in order to prove that her mental state was such as to entitle a justice to change the charge from murder to infanticide. Therefore it would start the accused <Col N="273" /> more or less on the wrong foot.  The Minister should look into that section and see if he can possibly extend it to meet the particular case I refer to.  I think the general practice is that these offences are treated largely like concealment of birth and that, in the long run, even without this Act, the practice would still be the same.  The accused would be committed to some reformatory or some home where she would give an undertaking to stay for a certain time.  However, it is just as well that the law has been put into a positive position such as this Bill envisages, but I would ask the Minister to look into the suggestions which have been made from both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it has been long overdue. A corresponding measure was passed in England as far back, I think, as the year 1922.  For a great number of years past I have had some experience of this class of case.  You often have the case of a woman who is placed on trial for her life, with all the significance that surrounds that particular trial, and you have the trial finishing up with the woman agreeing to go into a home for 12 months or, as I have known in some cases, the woman sentenced to the rising of the court provided somebody is prepared to look after her.  That rather throws derision at what you might call a murder trial. However, it is important that we should not pass away from treating every real murder as a case of murder. In this Bill we have created a new crime called infanticide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a criticism to offer.  I do not agree with the last speaker, Deputy Lynch, in regard to the onus.  As far as I can see the position is that the onus would be thrown not on the accused person but on the State as the law exists at the present time.  I think that would apply in the District Court in the same way as it would apply in the court of trial.  As this is a new offence I think it should be treated as such and should be adequately defined; its punishment and its court of trial should be considered.  The Circuit Courts, at the present time, have jurisdiction in the case of manslaughter but <Col N="274" /> there is no jurisdiction in the case of murder.  As far as I understand it, under this Bill practically all cases which ultimately will be decided as infanticide cases will go through tho whole business of a full-dress murder trial in the ordinary way because it will be difficult for the district justice to decide upon the evidence brought before him upon deposition as to whether the case is one of murder or of infanticide.  There may be cases in which it would be wrong for the defendant on trial for murder, from her point of view, to disclose what the particular defence is to be before the district justice with a view to getting a particular charge reduced from murder to infanticide.  I think it would be very much better from a practical point of view in the interests of justice-and of the person accused if it was treated as a separate new offence, a court of trial indicated and its punishment indicated.  It says here that the offence may be &ldquo;punished as for manslaughter&rdquo;. The punishment for manslaughter ranges from a suspensory sentence to 15 years' penal servitude according to the degree of culpability of the defendant found guilty.  The time has come when something should be done to define the different degrees of manslaughter.  In the United States they have homicide of first, second and, I believe, third degree; distinctions are made.  While I think that this Bill should be accepted in its present form at the present time because it will fill a long-felt want, I do say that it is not perfect in some respects.  I believe it is a step in the right direction.  I should like to give an illustration of what I was saying just now.  The offence may be tried as for manslaughter. Does that mean that in the event of the district justice deciding it is not a case of murder but of infanticide it is to be sent to the Circuit Court or is it to go to the Central Criminal Court as for a murder trial? That is a matter which will have to be cleared up.  If it were to be tried as for manslaughter it would be sent to the local Circuit Court with a reduction in expense to the State and to the defendant.  I do not think it is quite clear in this Bill to what particular court the defendant is to be sent.  I <Col N="275" /> welcome this Bill but I do think that there are certain alterations and additions which could be made to it to make it a more perfect Bill.  I have looked through the English Act of 1929. I do not suggest for a moment that any example should be taken from it because I think that the Bill we have here is infinitely better than the English one as it stands.  But I do not think either has the actual practical requirements in a case in which life has been lost as to the court of trial.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now. Deputy O'Higgins is a lawyer and he will know the answer.  That remark is prompted by the feeling that I think this is a case where it would have been desirable to have other Deputies who do not see it from the procedural point of view taking an interest.  We are dealing with a fundamental question of right and wrong.  There is such a thing as objective right and wrong.  We are dealing with unlawful killing&mdash;murder. In dealing with such a subject one has to approach it fundamentally in a different way from what I might call merely procedural matters.  Many of our laws are really regulations for running the community and they do not fundamentally affect what I have called objective right and wrong.  In other words, they do not fundamentally affect God's law.  There are other matters which do, such as this Bill covers.  We have no discretion in this matter; the thing is either right or wrong.  The first thing we have to do in looking at the principle of this Bill is to contemplate the killing of a child by its mother within a year of its birth and to consider the law of punishment <Col N="276" /> applicable to that.  It is conceivable that in many cases&mdash;in fact, it is very probable&mdash;coming within that category such a killing will be murder pure and simple objectively.  In other cases, and perhaps they are in the majority, the degree of personal guilt on the part of the killer will be moderated by a certain state of mental aberration resulting from a physical condition.  The whole category of crime which you have to consider will embrace everything ranging from possible complete lack of responsibility due to complete mental incapacity to cold-blooded, wilful and unadulterated murder.  In the circumstances I am inclined to ask myself whether fundamentally as a matter of law it is competent to this House to make a distinction in the nature of the crime.  I use the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; designedly because there is such a thing as objective right and wrong.  That objectivity governs us here as well as it governs anywhere else but perhaps the more practical question is whether it is proper for us in this House to legislate in this way providing for recognised degrees of responsibility in the case of such a crime as this.  In other words, the question I am asking myself is whether it would not be wiser for us to leave the crime as it stands and not attempt to make a separate category but merely make provision for mitigating, the punishment in the face of certain circumstances. I raise that question in no contentious or argumentative spirit. I do it because there is, as I have said, a question of objective right and wrong involved and, secondly, because I would be very careful in matters of this nature in following English precedent. I would not be too happy blindly to subscribe to anything resulting from the traditions of English liberal thought on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having posed that question, I ask this one.  What is the case for making any alteration in the law at all?  As Deputy Moran said, murder is murder. The case is the one which has been mentioned by Deputy Sir John Esmonde and Deputy Captain Cowan. It is one of difficulties in procedure and, in particular, that one was always up against the difficulty that, if you charged a person with murder and the <Col N="277" /> jury did not feel that it was a case for the death sentence, they were inclined to acquit.  The very severity of the proceedings operated to defeat justice.  That is one argument in the case.  But, as against that, on the form of the Bill as it stands, is it right, where a question of objective right and wrong is concerned, so to speak, even if only formally, to facilitate the commission of a crime which, objectively, is nothing short of murder?</P>
    <P>For that reason, if I were approaching the matter, I should be inclined to take this view.  I would leave the crime called murder.  I would recognise that the crime is murder, murder in God's law or natural law, if you like, with the qualification put on to it with regard to culpability or competency. Let the crime be recognised as murder and then make specific provisions for the mitigation of the punishment to suit a particular case. I do recognise that that is easily stated, but that to draft a practical proposal on these lines is not quite the same thing,</P>
    <P>What can you do?  First of all you can leave the <i>status quo</i> as it is.  You can let the person be tried, convicted of murder, duly sentenced, and leave it as the function of the Executive, as a prerogative of mercy, to remit the sentence or otherwise modify it as the circumstances seem to demand.  That perhaps, from one approach, would be the more or less proper thing to do, provided you authorise the Executive to do more than reprieve, that is to attach whatever would be a suitable penalty.  That is one possible solution. Incidentally, I might mention, with respect to the speaker who said it, that I do not see why there should be any objection to the full formalities of the trial.  I do not see why such a terrible thing as the killing of a child should not be dealt with as a solemn and extremely serious procedure. I do not think that argument carries so much weight.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is in the Bill and, perhaps, everybody exercising his own ingenuity could find other alternatives. Briefly, they would be sorted out into the two categories I have mentioned. As a solution, what should we do? <Col N="278" /> Perhaps, procedurally, the Bill goes very near the mark.  Personally, I would urge that we should recognise that murder is murder.  There may be excuses for the person committing it. I admit that I am not using the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; in the sense of the definition of the legal text-book, because one has to consider the public and our own outlook on this as well.  I would be inclined to use the word &ldquo;murder.&rdquo; This word &ldquo;infanticide&rdquo; savours a bit too much to my mind of English liberal thought.  Then, what is the objection to doing, what in fact you are doing under Section 2&mdash;letting it go forward to the jury to find whether the person is guilty or not, but leaving it open to them to find that, at the time of the act, the balance of the mother's mind was disturbed by reason of not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child, or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child.  Let the jury include that finding if the case warrants it, and either give a discretionary power to the judge in regard to the penalty, or else to the Executive.</P>
    <P>Approaching it from that point of view, in fact approaching it from the point of view of the Bill, if I understand Deputy Sir John Esmonde aright, I am inclined to agree with what he said about Section 1.  If you read this Bill carefully, you will find that Section 1 virtually leaves it to the district justice to decide whether it is murder or infanticide.  In other words, the district justice, when he takes the depositions, has to make up his mind whether he will return the woman for trial on a charge of murder or on a charge of infanticide.  Does that not mean that he is deciding the question as to which the crime is and merely leaving it to the jury to find whether the person is guilty of any crime or not?  Is not that the effect of Section 1?:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the preliminary investigation by the District Court of a charge against a woman for the murder of her child, being a child under the age of 12 months, the justice may, if he thinks proper, alter the charge to one of infanticide and send her forward for trial on that charge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Does that not mean that the district justice decides the question of murder as against infanticide and merely leaves it to the jury to find whether she is guilty of any charge at all?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran suggested that you should leave the whole thing to the district justice.  Personally, I could not subscribe to that view.  Murder is murder, to use his own words.  It is a serious thing in principle and in fact for the community.  The fact that an unfortunate child is under the age of 12 months does not in any way alter the gravity of the crime.  That child has the same right to live, the same place in the sun, as any other human being.  I cannot see why its killing should be treated as being of such a trivial nature that jurisdiction should be given to the District Court.  Consequently I must differ with my Colleague, Deputy Moran, on that point.  As Deputy Sir John Esmonde pointed out there is to some extent an anomaly there.  I hope I am not misquoting the Deputy but that is what I understand him to point out, that there is an anomaly there.  Again, for that very reason which is a technical one quite apart from the more objective reason which I tried to mention earlier&mdash;a purely technical reason in regard to drafting in Section 1 I suggest that the word murder be retained. In other words, if you retain the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; the district justice returns for trial simpliciter as heretofore and you are not complicating the issue by bringing in the element of decision as to the nature of the crime, or consequent punishment at the deposition stage.  If you do as I am suggesting then the woman goes forward on a charge of murder but you so alter the law that you empower the jury to find a certain qualification in certain cases and the jury so find.  I think that that procedure will equally well meet the purposes for which this is intended while maintaining the proper attitude to the degree of crime involved.  The danger is that we are focussing ourselves on the case that we too frequently see forgetting the other case of murder embraced in this particular enactment.  I press my point with a view <Col N="280" /> to showing and maintaining the respect which this House must hold for human life and the human soul.  The question as to whether it should be remission or whether the judge should be empowered is another day's work but should be capable of practical solution.  What I am trying to say is that here you are dealing not merely with man law but with the objective law of the universe and with fundamental natural law. Consequently, we must avoid the pitfalls into which we might be brought by the emanations of liberal thought. Having got our feet on the ground in regard to the principle we have to look to the practical problems from the point of view of effectively enforcing the law, having balanced on the one hand too severe restrictions which would defeat themselves and, on the other hand, too lenient provisions which in effect operate to encourage or if not to encourage not sufficiently to deter a certain type of crime.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to Section 4 of the Bill it might be well to read Section 60, to which it refers.  Very often we pass enactments that refer to sections without having the relevant section read in the House.  Sub-section (4) refers to Offences against the Person Act of 1861, Section 60.  That section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any Woman shall be delivered of a Child, every Person who shall, by any secret Disposition of the dead Body of the said Child, whether such Child died before, at, or after its Birth, endeavour to conceal the Birth thereof, shall be guilty of a Misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be imprisoned for any Term not exceeding Two Years, with or without Hard Labour: Provided that if any Person tried for the Murder of any Child shall be acquitted thereof, it shall be lawful for the Jury by whose Verdict such Person shall be acquitted to find, in case it shall so appear in Evidence, that the Child had recently been born, and that such Person did, by some secret Disposition of the dead Body of such Child, endeavour to conceal the Birth thereof, and thereupon the Court may pass such sentence as if such Person had <Col N="281" /> been convicted upon an Indictment for the Concealment of the Birth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have, nearly 100 years ago, an effort in the direction in which we are making to-day.  What did they do? They created a statutory offence of concealing the birth of a child and related it to the disposal of the dead body.  Then they explicitly provided for the problem that we are up against, that a jury, because of mitigating circumstances, would not convict of murder.  It provided where a person was acquitted on the charge of murder that that person would be liable to a sentence on the charge of the concealment of birth and to meet the case they provided that: &ldquo;The court may pass such sentence as if such person had been convicted upon an indictment for the concealment of the birth.&rdquo; That is similar to what we say here. The point in regard to sub-section (4) of this Bill is that you are now going to put that alternative in in the case of infanticide.  If you create the statutory crime of infanticide now you will have the possibility, under the original Section 60, of the alternative of concealment of birth.  Under this infanticide charge the alternative will lie there, and if acquitted of the alternative there is still the other charge here. I am not altogether satisfied that that is going to be a satisfactory state of the law at all.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not giving the impression that I am just attacking this Bill. I am not.  There is a problem there, admittedly, for which a solution should be found, but as other people have not pointed it out I have felt it incumbent on me to do so.  Again, by virtue of the fact that you are introducing the further possibility into the section that you will have cross-references, you are bringing in technical law, with the absurd result that technical law brings in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that fact, would it not be simpler to enact a simple Bill of one section to the effect that murder in a certain case can be qualified by a jury rider roughly corresponding to the terms of sub-section (3) here, leaving it at that and, if necessary, giving a discretion to the court, cutting out this anomaly represented in sub-section (1) and dropping out sub-section (4), which <Col N="282" /> again would become unnecessary, and, lastly, in cutting away from following the line taken in another country we will be showing that we in this country still recognise the dignity and the importance of human life from the moment of conception to the grave.</P>

I first want to point out beyond yea or nay that the charge of murder still remains, that this Bill does not lessen that and that where the Attorney-General finds that such a charge should be levelled, it shall be so levelled and that will continue.  This Bill is an enabling Bill, if you like, but in no way can it be taken as lessening the sanctity of human life.  Perhaps for that reason Section 1 is so worded that I did want to leave it clear that the death by malice of any person, whether that person was one hour, one minute or 100 years old, was murder.</P>
      <P>This matter was referred to a very fine committee.  I do not know that you could get a law reform committee as good as this one.  It was certainly a very able committee and the members recommended practically word for word what is in this Bill.  I can assure the House that I had very grave misgivings about it, because it was likely to appear as if the view was the cheapening of human life.  I am satisfied by the wording of the Bill that the sanctity of human life is maintained and the seriousness of the offence is not lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does enable certain courses to be taken where it is clear that some of the conditions obtaining in Section 1 (3) exist.  Where it is so found, the district justice can return the case to the Circuit Court and thereby lessen the difficulty with regard to travelling.  Up to the present in every case of infanticide the trial is in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, whether the accused is from Donegal or Cork, and witnesses and others have to travel the whole way to Dublin.  There are many reasons why that should be avoided, where it is quite clear that there was no criminal malice on behalf of the person accused. We are still leaving this offence punishable. Owing to many causes, up to the <Col N="283" /> present juries have not brought in, in certain cases, the type of verdict they should bring in.  This Bill leaves the position such that a verdict can be brought in on the lesser charge.  I do not think it is proper that the Executive should, where a verdict of murder is brought in, be left with the responsibility of deciding whether or not the full dire penalty of the law should be imposed.  Where a sentence is commuted it lessens the effect of the punishment and lessens the deterrent.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House. I am not bringing it in because the British have brought in similar legislation, and I do not bring it in in the spirit of liberalism that some may attach to it; I bring it in in a spirit of humanity and charity to people who are among the poorest of our community. I want to lessen the mental strain of going through a trial for murder where it is quite clear that no such charge could be sustained and where such a verdict could not be brought in.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything else to say beyond mentioning that, as regards the law reform committee which has been referred to, when the law of torts has been brought in that will be another day's work.  I want to assure my predecessor that the law reform committee is still in existence and that the law of torts will come up at an early date.</P>

    <Col N="284" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Since 1924 there has been legislation enabling the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide guarantees for loans to assist in industrial development both for new industries and for established concerns wishing to expand their activities where the granting of guarantees was calculated to promote employment. The legislation also provided for the actual grant of loans for similar purposes.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary to the guaranteeing or granting of any loan under the Trade Loans Acts it is necessary to consult an advisory committee, representing industrial, commercial and financial interests and the sanction of the Minister for Finance is also required before facilities can be granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The first legislative provision was made in the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1924, which provided that guarantees or loans might be granted to companies and public authorities for the purpose of meeting expenditure on buildings, plant and machinery and other fixed assets.  The operation of this Act was limited to five years, but by a series of amending Acts from 1925 to 1932 inclusive the Minister's powers were continued.</P>
      <P>In 1933 the scope of the trade loans scheme was extended by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of that year which enabled loans to be guaranteed or granted to meet cases where the expenditure to be incurred related to working capital in addition to the acquisition of fixed assets.  At the same time individuals, as distinct from companies, became eligible for trade loan facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1933, was limited to five years and on its expiry the Minister's powers in regard to trade loans were continued for another five years by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, 1939.  This Act also fixed £1,000,000 as <Col N="285" /> the total of guarantees and loans which might be granted.  On the expiry of the Act of 1939 the powers of the Minister were further continued for a period of five years by the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Amendment Act, 1944. The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to continue the powers of the Minister to guarantee or grant loans for a further period of five years.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that some machinery should continue to exist to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to afford financial assistance for industrial development which might not in the ordinary way appeal to the banks or to the Industrial Credit Company Limited.  The advantage of the trade loans guarantee system, as compared with ordinary commercial banking facilities, is that it provides a fixed long-term period of repayment for which industrialists can budget in their costings.  Banks normally require loans to be repaid over a short period, usually less than five years, whilst the Industrial Credit Company affords financial assistance to industry mostly in cases where large amounts are involved and where public issues can be arranged.</P>
    <P>Under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, 1924 to 1944, guarantees were actually given in 101 cases involving a total capital sum of £1,616,711.  In 70 cases the loans, totalling £721,471, were fully repaid by the borrowers.  In 25 cases, involving guarantees totalling £585,240, it was necessary to appoint receivers, and some of these companies ceased to operate.  Repayment to the Exchequer in cases where receivers were appointed amounted to £149,170.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to continue the powers given under the Act of 1939, under which the aggregate sum guaranteed was £1,000,000, and guarantees have been given to the extent of £446,000 under that Act.  I should say that there have been numerous inquiries as to the financial facilities available for industrial development, either for an expansion of existing industries or where promoters contemplate starting new ones.  I am satisfied that the trade loans guarantee system should be continued as proposed in this Bill.  The guarantees under the Act of <Col N="286" /> 1939 were availed of to the extent of £446,000.  It is not considered necessary to extend the limitation of the amount of £1,000,000 prescribed under Section 7 of that Act.  This Act provides that the overall limit of the amount guaranteed will be £1,000,000. In view of our experience in the working of these Acts and the inquiries which have been received recently there is evidence for a continuation of these powers, and I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £182,540 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which <Col N="287" /> will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The total net amount required for the group of eight Votes for which I account is £7,508,380.  This is an increase of £176,790, or about 2.4 per cent., on the amount voted last year, which was £7,331,590.  The chief differences between this year and last are as follows: Vote 45&mdash;Office of the Minister for Education&mdash;the net Estimate is £276,540, a decrease of £140 on the amount provided last year.  Full provision is made for salaries on the basis of the increase recently granted to the Civil Service generally.</P>
    <P>In Vote 46&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;the net Estimate is £5,330,140, an increase of £117,020 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>In the main sub-head&mdash;sub-head C (1)&mdash;the amount provided for teachers' salaries, allowances, fees, etc., and for capitation grants to convent and monastery schools is £4,730,760, an increase of £117,020 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>Lay teachers' salaries are estimated to cost £3,500,000.  The abolition of the &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; rating, provision for the appointment of additional teachers in large schools, the substitution of average enrolment for average attendance for staffing purposes and other changes favourable to the teachers have added nearly £80,000 to our commitments here.</P>
    <P>Teachers' allowances and fees are estimated to cost £250,100 as against £228,100 last year.  Allowances to principal and vice-principal teachers will cost £178,000, an increase of £13,000. Rent allowances at £35,000 show an increase of £2,000.  The fee for instruction in cookery and laundry has been raised from 8/11 to 12/- per pupil and an extra £2,000 has been provided in consequence.  A sum of £17,000 is provided for the cost of recouping to teachers two-thirds of the salaries of substitutes employed by them during illness.  This figure shows an increase of £3,000 on last year's provision and is based on the actual expenditure last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> Capitation grants to convent and monastery schools are estimated to cost £980,000 as compared with £920,000 last year, an increase of £60,000.  Of this, about £13,000 is a consequence of the abolition of the &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; rating.  The balance is attributable to the continued increase in the numbers attending these schools.</P>
    <P>Provision is again made for the training of the maximum number of teachers.  The numbers in the preparatory and training colleges will be 517 and 707 respectively as compared with 514 and 706 last year.  There is an increase of £1,700 in the provision for preparatory colleges and of £3,612 in that for training colleges.  This latter increase is mainly due to the inclusion of provision to meet losses which may be incurred in the working of the training colleges.</P>
    <P>Grants towards the cost of heating, etc., of schools and the cleansing of out-offices are continued on the existing basis.</P>
    <P>The provision of £55,000 made last year for the &ldquo;£5 grant&rdquo; to Gaeltacht children proved a little too large, and £52,500 is provided this year.</P>
    <P>An increase in the number of van and boat services and in the cost of existing services has sent the provision under this head up from £7,000 to £9,250.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for superannuation, etc., of teachers&mdash;£444,000&mdash; shows an increase of £17,000, due mainly to the pension and gratuity increases granted by the National Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme which was recently approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In Vote 47&mdash;Secondary Education&mdash; the net Estimate is £896,300, an increase of £24,650 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>Capitation grant at £316,950 is up by £13,900.  The number of pupils in respect of whom this grant is payable continues to increase steadily.  This year it is 45,412 as compared with 43,710 last year and 42,730 the year before.</P>
    <P>Incremental salary grant at £503,600 shows an increase of £6,100 due to the accretion of annual increments on the increased salary scales granted to secondary teachers in 1946.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The provision of £24,260 for examinations shows an increase of £2,900 due chiefly to an increase in the remuneration of superintendents and in the rates of subsistence allowance for both superintendents and examiners.</P>
    <P>Laboratory grants at £36,700 are up by £1,700 due to an increase of about 70 as compared with last year in the number of science and domestic science classes.</P>
    <P>The provision for rent allowances has been increased by £1,600 to £9,200 in view of actual expenditure.</P>
    <P>In Vote 48&mdash;Technical Instruction&mdash; the net Estimate is £660,380, an increase of £55,610 on the amount provided last year in the original Vote and a Supplementary Vote.</P>
    <P>Annual grants to vocational education committees at £620,000 show an increase of £53,363 on the amount provided last year.</P>
    <P>The major portion of this increase (£45,000) arises partly from development of existing vocational education services and partly from the increase in the cost of maintaining the existing services.  The balance of the total increase (£8,500) is due to recent increases in the remuneration of officers and employees of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £2,157 in grants to miscellaneous schools not under the management of the committees. There is an increase in the number of students, and religious instruction is recognised as a grant-earning subject for the first time.</P>
    <P>A sum of £16,000 is provided in sub-head A as a contribution towards the loan charges of rating authorities in respect of school buildings.  This is an increase of £1,785 on last year's provision.</P>
    <P>In Vote 49&mdash;Science and Art&mdash;the net Estimate is £106,800, a decrease of £1,500 on the amount voted last year.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £5,750 in the grant to the Irish Folklore Commission. Salaries, wages and allowances are up by £3,364, due mainly to the recent increase in Civil Service remuneration. Last year £4,000 was provided for grants to colleges providing courses in Irish for persons other than <Col N="290" /> teachers.  The actual expenditure was nearly £6,000, and that amount has been provided for this year.</P>
    <P>Reductions totalling £15,734 have been made on other sub-heads.  The grant to Comdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge has been reduced from £10,000 to £6,000.  The provision for publications in Irish has been reduced by £3,550.  A nominal sum of £5 has been provided for the production of films on behalf of Government Departments as against £2,500 last year, and the grant to the National Film Institute has been cut from £2,000 to £1,000.  The grant to the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences has been restored to the normal figure of £100, and the provision of £1,000 towards the cost of a history of the famine has not been repeated. The grant for the purchase of specimens for the National Museum has been reduced by £1,000.</P>
    <P>In Vote 50&mdash;Reformatory and Industrial Schools&mdash;the net Estimate is £174,850, a decrease of £12,790 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>The provision for industrial schools &mdash;£156,100&mdash;is down by £4,200.  It is estimated that there will be a reduction of 150 in the number of children under detention as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Grants for building and equipment at £18,550 show a reduction of £6,450.  The amount now provided is the balance of the grant of £40,000 towards the cost of building a new industrial school for senior boys.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the receipts from the parents of committed children, etc., will exceed £12,000, an increase of about £2,800 on last year.</P>
    <P>In Vote 51&mdash;National Gallery&mdash;the net Estimate is £8,500, an increase of £290 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>In Vote 28&mdash;Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies&mdash;the net Estimate is £54,870, an increase of £2,120 on last year's Vote.</P>
    <P>The grants for the administration of the Institute and for the three constituent schools (sub-head A) and for buildings, etc. (sub-head B) are substantially the same as were voted originally last year.  Owing mainly to the fact that certain senior posts were not filled, credit was taken last year in <Col N="291" /> a Supplementary Vote for a saving of £10,000 on sub-head A, and this sum was diverted to sub-head B to meet the increased cost of certain building and reconstruction.</P>
    <P>In the realm of primary education, the number of pupils on the roll on 30th June, 1948, was approximately 458,000, or about 5,000 more than the number on the rolls on 30th June, 1947. In 1928 the figure was 516,660 and, with the exception of a few years, the numbers fell constantly and consistently to 453,428 in the year 1947, representing a decline of some 63,000 over the whole period.</P>
    <P>This fall in the school-going population brought with it inevitably a decline in the number of teachers required, even though in the earlier years of the period the effect of the fall on the numbers on rolls was offset or arrested by other factors such as the operation of the School Attendance Act, 1926, etc.  In due course, the various measures adopted succeeded in reducing the number of unemployed and the recruitment of teachers was again resumed.  It also became possible to restore the position that women teachers could be continued to the age of 65, subject to satisfactory service, and, in point of fact, except for odd cases, there have been no normal retirements of women teachers before the age of 65 for some years past.  The retirement of women teachers will again resume its normal course on the 31st March, 1950, when the first group of those affected by the extension from 60 to 65 reach the latter age.</P>
    <P>The increase in 1947-48 in the school going population, even though of modest proportions, is a very welcome occurrence from the national point of view.  Since 1940 there has annually been an increase in the number of births registered within the jurisdiction; the figure for 1939 was 56,070 and for 1947, 68,602, the highest for 30 years.  Unfortunately, however, the provisional figure for 1948 shows a reduction to 65,584.  There is necessarily a time lag between any movement in the birth rate and an increase or decrease in the school-going population <Col N="292" /> so that the upward trend from 1940 to 1947 in the birth rate, which has apparently shown itself in the pupil rate in 1947-48, should continue for some further years.  In view of the decline in births in 1948, however, it is yet too early to assure ourselves that we can rely on any steady increase in the school-going population from year to year.</P>
    <P>We have, for the last year or so been observing signs that our existing supply of teachers is failing, to an extent at any rate, to meet adequately the number of positions falling to be filled. Should the present trend in this respect continue, and should we fail to increase our output of teachers, we would obviously have exchanged our problem of unemployment of some years ago for a problem of shortage of teachers.  This would be equally serious in its own way since it would be a case of pupils looking for teachers instead of teachers looking for pupils. The whole situation is, however, so uncertain at the moment that I cannot do more than say that we are keeping it under the closest review. Before one could embark on a permanent extension of training facilities there would need to be reasonable assurance that the extra trainees would continue to be required.  The cost of such extension, the cost of the training of the extra numbers and the danger that posts might not be there for them when trained, are all factors requiring that a decision of the kind should not be taken without the fullest consideration.</P>
    <P>There are also other aspects entering into the picture.  The question of the school-leaving age must, even apart from the matter of finance, remain in abeyance until we have the view of the Commission on Youth Employment.  It is admitted on all sides that the position regarding the size of classes could be improved but, in existing, circumstances, any movement in this direction would have the serious result of depriving the more out-of-the-way and less attractively-situated schools of even their present quotas of staff.  There would be, of course, the possibility of temporarily extending the facilities for the training of teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Such an extension was actually commenced in 1947 through the kindness and the most gracious co-operation of the manager, His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, and the authorities of Our Lady of Mercy Training College, who placed at the disposal of the Department on most reasonable terms, a building adjacent to the college which they had been using as a school for junior pupils.  No further expansion in the number of women trainees is possible without recourse to a new centre or centres and such a step would have considerable financial implications.</P>
    <P>I can only sum up the position at the moment therefore by saying that we have reached a point at which our supply of teachers seems to be running short as against probable future requirements but that there are so many factors to be taken into account that we must await some further development of events before proceeding to decide to augment the supply of either men or women teachers.  This suspension of judgment brings with it necessarily, much though I regret it, a similar suspension of the examination of any steps towards increasing the ratio between the numbers of teachers and the numbers of pupils, a problem which has also very decided financial concomitants in the matter of the provision of the extra teachers and of additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is also an improvement to report as between 1946-47 and 1947-48 in the average number of pupils on rolls and in the percentage of average daily attendance to the average number on rolls.  For 1946-47 the average enrolment was approximately 444,000 and the percentage attendance 79.9; in 1947-48 the corresponding figures were 446,500 and 83.9.  Attendance in 1946-47 was of course, particularly affected by the events of the year in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The past year may fairly be described as one of considerable activity, in the field of primary education.  The outstanding event of the year was, without doubt, the change in what is known as the system of &ldquo;rating&rdquo; national teachers.  From the inception of the national educational system, it had been the practice in one form or <Col N="294" /> another to divide teachers into a number of categories based primarily on the degree of efficiency which they had attained.  From 1920 onwards the system took the form of three ratings &mdash;highly efficient, efficient and non-efficient. Those who were rated highly efficient proceeded to a higher maximum salary than those not so rated. To a growing extent, however, down the years this division of those whose work was generally satisfactory has been a source of irritation to, and a sense of grievance amongst, the teachers who professed to see in it, to a large extent, a device for saving money.  I do not think in all fairness that was the intention&mdash;though we can hardly blame the custodians of the nation's purse for seeing considerable virtue in its actual operation&mdash;and it is my opinion that the real aim of the arrangement was to spur teachers on to the greatest effort of which they were capable.  Be that as it may, there is no gainsaying the fact that the position had been reached at which the maintenance of the system was a major cause of controversy as between the teaching profession and the State. With a view to having the matter fully threshed out, my predecessor had invited the representatives of the different Managers' Associations and of the Teachers' Organisation to a conference with the Department's officers but it was actually my privilege to welcome the representatives when the conference did meet.</P>
    <P>A very full and frank discussion took place between the three parties present. I had the opportunity of reading the detailed account of the discussions and I would wish at this stage to pay tribute to the various parties for the harmonious and co-operative manner in which they approached the problem.  It was clear from the tone of the proceedings that we had definitely reached the stage at which, no matter what the good intentions of the &ldquo;rating&rdquo; system were, the defects of continuing it would outweigh the advantages.  That being so, I came to the conclusion that, in the interests of the managers, the teachers and the pupils, the time had arrived at which we should endeavour to operate a new arrangement.  I made my proposals accordingly formally to <Col N="295" /> the various interests affected and secured their approval, but I had to explain that, owing to the financial situation, the alteration of the system would have to wait until the 1st April, 1949.  From now on, we shall recognise only two classes of teachers, those who are doing their work satisfactorily and those who have to be regarded as not satisfactory.  It is my earnest hope that the results of this elimination of the practice of sub-dividing efficient teachers into two groups will redound to the general advantage of the schools.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the teachers will respond whole-heartedly to this great change and that by the removal of the irritant we shall be able to command an even more satisfactory standard of work than was being before achieved. Managers will still receive the detailed statement regarding the work in each individual subject which is at present issued to them and it was the feeling of their representatives at the conference that with this data before them they would be in a position to glean all the information they required as to the progress being made in the schools under their care.  The results of the abolition of the highly efficient rating on the financial side are also very important. Although there was no restriction on the number of awards, it was a fact that from year to year the percentage of those obtaining the highly efficient mark was around 30 per cent.  Now that the highly efficient rating has been removed, the other 70 per cent. of the teachers are in the position that they can proceed to the maximum salaries hitherto reserved for the 30 per cent.  This means for both principals and assistants a potential maximum increase of from £36 to £40 in scale salary with some increases also in the amount of the allowance payable to principal teachers.  Teachers who are at least one year on the former efficient maximum are receiving an immediate increment on the former highly efficient scale from the 1st April this year.  The cost of the removal of the highly efficient rating is estimated at £80,000 for the first year of operation rising, according as the teachers proceed from the former maximum <Col N="296" /> efficient figure to the now common maximum figure which was hitherto the highly efficient maximum, to about £200,000 per annum.  It can be seen, therefore, that the step is of great importance from both the educational and the financial point of view.</P>
    <P>Although the need for economy in national expenditure has been and is very pressing existing services in the primary school field have not alone been maintained in full but a number of important developments have been introduced in the past year.  These have had the aim of improving the conditions of service of national teachers and, within restricted limits, providing better staffing for the larger schools.</P>
    <P>Additional security of tenure for serving teachers has been provided by the regulations adopted from the 1st July, 1948, which based the appointment and retention of teachers on the average number of pupils on rolls rather than on the average number of pupils in attendance.  The incidence of variable and unforeseen factors, such as weather conditions and illness of pupils, which up to now tended to make the teachers' position insecure, will thus be removed or considerably reduced. When this matter was touched on in the debate on last year's Estimates the fear was expressed that the new conditions would prejudice the staffing position in certain types of schools.  It is of course usual to find that a new measure whilst benefiting the great majority of those affected by its provisions will, in a limited number of cases, have the opposite effect.  It will appear that very few schools will be adversely affected by the changeover, but following on representations subsequently made by the Teachers' Organisation and in order that the transition from one system to the other should work smoothly, it has been decided that for the two years up to the 30th June, 1950, the appointment and retention of teachers may be based either on the average attendance figures or the enrolment figures, whichever are the more favourable to the particular school.</P>
    <P>As a result of the operation of the new regulations regarding enrolment as a basis, and of the concessionary <Col N="297" /> alternative, and further of the upward trend in the total numbers on rolls and in average attendance, it is interesting to find a very considerable decrease in the number of teachers on the panel, namely, those whose services are no longer required in their schools and are being continued pending the occurrence of a vacancy in the diocese.  On the 1st January, 1948, there were in all 92 teachers on the panel proper, viz. 12 men, 72 women and eight junior assistant mistresses. The number on the 1st January, 1949, on the panel proper had fallen by almost half to 54, viz. seven men, 40 women and seven junior assistant mistresses.  Indeed, if two areas in which there has been serious depopulation are excluded the number on the panel on the 1st January would have been only 12 assistants and three junior assistant mistresses.  The number of teachers on what is known as the addendum to the panel has also fallen from 77 to 53; these are teachers who, as a result of the amalgamation of schools and other causes are being continued in their existing schools until a vacancy in the near neighbourhood arises.  It is important to remember that the change to enrolment was not made with the formal purpose of increasing the existing staffs of national schools but it will be seen that it is having a very valuable effect in not reducing existing staffs and in enabling schools to continue to receive the benefit of their present teaching power.  It would be unreasonable to expect that teachers should remain in schools irrespective of the number of pupils but any improvement in the conditions permitting teachers to continue in schools must generally be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain conditions additional staff may from July 1st, 1948, be appointed to the larger monastery and convent capitation schools.  The number of appointments so made to date is not large, due, to an extent, to difficulties in finding accommodation.  The increased staff now allowed in these capitation schools brings the staffing conditions into line with those allowed in the case of the larger ordinary national schools since 1938.</P>
    <P>Men teachers in the smaller mixed <Col N="298" /> schools which were in a higher category on their appointment and men teachers in small schools for boys only, who were subject to certain limitation of salary because of the size of the school, now receive the full-scale men's salary.  Teachers in schools with less than ten pupils, who were not eligible under the 1946 salary scheme for a principal's allowance, have been granted a small allowance.  The ban on the promotion to untrained assistant teacher of junior assistant mistresses who are over the age of 45 has been withdrawn since January 1st, 1948.</P>
    <P>The regulations for the appointment of vice-principal teachers have been altered so as to allow of the appointment of a third and fourth vice-principal if the number of pupils permits; not more than two vice-principals could formerly be appointed.</P>
    <P>Young persons on appointment to ordinary posts for which they receive salary direct from the Department are given incremental credit for service as supernumerary or substitute teacher, which has been included in their period of two years' probation.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has very recently passed an amendment of the National Teachers' Superannuation Scheme which gives three important concessions. With a view to lessening the after effects of the strike in the Dublin schools in 1946 about 1,000 teachers, who have already been granted since my assumption of office incremental credit for the period during which their services were withdrawn, will now receive pensionable credit for this period.  All teachers throughout the country who have retired since the 30th October, 1946, when the present scales were introduced will have their pension based on these new scales; under the existing scheme pensions could be calculated only on the average actual salary for the three years preceding retirement, which involved taking into account the former lower scales for the appropriate period of the three years in question.  This particular amendment ensures that all those retiring on pension under the new scales will receive the full benefit in pension of the higher salaries just as if they had <Col N="299" /> actually received these higher salaries for the full three years before retirement. Lastly, lay assistant teachers in schools conducted by the Irish Christian Brothers will receive two-thirds pensionable credit for their service in these schools prior to 1926 when the schools came under the Department for the first time.</P>
    <P>The committee which I set up some time ago to deal with the question of the salaries of teachers of national schools is still in session.  I would, however, wish to call attention to the fact that the 1946 scheme for salaries, etc., with the improvements which have been since effected both before and after my taking up office, made considerable strides in improving the general conditions.</P>
    <P>A woman principal or assistant teacher now receives the full salary scale no matter how small the size of her school; a principal teacher, once appointed to a school, will continue to receive the salary scale and allowances proper to the school at the date of appointment, even though the number of pupils subsequently declines.  This applies to both men and women teachers.  A trained teacher serving as junior assistant mistress receives the trained teacher's scale up to the sixth increment.  In fact the broad position has now been reached that the size of the school does not affect the amount of the teacher's basic salary and that a fall in attendance does not worsen the financial position of a principal teacher.</P>
    <P>It still holds that we will not pay the man's salary scale to a man principal appointed to a mixed school with less than 30 pupils but that is because it is considered that the post is one proper to a woman teacher, rather than from any intention to save money as such. There is also the restriction that in schools where the number of pupils is too large for one teacher but not big enough to warrant the appointment of a full assistant teacher, we recognise the class of junior assistant mistress, mostly in present circumstances untrained teachers on a lower scale of salary.  The principle has already been accepted, however, in this latter regard that as and when the supply of teachers <Col N="300" /> permits only trained teachers will be appointed to this particular class.</P>
    <P>It would appear at first sight from the Estimates that the provision for the heating and cleaning of national schools is being reduced by £30,000.  I have to make it clear that there is no actual reduction and that the services provided in former years are being maintained in full.  What has happened was that it had been proposed, though never published, in 1948-49 to alter the conditions attaching to payment so as to provide for larger grants, but it was decided after the issue of the Estimates Volume that in all the circumstances of the case the continuance of the existing basis of grants would be adequate until such time as there was an improvement in financial conditions.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to note that the number of scholarships to secondary and vocational schools provided by county councils for pupils whose parents are unable to pay for their further education continue to increase, even if only slightly.  Four hundred and fifty-four new scholarships were awarded in 1948 as compared with 443, in 1947.  The growing sense of the need for these scholarships is, however, apparent when we see that 20 years ago the number of awards was only 209.  I would like to mention in a very general manner that I would be glad to see, in the case of some authorities, a softening of their means' conditions. I would also like to see a further increase in the number of scholarships awarded so that good boys and girls should have the opportunity of improving their education but not necessarily for the purpose of turning them away from their land or from other reproductive occupations.</P>
    <P>The cost of the building and improvement of national schools is not borne by the Votes for the Department of Education but by Vote 10&mdash;Public Works and Buildings.  The Department of Education is, however, so closely concerned with the whole question that I feel it necessary to refer to the subject. It is easy to become impatient at what appears to be the slow progress of the school building campaign but when we consider the number of <Col N="301" /> stages that have to be gone through, administrative, legal and constructional, the fact that work actually authorised by the Department during the year ended 31st March last is estimated to cost in all just £574,000 must be regarded as a steady advance. This work includes extension and improvement schemes, major and minor, as well as new buildings and of the total cost 86.6 per cent. or about £497,000 will be provided by the State, the remaining 13.4 per cent. or £77,000 being provided locally.  The target of actual new buildings and of major enlargement schemes is 50-55 per annum which is, in spite of the many difficulties and delays, being achieved. I cannot say, however, that I view the present distribution of cost as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The basis of the arrangement, as enshrined in the Department's rules for many years, is that the State contributes two-thirds of the cost of building or improvement&mdash;the remaining third of the cost and the full cost of ordinary year-to-year maintenance falling on the locality.  There is provision that in necessitous areas the State grant may be increased beyond two-thirds.  The figures I have given, showing for the last year a local contribution of 13.4 per cent., as against the former conception of 33? per cent. will indicate the extent to which we are failing to implement the idea of the system. Admittedly, building costs have soared but we believe that they have now reached their peak, and that some improvement by way of reduction may be expected.  These schools&mdash;new and old &mdash;are legally the property of the parish and it should be a source of pride and a discharge of a duty for the people to provide the wherewithal for the necessary contribution to their erection and subsequent maintenance.  To reach a position where the local contribution to erection would become as a matter of course only a nominal insignificant sum would not I feel be in the public interest.  For many years and particularly before home Government commenced it was the practice, except in areas which would be regarded as necessitous, to provide a one-third quota and I feel that if our people come to realise the full possibilities and <Col N="302" /> implications of the position they would be no less willing to do their part under their own administration.  I think, too, that those members of the public who have not children actually attending school should appreciate that that should not relieve them of their responsibility for making their financial contribution to what is a most necessary portion of the parochial structure. In 1935-36, £87,000 was provided locally towards a total cost of £309,000, i.e., 28.2 per cent. and taking the pre-war decade generally the proportion ranged from about 24 per cent. to 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that it is my intention to set up a council of education.  I have indicated the reasons why there has been delay in approaching that question.  I feel that when I come to speak on the matter, when my plans for that have been fully formulated, the House will understand why there has been a delay in the matter and how necessary that delay has been.  But while waiting for the council of education to take over the, shall I say, creation of the climate in which the work of education will be done in the country, I have looked at certain aspects of the work in the schools that might be regarded as relating to the curriculum of the schools so that a certain stream-lining may be done where it is obvious that that is required for the schools and so that the quality of the work done in the schools may be fully and frankly understood and evaluated by the people generally.  There is a certain type of surface criticism at the moment with regard to certain aspects of the work in the schools and with regard to the quality of the work in the schools.  A number of people are writing letters to the papers and making statements with regard to it. A very considerable amount of that criticism is superficial.  I should like to make it clear to any individual person or to any classes of people in the country that are seriously concerned about any type of defect in the school that if, while we are waiting for a council of education to restore a certain amount of confidence in the approach to educational problems in the country, they will put their facts and their complaints definitely before me, saying where these defects are and <Col N="303" /> the nature of these defects, they will be speedily and fully examined.</P>
    <P>It is in that particular spirit that I have approached a certain number of problems related to the curriculum at the present time.  In connection with that there are one or two things I should like to say.  The opinion has been widely expressed, both in public and in private, that the regulation by virtue of which Irish was to be the sole language used in infants classes was not working out satisfactorily in practice.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, as I indicated last year, I selected a delegation of inspectors including inspectors of all three branches, that is, primary, secondary and vocational branches, and sent them to visit schools in various parts of the country with a view to conducting an investigation into this matter and submitting a report as a result of their investigations.  They, visited 29 schools in 13 counties.  They had the advice and assistance of the Head Organiser of Kindergarten and they had full and frank discussions with the teachers as to their difficulties and the causes of the comparative success or failure of their efforts.  Arising out of the reports submitted by the inspectors I made certain changes in the regulations governing the medium to be used in infant classes.  First of all, I made a verbal change, the effect of which would be to modify the injunction that Irish should be used exclusively from the very first day of the infants' attendance.  I substituted a recommendation that the aim should be to reach as soon as possible a stage at which Irish can be exclusively used as the language of instruction and communication in those infant classes.  It will be understood that the work which is done in the infants classes is of a kindergarten nature and that the use of the Irish language in those classes is for the purpose of giving the children at the earliest possible age the opportunity of hearing the Irish language used simply and naturally, as it were, in ordinary day to day use.  In addition, English, may now, at the discretion of the Manager, be taught in infants classes in all primary schools for half an hour a day.  I gave the <Col N="304" /> most careful consideration to the inspectors' reports and I came to the conclusion that no further changes were either desirable or necessary.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Gaeltacht in the revival of the language is so self-evident that no elaboration is necessary.  I have long been of the opinion and I have expressed it frequently in the House that, in addition to discharging fully the obligations to secure the best possible educational facilities for the Gaeltacht, the Department of Education should provide for itself facilities for acquiring knowledge and information as to the state of the language in the Irish-speaking districts and on the extent to which the schools are assisting in the preservation of Irish as the spoken language of these areas.  I have accordingly set up a special inspectorate for the Gaeltacht areas and have assigned to one of the selected inspectors the Tír Chonaill Fíor-Ghaeltacht, to another the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas of Mayo and Galway and to a third the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Gaeltacht areas of Kerry, Cork and Waterford.  The duties assigned to these inspectors go much farther than the mere inspection of the schools.  They are expected to regard the maintenance of Irish not as a school matter alone but as a problem of regional and national significance. They will be expected to keep the Department informed as to the condition of the language in the areas assigned to them and as to the forces in those areas which foster or militate against the language.  In general it will be their duty to act as liaison officers between the Gaeltacht and the Department so that the Department may at all times have reliable firsthand information as to how the language is faring in these supremely important areas, both in the schools and in the life of the people outside.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the school work to which I have had special attention directed have been, first, the general question of the articulation of the children. Their general manner of speaking and of holding themselves has a number of important bearings both on the development of their character, on their manliness and on the way in which they hold themselves in address-speakin <Col N="305" /> ing others.  It has an effect on their grip both of their native language, whether it is Irish or English, and of the second language which they are expected to acquire, whether that is English or Irish.  I also feel that the observation of the manner in which children speak and hold themselves generally will make a considerable contribution to improving the physical condition of the children.  There was a time, when the primary school programme was being reviewed in 1925, when I thought that physical education should be made a compulsory subject in the primary school.  It was not possible at that particular time to get a decision in that way.  I feel that by paying systematic attention to the manner in which children now hold themselves and speak, it will be making a certain small contribution to improving the physical development of the children and may lead us on to days when, in a more systematic way, physical instruction will possibly be given.</P>
    <P>I have also asked for a special report on the school position for the year 1947-48 in respect of two matters. The first is the teaching of Irish in the primary schools and the second is the teaching of arithmetic.  That report was called for, no doubt, after or towards the end of the school year, but I feel that it is rather important and will be of general public use and information to get that report from the inspectors while they are still fresh after their year's work.  However, at the beginning of the present year, 1948-49, I asked them to report specially on two other subjects: first, the teaching of history and, secondly, the teaching of geography.  I had two objects in that.  I wanted a rather concentrated report on how some particular subjects were being taught in the schools and I selected for the current year history and geography.  As well as getting a report on these subjects by asking for it, it will be understood that the report was asked for in such a way as to be practical and directed to the teaching work in the schools with regard to these two subjects.  That report will not be available until after the current school year, but we will have the advantage when the reports <Col N="306" /> for last year and this year have been received that four subjects will have been reported on with a considerable amount of care and a very considerable amount of observation.</P>
    <P>It is no doubt disappointing to the members of the Oireachtas who are interested in the work of the Department of Education that the last annual report has been the report for the year 1944-45.  That report was published two and a half years after the end of the school year to which it refers.  No report has been published since.  There are two reports due.  One is the report of the year 1945-46 and another for the year 1946-47.  It is a commentary on the printing difficulties that obtain at the present moment but I expect to have the report for the year 1946-47 in about two months' time.  I shall not have the report for the year 1945-46 perhaps for some considerable time after that.  Everything that I can possibly do to speed up the printing of these reports is being done.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper I had a question addressed to the Minister for Lands in which I asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state (i) whether a scheme for the distribution of the Kelly estate at Burren, Castlebar, has been submitted by the local office to the Land Commission for approval; (ii) the date upon which this scheme was submitted for approval, and (iii) the reasons for the long delay in dealing with the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I got no reply to the specific matters upon which I asked for information in that question, because the Minister stated in his reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" />&ldquo;This scheme provides among other things for the disposal of lands in course of resumption and cannot be operated until resumption proceedings are completed.  There has been no avoidable delay in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not ask the Minister what the scheme provided for.  I asked whether a scheme was in fact submitted by the local officer of the Land Commission to the head office and when that scheme was submitted, as it is notorious throughout the country that schemes submitted by the local officers of the Land Commission to the head office are often lying there for very long periods of time with nothing being done in connection with them.  I pressed the Minister to-day to give me a reply to this question.  He suggested that the matter must be treated with secrecy.  Evidently there is some extraordinary principle of secrecy involved in dealing with a matter of this kind.  Why there should be any possible question of secrecy as to when the particular scheme was submitted for approval to the Land Commission is completely beyond me.  This is a new departure on the part of the Minister for Lands in connection with the administration of his Department.</P>
    <P>If we are to accept the principle laid down by the Minister to-day that he cannot or will not give Deputies information on questions of this kind, it means that all the operations of the Land Commission will be shrouded in complete secrecy and that Deputies will be unable to elicit any information in connection with the delays of the Land Commission in dealing with matters under their jurisdiction which are notorious.  If a scheme submitted to the Land Commission for the distribution of land or for any purpose coming within the ambit of the Land Commission is to be left to gather cobwebs over in Merrion Square for years and we as Deputies are not entitled to ask questions in connection with the scheme, I do not know where the procedure of this House will get to.  Surely Deputies are entitled as of right to get information as to why there should be long delay in connection with a scheme <Col N="308" /> of this kind.  The Minister refused to-day to give this information on the ground of secrecy.  What secrets would be disclosed by telling the House the date on which this scheme was submitted by the local officer to the central office of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The issue was not raised by me as to what people were to be dealt with or whether any particular individuals were to get land.  It may be a matter of amusement for the Minister, but it is not amusing for unfortunate farmers in Burren, outside Castlebar, who are waiting to know whether they are going to be left with the pieces of land they now hold under temporary convenience lettings on the estate.  Springtime has arrived and these men want to know whether they are entitled to till the lands that they hold under lettings for temporary convenience; whether they should manure these lands; if these lands are going to be taken from them this year; and whether they must make arrangements to take conacre elsewhere for their crops.  They have worn out their boots trailing into the local office of the Land Commission during the past 12 or 18 months trying to find out what is happening about the division of this estate, whether the scheme will be put into operation this year or next year or at what particular time, and they are told by the local officials that the matter has been submitted to Dublin for approval.  The local officers cannot tell them anything but that they are waiting for the scheme to come back from Dublin.  That is the position of these unfortunate people on this estate at present, and yet we are told by the Minister to-day that this matter must be shrouded in secrecy because the Land Commission must be protected from public inquiry as to when the scheme was submitted to them, as to how long they are to sit in judgment on it, as to how long the scheme is to be left in some forgotten file in Merrion Street to get covered with cobwebs while people down the country are waiting for a decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a principle involved in this matter.  The principle enunciated by the Minister has not been enunciated by any other Minister in this House&mdash; that a cloak of secrecy must be put <Col N="309" /> round issues of this kind.  In connection with any scheme, let it be a scheme for a harbour work dealt with by the Department of Industry and Commerce or any other scheme under any Government Department, it has been the regular practice in this House that Deputies are entitled to put down a question as to whether the scheme was approved, when the work might start, and to get information for the benefit of their constituents so that the people would know what was happening. Now evidently we are going to be forced into the position by the Minister that &ldquo;mum&rdquo; must be the word as far as the Land Commission is concerned; that we are not entitled to find out by Parliamentary question what is happening in a particular case; how long the Land Commission can hold it up; whether there is in fact justifiable delay on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with any particular scheme.</P>
    <P>If the House stands for this closure by the Minister for Lands in dealing with his Department, the same very easy procedure will no doubt be adopted by other Ministers when dealing with Parliamentary questions. Telling us that secrecy is involved is so much eyewash.  Does the Minister suggest that a twopence-halfpenny scheme for the division of some small estate for the purpose of distribution must be marked private and confidential in the Land Commission office and referred to by some mystic term like &ldquo;Operation Hazard&rdquo;?  Does the Minister suggest that it is sufficient to get the usual enlightening document from the Land Commission such as this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá orm a admháil go bhfuarthas do litir de'n dáta &mdash;&mdash; agus a rá go bhfeicfear isteach sa scéal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister suggest that before that wonderful document is issued by the Land Commission the officials concerned have got to be sworn to secrecy on the Bible?  There is an awful lot of hypocrisy in connection with this alleged need for secrecy in connection with the operations of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister's refusal to give information of this kind serves a very useful purpose.  It means that it <Col N="310" /> provides a complete cloak for the delay and incompetence of the Land Commission or the Minister in dealing with matters of this kind.  The Minister can always come to the House when pressed on matters of this kind and hold up his hands in horror and say: &ldquo;This is a highly secret matter.  I cannot give the House any information in connection with it.&rdquo; Certainly it is a bad precedent for the Minister to create and it is going to destroy the privileges which Deputies enjoy in this House when they feel bound to question long delay in dealing with matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had suggested to-day that there was some reason for apprehension that some local people might know what was happening under this scheme, I could understand that.  I would invite him, when replying, to state on what ground or principle he suggests it would be against the public interest to let the people concerned, or this House, know when the scheme was submitted by his local officials to the head office in Dublin, and what precedent would be broken by giving that information.  Is not that information that was always made available to the House by the Minister's predecessors? Why should he now execute this complete somersault in connection with the procedure of the Land Commission? Since becoming head of the Land Commission, the Minister has done many political feats of acrobatics in connection with Land Commission policy or what he has announced to be his policy in connection with the Land Commission. We discovered to-day that whereas the matter of the Land Commission taking over land at a public sale for the purpose of relieving congestion was a matter to be lauded some 18 months ago, it evidently now is a crime if anyone suggests that the Land Commission should resume a holding for the relief of congestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is another matter in which there has been a change on the part of the Minister.  He stated to-day that there was no avoidable delay on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with the Kelly estate.  I challenge that, and I assert that there has been culpable delay.  If the Minister refuses to inform us when this scheme was received at the head office of the Land Commission he can cover up the unreasonable and culpable delay which I assert the Land Commission are responsible for in this particular case.</P>
      <P>This was a scheme involving a very small number of people and the resettlement of a small amount of land. There is no reason why the officials in Dublin could not have dealt with it within 48 hours of receiving it.  As regards the procedure, the Minister knows that it is the local officials who prepare these schemes.  They consult the people concerned, and it is on their suggestions that such schemes are approved in Dublin.  I am sure the officials in Dublin never heard of a place called Burren, in the County Mayo, or of the people concerned in this division until the scheme was submitted by the local officials.  They had visited the people entitled to parcels of this land and had taken particulars of their valuations and of their families.</P>

    <P>All that work was done by the local officials.  Why, then, should it take a month or, has happened in this case, 18 months, for the officials in Dublin to make a decision on the scheme, particularly at this time of the year when the local people concerned were anxious to know what their position was going to be from the point of view of putting in crops?  If the Minister is going to stand by the principle that he is endeavouring to set up in this House, I want to warn him that there must be a reaction to that.  It is our <Col N="312" /> main function as Deputies to get information by way of Parliamentary question on these matters.  That is what I am endeavouring to do in this case.  I would ask him to reconsider his attitude so far as the rights of Deputies are concerned or of any future Minister who may occupy his position.  He should not attempt to fritter away the rights of Deputies by refusing to give information which I hold I am entitled to get.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran, I am afraid, has let the cat out of the bag on himself, and particularly on one of the members of his Party who was my predecessor. He says that the scheme was lodged 18 months ago.  The Deputy knows the area better than I do, and I would like to know from him if there is one or more holdings concerned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that the tenants were wearing their shoes out going into Castlebar to find out what exactly was happening in this particular case.  He must be aware that these different sections, as he describes them, are not in the hands of the Land Commission yet.  Would it not be a nice thing to go and divide land before you had got possession of it?  The Deputy says the tenants were told in Castlebar that the scheme had been lodged, but he did not say by whom. I presume it was he himself who told them.</P>

      <P>Deputies have the right to inquire into matters like that, and if any useful purpose would be served by telling the Deputy or the people concerned the details of a scheme they would not be withheld, but it would definitely go a long way towards preventing a scheme coming into operation if the details were made known beforehand.  In cases where the Land Commission propose to divide or allot land, I cannot see where the necessity arises to give information about it some time beforehand.  Would it not be a nice thing if a Land Commission inspector in a congested district were to tell people that such and such a farm or group of holdings had been allotted and that they were going to get five or ten acres?  I think that would be very good news for the tenants to hear.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran's attitude suggests that these people are just like children waiting for their parents to come from town with whatever toys they may have.  The tenants are not of that type at all; they are not of the type that Deputy Moran would have us believe.  The tenants in most cases know what the situation was as I found it; they know the mess that Deputy Moran's Party left the Land Commission in when they were the Government. I appreciate very highly indeed the patience the people have with me. They know what the position was when I took over office.  They know the Land Commission was under-staffed and they know that I could not, by pressing a button or turning a switch, acquire all the land and divide it amongst them and in that way come to their relief all in a few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moran is a great champion of the small farmers now.  It was the attitude of Deputy Moran and his Party which weaned the support of that very class from me and endeavoured to attribute the delay to the change of Government.  I think the small farmers now know that they have a Minister in office who is prepared <Col N="314" /> to speed up Land Commission work and do all he can to relieve congestion in a proper, businesslike way.  They know that they have a Minister who will not tolerate delays.  I am telling them that now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran, in the course of his question, asked me whether a scheme for distribution of the Kelly estate at Burren, Castlebar, had been submitted by the local office to the Land Commission for approval.  Suppose I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, where would that get the Deputy?  He went on to ask about the date upon which this scheme was submitted for approval and the reasons for the long delay in dealing with this matter.  The fact is that, whether or not it is the same land that Deputy Moran is referring to, we are going to resume three holdings in the townland of Burren.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  I am afraid Deputy Moran has been misinformed. My Department has informed me that we have not yet got possession of these holdings.  Deputy Moran now says that the Land Commission have had possession of these holdings for four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in his question asked about the distribution of the Kelly estate.  That comprises nearly the whole townland.  With all due respect to the Deputy, I am afraid he has been misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been misled, or else he does not know what he is talking about.  The fact is that we are resuming holdings in Burren for the relief of congestion but we will not divide or stripe or allot them until we have resumed them.  Even with the wide powers that the Land Commission have, we will not divide other people's <Col N="315" /> land until the resumption proceedings are completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically mentioned in my question the Kelly estate at Burren.  That is a holding that was left by a migrant, a man who was migrated by the Land Commission.  It has been in the hands of the Land Commission for four years.  It has been let in temporary lettings to various tenants.  If the Minister thinks that he can side-step the issue by some &ldquo;codology&rdquo; about other estates, he is making a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department knows all about these holdings and the officials in it have more information about them than the Deputy.  The Deputy has probably made promises to people in the district and they are not materialising, or he may have misinformed tenants.  If he has made a fool of himself, I cannot help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy to-day that this scheme provides, among other things, for the disposal of lands in course of resumption and it cannot be operated until the resumption proceedings are completed.  Surely that is plain enough English for the Deputy.  I also pointed out that there has not been any avoidable delay.  If the Deputy made foolish promises to people, or promised them too much, I cannot help him.  If he has been foolish or if he has made unguarded statements, that is his own affair.  He should not have done it.  He should have known more than to do it and I am afraid I cannot come to his rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He refers to me as having made a change of face.  I made no change of face.  As a matter of fact, the Deputy has made a certain change of face.  He had his chance when he was sitting <Col N="316" /> behind the Minister for Lands in his own Party and surely he could have done something then.  The fact is that he did not.  Indeed, his voice was remarkably silent.  If I remember correctly, on a few occasions when the Vote for the Department of Lands was being considered the Deputy congratulated the Minister for Lands on how well he was getting along when, as a matter of fact, he was really doing nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the situation we have to-day, and I am sorry that Deputy Moran has seen fit to raise this matter in this way.  He wants us to divide lands before we resume them.  We will first have to resume the lands before we proceed to allot them.  While the small farmers, the congests, in Mayo have such an open and brave champion as Deputy Moran to fight their cause, they have nothing to worry about.  Let him not make any promises in the future.  Let him first get the facts and any time he thinks fit to put down a question an answer will be given to him.</P>
      <P>It is stated here in very plain English what the position is and there is no attempt to conceal or mislead.  The Deputy is entitled to get information, provided the giving of it will not impede the work of Government departments. There is no special privilege in this instance and there is no departure from the usual procedure.  I will give any information that is required where it does not impede or delay the work of the Department.  If it does, I will be justified in not giving it.  I will answer any question the Deputy puts down.</P>
