      <P>On the morning of the 17th September, 1949, the day preceding that of the announcement of the British Government's decision to devalue the £ sterling, I was handed by the British Representative in Dublin a personal and confidential communication from Mr. Attlee informing me of his Government's decision and of the intention to announce it on the evening of the 18th September. Apart from this communication, no intimation of the British Government's decision was given to the Irish Government, and no correspondence passed between the two Governments in the matter.  The question of publication does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to the British authorities about this case on three separate occasions but they were not successful.</P>
      <P>The real difficulty is that there is a conflict of testimony on the facts.  In particular, the British authorities do not admit Mr. Neanon's claim that he was resident in Britain for more than 20 years prior to his deportation in 1939.  As Mr. Neanon has already been informed, however, if further evidence on this point can be adduced, the question of the revocation of the order made against him can be reopened.</P>

      <P>Our claim on the gold, etc. reserve held by Great Britain arises from our position as an earner of sterling and a holder of sterling investments and from our membership of the sterling area, for the needs of which the reserves form a common pool.  The right to convertibility into other currencies of our sterling resources is of a general character and is not limited <Col N="408" /> to any specific amount.  It will be recalled that the official communiqué issued at the close of the trade negotiations with the British Government in June, 1948, contained the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland will use its utmost endeavours to obtain the maximum amount of aid available under the European Recovery Programme with the object of ensuring, as far as practicable, that their recourse to the sterling area pool for hard currencies will not involve any ultimate drain on the pool.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(1) The necessity of entrusting industrial and commercial operations to specialist bodies largely autonomous in character, rather than directly to Departments of State, has raised the difficult problem of reconciling the freedom from interference regarded as essential for the discharge of business functions with amenability to Parliamentary control, especially in the financial sphere.  I agree with the Deputy that it is unsatisfactory that the accounts and activities of these bodies, some of which have a considerable influence on the national economy, should receive no systematic consideration by the Oireachtas.  The Government have had this problem under consideration, but have deferred a decision as to how it might be solved until they have studied in detail the activities of a few typical State-sponsored bodies.</P>

      <P>Widows of Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners who retired in the normal course will receive increases in their pensions.  Provision for the increases will be made by an amendment to the Garda Síochána (Pensions) Orders in the case of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police force who became members of the Garda Síochána on the amalgamation of the two forces by the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.  It is necessary to amend these Orders so as to apply the increases to widows' pensions which may be awarded in future as well as to those already being paid.

There are, however, practical difficulties in the way of early publication:&mdash; (a) the translation of the single Acts; (b) the time taken to prepare material, including index and table of contents; (c) the impracticability of giving priority to the printing and binding of the volumes having regard to the pressure of other work.  Legal practitioners should not, I think, be seriously inconvenienced by having to wait for the bound Statutes.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that injustice is being done to members of the Garda Síochána who hold Class 1 (a) literary qualifications and who were promoted to the rank of sergeant under the 1924 regulations, and subsequently reduced in rank due to the requirement that they must undergo a further professional examination before being eligible for promotion under the 1925 regulations, while members of the force who hold only Class 3 (a) literary qualifications and who were promoted under the 1925 regulations are, if they were subsequently reduced, eligible for promotion to the rank of sergeant without further professional examination; and, if so, whether he will arrange to <Col N="415" /> have the regulations amended so as to remove this discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to amend these regulations.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Promotion Regulations 1925 to 1947 provide that, in the ordinary way, a guard will not be eligible for promotion to the rank of sergeant, unless he has passed, or is exempted by the regulations from passing prescribed examinations (a) in educational subjects and (b) in police duties, the examinations in question being referred to as Class III promotion examinations.  The regulations exempt from the examination in educational subjects a guard who passed the Dublin Metropolitan Police Class III examination in educational subjects, or who passed or was deemed to have passed the &ldquo;P&rdquo; examination under the Garda Síochána Promotion Regulation of 1924.  They also exempt from the examination in police duties any guard who passed the examination in police duties and drill for promotion to the rank of sergeant in the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  They do not give a similar exemption to a guard who passed a Garda Síochána promotion examination in police duties prior to the date of the making of the 1925 regulations for the reason that the standard of those examinations is not considered to have been sufficiently high.  The regulations provide that a proportion not exceeding 25 per cent. of vacancies in the rank of sergeant may be filled by promotion of guards who have shown special zeal and ability in the performance of their duties, notwithstanding that they may not have passed the Class III promotion examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the members of the Garda who were promoted to the rank of sergeant prior to the making of the 1925 promotion regulations did not pass any examination in police duties prior to promotion, and those who did, passed an examination of a lower standard than the present Class III examination.  Accordingly, where such members have, for disciplinary reasons, been reduced to the rank of <Col N="416" /> guard, I do not consider that there is any ground for making them eligible for reinstatement in the rank of sergeant, without passing the Class III examination in police duties, no matter what their literary qualifications may be.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Censorship Board have made a prohibition order in respect of the publication referred to, and I have seen the letter from the secretary of the board which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on October 29th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to the board being &ldquo;properly summoned and convened&rdquo;, as the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, does not prescribe any procedure for the summoning or convening of meetings of the board.  I have been informed by the chairman of the board that the letter was written with the approval and on the directions of the board.</P>
    <P>In regard to the final part of the question I do not propose to take any action.  I should like to point out, however, that the board prohibited the report in pursuance of Section 7 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, on the ground that it advocates the unnatural prevention of conception, and to point out also that it is an offence under Section 16 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, to print, publish, sell or distribute a publication which advocates this, whether or not the publication is prohibited by the board.</P>
    <P>I assume the Deputy knows that under Section 8 of the 1946 Act, it is open to the author, the editor, the publisher or any five members of the Oireachtas acting jointly, to appeal to the Appeal Board from a prohibition order in respect of any book, and that Section 19 of the Act authorises the Minister to grant permits for the import of prohibited books.</P>

    <P>In cases where the powers of compulsory acquisition conferred on the Irish Tourist Board were exercised, an official arbitrator was engaged.

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that a 38 KV substation has been erected by the board in St. Kevin's Churchyard.  This particular site was found to be the only one in the locality to comply with the requirements of the town planning authorities and it was acquired by agreement with the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland.  All the work was carried out under the supervision of the incumbent and churchwarden of St. Kevin's and any human remains disturbed were reinterred under a licence granted by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the board has decided that in future no structure will be erected by them in a cemetery or burial ground.</P>

If a power station was built in this region, heavy and expensive transmission lines would have to be erected to bring the electricity generated to the main load centres.  The board have informed me that a power station project in this area could not be recommended at the present stage of development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons for the alarming increase in the price of eggs; whether this is due to an attempt by some controlling influence in one of the various commercial rings to extract huge profits; and whether he will take drastic measures to prevent the further exploitation of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent increase in the price of eggs is due to a seasonal scarcity which makes itself felt at this time of the year.  Egg prices react quickly to a change in the supply position and during the annual period of scarcity there is an upward tendency in egg prices.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence that the existing situation is being used for the purpose of exploiting the public but I should like to repeat the advice which has already been offered to consumers that by reducing their purchases they can help to bring down the general level in egg prices.</P>
      <P>I may add that it is expected that the period of seasonal scarcity will be of short duration this year and supplies should increase in the near future to an extent which will be more than sufficient to satisfy the home demand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Largely because consumers will take no steps whatever to protect themselves and very largely because, when there is a mere mention of scarcity, consumers rush in to buy <Col N="427" /> up and store eggs and other commodities which, rumour has it, are going to increase in price, and thereby create a scarcity which brings about an increase in price.  It will be clear that no action taken by this Government or no action that could be taken by the largest number of inspectors I could appoint will be in any way effective in controlling prices unless we get the cooperation of consumers as well.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to build a new children's hospital at Crumlin. The late Archbishop of Dublin, Most Reverend Dr. Byrne, had the project in mind for some time and had acquired a site from Dublin Corporation before my Department was approached early in 1938 for a grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund to meet the cost of the work.  The site of the proposed hospital adjoins Crumlin Road, Cooley Road and Errigal Road.  Approximately 300 beds are to be provided.  They will cater for surgical, medical, infants and private patients.  This will be a public charitable hospital.  The hospital will serve Dublin and a wider region for <Col N="433" /> which Dublin is the natural centre.  A number of beds, to be determined, will be reserved for patients sent to the hospital by local authorities from areas which I will in due course define for the purpose as the Dublin hospital district and the regional hospital district.  The total estimated cost is between £750,000 and £800,000.  A grant representing 100 per cent. of the approved costs has been approved from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  Presumably a contract will be placed in the near future and the work will commence shortly afterwards.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann nominate William Eugene Wann, at present secretary and director of audit in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, for appointment by the President to be the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>I move this motion because of the retirement, permission for which was recently granted by the President on the advice of the Government, of the former Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Maher.  Mr. Maher recently asked for permission to retire on purely personal and family grounds. I think that I am expressing the sentiments of every Party and every Deputy when I say that we received notification of his desire to retire with extreme regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the motion, I should like on behalf of this House to pay a tribute to the work that was done by John Maher, the former Comptroller and Auditor-General, in that high constitutional office during the period of a little over five years that he occupied that very responsible and dignified post.  He was appointed to the Comptroller and Auditor-General's Office in the year 1923 and, until his appointment as Comptroller and Auditor-General in 1944, he was the secretary and <Col N="435" /> director of audit in that office. During the intervening years from 1923 until he was appointed to the constitutional office of Comptroller and Auditor-General, he had very wide experience of the duties pertaining to the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Those Deputies who assisted at the Committee of Public Accounts will have realised from their attendance there and from the assistance that he gave to them the depth of knowledge and the wide experience that Mr. Maher had in connection with the duties of the office of Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He has retired at the comparatively early age of 63, although, under the statute, he could have remained on until he reached the age of 70.  I think it is proper that we should pay a tribute to the work that he has done in that office and in the constitutional position of Comptroller and Auditor-General for very many years.</P>
    <P>His retirement involves this House in the duty of appointing a successor. The position of Comptroller and Auditor-General is one that is enshrined in the Constitution.  The holder of the office is a servant of this House.  He is appointed by the Deputies in this House, and I feel sure that every Deputy will bring a sense of responsibility to bear in the choice of the person who is to fulfil the duties of this constitutional office.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is charged with the function and the high duty of being, so to speak, the watchdog of this House in order to see that the moneys which are voted or given by statute for public purposes are properly spent in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil.  He is charged with the duty of seeing that the wishes of this House are carried out in every detail by the officials of the various Departments whose duty it is to pay out public moneys.</P>
    <P>The office is one which requires personal and very watchful care and attention.  It requires experience of a very specialised kind.  It requires experience of governmental accountancy and the intricacies of public finance.  The function of seeing that <Col N="436" /> the disbursements from the Exchequer are made in strict accordance with the statute law of the country is one that requires to be discharged with great care.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has to see that the various accounting officers of the different Departments, in the disbursement of public moneys, carry out the exact wishes of this House.  The manner in which that work has to be done by the Comptroller and Auditor-General is directed and guided by numerous precedents of a very intricate character which have grown up over the years since this office was established.  It is here in this country, of course, an office of a constitutional character, but it had its origin in the constitutional position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in the Parliament across the sea, Great Britain.  The holder of the office must therefore realise that he is not a civil servant in the ordinary sense, that he is the servant of the public representatives elected here to this Assembly, and that he must bring to his task that experience and knowledge of precedents and law which is so essential to the due discharge of his duties.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to Deputies in order that, in fulfilling the duty that they have to fulfil under the Constitution, they may discharge that duty with the fullest knowledge that they ought to have.  The first issue that has to be decided is whether or not the person who is to be appointed to this position should be one who has been, or is, in the public service of this State, or whether some person unconnected with, and without experience of, the public service or governmental accountancy, should be appointed.  There are arguments for the appointment of some person of standing outside the Civil Service, provided he has experience of the workings of the very complicated finance machine and of the control of expenditure that is necessary to safeguard public moneys.  There are very few people outside the Civil Service who can have had that experience. However wide the knowledge a chartered accountant or any other qualified accountant may have, it does not fall <Col N="437" /> within the ordinary scope or ambit of his duties to learn anything very much about governmental accountancy or the intricacies of public finance, and, accordingly, the particular type of specialised knowledge which is required for this position can normally only be obtained by a person who has served a long apprenticeship in the public service, and particularly in this particular Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>It may be that Deputies, knowing that the person who is to be appointed is their servant, would prefer someone independent of officialdom or, if you like, bureaucracy.  There is something to be said for that.  The weight of the argument, however, in the view of the Government who have given this matter very careful consideration in this particular instance, is that, by reason of the intricacies of the duties and the experience that is necessary for the due carrying out of the position, and also by reason of the fact that the holder of the office must command not merely the respect of the accounting officers in the public service but command their fear, so to speak, the post should be filled from within the Civil Service if there is available a sufficiently highly qualified person to fill it.  Accounting officers must be in a position, or they must know, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General is a man who thoroughly understands the details and the intricacies of his duties; they must have confidence in him as a person whom they can from day to day consult on the problems that arise in connection with the disbursement of public moneys.  Very difficult and intricate problems arise daily in the course of public administration as to whether a particular proposed expenditure comes within the ambit or scope of a vote of money given by this House or whether a Supplementary Estimate would be required.  The accounting officers must know that they have in this constitutional officer a man whom they can trust, a man whom they can consult and from whom they will know and will have confidence that they will obtain the most trustworthy information to guide them.  They must also know that they have a man&mdash;and I use <Col N="438" /> the word without disrespect&mdash;that they cannot try any tricks on in connection with the handling of public moneys or the discharge of their duties in connection with the disbursement of voted moneys.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, and for the reasons that I have barely outlined, the Government came to the conclusion that in their view, which they would submit to the Dáil, the proper person to appoint was the man who has occupied for a considerable number of years now a position similar to that which Mr. Maher occupied before he was appointed Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Mr. Wann, who is mentioned in the motion which I am commending to the House, is the present secretary and director of audit in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That was the office which Mr. Maher occupied from 1923 until he was appointed Comptroller and Auditor-General in 1944. We are assured, and all our inquiries have confirmed, that Mr. Wann has had great experience of the duties of the office.  He has professional qualifications in accountancy and he has had every opportunity of attending with Mr. Maher the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and of acquiring a knowledge of public accountancy and of the intricacies of the duties of accounting officers in each Department.  In accordance with the precedent established by my predecessor, the present Leader of the Opposition, I informed Deputy de Valera yesterday of this proposal and of the reasons for it.  The other Parties were informed also by various Ministers and, to the extent that I could reach them, I informed every single Independent member of the proposal that is before the House and the reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this is not so much a Government proposal as merely a recommendation.  It is for the House to decide.  We must be jealous in safeguarding the rights and prerogatives of Deputies of this House in connection with this constitutional position.  We do not wish to create a precedent or merely to give the impression that, because we have <Col N="439" /> substantially followed the procedure which was followed before when the occasion arose of appointing Mr. Maher, that must necessarily bind a future Dáil or hamper the choice of members of the Dáil in connection with future appointments.  On the occasion of the appointment of the late Mr. McGrath as Comptroller and Auditor-General, the procedure adopted was for, I think, seven Deputies of the House to select a particular person.  It was emphasised at that time by the Leader of the Labour Party that that procedure was adopted &mdash;he suggested it should be continued &mdash;in order to emphasise the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor-General was the servant of this House.  The procedure adopted in 1944 was different from that.  I am adopting the procedure that was adopted by my predecessor, Deputy de Valera, when he was Taoiseach, on the occasion of Mr. Maher's appointment.</P>
    <P>We have given this matter very careful consideration.  We feel that the type of experience that is necessary requires that the appointment should go to somebody in the public service, if such a person is available in it.  If there is a person available in the Civil Service, then his claims &mdash; not so much his claims, because really he has no claims, but his qualifications &mdash; should be considered.  We agree that no person in the Civil Service of this State, whether he be, in fact, in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General or in any other post in the public service, has any claims to this post merely because he happens to have qualifications, or merely because he happens to be a high civil servant of long standing, high integrity and great knowledge and experience, or merely because he holds a particular post in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Nothing that we do here to-day in any way binds our successors in the Dáil.  It is a matter which must be done by each Dáil, but on this particular occasion, at all events, we feel that the proper course to adopt is to appoint the man who has had experience in working under Mr. Maher, who gave such good service to this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Accordingly, we recommend to the Dáil&mdash;and it is merely a recommendation on the part of the Government, putting as well as I can all the facts for and against as shortly as possible&mdash;this proposal and we commend it to the members of the Dáil for their approval. Finally, I am sure all Deputies will join with me in wishing Mr. Maher many years to enjoy his retirement in health and happiness as a reward for the great public service he rendered this State in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General during the past 26 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House desire to associate ourselves with the expression of regret made by the Taoiseach on the resignation of Mr. Maher.  During our time in office, as Leader of the House I was satisfied that there was the fullest safeguarding by him of the privileges of this House in regard to the appropriations of moneys for the public service.  He discharged his functions most efficiently, and we regret that he is leaving us.  We hope that he will have many years of health before him.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Taoiseach when he consulted me, we do not propose to object to the nomination of Mr. Wann, nor do we propose any other candidate. The Taoiseach has put the considerations which must be borne in mind by the House very clearly.  We understand that Mr. Wann is the most efficient person we could get for the post.  He has the necessary experience and, so far as we have been able to gather, he has proved most satisfactory in the discharge of the duties that he has been performing up to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like also to be associated with the statement of the Taoiseach that this officer being an officer of the House, ceases henceforth to be a civil servant and will have responsibilities to this House alone.  We are anxious that it should be made quite clear that the appointment of a civil servant to that post is not made because he is a civil servant but because he is the most suitable person that the House could choose at the present moment. We are very anxious that it should not <Col N="441" /> be regarded as a precedent&mdash;the fact that on these occasions when an appointment has been made it has been given to a civil servant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the position for this House has been safeguarded by the statements made by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition.  I understand that some similar safeguards were expressed in the statement that was made by the then Taoiseach on the occasion of the appointment of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
      <P>I will make this suggestion for the future, that when the Ceann Comhairle is notified of the resignation, or the ceasing to hold office, of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the matter should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I suggest that for this reason; naturally that committee will consult with the Taoiseach and the recommendation coming before the House will come from a committee of the House.  I say that so that the position will be on record for future consideration of this important matter.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned to me yesterday by the Taoiseach, and it is laid down in the Constitution, that in regard to this position of Comptroller and Auditor-General, the salary paid to him is a salary fixed by statute.  it seems to me, and I think it will so appear to every Deputy, that for a position of such grave constitutional responsibility the salary that is being paid at the moment is not adequate. Perhaps the Taoiseach might suggest that that matter should be considered by a committee of the House so that the legislation that will be necessary to deal with it will be introduced as soon as possible after this appointment has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking last night on this question I expressed <Col N="442" /> the view that it does not matter very much whether this particular company that is being established represents nationalisation of transport or not; it is as near to nationalisation as does not matter.  But there is one important consideration.  As we know, the number of State companies established to carry out industrial and commercial activities in this country has steadily increased over a number of years and the time has come to consider some machinery to control to a certain extent, or to supervise, the activities of such organisations. There was a suggestion made by Deputy Cowan, namely, that if a transport company should become park and parcel of the ordinary Civil Service of the State, it should be controlled by a Parliamentary Secretary who will be answerable to this House, and the members of the House will be in a position to ask questions and raise every detail of administration of that company here.  There are many people who claim that such far-reaching investigation and interference with the working of a commercial company would make things so difficult that it could hardly be justified.</P>
      <P>I think that the provision in this Bill for supervision by this House is too limited.  Provision is made to have a report submitted to the House each year and the House has the right to debate that particular report.  As between that provision and the very drastic suggestion made by Deputy Captain Cowan.  I think there may be a middle course.  It should be possible to set up a committee of this House, or a committee of both Houses, to investigate the operations of all State companies.  Just as we have a Committee of Public Accounts to deal with the operations of the various Government Departments we should have a similar committee to deal with the activity and operations of all State companies.  In that way there would be a more effective control over their administration. This House would certainly be better informed of the day-to-day operations of such companies.  In addition, the safeguard of having an annual report submitted to this House, as is provided in this Bill, should also be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Last night when I was dealing with the rights of the stockholders, who are being acquired.  I was not quite sure of the exact date upon which common stock will be redeemed under this Bill. From the Third Schedule it appears that debenture stock is redeemable in 1955-60, while common stock is not redeemable until 1975-85.  That seemed to me to be an injustice to the holders of common stock.  In a matter of this kind, when we are dealing with the rights of the ordinary citizens, it is our duty to deal absolutely fairly with any sections of the community with which we are brought into contact.  I do not think anyone can condone the grave injustice inflicted under this Bill upon this particular section of the community.  Many of the common stockholders in Córas Iompair Éireann are people of very limited means. Many of them are trustees for the benefit of dependents who are in poor circumstances.  I think for that very reason nothing less than absolute justice should be done.  There is the further factor that this stock will be reduced to 80 as compared with the debenture stock, which will be taken over at par.  I think that here again there is a case for investigation and a very urgent need to meet these particular sections of the community in a fair and reasonable way.</P>
    <P>The important issue facing this House is&mdash;can we now, after all the amalgamations, transformations and changes that have taken place, assure ourselves that there is a reasonable prospect that this new transport company will make a success of its operations? I think that is the most important question this House has to consider.  What evidence have we that this new company will be more successful than was Córas Iompair Éireann, in the last five years?  Have we any evidence that it will be more successful than the amalgamated railways were up to the time of the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann?  Unless there is a very far-reaching change in policy and a more vigorous application of progressive ideas in regard to transport in general I do not think we can have any definite assurance on that point. There is no doubt that if transport <Col N="444" /> were left to itself road transport would eliminate rail transport by the ordinary laws of competition.  I think that is an accepted fact.  There may be some people who hold that the ordinary economic laws should take their course, but most sane people realise that railways are a national asset.  They are an asset which should be preserved, if at all possible, because they are the backbone of our transport system.</P>
    <P>The problem is as to how one will preserve them.  I believe that the railway system cannot be preserved and that this transport company cannot be successful unless a real effort is made to dovetail rail and road transport and to make road transport a tributary, as it were, to rail transport, because I think rail transport should be the backbone of our transport system.  I think any reasonable person must acknowledge that that is a sane approach to the problem.  That is a suggestion which has been expressed on many occasions in the past.  There is nothing original in it.  Unfortunately, it is not a suggestion which has so far been adopted.  Long-distance bus services are running parallel with the railway system.  There does not seem to be any intention of discontinuing that unnecessary and unnatural competition.  It is unnatural to have two distinct services, which are operated by the same company, competing against each other when there is not sufficient traffic to maintain two services.</P>
    <P>I think it is deplorable to see buses coming perhaps 100 or 200 miles, full or partly loaded, over a route where almost empty trains are running parallel.  It is difficult to imagine why this should be.  The bus services seemingly have gained a certain amount of popular support and that makes an appeal to those in control to retain the buses as against the trains. There is no doubt that buses travelling along the main roads can collect passengers nearer to their homes than can the trains.  The bus can stop wherever there is a passenger and take him up. That brings the service a little nearer to the citizen's own door and that gives the bus one advantage over the railway <Col N="445" /> system.  There does not seem to be any reason, however, why there should not be bus services operating to convey passengers to the nearest railway station from which they could travel the remainder of their journeys by rail.</P>
    <P>In matters of this kind it is difficult for the ordinary layman to express his views because there are technical difficulties which the layman cannot always envisage.  As one who has no technical knowledge of transport, I can give the House my own experience as a passenger. When the branch line was running from Sallins to Tullow, coming from my district one had two alternative methods of travelling.  If I wished to travel by bus, I could pick up a bus within a quarter of a mile of my home and that bus would leave me in the centre of the city.  If I were to travel by rail, I would have to travel five miles to the nearest station.  Then I would arrive in Dublin at Kingsbridge and not in the centre of the city.  I would have to travel, perhaps with luggage, from Kingsbridge to Parkgate Street to get the ordinary city bus there, a bus which is not suitable for carrying luggage, and continue the journey to the centre of the city.  That is a very inconvenient service.  I do not think that, as long as you have a bus service that takes a citizen almost from his own door right into the heart of the city, a railway service, in which the journey is broken two or three times, is a suitable alternative.  I do not see any reason why the rail service should be so inconvenient.  I do not see any reason why there should not be short-distance buses to collect people from the scattered rural areas and take them to the nearest railway station, and I do not see why there should not be a special bus in the city to meet each particular train and take the travellers direct to the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>In the same way, take, for example, a person who goes up to Dublin to do some shopping.  If he travels by train, he will, in the evening, have to look for one of the ordinary city buses which may, at that particular time, be heavily overcrowded&mdash;as they usually are about 5 or 6 o'clock&mdash;and <Col N="446" /> travel on that bus to the railway station at Kingsbridge or elsewhere. There is even a possibility that such a person will not be able to put his luggage on that particular type of bus and, in any case, there is also the possibility that the bus may be overcrowded with the ordinary city traffic and the person concerned may not be able to catch the particular train. Why should there not be a special bus to pick up passengers in the centre of the city and meet the railway train at Kingsbridge&mdash;a bus capable of taking their luggage and everything concerned&mdash;and give the passengers a through-ticket right to the end of their journey?  That seems a reasonable way of dealing with the problem, but it is a method which has not yet been adopted in this country, though it has in other countries.</P>
    <P>I happened to be&mdash;in regard to an entirely different matter&mdash;in an English city a short time ago.  During the rush hours of the day I was rather surprised at the fact that there were very few cyclists on the streets.  I found that the reason was that the bus service was so efficient and so cheap that people did not bother cycling.  I mention that, just to show that a public transport company, if it is properly equipped and adequate and efficient, can compete with the private ways and means of travelling.  There is no doubt whatever that, if a public service to the city were available, there are many people in the country or in the country towns who have their own cars who would travel by the train and bus service rather than incur the wear and tear upon their own cars by bringing them to the city.  That is true, and I think it is an aspect of public transport that has got to be considered.</P>
    <P>The same position also arises in regard to goods traffic.  One is often inclined to wonder why so much heavy goods are conveyed by road rather than by rail.  One would think that the railway system is ideally suited for heavy freight traffic.  The reason is that the loading and unloading of goods at railway stations is so troublesome and so expensive that in order to avoid it people will avail either of the Córas Iompair Éireann buses or lorries to <Col N="447" /> convey their goods the full distance, or, alternatively, they will use their own lorries.  But, here again, if we had a system by which lorries would collect goods for the railways and again deliver them from the rail-head right to their destination, it would be possible to divert a very substantial amount of traffic to the railways.  In that connection, I would mention that I happened to be on a deputation to Córas Iompair Éireann some years ago, with regard to the closing-down of the Tullow-Sallins branch railway line.  I made a suggestion which I thought was an absolutely original one, namely, that freight containers should be provided which would enable goods to be transferred from road lorries to the railway wagons without the trouble of unloading the goods.  I was surprised and pleased to be told that such containers were already being provided.  I have noticed quite a number of them on the roads recently.  It seems to me that in the provision of such containers lies the hope of diverting a considerable amount of long-distance traffic to the railways.  If it is possible, speedily and efficiently, to transfer a load from a road lorry to a railway wagon without any great delay or trouble or expense, then I think the tendency would be more and more to avail of that system. If Córas Iompair Éireann adopts that system widely and are in a position to collect goods by lorry, transfer them to the railway and retransfer them to the lorry, perhaps to finish the journey, then they may be able to win back a considerable amount of the freight traffic that they have lost.  Everything, of course, will depend upon the system of transfer being not too difficult or expensive. That is a matter, perhaps, of mechanisation, in regard to which I could not pretend to be an expert.</P>
    <P>It strikes me also that that same method of loading goods in containers, which would be transferrable, would also obviate a good deal of shunting at the smaller stations.  I remember, when the Shillelagh branch line was in operation, on one occasion cycling to Tinahely station to catch the passenger train.  I inquired about the time the train would leave and I was informed <Col N="448" /> that the train had left half an hour before I arrived.  The stationmaster asked me if I was cycling and, when I told him that I was, he told me that I would have no difficulty in overtaking the train which, in due course, I did.  That type of delay was due to the system of shunting in order to pick up different types of wagons.  If we could transfer the load from one line to another, from one wagon to another, it would obviate a great deal of what I consider is unnecessary shunting, which is a source of delay.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of that matter is that it would enable goods and passenger trains to be combined.  The reason why we cannot convey goods and passengers on the same train is that the delays at the stations are too great.  If you had a quick efficient method of transferring the load on to the wagons of the train then you would be able to avoid those delays and thus make a saving by combining goods and passenger services on the one train.  That would particularly apply to lines such as those I have mentioned, branch lines such as the Tullow-Sallins branch line, where the total passenger and goods traffic is rather light.  I am only making those suggestions because I think that every Deputy feels it is his duty to do everything possible to help the operation of this national concern.  If this final attempt to solve the problem of transport fails it will be in the nature of a disaster for the nation; it will be a great loss and expense and will completely dislocate our whole national life, so it is a matter of urgent importance that this transport company should succeed.  It might be said that one way to make it a success would be to eliminate all competition.  I do not agree on that point, and I would like to hear the Minister disagreeing with it also, because a certain amount of competition is necessary to produce efficiency.</P>
    <P>I think it absolutely essential that private lorry owners should have the right to deliver their own goods wherever they are supplying them or to collect what they require.  That element of competition is a far better safeguard to the public than any legal <Col N="449" /> safeguards that might be introduced into this Bill.  In the same way it is essential to preserve the right of persons to travel by other means than the Córas Iompair Éireann services. If, for example, the bus services in this city are not sufficiently adequate or cheap, then the right of a citizen to take out his own bicycle and use it on the street is one that should be preserved because it helps to force this national company to keep up to date and provide efficient services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two or three points upon which I should like a little enlightenment.  They have probably been raised by other Deputies during the course of this debate, but nevertheless I would like to put them on record.  I am sure that the Minister will answer all the questions that have been raised when he is concluding. I should like to ask him for what reason did he, to all intents and purposes, remove himself and his colleagues of the Government from any share in the responsibility for running this great national concern.  If, as I have heard it described, this is the nationalisation of the railways, surely that is one vital reason why the Government should not only keep closely in contact with it but also take a very close interest in the running of its affairs.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes enacted it appears to me that the railway company will be in a position to run its affairs according to its own ideas.  That in certain circumstances would be very desirable but if the Government and the nation through the Government has to find the money to subsidise any possible loss I would like to think that the Deputies of this House who are responsible to their constituents for the expenditure of sums of money would be entitled to discuss the affairs of this national concern whenever they felt it was desirable to raise these matters in this House.  I personally cannot at the moment see any good reason for the shedding of that responsibility.  As I said in opening, I have no doubt that the Minister will give us the reasons for taking that particular step which this House looks for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> I have heard in the course of the last couple of years some very severe criticism of the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and usually the blame for the failure of the concern to produce profits was placed on his shoulders.  The criticism usually was to the effect that the particular gentleman concerned lacked the knowledge required by a person occupying such a highly responsible position.  When this Bill becomes enacted a board is to be appointed in the near future and the members of this board, I have no doubt, will receive generous salaries and I would like to know from the Minister if the appointment of the gentlemen concerned will be based on their extensive knowledge of transport affairs, of matters that would be vital to the successful running of the transport organisation of the magnitude of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I cannot say anything about the abilities of the present chairman or whether his abilities exceed those of the former chairman. All I do know is that the former chairman actively participated in a transport business of which I understand he made a very great success. From that point of view it can be assumed that he at least had an expert knowledge of road transport and he perhaps acquired a useful amount of knowledge of rail transport as he went along.  He was also a highly trained practical businessman who took an active interest in the affairs of numerous concerns in the city and from that I would presume his knowledge of the running of a business to be rather extensive.  I do not know if the same can be said of the present chairman, if he has had practical business experience such as that of the former chairman which I have referred to.  If the members of the board to be appointed possess all the qualifications which they should possess then that will be all to the good, but if they are to be merely appointees, as Deputy Cowan pointed out, who will receive plum appointments&mdash;I think these were the words he used&mdash;then it is very questionable whether all the trouble that has been taken will bring about anything in the nature of the success which we would all desire to see attaching to this great national transport concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> I would also like information on the abandonment of the site for the central bus station in Store Street.  I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to say if the report which is general amongst members of the Dublin Corporation is true, that the present manager of Córas Iompair Éireann is strongly in favour of using the basement of the Store Street building for the purpose of a bus station, for which it was specially designed.  The offices overhead were, I understand, merely for the use of the administrative staff, so that from the point of view of the Government desiring to utilise the office space for the officials of a Department of State, which may be desirable, it should not in any sense interfere with the use of the basement as a bus station.  I would like very much if we could be enlightened on that particular point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the removal of the bus station from the Store Street area and its establishment in the Smithfield area, I would like to know if it is true that that is likely to cost a sum in the region of £350,000 to meet certain eventualities, such as the removal of a large number of families from the Smithfield area, widening certain thoroughfares in the vicinity, and reestablishing the families in some other site, yet to be selected.  If that £350,000 has to be found by the ratepayers of this city, then I can only describe it as an outrage.  I want to impress upon the House that the central bus station is not designed to provide any facilities for the people of the city.  It will be providing facilities for those who arrive in the capital from various counties of Ireland and who go from the capital to various counties.  The people of Dublin will receive very little of the amenity which that great building would provide. Therefore, I can use no other words than to say it would be an outrage on the ratepayers in the City of Dublin if they have to find the sum of £350,000 for the preparation of a new bus station in the Smithfield area.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the Smithfield area is completely and entirely unsuitable, it is removed to a great extent&mdash;I suppose anything up to 20 <Col N="452" /> minutes' walking time&mdash;from the centre of the city, and people arriving in a place like Smithfield would have to hire private transport to take them into the centre of the city.  On the other hand, from the proposed site at Store Street, which is nearing completion, it takes only something like three minutes' walking time to leave you convenient to any of the hotels in the city.  At the same time, you are beside a railway station which could very easily be converted into a central railway station.  That would almost bring about the position where it would scarcely be necessary to continue with the other railway stations. It would be a desirable state of affairs if the people of this country could arrive at a central depôt, either by bus or train, and be in a position to entrain immediately, if they arrived by bus, for any other part of the country. I desire enlightenment on these points and would be glad if the Minister would answer them and especially let the House know if it is correct that the present manager of Córas Iompair Éireann is strongly in favour of the use of the Store Street site as a central bus station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion as to whether this Bill is nationalisation or just a measure of State control.  I do not think it matters very much what name you put on it.  To me it does not seem to be nationalisation, but maybe that is because, in the main, I am not in favour of the principle of nationalisation. What this Bill does is the important thing.  It is the stepping in of the State to rescue a bankrupt concern. The railway company of this part of Ireland is bankrupt, and that is the difficulty we are up against at this moment.  The Bill outlines certain steps which can be taken in order to alleviate that bankrupt situation.  In itself, however, this present Bill is, I take it, only the first of a series of Bills dealing with the transport situation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Cogan, I have not any suggestions to make as regards loading and unloading.  I am not a transport man and it is a highly complicated <Col N="453" /> subject.  I would say, however, that at the present moment, unfortunately, the face of the public seems to be turned away from railways, both for carrying goods and passengers.  What concerns me is how our railways are to be made pay without putting a stranglehold on the farming, commercial and industrial community generally.  If we as a State wish to pay for it, we can have the most wonderful railway system in the world&mdash;at a price.  That is the position that faces us.  How can we as a country maintain our railway system and do the best for that system and its employees without at the same time putting a stranglehold on private enterprise and, perhaps, on the commercial and farming communities?  The Bill, of course, cannot deal with that.  That is a matter that will have to be dealt with later.</P>
    <P>There are some people who are very concerned that Córas Iompair Éireann in future may take steps to eliminate road competition which, of course, hits it very heavily.  We know that at the present moment Córas Iompair Éireann has something like 5 per cent. of the lorries in this country.  It cannot establish a monopoly with only 5 per cent, of the lorries but if, in future, it will be given powers or will take powers it could very quickly increase the number of its lorries.</P>
    <P>Although I sympathise very much with the position of the railways, I do not want to see the Irish farmers and commercial community&mdash;in fact, the citizens generally&mdash;handed over to the interests of any transport company. A measure of free competition, in the long run, would be better for the railways and certainly it would be better for the country generally.  I do not necessarily say that free and unrestricted competition should be permitted, but there certainly should be a large degree of competition. Otherwise it would be very difficult for this House or for any other body interested in railway rates and prices generally to know at what price goods can be carried economically.  I do not wish to labour or to stress the point&mdash; every Deputy can see it as well as I can&mdash;that it is something which vitally <Col N="454" /> affects the whole industrial arm, if we are not in a position to transport goods as cheaply as possible.  It will mean that industry and agriculture must carry a heavier burden than they should be asked to bear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor spoke about the proposed Córas Iompair Éireann bus station on the north side that is in process of being built.  Everybody has his own view and opinion as to the ideal site for a bus station but it seems to me, and it has always seemed to me, that in the City of Dublin where there is such a very difficult traffic position at the moment, with the bulk of traffic moving north and south across the Liffey, it would inevitably lead to traffic chaos to bring every bus coming to Dublin and every bus going out of Dublin across that natural flow of traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the question of the very great expense under which Córas Iompair Éireann was operating when the Minister had to interest himself in the situation.  My views on that point are covered by what I said at the beginning, that the Government had to step in to save a bankrupt concern. That is the position which the country and we, as Deputies, are concerned with at the moment.  I do not know that there is any easy way for our railways.  We are an agricultural country, and the transport of agricultural goods does not pay because they cannot be transported very far.  We are not, unfortunately, mainly an industrial country, and it is the carrying of heavy industrial goods which makes the railways pay.  We have not got these goods, as yet, to carry and neither have we a heavy population. Even in England they are finding it difficult to get their railways to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these economic and geographical factors, we have a problem facing us in connection with our railways, but I want to stress that the railways, important as they are, exist for the purpose of serving the community. The community does not exist for the purpose of serving any transport concern, and we must see that in doing what we can for the railways we do not handicap private enterprise&mdash;if far more than private enterprise&mdash;if there is anybody who is not very fond of private enterprise&mdash;the whole agricultural and commercial life of the State.  That is what many people, including myself, are afraid of in the future.  Although at the moment there is no question of the railways being given dictatorial powers in that respect, <Col N="457" /> inevitably in the future they will want these powers in order to make their undertakings pay, and as the State interests itself by pouring money into a transport concern, so it will have a vested interest in the earning of profits by that concern.  I am anxious to see that we have a transport system which will pay its way, but I do not want to see it paying its way at the expense of private individuals, and, in fact, of the whole commercial life of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell has conditioned his support for the Bill on its containing no proposals interfering with private enterprise.  If the Minister had been frank with the Deputy and with the House and had told them everything he should have told them in the matter of future policy, I am sure that he would not have Deputy Dockrell's support for the Bill.  The Minister knows quite well that he kept back from the House, in introducing this Bill, many matters having relation to the future of public transport that he should have given to the House. It is unfortunate that the future of public transport has been made a keen political issue and that public transport here is to be a keen issue as between different political groups. The Minister started off his statement by reciting all the sins, as he called them, and all the blunders of Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over a number of years and gave these as the excuse for introducing the Bill.  That was the only reason for the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the bad management and the squandermania, as he termed it, of Córas Iompair Éireann in its four years of office.  He went out of his way, and those behind him on his left, led by Deputy Larkin, went out of their way to try to belittle the efforts made during the years of the emergency to maintain and keep that undertaking in existence and to belittle the efforts of the Minister's predecessor in every possible respect. It is unfortunate for the future of <Col N="458" /> public transport here, if that is to be the basis of discussion.  If the discussion of public transport policy is to be on a political basis, and on a political basis only, and if public transport policy is to be fashioned in that way, the future of this country will be most uncertain.</P>
      <P>Public transport is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of the State and its people.  I think that is agreed, and an adequate public transport at a reasonable cost is all-important.  If this Bill becomes law as it is, unaltered, it will not put the new Córas Iompair Éireann in any better position than it is in at the moment to provide an adequate public transport service at a reasonable cost to the public.  The Minister will find that, before very long, the new Córas Iompair Éireann will come to him and tell him, as I am sure the existing body has told him, that it cannot carry on unless further legislation is passed. Sir James Milne pointed out in his report that, with the present competition from private transport, Córas Iompair Éireann could not meet its expenses, and he showed that, unless there was a change of policy in many directions, a public transport undertaking could not hope to pay its way.</P>
      <P>This new undertaking will have more liabilities than its predecessor.  It will have to pay a dividend on the common stock and also on the stock of the Grand Canal Company.  It will have to face demands for increased wages and increased expenses of one kind and another.  The Minister is making provision in the Bill to give the new board a free hand as to charges for fares and carriage of goods and other matters incidental thereto.  It is quite on the cards that this new board will give as little satisfaction to the public as the board that it is proposed to abolish.  They must do the things which are set out in the Bill for them to do.  They must pay their way. They must provide the interest on the full capital that is weighted on them. They are bound in law to provide, in addition to the interest on debentures, interest on the ordinary stock and on the stock of the Grand Canal Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> It is significant in regard to the acquisition of the Grand Canal Company that the Minister dismissed that matter very shortly.  He gave little or no reason to the Dáil as to why it was proposed to acquire the Grand Canal Company.  He is aware, I am sure, that in the past every canal acquired by a railway company was closed down soon afterwards.  Has it been decided that the canal operating at the present time is not essential for the future inland transport of the country?  The Minister has made no provision in this Bill to safeguard the interests of the private users of that canal.  He is aware that many private persons earn their livelihood in using the canal. They have boats on it and they keep a number of men employed.  I hope the Minister on the Committee Stage will amend the Bill so as to provide for these private users of the Grand Canal.  It is assumed that the railway company, or the new board under this Bill, will have the right to close the canal if they are so minded.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies have been rather surprised that the Government have decided to give this new board full authority to close any branch lines they wish to close permanently, not alone that, but to abandon them and be no longer responsible for them in any way. That is a rather extraordinary provision in view of the fact that a campaign was carried on over a number of years against the closing of branch lines. That campaign was carried on by many members of groups who now support the present Government.  A very active and deliberate campaign was carried on in the teeth of the emergency, when sufficient fuel was not available to run scarcely any railway, against the closing of branch lines.  Whether it is sound national policy to close branch lines or to keep them open, it is very difficult to say.  We do know that when a branch line is closed, additional transport is thrown on to the roads. These roads are maintained, as the House is aware, to a great extent by funds raised from local ratepayers and the burden of maintaining them is increasing year by year.  The House is also aware that these highways are <Col N="460" /> not able to carry the transport that they are being forced to carry at the present time.  They are narrow, crooked and winding and unless millions of money is expended on them in future to strengthen, improve and widen them, they will be found incapable of carrying all the traffic of this country.  To my mind, therefore, every mile of railway that can possibly be maintained and kept open must be maintained and kept open.  It will be sound national policy in the long run.  It is not a day-to-day business.  It is a matter that is bound up with the life of the nation for 100 years to come and if a false step is made at the present time, in closing down branch lines, the people will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>I personally believe that the maintenance of the railways is absolutely essential to the future welfare of the State.  When the cost of making and maintaining roadways is considered, it must be frightening to local authorities or even to the central authority.  The Government must be fully aware that the roadways in this country capable of carrying heavy traffic and motor traffic at the present time are very limited in number indeed.  To make new roadways and to widen and straighten the ones we have, will cost millions of pounds and most of that will have to be provided by the local ratepayers.  There is an outcry at present in the country generally because of the burden local authorities have to carry for housing and a thousand and one other things. The Minister should keep that in mind. For that reason, the Government should accept full responsibility to the nation for every mile of railway that is closed down, whether it be a branch line or a main line.  It should not be left to a board which has no responsibility to anyone for its actions.  Once these lines are abandoned finally, they will not be reopened.  The cost of reopening them will be found to be beyond the resources of the State.  For that reason alone, the Dáil would be justified in rejecting the Bill, unless we hear from the Minister when he is concluding, that he is prepared to amend the Bill, so as to provide that the responsible Minister or the Government <Col N="461" /> will take the responsibility before any branch lines are closed in future.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport charges, I think it is probably right that the board should have the determination of what they will charge for the transport of passengers, but I would suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should be consulted by this board in regard to the matter of the transport charges for raw materials needed by farmers and for farm produce going to the market. Every effort has been made for a number of years past to increase agricultural output.  As things stand at present, the cost of transporting many primary products of agriculture to the markets is almost as great as the value of the articles themselves.  Similarly, the cost of transporting raw materials needed by the farmers, such as manure and lime, is almost prohibitive if public transport is utilised.  It is no wonder that Córas Iompair Éireann has been losing a lot of revenue in that way and that there has been an increase in the number of lorries carrying goods for traders and private individuals.  The Milne Report recommended that private lorries should be zoned and should be allowed to operate only within a short distance of the owner's residence.  The Minister did not even advert to that in his opening remarks.  He did not advert to many of the important problems that are touched upon in the Milne Report and that must affect the interests of the country and many sections and elements in the country in the future.</P>
    <P>Because this is an agricultural country, most of the goods carried by rail or otherwise are produced by agriculture or needed by agriculture. Therefore, I believe that we must not have a restricted type of traffic.  We must have as flexible a transport system for the agricultural community as possible and any other system will be bad for them.  Manufactured goods are in a different category altogether. But the transport of agricultural produce and the raw material needed by farmers should be as flexible as possible and any restriction on the type of transport that farmers may need <Col N="462" /> will be seriously damaging to the structure of agriculture and the output of agriculture in future.  Whatever may be the policy to be pursued by this new board, certainly anything that can be done to loosen up even the present restrictions and to allow farmers, if need be, to work for hire for their neighbours in carrying agricultural produce to and from the farm needs to be done in the immediate future and is very necessary for the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Railways have been a bone of contention in this country for many years. That does not date from the 1924 Act or the 1944 Act.  In 1876 there was a Royal Commission set up called the Devonshire Commission and they seriously considered at that time&mdash;it was even put up to them by the then directors&mdash;that the British Government should acquire all the railways and the stock of the railways.  They gave that serious consideration and it would appear from the report that, but for the fact that they were not satisfied it was necessary to do that in England, they would have advised that the State should have acquired the railways here and run them as a State concern.  That is a long time ago now and it would appear from the report that the railways were not then in a good position.  They were scarcely able to pay dividends and what they had to charge for transport was considered too high in those days.  Things have changed very much since then and the different small groups of railways were brought into one group by the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>Anyone who looks at the railway termini in Dublin will see that they were all planned separately.  The railway services from the different parts of the country should be brought together in one terminus.  I wonder what will be the policy of the new board in that direction.  Will it be possible to bring all the railway services into Dublin into one centre?  That would appear to be a good, sound policy if there is to be any future for the railways.</P>
    <P>There has been much controversy in this House and outside as to whether <Col N="463" /> the bus station in Store Street should be abandoned and a station erected somewhere else.  If there is to be a new board set up, the commonsense thing would be to let that new board consider the matter.  I do not think it is right for a Government or the Minister or a political Party to decide these things on political lines, to decide that because something was done by their predecessors it must be wrong and should be abandoned irrespective of what damage that might do to the national structure of the State.  There has been too much of that in the last 18 months.  This House is not capable of deciding whether the bus station should be in Store Street or in Smithfield. The combined wisdom and brains of this House are incapable of deciding that matter.  I suggest that the Minister and the Government are incapable of deciding it properly and that they can only decide it with prejudiced minds.  If the new board is to be a success it should not be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>, with the fact that the Government had decided that they cannot have the building erected in Store Street as a bus terminus.  That should be left to somebody else.</P>
    <P>There has been a great controversy as to whether it was the Minister, the management of Córas Iompair Éireann, the Dublin Corporation or its town-planning committee decided that Store Street was the proper place at the time it was selected.  I have no doubt, and I am sure the Minister has not, that if Store Street was found not to be suitable by the Dublin Corporation, by the management of the railways or by the other interests concerned no effort would have been made to put the station at Store Street.  I am sure the Minister knows very well that it was not put there through cussedness on the part of anybody.  It was put there because the people who had the responsibility for determining on the site for a central bus station chose Store Street because they believed it was the best of the sites available. But the Minister and the Government, in their wisdom and judgment&mdash;with prejudice I am sorry to say because <Col N="464" /> that is apparent to everyone&mdash;decided that the Store Street building must be abandoned and that no bus must be allowed to shelter in it.</P>
    <P>As to the concentration of the staffs in Córas Iompair Éireann in Store Street, the Minister says it is cheaper to have them in offices all over the city.  Where you have a large number on the staff, it is commonsense that they should be concentrated in one building so that they will be in touch with the executives and the heads of the departments.  It would mean a more economic and efficient running of any institution to have all the staff, if possible, in one building.  At one time the staffs of the Minister's Department were spread all over the city.  If a Deputy wanted to visit some of the sections of this Department he had very often to spend a whole day travelling around the city to get in touch with them.  It must have been very inconvenient for the officers running the different sections of the Department when they were spread all over the city.  The same thing, I am sure, applies to the railway company with offices in different parts of the city.  Rents and rates have to be paid for all these buildings.  To concentrate them altogether would seem to be the most sensible thing to do.</P>
    <P>I know nothing about the details or the politics in regard to this site in Store Street.  But I know that the people who come from the south-east will not be pleased if they have to go to Smithfield to get a bus to return home.</P>
    <P>From the little that I know about Dublin, I believe Store Street would be a far more convenient centre as a bus station for a bigger proportion of our population than Smithfield will be. No adequate reasons have been given for the change that has been made. There must be some mysterious reasons for it, but these, I think, will not satisfy the ordinary people.  The building in Store Street was almost completed, and then quite suddenly, on the change of Government, it was decided to abandon the project.  What would be thought of some future Government if it decided to abandon the <Col N="465" /> Custom House as offices for a Government Department and spread the staffs out all over the city?  It was foolish to abandon Store Street.</P>
    <P>In many other ways the people of the country will be affected by this new transport legislation.  I shall reserve going into details until the Bill is in Committee.  One thing, at any rate, is apparent, and that is that this Bill will do nothing to solve our national transport problem.  There appears to be a difference of opinion as to whether or not the Bill means nationalisation.  I do not think that matters two hoots.  The railways have been semi-nationalised since 1944.  If this Bill produces results, and goes a step further in the direction of nationalisation, I do not think anybody will worry whether we call this nationalisation or State control.  In my opinion, the fact that the new board will not be responsible to the Minister, or the Government, will have a damaging effect.  The Minister proposes to give the new board additional powers, but he has not given any indication of what they will be.  That is something which will need careful consideration before it is passed by the House.</P>
    <P>I again suggest to the Minister that on the Committee Stage he should consider the matter of charges for the carriage of agricultural produce to and from the farm.  The new board should not have the last word on that.  It should be obliged to have consultation with the Minister or the Department of Agriculture.  It is all important that we should have the most flexible type of transport to serve the needs of agriculture, to carry the raw materials to the farm and the produce to the market. The charges should not be such as to reduce production.  I hope that when replying the Minister will give the House some of the information that he would appear to have deliberately withheld when moving the Second Reading of the Bill.  Will he tell us what the Government's considered view is on the future of our transport, as well as the possibility of the new board making a success of our public transport, and of being able to pay dividends <Col N="466" /> and meet the charges in respect of stock holdings?  We know that the payment of interest in the future on all this stock will be Government guaranteed.  If the new company finds itself unable to pay the interest on the stock the State Exchequer will have to pay it.</P>
    <P>The State Exchequer has not been called upon to pay a lot yet.  The Minister must know that the first payment came to be made as a result of the disastrous conditions that prevailed in 1947.  We all remember the terrible weather we had in that year and the fuel scarcity there was.  By reason of all the increased charges that had to be met&mdash;increases in wages, increases in the price of fuel and increased expenses generally&mdash;the company in 1947 was not able to earn, as it had earned up to that time, sufficient money to pay the interest on the preference stock. The Minister must know that quite well.  Therefore, I think he should be more frank and honest with the House and the country so far as this transport problem is concerned instead of trying to score some small political advantage.  It would be far better for all concerned that the House should settle down, without reference to past or future Governments, and discuss in a proper manner what is necessary to be done in order to provide this country with an efficient transport system at a reasonable cost.  That is what we require both for goods and passengers in the future&mdash;a transport system at not too great expense to the community.  This is a purely agricultural country.  The big end of our industries are situated around the coast.  As has already been pointed out, under the transport system that we have the average load is carried a distance of about 30 miles which, generally speaking, is a very short distance. In view of all that it will take the combined wisdom of Deputies in all parts of the House to plan and devise for the future the transport system which the country needs if it is to make progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the debate I do not intend to give the Minister any advice except to say that <Col N="467" /> I agree that it is absolutely essential, at whatever cost, to keep the railways in action.  They are the main arteries of our transport system and so they must be preserved.  If an emergency were to arise we would find ourselves in a very difficult position indeed if we had not the railways for the transport of our goods and other commodities. We also have to remember that Córas Iompair Éireann is a very important industry.  It has a great number of men on its pay-roll, and no matter what grade they may be in they are receiving the recognised trade union wage.  Therefore I say, no matter what the cost may be, and whether we call this nationalisation or not, we must agree that the railways will have to be preserved.  Their preservation is one thing, but having extravagance in expenditure and over-lapping on them is another.  I do not know how far the Minister intends to go so far as the Milne report is concerned. I think he can find quite a lot of useful information in that report, particularly on the running of parallel services.  You have road transport carrying goods and passengers running parallel with the railways which carry agricultural and commercial goods as well as passengers.  I think it would be possible to eliminate a lot of the overlapping there is at present.  It is unfortunate that railways all over the world appear to be having a bad time of it.  People seem to be losing their fondness for travel by rail or indeed for sending goods by rail.  That is true even in the United States where the railways appear to be in a very precarious position.  Everyone, of course, is aware of the speed with which people can be transported by motor vehicles from one end of the country to the other.  No matter what type of transport we provide for passengers by rail, it can never equal the speed with which they can be carried by motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take a town that is furthest west in the constituency I represent. A man in business there intends to visit the city.  If he has to board a train at an early hour in the morning and arrive in the midday or evening in Dublin, he will find he will not be <Col N="468" /> able to carry out any business.  He will lose that day and the next day before he gets back home after finishing his business in the city.  It is only commonsense for that person to use his own motor car, if he has one, or get some other kind of motor transport, because he will reach the city more quickly and be able to do his business in a shorter time.  It is only natural that he will use the faster type of vehicle so as to be able to carry out his business more rapidly.</P>
    <P>Take Deputies who have to travel long distances to come here.  It is essential that they spend most of their time at home and if the railway transport provided for them is not sufficiently fast they must use motor vehicles.  Passenger traffic on the railways sets up a type of problem which the Minister and the new board will find it difficult to solve.  I believe that if city air services were established, covering five or six different centres from the city, the amount of passenger transport on the railways would be cut down very appreciably.  Unless there is some improvement in the transport of passengers, the railways are bound to decline in popularity.  If Córas Iompair Éireann expect to be able to pay their way in relation to passenger transport and continue to adopt the present method of procedure then they are on the wrong line of thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that all heavy traffic will be transferred to the railway.  Take local fairs as an example.  The transport company at the moment are permitting a most foolish procedure.  They may have 50, 60 or 100 wagons at a railway station in accordance with the order of the local stationmaster.  At the same time, you will see six or seven or ten giant Matador lorries, capable of pulling heavy trailers.  These vehicles will carry live stock.  Some people prefer to have their animals carried by road transport.  The argument is put up that the animals reach their destination quicker.  There are dealers who want to send their live stock to the shippers or to other markets and they find it preferable to transport them by road.  The overhead charges may be heavy, but there is less handling of <Col N="469" /> animals and not so much of a delay and it is calculated in some cases that it is a better paying proposition.  If the Minister could so arrange that perishable or semi-perishable articles will reach their destination faster, he will soon put heavy goods back on the railways, but nothing else will.  We are moving rapidly into a speed era.</P>
    <P>Take a country merchant who wants goods delivered speedily.  He gets in touch with a central distributing agency here or whatever industrial concerns import goods from across the Channel.  His idea is to get them to the place where he can sell them as quickly as possible.  Speed and efficient transport have not been given to those people, and in order that these individuals will concentrate again on the railways, the new board of Córas Iompair Éireann will have to evolve some organisation along that line.  We should not look at this matter as though we are going to have a slack period.  Anyone who examines our trade returns will observe that our progress is becoming quite significant. The articles that come from agricultural production, the many things that come from the small farms through the country, must all find their way to a central marketing depot.  They must be transported by rail in some way or another.  Then let us turn to the quantity of goods that come in for the farmers, particularly artificial manures. We find as a result of our examination that in the years to come the railways will have more goods to carry than in the years gone by.  If we take such things into consideration and if we have perfect co-operation and no financial over-lapping, the outlook need not be as desolate as some of us seem to think.</P>
    <P>So far as heavy transport on the roads is concerned, that must cease; otherwise let the Government take over the maintenance of the roads, because the people could not afford much longer to pay for their upkeep.  Our roads were never designed for such heavy traffic as they experience to-day.  Many of our roads are built on soft and swampy foundations.  The roadmakers of long ago laid down some roads in a <Col N="470" /> peculiar way.  Many of them were twisted and some of them were formed out of old beaten tracks from times long gone by.  They never had proper foundations, and they were never constructed to bear the heavy traffic of the present day.  If a 20-ton Córas Iompair Éireann lorry driver took his vehicle on any road which has not a sound foundation there is no doubt he will injure that road considerably and cracks will be easily visible.</P>
    <P>We shall have to keep the heavy vehicles off the roads.  Send those heavy goods to the railways or else let the Government take the responsibility of road maintenance off the backs of the ratepayers.  A certain amount is provided out of central funds, but that is only because the local ratepayers put up so much.  If the expenditure is in excess of a certain figure the Government will come to their assistance. So far as long-distance haulage by road is concerned, the sooner it is abolished the better.  If we are to have haulage of a local nature the recommendation in the Milne Report is that we should keep competition out as long as we can if we mean to save the railways.  In doing that the private hauliers should not be ignored, because they have their uses.  The haulier in most cases is the man who owns the lorry and he can operate it at a slightly cheaper rate than Córas Iompair Éireann, who have to pay trade union rates to their drivers.  If the lorry of the private haulier breaks down he can take it to the nearest garage.  Córas Iompair Éireann must take their lorries for repair to a central depot.  A Córas Iompair Éireann lorry may have to travel 15, 20 or 30 miles, as the case may be, to the central depot for repair.  Naturally that costs money. The local haulier has the advantage that he does not have to take his lorry such a distance.  He can give the benefit of that to the people for whom he works, because he can afford to carry their goods cheaper than Córas Iompair Éireann.  I agree with the suggestion that local hauliers, particularly where they carry agricultural goods, should be allowed to carry such goods within certain defined limits to the nearest rail head.  In <Col N="471" /> that way, one would do away with private haulage running parallel with the railways.  In that way, too, there would not be competition between Córas Iompair Éireann and private hauliers.</P>
    <P>We have been told that Córas Iompair Éireann at the present time have only 5 per cent. of the lorries on the road.  It must be remembered, however, that they have a monopoly and are protected by law.  There are cases where goods are left untouched because there is no Córas Iompair Éireann lorry available to carry them. Anyone who thinks that, because Córas Iompair Éireann have only 5 per cent. of the lorries on the road, they only do 5 per cent. of the haulage is making a very grave mistake.  If a company has a monopoly, even if it has only 2 per cent. of the lorries, it is protected by law.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that Córas Iompair Éireann may be faced with further competition if the ports along the western seaboard are allowed to operate.  It has been proved beyond doubt that goods can be imported much more cheaply if they are delivered at the nearest local port and transported from there either by rail or by road. If the time comes when it is decided to give the local ports, such as Westport and Ballina, a chance they will operate in competition with Córas Iompair Éireann, because goods imported in that way will be carried a much shorter distance and the railway will thereby suffer some loss of revenue. There is a popular demand for the utilisation of the local ports along the western seaboard and the proposed new company will have to face up to that problem at some date in the future.</P>
    <P>If Córas Iompair Éireann is determined to carry goods in whatever way it thinks best, then steps must be taken to ensure that freight charges will not bear too heavily on the consignees. When the 1944 Act was introduced the uproar created in this House because of the proposed monopoly led to a general election.  But the Dublin United Tramways were taken over and it is now proved beyond doubt that this <Col N="472" /> undertaking, which up to that time had been a profit-earning concern, failed to make Córas Iompair Éireann pay its way.  Now it is proposed that the Grand Canal Company be taken over and that its funds will go to fill the coffers of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I have no objection to the taking over of the Grand Canal Company, but I have serious objection to any proposed increase in the cost of transport particularly where agricultural commodities are concerned.  If the freight on a wagon of cattle taken from a western station is increased it is not the dealer who will pay that increase.  He will take it out of the profits of those from whom he bought the cattle.  The merchant buying artificial manures, or any other commodity essential to increased productivity on the land, will not bear any increased freight charges.  He will not be the loser.  It is the people who ultimately buy the goods retail who will have to pay in the long run.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed new company, I think they should be compelled to consult with the appropriate Minister before any increase is made in freight charges.  An increase in our export trade, such as has taken place within the past year, means that more goods are carried by the railways. Steps should be taken to ensure that the primary producers who have brought about that increase are protected and are treated as fairly as it is possible for a railway company to treat its patrons.  The inclination has been to fleece them over the past few years.</P>
    <P>We who live in the West of Ireland have to travel across the centre of Ireland to reach the capital.  The first complaint we have to make is that public transport provided for us is not fast enough to encourage us to travel by rail.  Secondly, I think it is the essence of stupidity to have a train leaving a certain town at 10 o'clock and a bus leaving the same town at 11 o'clock for Dublin, while there is a bus returning from Dublin reaching the town at 5 o'clock in the evening and a train reaching the same town at half-past three in the afternoon.  I think the new board should make sure that there will not be trains and buses <Col N="473" /> travelling over parallel routes in competition with one another.  They will have more earning power by doing that and they will be of more benefit to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>My chief worry is that the burden of maintaining roads for heavy transport is now becoming unbearable and the sooner the haulage of heavy goods by road is done away with the better. But this can only be done and business brought back to the railways by giving a more efficient and speedy rail type of haulage of heavy goods.  If that is done the people will again become rail-minded.  If it is not done they will continue to be road-minded because of the speed at which goods can be delivered from one centre to another.  This road-mindedness will mean a burden on the ratepayers for the maintenance and upkeep of crooked, narrow roads and the whole burden will be back on the shoulders of the taxpayers and particularly of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Finally, my only advice would be to get away from road transport as soon as possible, and, in doing so, get away from imposing extra burdens on the ratepayers and local authorities who have to maintain such roads and keep them in good condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the last speaker admitted candidly that other countries had difficulties with their transport systems, much the same as this country has.  The Minister, when he introduced this measure, and several speakers on the Government side, conveyed the impression, to me anyway, that it is only here that a transport problem has developed.  They went a little further and tried to put it over on us that this problem arose entirely through the faults and shortcomings of Fianna Fáil and of the manager whom they appointed.  Of course, that is not true.  It is not necessary to say that, because the community here in general know quite well the difficulties that have arisen in transport since long before 1921.  But they came to a head in the period during which Cumann na nGaedheal was the Government&mdash;from 1924 or 1925 on up to 1933.  Most of the older members of the Dáil and quite a <Col N="474" /> number of the younger members will remember the chaotic condition of our roads in those days.  On many of the main roads we had as many as five or six different omnibuses, all functioning, one against the other, and life on those roads became extremely dangerous and the transport system got into a very precarious position. As well as I remember the Great Southern Railway Company had buses running then.  By the time Fianna Fáil introduced their measure, in 1933, I think that both the railway company who owned the buses and all the private bus companies were almost completely bankrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, we had a number of private lorries competing.  It was in those years that some of the biggest difficulties arose but I am not going to say for one moment that modern methods of transport are not attacking the older method and I believe that in almost every other country that is the case.  If we go back to Bianconi's time, I am sure he looked with horror on the train when he saw it.  He must have come to the conclusion, too, that his method of transport would one day or another fade out.  But we are in somewhat a different position now.  I believe that the railway system is vital to the economy of this country.  I also believe that the Minister, unknowingly possibly, is taking a very serious risk. He is appointing a board with a completely independent manager and that board is going to be completely independent of this Government.  That board will be composed of human beings, every one of them versed in cent. per cent. interest on the money, and the usual modern system of business. One bright day he will discover that the railway is only taking second place, and the next day he will discover that it has almost disappeared&mdash; because they will follow the line of transport that is most profitable to them.  It is our business to guard against that.  Nobody will deny that it is possible that that can happen.  In fact, it would be nearly imperative on any manager, or on any independent board appointed to carry on, as far as the £ s.d. portion of it is concerned, to do the most profitable thing for the moment.  They would not be inclined <Col N="475" /> to look on it from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>I believe the railway system will have to carry on and I believe the taxpayer will have to help.  One of the reasons why I think that is bound to be the case is that a number of branch lines were closed down.  I am satisfied that the new board will close down a further number of them.  The branch lines were devised, I suppose in the wisdom of the railway managers, as feeders for the railways.  I take it they were not devised for any other object.  I think, when that is done, you will all agree with me that some of those lines would be unprofitable but that quite a few of them would be profitable&mdash;that there are, possibly, two or three years in which they would not give any profit, followed by three or four years in which they would.  To my mind, no railway system can live without its branch lines or its proper feeders.  If they are cut off, I think it is only a matter of time until the main line is bound to dry up.  What the railway company wants is business. What happened in the years gone by&mdash; in 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930&mdash; when the people got accustomed to the more modern method of bus passenger transport?  The cars came in and the lorries came in.  I must say that the lorries were able to give very personal service.  The railway, because of its older traditions, was bound up in a great deal of red tape, and the delays that arose in despatching and in receiving, and in the transport of cargo, became unsatisfactory to people who had become accustomed to much more rapid and much more personal service.</P>
    <P>I believe that the railways could be revived here to a large extent if the necessary steps were taken to do so and if the Minister, before this measure goes through, can assure us that we shall have some little control over this board.  If he cannot give us that assurance, if we shall not have some little control over the board, the board will do what all human beings do.  They are not going to be successful straight away.  They are going to have bad times, and, as soon as times are bad, the board will economise and they will close down, first, every single one of <Col N="476" /> the branch lines and, after that, a great portion of the main lines.  The last thing I want to say is that I listened to the talk about the bus station here and the contention about it.  I am not so sure that the change of that site for a bus station is essential.  I am afraid that quite a number of people through the country believe that it is to a large extent a political manoeuvre.  I do not know the City of Dublin too well, but I know that if they move the site to Smithfield it is going to improve immensely the business in Prussia Street and bring Capel Street back to what it used to be.  That would be very satisfactory&mdash;to me anyway.  I know from the people of Meath and Westmeath&mdash;I heard the traditions&mdash; that Prussia Street and Capel Street were great centres of business in Dublin and that most of the people from North Leinster made their purchases there.  That just struck me as I heard all this talk going on.  Really, it would not be a bad idea to transfer this surplus population from O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Talbot Street and the other centres.  I am sure that the Government knows perfectly well that it is not the tourists who bring all the money into Dublin; a great number of the people of the country bring their money to Dublin, spend it in Dublin and help to keep Dublin going, and they do not care to walk a lot or get knocked out.  The business people are fairly active too and are going to come as near their customers as they can. The result of this will be to transfer a good deal of Dublin into the Phoenix Park and I will leave Deputies to decide whether that is right or wrong.</P>

      <P>Now that this debate is drawing to a close the Minister has got many angles on the question from different parts of the House and a great deal to put him thinking.  I agree that this is an important debate because the whole future of the transport system is in the balance and something must be done about it by the Minister.  He has a nice mess to clear up and must have a headache over it, but he has no choice in the matter and he must do something.  He has set up <Col N="477" /> a new board.  He took over a bankrupt concern that was not paying, a dead end.  I am not going to say that Fianna Fáil was the cause of the break-up of the transport system in this country, because when I was a young boy &mdash;a good many years ago now&mdash;transport was going down and the railways were becoming obsolete.  The railways were the main cause of their own destruction.  They slept on the question and let the new system on the highroads take over control.  If they had been more alert and kept better faith with those who put money in them the railways would have had a link up with the roads.  They would not have allowed the high speeds we have on the roads and would have taken them over in proper time.  However, they slept on it and are now in the mess they are in.  The question is can we save the railways.  One of the last speakers said that speed was essential.  It is not speed that is essential but the stoppage of speed.  The railways would be hale and hearty if the speed allowed on the roads were curbed.  If the buses which travel at 40 or 50 miles an hour were definitely curbed to 20 miles an hour the railways would have a better chance of competing.  There is no need for speed.  We have men going in cars on the roads at 90 miles an hour, flying, but the man who holds the balance at 35 miles an hour get in in time and can start in time.  We should curb enormously the speed that is allowed on the highroads.  If we do not the roads will be a death-dealing machine, nothing more, and will not be safe for anybody.  During the last few years we have had an enormous amount of traffic on the highways, cars of every type, big cars and small cars.  You cannot get room to park cars in the centre of Dublin or even at the chapel gates.  On Sunday there has to be a policeman at the chapel gates and something will have to be done because our roads were not built for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many causes for the failure of the railways and one of the chief causes is the lackadaisical way they were carried on.  I am satisfied that a vast amount of the men on the railways were no more than railway pensioners because you were getting <Col N="478" /> very little return for them.  I am not saying that every man was bad, but I am keen enough to see the enormous gangs of men doing little jobs on the railways.  Then take all the half days and whole days and short hours they worked so that the railways could not exist.  I know that trade unionism has a big say in that, but trade unionism brought too far is a bad thing for the country.  Those men would be far better off working with more vigour and longer hours for better pay.  The output per man on the railways was enormously bad and they were nothing more than pensioners.  A huge staff was kept on and I do not believe that half of that staff was needed.  There was no reason why during the last few years tickets could not be sold on the railways in the same way as they are sold on the buses and then half the stationmasters and half the station staffs could be got rid of.  If that were done you would certainly have a better system and it would be getting in line with what is done on the roads. Instead of that you had a stationmaster sitting in an old station all day waiting for the few passengers to come to sell them their tickets.  There was no need for that at all.  Let the tickets be sold on the railways as the trains are going along and you would have better business methods.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of expense was incurred by the railways last year putting up gigantic fences.  Eight months or a year were spent putting them up on old swampy ground where there was a perfectly good fence already.  You had numbers of men putting up these fences for a bankrupt concern and it would be better if half those men were not working for the railways at all. Let the swamps alone.  Then the money ran out and the poor old taxpayer had to come to their aid.</P>
    <P>There would be no need for half the expense if there were a better system and better output per man.  Córas Iompair Éireann came along a few years ago and told us that they were going to regularise transport in an efficient manner but the first thing they did was to kill the railways completely. They had bus services running parallel with the trains and at the same hours so that the train arrived at Enfield, <Col N="479" /> Boyle or Trim right beside the bus which was running alongside it packed out with passengers.  One time I remember a Córas Iompair Éireann lorry came to Trim which had nothing left but one parcel that was worth about 5/- and it had to go from Trim to Kingscourt with that.  Two men in livery or uniform had to go with it. When the farmer needed a Córas Iompair Éireann lorry for his beet or his cattle there were these two gentlemen sitting inside it.  Their trade union did not allow them to take a hand while the poor old slob of a farmer with his labouring man had to pack the load.  It would be better for their own sake if they could lend a hand because the poor devils were standing there famished, but their trade unions did not allow it.  I hope that some system can be devised whereby the men instead of sitting in the lorries will be allowed to do some work and give a bit of help to the people of the country.  We have too many idle men who are not giving a full return.  These things are not popular but these things are facts, and it is time to face up to the fact that we are not getting the output to keep those essential services on the road.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should have more than one transport system, that we have reasonable competition, but we have a fair number of lorries with trade plates and I hope there is a future for them and that they will be able to make the new railway efficient and charge proper fares.  If we allowed one system to monopolise the country, we would be in a bigger mess, as the cost would be colossal, in the absence of reasonable competition.</P>
    <P>Over quite a number of years past, thousands of lorries were allowed to come in and operate without restriction and they are now lying derelict everywhere.  Bowmaker has the yards full of them and the unfortunate fellows who bought them and paid hundreds of pounds for them find now that they cannot pay the instalments and they are in a pitiable mess.  Many of them have taken to emigration, so as to get away from their debts.  That state of affairs should not have been allowed to occur.  The roads were <Col N="480" /> cluttered up with lorries, passing one another, as the owners thought there was a big business in it.  There was, for some years, when turf was important in the national economy, but that ended with the end of the emergency. Someone should have stepped in and realised the amount of transport that was needed and controlled the position. We should have been able to see a few years ahead.  These are headaches now for the present Minister, but if they had been taken at the proper time, there could have been a great saving and transport would not be in the chaos it is in to-day.</P>
    <P>Córas Iompair Éireann made no effort to take the heavy transport off the roads.  In my county, the gypsum lorries which carry 25 to 50 tons are passing my own door two and three days a week.  They are huge lorries and if you are a quarter of a mile away making hay, the land under your feet is trembling with the enormous weight. They cannot tear along at high speed, of course, as they are too heavy; but many of the bridges are cracked and in danger and some are marked with signals that they cannot be used any more.  From Kingscourt to Dublin we have a fine railway system and I cannot see why these vehicles are allowed to carry these heavy loads on the highways. It is not fair to the people generally and it is not fair to those with lighter vehicles to have these huge demons of destruction on the roads.  If the Minister wants to preserve the railways, he must see that this heavy traffic is taken off the roads. I do not see why Córas Iompair Éireann did not start years ago, instead of building a huge fleet of buses, feeding the railways at the stations by means of cross-country buses.  That could have been done at every main station from Dublin to Galway.  At places like Enfield, Mullingar and Hill of Down, there is no reason why the people could not be brought in by bus and, instead of standing on a cold morning waiting for a ticket, they should have been able to buy it on the train and so cut out the stationmasters.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has courage and vision enough to face up to difficulties <Col N="481" /> and I am satisfied that, if left alone, he will evolve a system of transport which will be satisfactory to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the board referred to in the Bill has extraordinary powers and I would ask the Minister to introduce some safeguard, to restrict members of the board from arriving at hasty decisions in regard to closing branch lines or things like that. In my constituency we have two important branch lines and I would not like to see the board &mdash; without any reference to this House or to any responsible organisation &mdash; decide overnight to close down a branch line. There should be some test and the board should be required to publish a statement that they intended to close a branch line down and there should be a period of, say, 12 months given to carry out a proper test as to whether they were justified in closing down that particular line.</P>
      <P>The main point put up against Córas Iompair Éireann was that they acted in a very hasty manner in closing certain branch lines, without giving a fair trial and without satisfying themselves that they were justified.  Instead, they instituted a road haulage system which made it impossible for some branch lines to work out economically and the net result was that the branch line was not considered in its proper perspective.  It was not given the chance to prove that in a fair deal, with fair competition, it could hold its own.  I do not wish to see that happen again and allow any board of directors, without any test, to declare a line uneconomic.  The whole difficulty with Córas Iompair Éireann was that they developed a road transport system in competition with the railway system and in that way proved that they had no initiative and no business capacity.  In the rural districts, this road competition made it impossible for the main railway lines to be a success economically.  The charges were exorbitant.  In rural districts, you had a collection charge, the railway charge and a delivery charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cumulative system of rates made it impossible for traders to avail of the railway system and I hope that under the new arrangement there will be a <Col N="482" /> one-way charge from the distributing centre to the rural districts.  We have sad experience of the doubling haulage system where Córas Iompair Éireann established traffic zones.  Any chairman of a board or any responsible director who knew his business would not have acted in that manner and should not have acted in that manner. They proved that they did not know the first thing about running a railway system.  I agree entirely with Deputy Davin when he says that the outgoing chairman of the railway company never consulted the superintendents in the provincial districts, never asked for their suggestions or advice.  The net result was that the whole system crumbled and became uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I maintain that there are men in the outlying areas, such as Cork, Limerick, Tralee and other districts, who are as capable of railway management as the men in Dublin.  Yet they are never given the proper recognition.  At least they did not get it in the past.  I recommend to the Minister that when this board is being appointed there should be consultation with these people and, if necessary, personnel should be recruited from these outlying areas.  I have discussed railway matters with some of these men and I have come to the conclusion that they are equal to, if not better than, any of the personnel in railway headquarters in Dublin.  Yet, up to the present, they have not been consulted.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of indifference to me who is chairman as long as he knows his work.  The present chairman, as far as I know and as far as I have been informed by railway men, is doing good work and, if he is selected, I believe he will be an asset to the organisation.</P>
    <P>A great deal of criticism has been levelled at the Córas Iompair Éireann system but I think it is true that were it not for this question of road transport <i>versus</i> rail transport the position would have been reversed.  The railways would have recouped themselves and would have been a paying proposition if the chairman and the board had not embarked on extensive road transport.</P>
    <P>The merchants in large provincial towns do all their haulage direct to <Col N="483" /> Dublin.  This is a free country and they are entitled to do what best suits themselves.  However, there should be some restrictions and they should be compelled or induced to give at least portion of their traffic to the railways where the railways are available.  In their own way they have become rivals of the railway system.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I would like to make on a matter which affects us very much.  I put down a question on this matter the other day to the Minister.  It is the question of the private haulier, the small man in the rural district.  I would make a special plea to the Minister that these men should not be wiped off the map.  The new board could bring them in or employ them as feeders to the main railway line.  These men have been indispensable to the farming community. During the emergency they gave great service.  Through no fault of their own, the vast majority of them have not merchandise licences.  They have been filling a very useful rôle in hauling agricultural produce to markets and fairs.  Some recognition should be given to them under the new system.  They should be employed as part of the system or recognised in some other way.  I do not mean to suggest that they should be compensated. They do not want compensation. They simply want the right to ply for hire between the various centres without competing with the railway system.  They are not competing with the railway system.  They are serving a very useful purpose in areas not covered by the railway, such as my own district and from Cahirciveen around the coast to Kenmare and in portion of east Kerry where there are no railways.  These private hauliers serve a very useful purpose. I know that it was always the intention of Córas Iompair Éireann to wipe out these people altogether.  At one time they thought that if the private haulier were wiped off the map the railway would be economic but, as time went on, it has been proved that, apart altogether from the private haulier, the railways were not able to pay their way.  I make that case to prove to the Minister that these men <Col N="484" /> are not competing with the railway system.  On the other hand, lorries employed by merchants&mdash;I admit the merchants have a perfect right to use them&mdash;are much more detrimental to the railways and are taking traffic from the railway to a much greater degree than the private haulier in rural isolated districts.  I make that special plea to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We know that there are many difficulties in a transport system that it is not easy to adjust.  The Minister has done the obvious thing, that is, to nationalise, to a measure at any rate, the transport of the country.  He has made the first effective move to save the railway system and, as time goes on, he will probably have to introduce further legislation to cover some of the points that Deputies are now making in regard to private hauliers and other people and particular types of transport. I for one appreciate what the Minister is doing, as I think the whole country, and particularly the people I represent, appreciate it.  I hope he will bear in mind the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that the debate on this Bill has ranged over every possible, and indeed impossible, aspect of this transport problem. Deputies have spent a lot of time telling me that this Bill is not going to provide a complete and final solution of the whole of the transport problem of this country.  There is no necessity to tell me that.  May I remind Deputies that I told them that myself when introducing the Bill?  Deputies on all sides of the House in their speeches covering every aspect of the transport situation have themselves shown quite clearly what a very difficult and very complex problem this is and have demonstrated far more clearly in their speeches than I could how absolutely essential it is that every step to be taken should be fully examined and whatever expert or skilled advice is available to us should be sought.  However, I want to thank the House, with a couple of exceptions, for the constructive and helpful way in which the discussion on the Bill was approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, of course, <Col N="485" /> given the lead by Deputy Lemass, tried to make it clear that there was nothing wrong with Córas Iompair Éireann, if I had left it alone and every speech made from the opposite side was made for the purpose of trying to show to the House and to the people outside that the mess which is undoubtedly there was created, not by Fianna Fáil, not by my predecessor, but by me and this Government.  Deputy Lemass went so far as to say that, if I had allowed the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann to increase his charges when he came to me immediately after I became Minister, everything would have been right with the system, that there would have been no necessity for this Bill and that they would have weathered the storm.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of what happened in 1947.  In April, 1947, an Order was made by my predecessor authorising an increase of 20 per cent. in maximum rail passenger fares. That was estimated to give an increased yield of £110,000.  In the same month, a Ministerial Order was made authorising an increase of 20 per cent. in the statutory maximum rail freight rates.  The company increased their rail freight charges on 21st April and the increase was estimated to yield £809,000.  In the same month, there were rates increases on road freight estimated to bring in another £100,000.  There were increases in 1947 sanctioned by my predecessor and estimated by the chairman and directors of Córas Iompair Éireann to yield an additional £1,000,000.  Notwithstanding that, they lost almost £1,000,000 over the same period.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann knew, in 1947, that he was going to lose on the 1947 working, notwithstanding the increases I have mentioned, a sum in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000.  If he knew that early in 1947, he also knew and was able to tell me the first time he saw me that the estimated loss on 1948 would be at least £1,250,000.  Actually, the loss was £1,400,000.  The chairman and board of directors of Córas Iompair Éireann knew, in 1947, that the increases granted to them in April of that year were not going to come within <Col N="486" /> £1,000,000 of meeting their losses, but &mdash;and this is a rather remarkable fact &mdash;they did not seek any further authority to make further increases until&mdash;when?</P>

      <P>No&mdash;20th February, 1948, or two days after this Government came into office.  I want to know &mdash;and I am glad that Deputy Lemass is coming into the House&mdash;was any application made to him before 18th February, 1948, by the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann to authorise further increases in rail freight charges, bus fares or train fares, and, if not, why not.  Did the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann or the chairman go to Deputy Lemass before February 18th, 1948, and tell him that, in their opinion, the only solution of their problem, the only hope of saving them from bankruptcy, was to increase fares and freights, to cut back on maintenance and to close further branch lines?  Did the then chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann go to Deputy Lemass, as the then Minister, and, if not, why not, because, as I say, the application was made to me on the 20th February, 1948?</P>
      <P>So much for the people who were going to save this great concern from bankruptcy by getting authority to increase still further the fares increased in April, 1947, to an extent estimated to bring in an additional £1,000,000.  Notwithstanding that they got that authority to make these increases, they lost £1,000,000 that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made from the Fianna Fáil Benches is that I was responsible for making this concern bankrupt.  It was bankrupt before the change of Government, and nothing could have saved it, and the Deputy knows that.  The Deputy's whole concern here now is to show that, if there had not been a change of Government, this organisation could have survived.  It could not, and I will prove that even to the Deputy, as well as to the House and, I hope, to the country.  The Deputy&mdash; and I am glad to note that he was entirely alone in this&mdash;saw fit to speak in the most disparaging way, in the most contemptuous and sneering way, of <Col N="487" /> Sir James Milne and his colleagues.  I am very glad, as I say, that in this House the Deputy was entirely alone in that.  He took the line that there was no necessity for any examination into the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

The Deputy quoted from Sir James Milne and the Deputy taunted me that I had not given fuller quotations.  I am going to give him some more.  Let me start at the beginning.  Deputy Lemass told us that the kernel of the trouble was the railways, that everybody knew that if we could solve the railway problem, then we would have solved our transport problem, that if we could bring about a situation on the railways when the revenue would meet the costs everything in the garden would be lovely.  The Deputy said, and it was repeated by many of his colleagues, that Córas Iompair Éireann never got a chance.  I am in entire agreement with the Deputy on that.  It never did <Col N="488" /> get a chance.  I am going to tell the House some of the reasons why it never got a chance and some of the reasons why it could not operate as a railway organisation successfully, why it was made impossible for it to operate successfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asserted, and nobody challenged him, that the kernel of our trouble was the railways. Will anybody challenge the assertion that in a railway system in this or any other country, the key man is the chief mechanical engineer?  Is the House aware of the fact that Córas Iompair Éireann has not had a chief mechanical engineer since November, 1944?  In other words, Córas Iompair Éireann never had a chief mechanical engineer.  I want to know why?  Was he ever sought?  Did they look for him?  Did they deliberately refrain from filling that post? Remember this immense outlay, these immense sums that were contemplated for capital expenditure. Deputy Cowan rolled them around his tongue yesterday evening&mdash; £12,000,000 for railway locomotives and rolling stock alone.  Did the Deputy know, does he now know, or does Deputy Lemass know by whom that scheme was prepared?  Who was the skilled adviser?  Where was the expert sought for?  Is the House aware that not only was there no chief mechanical engineer in charge of that railway system but that the engineering staff that was available to them in their own employment, some excellent professional men, were not consulted about it?  Is the House aware that in connection with these projects, running into millions of pounds, for the provision of elaborate buildings, that not only was there no chief mechanical engineer there but for 12 months, owing to illness, there was no chief civil engineer or no deputy chief civil engineer and that the engineers who <Col N="489" /> were available were not consulted in respect of these projects?</P>
      <P>Sir James Milne!  Here is an extract from Sir James Milne's Report, paragraph 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The position of chief mechanical engineer has been vacant since November, 1944, and the work of the department is not being, and cannot be, carried on efficiently under existing conditions.  The chief engineer has been absent through illness for over 12 months, there is no deputy chief engineer and the present acting-chief engineer has only been deputising for a short time.  The department should not be left without a chief or acting-chief for such long periods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is another quotation from Sir James Milne, sub-paragraph (58):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A number of plans showing alterations to the permanent way, goods sheds, etc., have been prepared without consultation with the chief engineer and without prior discussion with the local traffic officers or the district engineer.  This is very unsatisfactory.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that although I know it is hurtful to some Deputies to have to listen to it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Schemes for new works have been prepared and are being carried out by outside engineers and architects without consultation with the chief engineer who is likely to be responsible for future maintenance of the works.  The duties of the chief engineer should include general collaboration in the preparation and carrying out of all schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall come to some other parts of the report later and we shall find out something about the experts.  Remember that Deputy Lemass cannot shake the responsibility off his shoulders. They were dealing with millions of pounds which were guaranteed by the taxpayers of this State, apart from the money they have belonging to the stockholders.  It was decided to buy six huge Diesel locomotives and five Diesel locomotives for shunting.  Who <Col N="490" /> was the technical engineer that advised the purchase of those?  Who was consulted about them?  Was there any expert outside or inside this country, other than the people who were selling them, consulted about it? Whose was the decision that they were to be purchased?  Who decided that they were suitable for the country?  In passing, may I say that at the time it was decided to go ahead with the purchase of these Diesels, the decision was made because at the same time they were considering erecting a super-marshalling yard at Clondalkin.  The super-marshalling yard was abandoned but the purchase of the Diesels went on.  These Diesels, of course, could only be operated, in so far as they could be operated at all, in and around Dublin, because there is no accommodation, no equipment to deal with repairs to them anywhere outside Dublin.  Fortunately, we are not going to have the five super Diesels at £80,000 each, which originally were to cost £52,000.  We are not going to have these, but we have the five shunters, the smaller ones, and they are so economic that so far never more than three of them have been operating at the same time, because never fewer than two of them have been in the repair shops at the same time.</P>
    <P>Who advised on Store Street?  Who advised on the Broadstone&mdash;£927,000? Who was the expert consulted there? I can tell you that no technical man, no professional man in the employment of Córas Iompair Éireann was consulted. There are no written records there to show that they were consulted. Outside architects and engineers were consulted.  From the point of view of the taxpayer Córas Iompair Éireann may be a bankrupt concern, but for the three or four years prior to the change of Government it was a gold mine in the real sense of the word for certain architects and engineers in this country.  I have the figures here of the fees and expenses paid to architects and engineers over a period beginning in the early part of 1945 and these were not in connection with the supply of wagons or the provision of more carriages and locomotives.  I am sorry to say that this is not a complete <Col N="491" /> picture because there are balances to be paid to many of these gentlemen yet.  The total paid in fees and expenses to these professional men who were engaged amounts to date&mdash;unfortunately, as I say, there is a lot to be added to it before they are finally paid for that work&mdash;to £149,039 17s. 11d.</P>

      <P>I shall give you a little more information.  I may say in connection with the famous Glengarriff proposal, where the foundation will never be dug or the Minister will not have the pleasure even of digging the first sod, that so far we have paid to architects and quantity surveyors £18,360.  I am not quite sure whether the balance still to be paid to these gentlemen is £6,000 or £9,000, but it is either one or the other.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about Store Street.  Deputies should keep in the back of their minds that I have been accused by Deputies opposite, including Deputy Childers, of being grossly unfair, of having made a grossly unfair attack on the former chairman of the company.  I did not. I am, however, going to pin the blame on the shoulders where it should be properly pinned. For Store Street, the amount for the architect alone was £21,393 11s.</P>

I am entitled to give the facts when the Deputy for an hour and 40 minutes lectured me and the Government and tried to give a completely distorted account of the position.  It is easy to understand the interruptions. As I said, the amount for the architect for the Store Street premises was £21,393 11s.; for the consulting civil engineer, £14,637 5s. 4d.; for the quantity surveyor, £6,714 17s. 6d.; for the heating and ventilating engineer, £4,542 14s.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to suggest this, that that demonstrates in itself that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann was not fit to remain the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It demonstrates also that the Deputy was not doing his job as Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the person who was supposed to be the custodian of the millions of money for which the people of this country were held as guarantors. The Deputy talks about architects and that Córas Iompair Éireann never got a chance.  It certainly did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the suggestion that the fees were too high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I have a lot more things to say and I am not going to be diverted by the Deputy. May I again ask the Deputy, who were the transport experts who advised the work at the Broadstone, the cost of which was estimated at £927,000?  If one is to be guided by other reliable estimates which were given, one can assume that that figure would be at least £1,500,000 by the time that work was finished.  Were there any transport experts consulted about that? Who decided on what was to be planned there?  Who decided what was required there?  I assert that there were no reports asked for or got from the engineers in the employment of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I know this, that Sir James Milne &mdash; the Deputy if he wishes can sneer at the Englishman and is entitled to his sneer &mdash;sent an acknowledged transport expert to the Broadstone.  He told him what the Broadstone was required for by Córas Iompair Éireann, and he <Col N="495" /> asked him to give him an estimate of what it would cost to provide at the Broadstone the accommodation which Córas Iompair Éireann said they required.  The expert sent there specially for that purpose came back and reported to Sir James Milne&mdash;it is included in the report &mdash; that the accommodation could be provided there at a cost not exceeding £100,000 &mdash;not £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers gets up and chides me for daring to suggest that there was any extravagance, any mismanagement or any misdirection.  Does the Deputy know&mdash;he does, of course&mdash;that this company in their wisdom decided to spend approximately £1,000,000 in Glengarriff on the erection of an hotel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They not only decided that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided not to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You see the Deputy is too much of a smart Alec.  They decided that, with or without the Deputy's knowledge or permission.  In any case, they decided to go to this extent, that they dropped it.  Why did they drop it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When they found out what it was going to cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case it is going to cost us £35,000, and before that they went down and bought Roche's Hotel and levelled it to the ground.  Is there any man in this House, including Deputy Lemass, who if he were going to build an hotel in Glengarriff himself, would first of all buy a hotel that was there, pay £10,400 for it, and level it to the ground before he had made any effort whatever to ascertain what he was going to have to pay to put a new one in its place?  But they went further with it.  They invited tenders for it and the lowest tender they got for the bare shell was £507,000.  I want to suggest to this House that a responsible person in charge of that company who could conceive that sort of plan <Col N="496" /> was out of touch with realities.  Either that, or he had been told by the Minister that the money did not matter. Let us conceive a £1,000,000 hotel in Glengarriff, a six-storey luxury hotel. It would need to make the whole year round a net profit of £1,000 a week to pay the interest on £1,000,000.  Is it any wonder&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That they decided against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They only decided against it in the middle of 1947 when they found that, notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy, as Minister, gave them permission to increase their charges so as to bring in an additional £1,000,000, they were going to lose another £1,000,000.  The Deputy is not going to get away with it.  This company was bankrupt at the time of the change of Government.  No one knows that better than Deputy Lemass.  No one knows better than Deputy Lemass that permission to increase their fares on the 20th February, 1948, would not have saved them.  No one knows better than Deputy Lemass that that company could not afford to go on with these hare-brained, mad, extravagant schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as the Broadstone, such as Glengarriff and such as Store Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the chassis factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the chassis factory. I am delighted the Deputy has reminded me of it.  Will you tell me who was the expert who advised that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you saying that I was strongly in favour of it?  I was, and I promised them every encouragement and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference between Deputy Lemass and most other people.  Deputy Lemass is quite convinced that he knows everything about everything, and he wants nobody's advice.  The trouble with me is that I am one of the few people in <Col N="497" /> this House or probably in the country, who do not believe that they know everything about everything.  I am one of the few people in the House who know quite well that I am not infallible, and I am always anxious to seek for and look for advice.</P>
      <P>On that, let me say that if Deputy Lemass had relied more on expert opinion, on the opinion of people experienced in transport matters in 1944 before he brought in his Bill, this Bill might not be before the House at all to-day, and that the transport of this country would not be in the state of chaos that it is.  Of course, there was no expert.  I am not condemning the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann because he had not railway experience; I am not condemning the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann because he had not railway experience. I would not think it would be essential for them, but what I am condemning the chairman and the company for is this, that, not having it themselves, they refused to look for it or seek it, or take much advantage of it when it was at their disposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig, an ex-Minister, and a colleague of Deputy Lemass, let the cat out of the bag the other night when he said that Córas Iompair Éireann in their general policy acted on directions from the Government. Are we to take it that it was on the direction of Deputy Lemass that the chassis shop was started?  Are we to take it that it was on the direction of Deputy Lemass, and on his authority that they agreed to the terms laid down by Leylands?  Does the Deputy want me to go into that agreement and to tell him that he agreed to something in that agreement that he did not agree to in relation to other firms?  The Deputy knows that it was a one-sided agreement, entirely in Leyland's favour.  The agreement is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know, because the people are going to lose thousands, on whose authority or advice were five Diesel electrics purchased at a cost of £80,000 each.  Was there any technical advice? Was there any expert, any skilled engineer, any locomotive or mechanical engineer, native or foreign, consulted <Col N="498" /> and, if so, who was he?  I am entitled to suggest this, that they were bought entirely out of the head of the chairman, perhaps assisted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to give the facts; I want to give a clear picture here.  I want to put all this thing behind me once and for all.  I hope I will never have to refer to it again.  I refrained from going into this matter in my introductory speech.  I had no intention, although perhaps I was unfair to the House in that decision, of going into it in detail in my reply to this debate.  But I am not going to allow the Deputy and his colleagues to put it across the House, or attempt to put it across the country, that they left us with a sound concern. There was never such an organisation in the history of any country.  There was a board in charge of the biggest undertaking in this country, employing approximately 22,000 people, and the members of that board were never sent an agenda for any meeting; those members never had an agenda placed before them on the table at a board meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not finished. There was a deputy chairman on that board, but there could not be a meeting in the absence of the chairman. What the function of the deputy chairman was on a board that could not hold a meeting in the absence of the chairman, I do not know.  He said, incidentally, that all those capital undertakings had the full approval of the entire board and that they would be prepared to give an answer at an early date.  I am waiting yet to hear them answer for it.  Not only did the members of the board not get an agenda but, in relation to these capital projects, running into hundreds of thousands of pounds&mdash;some of them into millions of pounds&mdash;not one of them was put before the members in a properly detailed written submission.</P>

      <P>Do Deputies get the mentality here?  Here are a board and a chairman dealing with approximately £18,000,000 of capital and with the livelihood of 22,000 people and they are supposed to be considering a project involving the expenditure of £1,000,000 in Store Street.  Deputy Lemass makes a cheap comment when I say that that was never put before them in writing&mdash;&ldquo;as they do it in England.&rdquo;  Is there any group of men in this country in any business who would take from their chief executive officer a proposal to spend on a capital project an immense sum without having setting out in writing why it was going to be done, what it would achieve, what it would cost, what it would earn?  What I want the House to grasp is this, that those immense sums, running into millions of pounds, were passed by the chairman and the board on a mere verbal say-so across the table in the board room.</P>
      <P>I do not want unduly to delay the House.  I have all the facts and figures here and they cannot be controverted. I have nothing further to say in that matter.  I have plenty of material if I desired to use it.  I could produce a dozen further examples if the House wanted them, but I do not want to weary Deputies.  I will say this, that, having regard to those ill-considered plans, having regard to the almost total disregard for money, having regard to the fact that there was no proper check of the amounts, having regard to the fact that there was no chief mechanical engineer since before Córas Iompair Éireann was set up and that there was no effort ever made to get one, having regard to the fact that the company was without not merely a chief mechanical engineer but for over 12 months was without a chief civil engineer, having regard to the fact that they were not consulted about any of those projects and having regard to the fact that they were prepared to spend unnecessary millions, is it any wonder that they reached the stage when they were unable to provide enough to pay the interest on the debentures and that they reached the stage when they had not as much left in the till as would pay the wages of their employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> I have given the House some picture &mdash;not the complete one&mdash;of the situation that was there and the position which this Government had to face. In the light of that, does the House, or any responsible member of it, think that we could do otherwise than seek the assistance of the best railway men and road men who were available to us?  My only regret, for the sake of the transport concern and for the sake of the stockholders and the taxpayers who are guaranteeing the debentures, is that those experts were not got five years earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is so clever and so smart that he could take the entire transport system and put it into one measure.  I can quite conceive, as he demonstrated so admirably in 1944, that he would bring that in here and tell the House: &ldquo;This is the complete solution of all our transport difficulties.&rdquo;  The Deputy should make up his mind.  Part of his time he spends denouncing me for engaging English experts to uncover the mess and to open up the way to clearing it. May I venture to suggest to the Deputy that he would have the very same sneer if they were American, or Spanish, or French, or Belgian, or Swiss experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you would be satisfied as long as they were foreign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that for the five years during which he was responsible for this undertaking he had no chief mechanical engineer, native or foreign.  May I remind the Deputy neither he, nor his chairman, nor his general manager consulted with or sought the advice of the Irish engineers who were in their employment. The Deputy will not get away with that kind of cheap jibe &mdash; that he is the only person who is concerned as to whether the experts are English or Irish.  I was put here to <Col N="501" /> do a job.  I was put here to do that job to the best of my ability and to ensure that it was done in the best way in which I could have it done.  I conceived it to be my duty to do with that company what I would have done with it if it were my own personal property.  I conceived it to be my duty to do with it what Deputy Lemass would do to-morrow morning if he were dealing with his own personal property. If Deputy Lemass were dealing with his own personal property and he knew that he could get in Britain a better expert than he could get here, or anywhere else, he would go to Britain for that expert.</P>
      <P>I must confess that it sounds well to get a cheap jibe across the floor of the House&mdash;the cheap jibe that I got English experts&mdash;when one remembers that neither the Deputy nor his appointees ever got either English or Irish experts and, in so far as they had Irish experts available in the country, refused to consult them or take their advice.  I do not want to pursue that matter any further.  I want to get to the Bill.  I want to make perfectly clear what I said at the outset: this Bill does not purport to do more than to take the first essential step that must be taken now to carry us some way along the road towards bringing our national transport system out of the chaos in which we find it to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the other parts of Sir James Milne's Report are concerned &mdash; and this ought to appeal to the Deputy who has such little faith in foreign experts&mdash;I want to have Sir James Milne's Report, and everybody else's, checked by the new board and by the responsible technical officers at their disposal.  I want it checked in the light of many things. I want it checked in the light of the fact that, in my opinion, this country cannot do without a railway system and must have a railway system.  I want it checked and examined in the light of the fact that I will not take a hasty decision in relation to road transport which might cause hardship and injustice to people earning their livelihood through such transport.  I believe in having the problems examined first and then taking action.  What has landed us in the mess in which we find <Col N="502" /> ourselves to-night is the fact that in the past they acted first and did not even proceed to examination after the event.</P>
    <P>I would have no faith in the board if they had not at their disposal men of outstanding ability on the mechanical and civil engineering side occupying the chief technical positions both in road and rail transport.  I do not believe for a moment that I would find a perfect solution to our national transport problem, or to any other aspect of our national economy, by establishing a board constituted entirely of experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any experts on the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question. In any case, whatever board is there, experts will be available to them.  There will be experts at the head of the various branches of transport in order to ensure that no further money will be wasted or squandered. I got a lecture about engines and rolling stock.  I do not want to go too deeply into that, but I do want to say that this board has improved the services throughout the country very considerably within the past 12 months. They have improved the railway services, apart altogether from the road services.  The only limit to the improvements effected&mdash;and this is a definite limit&mdash;was the fact that we had not enough carriages to put more trains at the disposal of the public. When one remembers the millions that were to be spent on Glengarriff and Store Street and all the other places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They did not and they will not.  That is the position. Deputies on both sides of the House have been trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.  Every Deputy, including Deputy Lemass and Deputy Derrig, has stated that we want an efficient and economic transport system and that we must have it.  Deputies quoted sections of the Bill to me.  I notice none of them quoted Section 14.  That section imposes a statutory obligation on the new board to provide an efficient and economical system.</P>

      <P>I want to show the inconsistency of Deputies.  We all want an efficient and economic system. None of us wants a drain on the taxpayer, a subsidy.  We all want a situation where, if Córas Iompair Éireann does not make a profit, it will at least pay its way.  But, in the same breath, Deputies insist that, whether it is losing money or making money, whether it is economic or uneconomic, the branch line must be kept there. That is all right.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made by several Deputies and, let me say, from all sides.  One Deputy on the other side of the House suggested that it was a social service and that the branch lines should be kept open and that there should be no question&mdash;that it should not be adverted to&mdash;as to whether they were economic or not. Deputy Lemass told the House that this Bill was a Bill to close branch lines.  It is not.  Unlike Deputy Lemass, I have never tried to ram either my own views or Bills or sections of Bills down the necks of the members of this House.  I feel, and I would not be fair if I did not say it, that it is unfair to expect the new transport board to provide an efficient and economic transport service if, at the same time, the House insists upon the operation of services that cannot be made economic.  If the House insists on refusing to let them adjust their charges and, at the same time, insists that their competitors must be free not merely to charge what they like but free to work any hours they like and free to pay any wages they like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My view is that if we want an efficient, economic service&mdash;if <Col N="505" /> we want to give Córas Iompair Éireann an even break with other transport undertakings and other transport users &mdash;it is unfair to tie their hands in respect both of charges and of operating branch lines, on which they are bound to and must lose money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would only have patience.  Perhaps I am not developing my reply as rapidly as I should.  I am trying to put the case fairly and evenly.  I am trying to do that because&mdash;sitting here, as I have been for the past four days&mdash;I have been impressed by the fact that Deputies from all sides of the House, and of every Party, from town and country, have, apparently, genuine fears that if the company are given the powers which are in this Bill in relation either to branch lines or to charges the powers will be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not those fears.  However, I recognise that they are there, because the same thing came from all sides of the House.  I am prepared, on the Committee Stage, to go a certain distance to meet Deputies and to remove those fears.  However, I want to make this clear.  I am not prepared to go to the extent of bringing about a position that this national transport undertaking is going to be the plaything of politics in the future, and certainly I am not prepared to go so far, as many Deputies asked me to go, that, in all its operations, including, as one Deputy said, &ldquo;its day-to-day operations&rdquo;, it should be amenable to this House.  It would be utterly impossible for any national undertaking, no matter how brilliantly staffed or led, to be a success if it was going to be amenable in its every-day actions to this House and that every Deputy in this House, either now or in the future, would be free at any time to <Col N="506" /> question any detail of its administration; to raise it on the Adjournment; to attack certain individual people.  I am not going to go that distance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is made, on two legs, for the maintenance of branch lines, whether they are economic or not.  Sometimes the two legs become one.  The first is that it may be in the national interest.  I can see that.  It may be in the national interest and it may be a very sound insurance for the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

      <P>From the point of view of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from defence, or any other point you like&mdash;even though, as a commercial proposition, it does not pay.  I am prepared to meet that. However, I would suggest to the House that Deputies ought to consider whether the appropriate Department of State, on whose advice a particular line is retained at a loss&mdash;because it is considered in the national interest&mdash;so that we can see exactly where we are, should not provide in its own Estimate the subsidy necessary to make up the difference between the loss and the earnings.  Further, if the railways, on the second leg, are so valuable&mdash;if the branch lines are so valuable to the people in the particular localities&mdash;the people concerned might consider whether their local authorities would be prepared to subscribe to make up the difference of the loss.  I am satisfied, not merely from what I have been told in the House here but from representations which have been made to me by railway users outside, that there are definite fears that there might be an abuse if the board got an entirely free hand in relation to charges and to the closing of branch lines.  So <Col N="507" /> far as I know, let me say this in passing, there is no intention at the moment on the part of the board or the present chairman to close branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait, do not be so impatient.  Deputy Lemass told us that it was a Bill to close branch lines.  Do not forget that Deputy Derrig told us &mdash;and Deputy Lemass agreed&mdash;that the Fianna Fáil Government directed the policy of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I wonder what would have happened the branch lines if the change of Government had not come about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait.  The Deputy knows I am going to read.  He does not want to hear and he does not want the members of this House to hear. You see here is what the Deputy's appointee, the former chairman, said in his letter to me on 13th March:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company has 861 miles of branch lines&mdash;all single track.  With few exceptions these lines never made a profit and, with the development of road transport, are all now losing and must continue to lose heavily unless excessive rates and fares are charged for the small volume of traffic offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintenance of these lines has been in arrears for years and, with numerous speed restrictions on every one of them, they have, by a process of patching, been kept in a state of repair consistent only with the minimum requirements of safety.  To put them in order would need an expenditure of £3,250,000 spread over five years.  It would be in the nature of capital expenditure as normal maintenance would continue to be necessary <Col N="508" /> and under no circumstances could it be justified.</P>
    <P>These lines are unnecessary in the railway system and the areas which they serve can adequately be catered for by omnibus and lorry.  The closing of them should not in any way place the districts in question at a disadvantage.  Objections will, undoubtedly, be raised by interested parties but they can have no foundation except a mistaken notion of loss of prestige or an unjustifiable fear that loss of the branch railways will be a commercial disadvantage. These branches are an unnecessary burden and should be systematically eliminated as road vehicles become available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ask yourselves what would have been the fate of the branch lines if there had not been a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

There are 20,000 commercial vehicles registered here and that is double the number that was registered in 1939.  Out of 20,000 registered commercial vehicles Córas Iompair Éireann is operating 450.

      <P>But the Deputy closed them.  I would prefer if Deputies would agree with me that the detailed points which have been made should be discussed on the Committee Stage on the particular section to which they apply.  Because I do not think that on a Second Reading like this which ran over four days and when all sorts of points were raised dealing with every aspect of the transport situation from all sides of the House I could adequately deal with them in a reply such as this and I do not think it would be fair to Deputies that I should reply to some points and, I will not say ignore others because I have no desire to ignore them, but forget or overlook points which have been raised by other Deputies.  I am not trying to get away from them but I think it would be more useful if the points were put again on the Committee Stage and debated in their own context and on their own section.  If the House is satisfied I do not propose to delay the House any longer beyond saying that I honestly believe that we are not setting out on the right road towards an attempt at least <Col N="511" /> to provide a solution for our people in the way of a decent public transport system.</P>
      <P>I go further and I say that in a national transport system profit making should not be the first consideration, that what should be the first consideration of the board and what I hope will be the first consideration will be decent services for our community here at home, the best services they can give them.  Naturally, from the point of view of the taxpayer we hope that the system will be operated as economically as will be consistent with efficiency and good service.  Let me say in reply to Deputies who made a special plea on behalf of the backward areas that I hope that this public service, this new national transport service, would endeavour to provide much better and more frequent services for the backward areas than they have enjoyed up to the present.  Even here in the city the city buses have been extended out into new areas and miles beyond their previous termini in order to facilitate the people living out there, although we have not made any additional profit but actually provided those extended services at a loss.  I have that view and in so far as I should have any function in either giving a direction or making suggestions to the new board when it is set up, my suggestion to them would be that their principal duty would be to provide efficient and effective services. They are naturally bound to do their best beyond that, if not at a profit, at least without substantial loss to the taxpayer.  Now that we have cleared the road, so to speak, I believe the House will approach this Bill, on the Committee and subsequent Stages, and discuss it purely as a transport measure and entirely on its merits.  As far as I am concerned, I am going to fight for what I think is essential if the board is to get a chance, and at the same time I am prepared to meet, as far as I possibly can, any legitimate case that is put forward from any side of the House.</P>

When I get a recommendation from a board that will have at its disposal, not merely Sir James Milne's Report but the services of competent professional transport men whose advice they can seek, then&mdash;if I happen to be here&mdash;I will certainly bring the proposals before the House. I prefer that the position should be examined first and, when it is seen clearly, that the proposals should be formulated, rather than that the proposals should be formulated first and the position examined afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill comes before the Dáil after having passed through the Seanad where it was subjected to very careful and detailed consideration and to fairly extensive amendment.  In the result, I am bound to say that, to my mind, the Bill which Deputies are now invited to consider is a better and more comprehensive measure than it was as originally introduced.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as Deputies will have observed for themselves, consists in the main of provisions of a technical character which will provide remedies, shown by experience to be necessary, or at any rate desirable, for defects in the existing law relating to criminal justice and administration.  The primary purpose of the Bill, however, is to provide for an enlargement of the District Court's criminal jurisdiction and it is with this aspect of the measure that I propose mainly to concern myself at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> One of the criticisms most frequently heard of the existing procedure for the administration of criminal justice is that an inordinate amount of time has to be spent in taking depositions on the preliminary investigation of indictable offences, even in cases in which the accused person would be quite willing, if the state of the law permitted, to have the charges against him disposed of summarily.  Sometimes also a person charged with an indictable offence is prepared at all material times to plead guilty, but, notwithstanding this, the depositions must be taken in full before the accused is returned for trial.  The existing law, it is true, provides for a summary trial of a limited range of indictable offences, provided that the district justice is satisfied on the facts proved that the offence constitutes a minor offence, fit to be tried summarily and that the accused does not object to being so tried.</P>
    <P>The principle of a summary trial for certain classes of indictable offences having been long since established and having worked well in practice, it was perhaps inevitable that the first reform to suggest itself should be an extension of the range of indictable offences that might be tried summarily.  Such a reform would enable cases to be disposed of by the District Court which would otherwise have to be sent for trial before judge and jury after depositions had been taken and might, therefore, be expected to result in an appreciable saving of time, trouble and expense and, of no little importance, in a substantial measure of relief for witnesses and jurors.  From the point of view of accused persons, protracted delays in the disposal of cases would be eliminated and more expeditious trials ensured.</P>
    <P>The Bill, accordingly, proposes to extend the range of indictable offences that may be tried summarily and it does this in two ways.  Firstly, certain specific offences&mdash;perjury, forgery, conversion, for example&mdash;are being added to the list of indictable offences that may be dealt with summarily. Secondly, the property value limits applicable in cases of larceny and malicious damage to property are being increased, the increase in larceny <Col N="518" /> being from £20, as fixed by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, to £50 and, in malicious damage to property, from £5, which was the limit prescribed by the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, to £50. The very considerable fall in the value of money constitutes, of itself, a sufficient warrant for the proposed increases in the property value limits.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that power is being taken in Section 2 of the Bill to enable the Minister for Justice to prescribe further indictable offences as offences that may be tried summarily. It is unlikely, I think, that this power will be frequently availed of.  The First Schedule to the Bill pretty well exhausts the offences that, by common consent, are fit to be tried summarily, subject to the conditions laid down in Section 2, but it is conceivable that practical experience will occasionally show the desirability of adding a particular offence, or class of offences, to the list and, in the absence of a power such as the section proposes to confer, the only way by which this could be done would be by legislation.  The essentials of Parliamentary control are preserved by the requirement that an Order made by the Minister for Justice under the section must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can come into force.</P>
    <P>It is as well, perhaps, that I should stress the fact that the power of the District Court to deal summarily with indictable offences will continue to be subject to two conditions, namely: (a)  that the offence must be in the nature of a minor offence, and (b) that the accused does not object to being tried summarily.  With regard to the minor nature of the offence, Section 2 of the Bill proposes a change in the law which, though largely of a procedural character, is important from the practical point of view.  Under Section 77B of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the justice, before he could decide to deal with the case summarily, had to be satisfied on the facts proved that the offence constituted a minor offence fit to be tried summarily.  On a narrow construction, this provision meant that the justice had to hear the case in full, taking the depositions as it proceeded, before he could form the opinion that the offence was a minor <Col N="519" /> offence with which he might deal summarily. The time spent laboriously taking depositions was almost wholly wasted in such a case.  Section 2 of the Bill alters the law in this respect, and, in future, instead of having to be satisfied as to the minor nature of the offence on the facts proved, the court may so satisfy itself on the facts proved or alleged.  Thus, for example, the court will be able to form the opinion that the offence is a minor offence after the charge has been read, or after hearing the opening statement by the prosecution, and will be able to proceed at once to deal with the case summarily, provided the accused does not object.  The accused's right to object to a summary trial is an unqualified right and preserves for him his right to a trial by jury which the Constitution guarantees, except in the case of minor offences.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in passing to the case, which occurs not infrequently, in which an accused person is, from the outset, prepared to plead guilty. Unless the offence is a minor offence, in which event the justice may dispose of the charge summarily, there is no alternative in such a case, notwithstanding that the accused pleads guilty, to taking the depositions in full. The accused is then returned for trial and may be kept waiting for months before his case can be heard and, although he has pleaded guilty, the depositions have to be copied and the State has to instruct counsel and to ensure that all the necessary witnesses are available, lest the accused should change his mind and at the last moment withdraw his plea of guilty.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill contains provisions which, it is hoped, will help to eliminate the waste of time and money and the delays which the procedure I have just described necessarily involved.  The section, at the same time, contains safeguards that are, I submit, adequate to protect the constitutional and traditional rights of accused persons.  I do not think it necessary at this stage to comment in detail on the section, the provisions of which are self-explanatory.  I would like, however, to direct the attention of <Col N="520" /> Deputies to the fact that the powers of the District Court under the section do not extend to the more serious crimes of murder, treason or piracy or their cognates.  Not even the most zealous reformer would.  I think, propose that the District Court should be given the power to deal summarily with such serious crimes or even to apply the alternative procedure provided for in the section of allowing the accused to sign a plea of guilty and thereupon returning him for trial without taking any depositions.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the section vests a discretion in the District Court either to deal with the case summarily or to send it forward for trial, without depositions or with such depositions as may have been taken up to the time at which the accused signs the plea of guilty.  It is contemplated that the district justice, in exercising this discretion, will, apart from any other relevant considerations, have regard to the adequacy or otherwise of the punishment which he is permitted by law to impose for the offence.  If he thinks that the maximum punishment which he may order would be inadequate, he will doubtless send the accused forward to the Circuit Court which will have the power to impose a heavier sentence. The justice's discretion is not wholly unfettered, however, because he cannot, if the Attorney-General objects, deal with the case summarily.  This seems a desirably proviso, but it is to be noted that while the Attorney-General can object to, he cannot insist upon, a summary trial.</P>
    <P>In view of the increased powers being given to the District Court to deal summarily with a wider range and more serious types of cases, it is necessary to give the court the power to impose correspondingly greater punishment.  Six months imprisonment is the maximum sentence that the District Court may impose at present (unless it imposes consecutive sentences for two or more offences), while the court has no general power to inflict a monetary penalty.  Section 4 of the Bill empowers the District Court to impose a fine of up to £50 or imprisonment up to 12 months or both such fine and imprisonment <Col N="521" /> on conviction for a scheduled indictable offence or for an indictable offence dealt with under Section 3.</P>
    <P>As will have been gathered from what I have already said, one of the primary objects which we hope to achieve by Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill is to reduce the amount of time that district justices have to spend on the preliminary investigation of indictable offences.  It is proposed, on the one hand, to extend as far as possible the range of cases that may be disposed of summarily and so eliminate depositions and, on the other hand, to enable cases to be sent forward for trial at the earliest possible stage once the accused is prepared to plead guilty, thereby again eliminating depositions in whole or in part.  There may be some who think that the proposals in the Bill are not radical enough and that we should have gone even further. There have been propounded, for example, such suggestions as the returning of a person for trial on the establishment merely of a <i>prima facie</i> case against him and notwithstanding that all the depositions have not been taken or, where there was a multiplicity of charges, returning the accused for trial on one or two of the charges and preferring the remainder on indictment although depositions had not been taken in regard to them.  Such suggestions were carefully considered in all their aspects before it was decided to reject them.  They would involve a more or less radical departure from the existing procedure for the preliminary investigation and trial of indictable offences and would not, it was felt, on the whole, be in the best interests of the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this part of the Bill, there is just one other point I would like to emphasise.  We are not proposing in these provisions to confer any wholly new or novel jurisdiction on the District Court.  All that we are doing is to extend a jurisdiction that the court has had and has operated very successfully ever since its inception. That is not to minimise in any way the importance of what is proposed or the useful and beneficial consequences that we hope and expect will ensue.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that the proposals have been welcomed by <Col N="522" /> the general body of justices and I think that the Legislature can entrust the increased jurisdiction and powers which the Bill provides for to the District Court in the confident knowledge that they will be administered and exercised no less successfully than have been the more restricted jurisdiction and powers in the past.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a technical character and I do not propose to dwell on them at this stage except to say a word or two on the subject of Section 18 which provides for the clearing of the court in certain cases and for the prohibition or restriction of the reports of certain criminal proceedings.  My main reason, indeed, for referring at all to this section is that, in its original form, it was the subject of considerable comment and criticism.  There was a certain amount of confusion as to the purport of the provision and there was even a suggestion that it could lead to the establishment of secret courts.  I need hardly assure the House that no such intention was ever present to the minds of the Government.  The section, as it now stands, is restricted in its application to two classes of criminal proceedings, namely, (a) the preliminary investigation of indictable offences, and (b) criminal proceedings in relation to offences of an indecent or obscene nature.  There is, in fact, nothing very novel in the provisions of the section and provisions on very similar lines are to be found in various earlier statutes. Whether any of these earlier provisions survived the express provision of Article 34.1 of the 1937 Constitution that justice should be administered in public courts is, at least, open to very serious doubt.</P>
    <P>Article 34.1 was amended in 1941 so as to provide that, in such special and limited cases as might be prescribed by law, justice might be administered otherwise than in public courts.  This amendment, I am advised, could not, and did not in fact, operate to revive any provisions which might have been impliedly repealed by the original Article.  The provisions of Section 18 are, therefore, necessary to implement Article 34.1 as amended and to remove all doubts as to the powers of the courts in this important matter. <Col N="523" /> I think that there will be general agreement that in the two classes of cases with which the section deals it is not merely desirable but necessary that the courts should have the powers which the section proposes to confer on them.</P>

      <P>So far as this Bill goes, I think it represents an improvement on the existing system.  I am disappointed, I must say, that the Minister has not dealt in this Bill with a matter for which I thought a Bill should have been ready by now&mdash;a Bill to extend the powers of the District Court in civil matters as well.  I think that that Bill should be ready by now but perhaps the Minister may be in a position to deal with it shortly.  When I was in his place, I was constantly being asked when such a Bill would be introduced and, as I say, I thought it should be ready by now.  However this Bill does represent an improvement in so far as the taking of depositions in criminal cases are concerned.  It will obviate a waste of time in the District Court in that way.  It was time to put an end to that.  I think that is one of the reasons why we have to have so many district justices in Dublin.  No matter how many we appointed, we seemed to want more.  Even since the change of Government the Minister has been forced to increase the number. We were hoping we had reached the limit.  If this is going to help in that direction, it will be very desirable.  It may disappoint some legal people who may not have quite so much to do.  At the same time, the taking of depositions caused a great waste of time, especially in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will.  This is the first Bill that has gone through that new procedure in the Seanad.  Although the Seanad is supposed to be a more leisurely body than ours, it does not seem to have given a lot of attention to the improvement of this Bill.  There is no necessity to go into the Bill in much detail because in Committee we can deal with a lot of these matters.  I should like, however, to refer to some of the sections.  As to Section 2, I consider that the accused should be definitely reminded that he has the right to be tried by a jury, because he may not know that.  It is a matter which the Minister might consider making definite and specific in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so.  I quite agree that the District Court should have the right to impose sentences up to 12 months and a fine up to £50. That seems, however, to be extended to minor offences.  Whether that is not too much for what are called minor offences is a matter of opinion.  I imagine that a six months' limit would be adequate for the type of cases which are tried summarily.  As to Section 8, I think it is going a little too far to accept the evidence of a person who has died or become insane since making a deposition.  The great point is to have a chance of cross-examining a witness and if the person who made the deposition is dead there is no opportunity for that.  If he is insane, he might have been insane when making the deposition.  I think that matter wants looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the point is that Dr. McGrath, the State Pathologist, is often called upon to give evidence which is purely technical. This would allow that evidence to be accepted if the accused agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the section, the deponent must have died, <Col N="525" /> become insane, or be too ill to attend. I think it is something which the Minister should look into.  I am surprised that the Seanad let it slip through.  In any event, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to it and we may be able to help him to improve the section.  I expect that he is open to receive suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Section 11, I think it is nearly time for the State to consider accepting liability for malicious damage.  During the time of the last Government we made a move in that direction in the case of Gardaí who lost their lives.  Formerly the compensation was levied on the local authority.  I think it will be generally agreed that, as the State is responsible for the preservation of order and not the local authority, the duty ought to be on the State to provide the compensation.</P>
      <P>In regard to Section 18, I think the Seanad could have helped more than it did, if it did anything at all, in the wording of that section.  In sub-section (1) (b) of Section 18 we want to know what is meant by &ldquo;disclosure of information&rdquo;. If I meet a person when a case is being heard and I talk to him about it, am I committing an offence? I think it would be much better to confine the offence to publication of the information.  It would be more likely to be successful.  There is not much likelihood of an ordinary conversation in which something might be disclosed prejudicing the case of an accused person. I agree, however, that publication is another matter.  I think the Minister should look into that point. Then as to the persons who are to be allowed to remain in court during the hearing of indecent cases, if it is a case involving a young person I think the parents should be admitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that they should.  If both parties in the case are young people, the parents of both should be admitted.  To confine it to one female nominated by the person alleged to have been assaulted is I <Col N="526" /> think too narrow.  Other Deputies may have other views, but in a case like that where young people are affected the parents ought to have the right to be there.  In these cases, I think that the publication of the unsavoury part of the evidence should be prohibited. Whether publication of the whole of the evidence should be prohibited is another matter.  I do not think that the court at present has any power to prohibit the Press from publishing any portion of it.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that we should take any steps in the matter, but I am sure I am in order in suggesting that the Press ought to bear it in mind and not be magnifying trivial things.  As to Section 21, speaking from experience, I think the Minister will be a very sorry man if this section about the remission of forfeitures and <Col N="527" /> disqualifications is retained.  I was always very glad that I had no power to remit any of the consequential disqualifications. Take, for instance, the driving of a car, a Minister's life would not be worth living if he were to take the power that is set out in the Bill.  I think the Minister would be a foolish man to take it.  I do not think the Minister should take power to remit that part of the punishment. If he does decide to remit portion of the court sentence in the case of a person convicted of driving a car while under the influence of drink, the disqualification part of the sentence should remain I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not give me that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government may remit, in whole or in part, any forfeiture or disqualification imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction and restore or revive, in whole or in part, the subject of the forfeiture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is as plain as it could be.  I am telling the Minister that I think it would be foolish for him to take that power for himself.  I hope that I will not be a Minister for Justice again if he does take that power.  I had enough trouble myself when I was a Minister, but I was always able to say that I had no power.  I had people coming to me and trying to put pressure on me, and one would need to be a strong man to stand up to that.  I think that the disqualification from driving a car for the period prescribed should be insisted on, and that the law should be allowed to remain as it is.</P>
      <P>Another thing that I think is wrong is the provision in sub-section (3) which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government may delegate to a Minister of State any power conferred by this section and may revoke any such delegation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice is the only person to whom that power should be delegated.  In my time if, for <Col N="528" /> instance, prosecutions were instituted under the Traffic Act they were taken in the name of the Minister for Local Government; if they were tillage prosecutions they were taken in the name of the Minister for Agriculture and in his name if they were fishery prosecutions, and if they were concerned with industry and commerce they were taken in the name of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not think it is the Minister in whose name a prosecution is taken that ought to have the power to remit or to revoke.  I think that the Minister for Justice is more likely to take a detached view, and that he only ought to have this power.  He will naturally consult the Minister whose Department is concerned.  He will also communicate with the Gardaí and the judge or the justice, and as I say will take a more detached view of the whole position.  I think the Minister should not agree that anyone would have that power but the Minister for Justice.  I do not think it is desirable to set out in the sub-section that &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo; should have it.</P>

      <P>When I was in the Department of Justice&mdash;on this I am expressing my own personal view&mdash;there was one thing that we often discussed when considering the amendment of the law.  I refer to the solemn form of oath that is taken in the courts.  Some people say that a good deal of perjury is committed in the courts.  They say that it is widespread.  I do not know, but if I was in the Department when the Bill was being prepared I would have had that matter examined.  I think that instead of the solemn form of oath it would be better to provide for the making of a statutory declaration which would have attached to it <Col N="529" /> the same penalties as are provided in the case of perjury.  At present there is the solemn form of oath.  The Almighty is invoked as a witness that what a person says is true.  If, instead of telling the truth, a person tells lies, that amounts to blasphemy, I think it would be better if we were to put into our criminal code a statutory declaration with the same penalties as those which are provided for perjury.  In that case, if a person gives false evidence it would not be, I would say, as serious a thing as to commit perjury. That is my own personal view on this matter.  I will have to consult our Party on it.  I can say this, that it is a view that was shared by some of the principal officials when I was in the Department, some of whom, I am sorry to say, are now dead.  Of course, if I were in the Department it is a matter that I would have to go to the Government about if I were considering putting it into a Bill.  If an oath is taken lightly it is really a very serious matter.  On the whole, I think the Bill is going to be an improvement. Could the Minister tell us what progress has been made on the civil side as regards the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court?</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Boland, I feel inclined to welcome this Bill. The tendency in it is to improve the present situation in the District Court. I hope I am in order in saying to the Minister that I have a deep-seated objection to this type of legislation being initiated where it was.  I think it is only duplicating, in the main, the work that has to be done.  If this Bill is evidence of the efficiency of the Seanad, I take it that an initial effort of this House would be a far better criterion on which to build our future criminal law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

I think on that I am entitled, without <Col N="530" /> criticising the other House as such, to criticise this method of the initiation of legislation which I think should, primarily, be kept within this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No implications, so far as the other House is concerned were meant.  What I feel is that the Minister is the custodian of a certain State Department, in this case the Department of Justice, and he should advert seriously to his responsibility and keep within the orbit of this House the initiation of legislation of this kind. There was a good deal of merit in many of the objections made by Deputy Boland to this Bill.  I am quiet honest in saying that his approach to the Bill was very fair and candid.  Like Deputy Boland, I felt that when the Minister was tackling the problem of the District Courts at all, he would have tackled it in a comprehensive way and would have dealt with both sides of the court's activities.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if this is a first step in the direction of increasing the general jurisdiction of the District Court.  I do not suppose this is the stage to go into details on the sections, but in my opinion there are some blatant defects in the Bill which I would urge the Minister to deal with himself by introducing amendments in Committee rather than leave it to individual members of the House to do so.  I refer to what would appear to me to be obvious Government amendments which should come from the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with one point that was made by Deputy Boland.  Perhaps I may epitomise his objection in this way, that I would make it mandatory on a district justice, when dealing with a prisoner who may elect to be tried summarily by him, that in the same way as the Gardaí are obliged to caution a person before he makes a statement, he would caution a prisoner when he elects to be tried before him that he would tell him that he is doing so voluntarily and that he has, at all times, the right to elect to be tried by <Col N="531" /> jury.  I think that should be done by way of caution uttered by the district justice so as to ensure that, by no method of misconception or inadvertence, would a person not legally represented abrogate his legal rights unwittingly.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the cutting down of the cumbersome machinery of deposition taking.  There may be some merit in Deputy Boland's suggestion that some lawyers might regret the system, but our experience has been that, on the basis of fees, you usually get an all-in fee for a criminal case and the number of days the depositions take are usually only a straining of time.  I do not think the new proposal will be anything but welcome from the point of view of the legal profession, and particularly the Bar, when one considers the time taken with depositions and the prospect that the various days and half-days that we have to put up with in the District Court will be, in future, prohibited.  This proposal, in my opinion, will make for more cohesion from the point of view of the prosecution and more incisive effort on the part of the defence.  It will tend to help the accused person, because the case will be dealt with in a more expeditious manner and it will do away with the present prolonged and tortuous system of taking depositions.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking a most dangerous course in Section 8.  I think he should reconsider carefully the full implication of that section.  It may be that at the back of the minds of Departmental officials or the mind of the draftsman, there were certain limitations, but this section does not embody these limitations as such and it leaves the position such that an accused person could be considerably prejudiced and placed in a position where he would have no redress.  The effective safeguard, so far as the accused person is concerned, should be introduced in this section and the brake should be introduced to this extent, that the defence should have a summary right of objection to evidence unless it is in the nature of evidence which would be in the interests of the accused.  If the provisions of this <Col N="532" /> section are to apply, there should be an overriding clause to enable it to be used only for the benefit of the accused person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may interject, but the fact is that the general principle there is fundamentally bad.  It gives a power that is introducing something new into the administration of justice in criminal cases.  It is something I do not like and something I would be very slow to accept unless there are very strong qualifications.  We are all aware that there are certain cases tried in the District Court and it is undesirable that they should be published.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should take this opportunity of doing three specific things.  It will be within his power to do them on the Committee Stage.  He should give the district justice the power he suggests of clearing the court in relation to certain offences.  I am satisfied the Minister does intend that the Press in these cases shall have certain rights to be present.  I hope the Minister does not contemplate that these people should be excluded, but he should give the district justice a positive right to exclude certain people.  The only exceptions should be within the orbit of necessary witnesses or possibly the parents of young children.  He should give the district justice the positive power to ask the Press not to publish certain of the unsavoury elements of a case.</P>
      <P>Possibly, the Minister might say that under the Censorship Act it is made an offence, but I have complete sympathy with Deputy Boland to this extent, that no matter what the Censorship Act may do by way of imposing a penalty, if certain matter is published and the damage is done, no subsequent action by anybody under the Censorship Act and no penalty that may be collected under that Act will undo the harm that might be quite unwittingly and unnecessarily done by the publication of unsavoury details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should also give a clear direction as to what is to constitute what one might describe as the <Col N="533" /> publication of the unsavoury kernel of a case.  I would not like that, by any indirect means, any type of control would be exercised on the Press unless in the strict interests of the public. By that I mean that certain unpleasant or obscene features of certain types of indictable offences are better left unpublished and unknown to the general public.  It is unpleasant enough to have these matters arising within the actual legal world or in the Department of Justice, in its capacity as a public prosecutor.  It is unsavoury enough in these circumstances, without having the details developed into some type of public scandal.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that, on the Committee Stage, the Minister will be forced into the position of amending and limiting certain aspects of the Bill. I refer in particular to the very rational objection made by Deputy Boland because, no matter what the Minister's intention may be, Section 21 does give him power to do things that he himself up to the present believed he could not do.  I believe there is an unqualified power given to the Minister, if he wishes to exercise it, to restore driving licences which at present have a statutory disqualification placed upon them. At the moment that disqualification is automatic and there is a statutory limit within which the Minister cannot interfere.  If a licence is suspended that suspension lasts for a period of 12 months.  The district justice has discretion to make the period longer than 12 months if he thinks fit.  Up to the present there was no channel open to a convicted person other than by appeal to the Circuit Court.  No one in an administrative or executive capacity could interfere with that decision once it was given.  I think the Minister must take serious notice of the case made by Deputy Boland in reference to the implementation of the law by a district justice when dealing with people guilty of the offence of driving a motor car while under the influence of drink.  I think the section as it stands would create a very dangerous and unpleasant precedent for the Minister because it would give him power which, as he interjected here this evening, he is not seeking and <Col N="534" /> which he apparently did not realise he had until this evening.</P>
    <P>I sincerely believe that it would be most unwise and injudicious in a situation that is already difficult if power were granted to a Minister of State to interfere with what is at the present time a minimum imposition.  I go even further than that and say that such a proceeding would tend to aggravate an already aggravated situation in relation to that type of driver who takes charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of drink.  At the moment there is a deterrent. It may not be the strongest possible deterrent.  It may not be such a deterrent as most people would like it to be, but it is positive and it is salutary in relation to that type of person who may require a motor car for the purpose of his business, profession or occupation.  That unshakable disqualification is a positive deterrent because he knows that he cannot get round the Minister nor can the Minister get round the disqualification for him.  I urge upon the Minister that he should exclude specifically under Section 1 any right to interfere with convictions in relation to driving a motor car or contravening traffic regulations while under the influence of drink.  As Deputy Boland pointed out, the desired effect might never be obtained because the Minister would find himself drowning in a sea of representations by Deputies to get back licences for this, that and the other person.  To a certain extent the practice that has existed up to this has afforded some protection to Deputies in this respect because there was no way by which one could get round this disqualification.  Certainly I found it a protection myself.  One could give a person an honest answer and assure him that, no matter how anxious one might be to push his case, the Minister had no power, good, bad or indifferent, to interfere.  That had a certain advantage as far as Deputies were concerned. From the Minister's point of view, I think the retention of that practice would remove a headache for him because he could always point to the positive statutory provision under which he had no power to interfere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> On the Bill in general, the legal profession are glad that with the reputation that the District Court has built up for itself, together with the successful administration of the law which has become synonymous with that court, more power is being entrusted to these competent administrators.  It is, too, a step in the right direction because, from the point of view of the accused person, it will make the process of his defence a good deal cheaper.  Under this Bill there are certain types of offences that can now be tried in the District Court but which formerly inevitably involved the accused person in a protracted District Court investigation and a subsequent Circuit Court defence.  There are, however, certain aspects of the Bill to which I would like the Minister and his Department to readdress their minds.  I do not think the Bill is as watertight as one would wish it to be.  In its present form I do not think that it will achieve some of the objects it seeks to achieve.  In future legislation dealing with the jurisdiction of the District Court, I think the Minister can leave the initiation of such legislation to this House which is ultimately primarily answerable to the country on the question of what the statute law will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and Deputy Boland that this Bill is necessary.  There are, however, a number of sections on which I would like to suggest amendments.  First of all, let me say that this new power contained in Section 3 in relation to the taking of depositions is a very wise one.  It is probably ten years since I and some of my professional friends were invited to discuss this matter with one of the Circuit Court judges.  We were agreed at that time that, in order to speed up the procedure in the District Court in the interests of the accused person, some provision such as this should be introduced.  I take it that that particular section, together with the other sections, has been receiving the consideration of the Department of Justice over the years. As far as we were concerned at the <Col N="536" /> time, we were the people who were actually practising in the courts.  We were of opinion at that time that some provision such as that would be useful and very wise.  I am glad to see that, after that lapse of years, when I had almost forgotten the suggestion, it has come forward.</P>
      <P>This Bill is going to increase the jurisdiction of district justices.  It is going to increase the work of district justices.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice is not here at the moment but I know that the Minister for Defence, who is here, will convey this view to him&mdash;that if the work and the jurisdiction of district justices is to be increased it is only reasonable and fair that the remuneration to be paid to them should be increased also.</P>

      <P>However, there is a further point.  Right through the whole country, these district justices will be operating this increased jurisdiction. Many of them, quite a number of them, have 25 years of experience and there is too much of a difference between the remuneration or salary paid to the Dublin justices and that paid to those very experienced justices right through the country.  I think that the Minister might get an indication from the House as a whole, and from every side of the House, that if he were to examine this matter and if he were to make an increase in salary for the district justices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The increased jurisdiction and the increased work that will be thrown on the justices is incidental to the operation of the Bill. I think all of us are agreed that the District Court has been a tremendous success.  I think all the Ministers for Justice in the past and in the present are to be complimented on the splendid selection that they made for the bench of these courts.  The District Court has been a tremendous success. It is because it has been such a great success and because I am satisfied that the increased powers that are to be given to district justices in this Bill will not be abused that I am in favour of giving those additional powers to a court to which every citizen in the country can look with absolute confidence that the justices will do their work efficiently, well, honestly and impartially.</P>
      <P>There is one feature in it&mdash;it does give this additional punitive power to justices to increase sentences from six months to 12 months.  I am satisfied that that power would not be abused but I think that some investigation should be made into this question of imprisonment as a punishment for offences.  I think that imprisonment, in quite a number of cases, is an antiquated form of punishment, that it is unnecessary and that it does no good. Certainly, in so far as quite a number of young people are concerned, it has been my experience that a sentence of imprisonment early in life has led to a life of crime.  I think that has been the experience, probably, of our circuit judges who, from a wider sphere, are not anxious, if they can avoid it, to impose a sentence of imprisonment at all.  However, that is a wider and a broader matter and I only mention it incidentally so that it may be considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section which the Minister mentioned, namely, the sub-section of Section 2, which gives the Minister for Justice the power by Order to declare that any specified indictable offence shall be a scheduled offence.  I think it is unwise to insert <Col N="538" /> a provision like that in a Bill.  After all, offences, whether they are minor offences or serious offences, are contained in the different statutes.  This Bill, which is a Bill to amend criminal law and administration, declares that certain offences will be minor offences which may be dealt with by the District Court.  The Seanad has gone through this Bill and we are going through it now.  The Schedule contains a very long list of offences that may be dealt with summarily by the district justice.  I think that any Minister for Justice who comes in here and asks the Dáil to pass an amending Bill, including three, four or five different offences which may be dealt with summarily, will have no great opposition from the Dáil if the proposals he brings forward are reasonable ones.  In the administration of justice I think there are really no Party lines so far as this Dáil is concerned, and I think it is a good thing for the country that that is so.  The Minister may have a view, his advisers in the Department may have a view, but the members of this House might have a different view, and if the Minister came in here and if views were expressed to him on the Second Reading of a Bill by the Dáil he might see that certain powers that his Department, or maybe even district justices, wanted him to obtain should not be granted, whereas, if he may do this in the seclusion of his Ministerial office I think it is bad.  I have always objected to that sort of legislation on principle and I object to it here.  I admit that there is this procedure of having a resolution approving of it in both Houses, but that is not the same thing at all.  It is a different form.  It is a form that ought to be used in connection with administrative orders.  But where we are going to change the power of trial from a higher to a lower court I think it ought to go through the correct form of an amending Bill introduced in both Houses and passed in the ordinary way a Bill is passed into law.</P>

      <P>I object to that.  In the case of an offence which at the moment is an offence that can only be dealt with on indictment in the Circuit Criminal Court, under this Bill the Minister may by Order change it from being an indictable offence to an offence that may be disposed of summarily by the district justice.  That Order may come before this House and be approved of by a majority; it may come before the Seanad and be approved of by a majority, but I say that it would be wiser if it came in here as an amending Bill and have the different readings and let the Dáil have the different opportunities to amend it.  As I understand that type of statutory Order that has to obtain the approval of the House, the House has no right to do anything except approve of it or reject it.  We can approve of it or reject it, whereas if it came in here as an amending Bill we would have the right to amend it, alter it and discuss it in its several stages.  I think for those reasons that that particular power is unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister for Justice a Parliamentary Question with regard to depositions.  In the trial of an accused person in the Circuit Court depositions are available for the judge and for the State counsel who appears on behalf of the Attorney-General prosecuting.  In the ordinary way those depositions are only available to the accused person if he can pay for them, but the Minister for Justice told me that he can through certain machinery obtain free transcripts of the evidence.  I made enquiries in the Circuit Court office and no Circuit Court official had any knowledge of any such procedure.  No person of whom I am aware has been able to obtain in the Dublin Circuit Court copies of those depositions free and that is no fault of the Circuit Court registrar or of any of the staff.  The result of that is that when a solicitor has to or wants to defend an accused person who has no money if he wants to do the job properly he must pay for those depositions out of his own pocket. That has happened pretty frequently, or the unfortunate accused person may have to borrow the money to pay for copies of these depositions. <Col N="540" /> They are nothing more than typescript copies that should be made available. I say to the Minister that this opportunity should be taken of putting beyond all doubt that an accused person will be entitled as a right not only to the indictment&mdash;he gets that as a right&mdash;but to the depositions so that he and whoever is defending him may have an opportunity of preparing a defence and knowing what he has to face.  I know that if the accused person is in Mountjoy Prison and applies for copies of the depositions and is not represented by a solicitor he can obtain copies provided by the Government to enable him to read what is against him, but I understand that he has to give it back.  The solicitor defending an accused person should obtain that as a right or it should be served in the ordinary way on the accused person. The Minister, I know, believes that in the administration of the courts those depositions may be obtained easily and without charge.  Our experience is to the contrary and I think that this Bill should put the matter right.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with any of the sections of this Bill that have been mentioned by the other Deputies.  I intend to submit certain amendments on the Committee Stage.  I understand that certain amendments will be put down by Deputy Boland, probably by other Deputies in the House and perhaps by the Minister himself.  I think this is an opportunity to tidy up quite a number of defects in the criminal law and criminal administration.  Any Deputy who has any suggestion to make to improve the criminal law should put down an amendment for consideration so that when we have finished with the Bill we will have gone a long way towards improving the defects in the criminal law.</P>
    <P>There is one section which has not been adverted to and which I think introduces a very, very serious and objectionable principle, that is Section 17.  Under Section 17 the Circuit Court may transfer the trial of a criminal issue from the place in which it is required by law to be held to another place in the same circuit.  That, I think, is a very objectionable provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be good reason for that.</P>

    <Col N="541" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there may be good reason for that, or at least there may apparently be good reason for that.  It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The trial shall be held at the place to which it is transferred with a jury from the jury district or other area prescribed for trials by the Circuit Court sitting at that place.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An order of the Circuit Court under this section may be made on the application of the Attorney-General or an accused person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first little bit of doubt I have is whether the judge can transfer the trial without an application from the accused person.  I think that on the strict wording of the section he could. It says that the court may transfer the trial of a criminal issue and then it goes further and says that an order of the court may be made on the application of the Attorney-General or the accused person.  It does not say that it may only be made on the application of the Attorney-General or the accused person.  We have quite a number of courts here so it does not affect us so much in Dublin as it might in some other circuits.  When a particular trial was taking place in a particular county the judge might say that this man would not be convicted there and send him down to another county in the circuit.  Once we start that we are starting immediately to tamper with justice.  I cannot say that judges would not be swayed by considerations such as that.  There may be a case where an accused person is tried in a county before a jury of 12 men; that jury may disagree and the judge may think that the jury should have found him guilty. He comes up for trial at the next sitting of the Circuit Court and the judge directs that he be taken to another county.  I had one personal experience of an accused person being tried where the jury on two occasions disagreed and on the third occasion the jury acquitted him.  The judge was of the opinion at every stage that the man was guilty.  He so charged the jury and after the man had been acquitted at the third trial it was discovered that it was not he who committed the offence at all but another person.  That <Col N="542" /> is a case from personal experience and what would have happened if this power existed at that time?  After the first disagreement or the second the judge would have directed that the trial take place in another area and the man would have been convicted although he was an innocent person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  Are we going to open that again and have people who may be charged in County Louth sent for trial to Wexford or Wicklow?  Are we going to have a person charged in Mayo sent to Galway? That is a very serious interference with fundamental rights.  It is a fundamental right that a person should be tried by his own peers and it has always been the custom in the administration of law in this country that a person should be tried by his own neighbours, the people living in his own county, to understand the conditions.</P>
      <P>I am shocked when I consider what may happen, what monkeying and jockeying may go on with regard to accused persons, for the purpose of convicting them.  We have done without that power for 25 years.  Why do we want to introduce it now?  If a Longford man is charged in County Longford, why should the judge send him up to Westmeath or down to Roscommon? I think the Longford man will get a fairer trial and that the proper principles will be applied by a Longford judge and jury.  They may acquit him, but if they do he is entitled to be acquitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it going to affect the witnesses for the accused person?  If he is being tried in Dundalk and has 20 <Col N="543" /> witnesses to produce and is not a very wealthy individual, and if the case is sent down to County Wexford, who is going to pay the travelling expenses of the witnesses for the defence?  Will the State do it?  They may do it, and I think they are bound to do it, but will they do it?  If the trial is going to last a week, are they going to get hotel accommodation for them in Wexford and provide a special bus to take them down and back again?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to consider those implications.  They are small, minor implications in regard to the general principle.  The general principle is that a man should be tried in the county in which he resides or in which he commits the offence and he should be tried by his own neighbours.</P>
    <P>Let us look back over the 25 years' administration of the law.  Is there any great complaint that the juries have not done their duty?  I do not think the present or the previous Minister for Justice will say that juries in the ordinary criminal case have not done their duty.  Some judges may think so, but the jury in a criminal case have as much function&mdash;in fact, more function&mdash;than the judge and when the judge tells them they have not done their duty in the verdict they have brought in, I think the jury would have the same right to tell the judge there and then that he has no right or status to make such an observation, in court or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>We, as individual Deputies, in the case of Bills brought in like this, can only draw the attention of the other members of the House to the dangers that may be inherent in the principle that is contained in Section 17.  It is a dangerous principle, a bad principle, and if it should become law and be enforced by judges, it will lead to quite a lot of trouble while it is on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>With these observations, I reserve my other comments until the next stage of the Bill.  I am glad that the Bill is being introduced, as it gives us an opportunity of improving the administration of the law and if every Deputy who has anything to contribute to this measure on the next stage, will put in the amendments that he <Col N="544" /> thinks ought to be put in, we will provide a very useful improvement in the administration of our criminal law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. John Lynch Mr. John Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I think this Bill, in the main, tends to improve the administration of criminal justice. There are, however, some features which, without amendment, I consider will not go along the same lines as the rest of the Bill.  I would have preferred this in the form of another Courts of Justice Bill, if necessary, and to embrace a much wider scope than it does, particularly to meet the much needed extension of the civil jurisdiction of the District Court.  It might have been brought in the form of a District Courts Bill, but there are some other aspects that, possibly, would not come within the ambit of such a Bill.</P>
      <P>I refer particularly to a long overdue reform&mdash;in the provision of legal aid for poor persons.  Even in its present form, this Bill might easily have made provision for that.  Those who have had recourse to the court, either by way of practice or as a witness, must have seen unfortunate accused persons coming for trial on indictment before the Circuit Court without being legally represented and, as the charges are being read to him&mdash;several charges, possibly, in connection with a single offence&mdash;on being arraigned, that undefended accused person pleading, possibly, guilty to a succession of charges of varying degrees of criminality or arising out of the one offence. In many cases, those different degrees of criminality will provide different degrees of punishment.  While I know the courts always treat such an undefended person with the greatest possible consideration, it could be that if he were defended he might not only plead not guilty to all the charges read to him, but might find himself acquitted of not only the major but many of the minor charges that follow in the wake of a criminal indictment. However, that is a remedy I hope will come in some future Bill.  It is long overdue and it certainly would go towards the better administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general provisions of the Bill, I think it is most desirable that the <Col N="545" /> jurisdiction of the District Court should be stepped up in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of proceedings.</P>
    <P>In many cases at present, as the Minister pointed out, an accused person coming before a District Court finds himself returned for trial, the district justice not having power to deal with him summarily.  It happens very often that the District Court hearing takes place towards the beginning of the summer vacation and there will not be a sitting of the Circuit Court, before which his trial can take place, until many months later, when the new term opens in October.  We have all seen cases where an unfortunate accused person, who is unable to get bail, is in prison during the whole of the summer term.  From that point of view alone, the provisions of this Bill to overcome that situation are most desirable.</P>
    <P>As regards some particular provisions, I am very much inclined to agree with what Deputy Cowan has said about the method of legislating by Order.  That is a form of legislation that should be avoided if at all possible. On the other hand, I realise that, should a certain form of crime become common in a certain district, it would be necessary to eliminate the long routine of District Court depositions and Circuit Court hearing and to amend the law in order to provide for District Court hearings if at all possible. On the other hand, from the point of view of proper criminal legislation, in the case of any indictable crime or any crime capable of being tried summarily, it should be on the Statute Book in the form of a properly enacted Act of Parliament and not in the form of an Order.  I need not go into clause (ii) of sub-section (2) of Section 2 which provides that the accused, may be tried by the court, if he does not object to being so tried, in greater detail than was done by Deputy Boland, but the accused should most certainly be fully informed and it should be so provided in the Bill that he has positive right to trial by jury.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of giving a district justice power to impose a sentence <Col N="546" /> of 12 months, the whole purpose of summary jurisdiction is to provide a method of trying minor offences and it could not be argued that any minor offence deserves a penalty of 12 months or £50 or both.  It is laid down in the Constitution that only minor offences may be tried summarily.  If this Bill is now to earmark certain offences as minor offences, they should be treated as such from the point of view of punishment and, in my opinion, a sentence of six months&mdash;which the District Court already has power to impose&mdash;is ample.  I would not go so far as to say that it would be unconstitutional but I do not think it is right that an offence which we are now prepared to treat as a minor offence should merit punishment so high.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the Bill. Of course, there will be more time on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Coming to Section 8, I certainly agree with all that Deputy Collins and Deputy Boland said in respect of it. It is a very dangerous precedent.  For the first time in our criminal and civil code, we are allowing evidence which is unsifted and which nobody will have had an opportunity of cross-examining. Even in a civil case, for the recovery of £5 either in contract or in tort, no court would admit the type of evidence that it is now being sought to have admitted in a criminal case in this Bill.  Heretofore, what are known as dying statements were admitted only when the person who made the statement could be shown to be in fear of death and to have realised that he might die.  The explanation is simple.  The law expects from a person in such a position a greater realisation of the necessity for truth than from the person who might expect to recover and to get absolution for any offence, from the liturgical point of view.  It is taking the law too far altogether to allow statements from deponents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The accused must consent before these statements are read but it only provides for the case of insanity or illness.  If that is the furthest the Minister can go as regards giving the accused person the right to object, he should also include depositions from persons who had died between the time of the taking of the deposition and the time of the trial. I would ask the Minister to examine it seriously.  I do not believe there is a Deputy who has occasion to practise in the court who would not disagree thoroughly with the provisions of the section in their entirety.  If the Minister does not see his way to amend it as suggested, he will find plenty of amendments submitted by individual Deputies.  The amendment that I would suggest is that the section should be deleted altogether.  It is creating a precedent in the law of evidence that, as I have pointed out, does not apply even in civil cases where the same responsibilities are not imposed on the judge of trial.</P>
      <P>Sections 9 and 10 are desirable and are inserted now in view of defects which have become apparent from the operation of the law.  For the first time, a dog will become a chattel and capable of being stolen, with the result that anyone who gets a dog under false pretences will be liable to be tried before a District Court or a Circuit Court.  Most Deputies have heard of cases where men have tried to pass dud cheques for greyhounds and the poor Gardaí when they tried to follow the matter up, found that they had no remedy from the point of view of the criminal law.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides a desirable innovation inasmuch as it provides a person who has instituted criminal proceedings in the District Court for assault with the opportunity of bringing a civil action.  The lack of power to institute a civil action after having instituted criminal proceedings was a defect which certainly needed remedying and I am glad that it has been done in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 is possibly a very desirable <Col N="548" /> section also.  It provides that a Garda may arrest a person whom he reasonably suspects of having or conveying in any manner any thing stolen or unlawfully obtained.  I have no doubt that it is a section which, properly administered and with the exercise of discretion by the Garda, will provide a very useful instrument in the detection of crime.  It may be that at some stage a Garda may overstep the mark, but I am sure the Minister can confidently leave it to the officers of the Garda, in the knowledge that they will exercise discretion.</P>
    <P>I am not so enamoured of the provision in Section 13 which gives a Garda power to fix recognisances.  I am inclined to think that that is a power which should be reserved to a court of law, be the court that of a peace commissioner or a district justice.  If that power must be given to Gardaí, however, I suggest that an overriding maximum should be placed on the amount of the bail or whatever sureties are imposed.  If the Minister will examine it a little more closely, he will find that it is possible that a Garda, having had a certain amount of trouble with an accused person whom he brings into the barracks, in the heat of the moment, might not be inclined to fix fair recognisances or a fair surety in respect of his release and I suggest that that Garda, on calmer consideration of the particularly obstreperous case, might reduce the amount of the surety fixed.</P>

      <P>It certainly does not; but I am glad that a person whose property has been maliciously damaged can sue and recover compensation where the damage is over £5 and under £50.  This is a very involved code of legislation and I sincerely hope that the saving clause in that section will meet any situation which may arise in the future.  If anything does arise which the Minister had not anticipated, I feel sure that he will take quick steps to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the publication of reports of obscene or indecent cases, Deputy Boland has expressed my own feelings and I do not propose to enlarge upon the point.  I certainly have no desire to limit the power of the Press.  The freedom of the Press is a right which all of us, even though we <Col N="550" /> have nothing whatever to do with newspaper publication, value very highly, but in the case of the general run of papers, and particularly papers in provincial towns and cities, we find that they exercise a great deal of discretion in the matter of the publication of this form of news.  The papers in the capital also exercise that discretion, but I think the Minister is right in giving the District Court or Circuit Court power to exclude certain types of evidence from the published reports.  I suggest, however, that once a case has been completed, the restrictions imposed by Section 18 should be lifted in regard to any matter which may have arisen the publication of which would be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>As to the exclusion of persons other than those interested in the trial, I think the Minister is unduly restricting the type of persons who may be allowed to attend.  In the case of an offence against a female person, who may be one person nominated by the female who has been assaulted or injured may attend the court.  In many of these cases, the person alleged to have committed the assault is a young person and he should be given the right to have his parent or guardian present while the proceedings are going on.  In many cases, the clergyman who has particular knowledge of the character of the accused or of the injured person desires to attend the court and he should also be given permission, if he desires to do so.  Somebody has made the suggestion to me that there are so many <i>bona fide</i> social wefare groups operating at present that the privilege&mdash;if one may call it a privilege&mdash;of attending court at the hearing of such a case should also be extended to some person representing one of these groups, or as many of them as require to attend.  I feel sure that, when this Bill has passed through Committee Stage, the Minister will find that it will be a useful adjunct to the criminal code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the concluding remarks of Deputy Lynch that this is a very necessary measure and one that is going to prove very useful particularly in the court for which it is primarily intended, the District <Col N="551" /> Court.  It would indeed be hard to avoid dealing with the District Court in any measure which deals with criminal law, because the prosecution and investigation of every crime in the Statute Book has really to begin in the District Court in normal times.  Many interesting suggestions were made to the Minister and I am sure, before this debate is concluded, there will be many more.  I should like to make a few comments on the suggestions which have already been made.  I wish to endorse what Deputy Cowan has said on the question of the provision, free of charge, of copies of the depositions to accused persons or their legal advisers. I cannot see any good reason why there should ever have been a charge for copies of depositions, particularly since typewriters were introduced, as a carbon copy could have been run off for the mere cost of the paper on which the copy was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred also to the question of legal aid generally.  I think that most people in the country would favour free legal aid to necessitous persons.  There are many instances that spring to the mind of each one of us where grave injustices were done to people who had to stand their trial at the Central Criminal Court at a cost which broke them, although they were finally acquitted.  There are also a few items in other legislation which I think could be usefully tidied up in this measure.  I give as an instance a case which came to my notice only a short time ago.  It was a case in which a man was prosecuted under the Fishery Act of 1939.  The district justice acquitted him and the Guard who prosecuted in the District Court brought an appeal.  The Fisheries Act of 1939 expressly provides that where the appellant is a prosecuting Guard he is not bound to enter recognisances for the prosecution of the appeal.  I observe that the same provision is in this Bill.  The case came before the Circuit Court judge and the Circuit Court judge disallowed the appeal and confirmed the order of the District Court dismissing the summons.  Then the question of the costs of the appeal arose.  It appears that there is some <Col N="552" /> uncertainty as to the power of the Circuit Court to award costs in a case of that kind.  The safe thing was done; there was no order made as to costs but the innocent citizen who was acquitted of the charge of trying to catch salmon by each of the courts was put to considerable expense.  He had to pay his legal advisers, of course.  I suggest that the Minister should make some little examination of that matter of the awarding of costs in cases of acquittal, even if he does not go the whole way of giving free legal aid.</P>
    <P>While I am on that point there is another interesting matter that arises which the Minister might have examined also.  The practice in this country in capital charges is that if the accused can satisfy the court that he has not sufficient means to defend himself, he is entitled to free legal aid.  There is one charge which up to very recently was a capital charge but it has been taken out of that category.  That is the charge of infanticide.  We have, by passing that statute, pared down the rights of accused persons.  Up to the time that that statute became law, a person charged with infanticide was entitled to free legal aid.  From the date of the coming into force of the Infanticide Act that legal aid was no longer available because infanticide is not now a capital charge.  There is, therefore, a paring down of the rights of an accused person.</P>
    <P>On the question on the right to read the depositions under Section 8, every lawyer who has spoken has protested as vigorously as he could against the provisions of Section 8.  I certainly endorse everything that has been said against it.  The State, as we know, has very effective machinery in a prosecution in criminal cases.  It has a tradition, which lawyers, to give them their due, have very jealously guarded. They have a tradition of having safeguards there for the accused person, who in the legal theory of this State, is innocent until he is found guilty.  I think Deputy Lynch said that if we pass Section 8 as it stands, we shall be making available in criminal trials evidence which would not be accepted on behalf on a plaintiff in trivial simple cases.  The Minister referred Deputy <Col N="553" /> Lynch to sub-section (2) which states that in a case of insanity or illness of a deponent, the deposition shall not be read without the accused's consent unless the court is satisfied that the deponent is unlikely to recover within a reasonable time.  The end of that subsection makes the question of getting the accused's consent completely ineffective.  I think that is one of the risks the State ought to take and preserve the tradition of our legal system that where the prosecution is unable to produce its evidence, for whatever cause, it should be satisfied to give the accused the advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if he is aware (a) of the danger to health created by the present neglect of the sewage disposal works at Tallaght Camp, County Dublin; and (b) that the overflow from these works flows past the windows of a house and through fields causing a serious threat to the lives of human beings and also to dairy herds; and, if so, whether he will have the position investigated immediately with a view to ensuring that this neglect is remedied and that the former system of employing a worker to look after these works is resumed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply the Parliamentary Secretary stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not aware that there is any danger to health arising out of the operation of the sewage disposal works of Tallaght Camp.  I am satisfied that there is no neglect in the working of the installation and I do <Col N="554" /> not propose to alter the present arrangement in that regard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not content with making a negative and, I may say, a meaningless reply to my Supplementary Question, the Parliamentary Secretary proceeded to usurp my rights and privileges as a Deputy by putting questions to me, whereas, of course, his primary function is that of answering questions put to him and providing such information as he may have at his disposal at the request of Deputies.  It may have been thought that that particular tactic utilised in this case would be useful as a device to shroud what has been happening in Tallaght for some considerable time.  It may be that the Parliamentary Secretary feels that his local knowledge of the area is better than mine.  I agree that I am only a Deputy representing the area and cannot claim to spend every night or day there.  But I do say that in this matter there is an injustice being done to the people of the Tallaght district.</P>
    <P>There are in Tallaght a relatively large number of industries employing many workers and these industries have a sewage disposal works for their use and convenience.  Some years ago it was the practice of the Office of Public Works to employ a worker for the purpose of seeing that these sewage disposal works were kept in good order, that the overflow from them did not result in the pollution of the stream passing nearby and that the public health was protected.  Then, with the advent of the economy mind, the services of this worker were dispensed with, with the result that for a very considerable time these sewage disposal works have been grossly neglected and have been a matter of repeated complaint to the Office of Public Works.  At present the position is that the Tymon, a small stream running near these works along by a cottage tenanted by a very hard-working family and flowing through lands on which there are many dairy herds, is polluted.  The condition of this stream is such that it constitutes a serious threat to the health, not alone of the people living in the cottage, but of the people of this city, because much <Col N="555" /> of the milk consumed in this city comes from dairy farmers who use that land for their herds.  It has been a common thing in recent years to find cows which graze beside that river dead from poisoning by the pollution. Yet we have the Parliamentary Secretary stating here that he was not aware that there was any danger arising out of the present condition of this stream.  It is a matter of amazement to me to hear such a view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, because his knowledge of the area should prevent him from making a statement of that kind.</P>
    <P>I want, therefore, to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring to bear on this problem a fresh view instead of the customary Office of Public Works attitude which I heard very fittingly described the other day as that of a body moving with the most perfect precision and doing absolutely nothing. This is a matter concerning my constituents which should not be dealt with lightly by the Parliamentary Secretary and which could be easily remedied.  It is surely far more important that the health of the people of Tallaght and those who live in the cottage of which I have spoken should be protected and that the dairy herds which graze along the side of the stream, which is laden with sewage, should also be protected, than that we should be thinking of saving a few pounds in the year which might well be expended upon the employment of a man and in the taking of any measures necessary to remedy the present situation there.  I, therefore, ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter again and do something to remedy this grievance so that the name of the Office of Public Works will be respected in at least one area in this country and so that at least in Tallaght, in the constituency of County Dublin, we shall not have the usual feeling amongst the people that the Office of Public Works does not care whether the people of this country live or die.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Dunne was rather <Col N="556" /> vexed to-day when I put a question to him.  Probably I was not entitled to do it.  I asked him when the conditions there became bad.  I can assure Deputy Dunne that I was never in Tallaght in my life.  I do not know where it is.  I have here a report to the Board of Works of the conditions there.  I want to point out that the Minister for Finance is responsible for running and maintaining the sewage works for Urney Chocolates, Ltd., in that area&mdash;for that factory alone at the expense of the company.  Up to 1942 the Department employed a man and paid him.  The salary that was paid to him was recouped from the company.  During the years prior to 1942 there were terrible complaints about the way the work was being carried out until finally the company objected and said the work was costing too much and that the job was not being properly done.  The result was that the Department got rid of the man and handed over the job to the company itself which paid for the work that was being done.  Since then there had not been the slightest complaint until this question was put down by Deputy Dunne.  Since 1942 there has not been a word of complaint.  Prior to that, there had been complaints not only from the company that was paying for getting the work done but from the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that we could not help discontinuing this man's employment and letting the company do the work itself.  Since 1942 the company has been doing it very efficiently.  As a matter of fact, on the 31st of October last our architect accompanied by two others, went out there and inspected the place.  They admit that to a certain extent, but away from the portion that we are responsible for, there is an effluent from a privately owned plant in the area, from county council cottages at Culbert's Fort and waste from the factory of Barnes' Ltd. and the Redbreast Preserving Co. for which we are not responsible.  The portion that we are responsible for is kept in perfect order.  In order to satisfy the Deputy's mind&mdash;knowing the interest that he has in this area&mdash; I want to tell him that we have got this information: that it is understood <Col N="557" /> locally at least that the county council are about to embark on a housing scheme there&mdash;I am sure Deputy Dunne knows that too&mdash;which will involve the laying of a main sewer along the road fronting the leased portion of Tallaght camp and that when that <Col N="558" /> sewer has been laid the necessity for any use of a sewage disposal plant will then cease.</P>
